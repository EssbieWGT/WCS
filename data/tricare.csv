I am an AD dependent on tricare prime. I received a referral to a civilian hospital for my pregnancy/delivery.

I recently received a bill from the hospital for inpatient services. I had a normal delivery and didn’t request any services beyond the referral (ie delivered vaginally and didn’t have an elective c section). When I called tricare they said I am responsible for 20% of the charges. I explained I am on prime, am an AD dependent, and went to the hospital they referred me to. According to their website I didn’t think I owed anything (https://tricare.mil/Costs/Compare). Representative said it didn’t matter, I still owe 20% of the bill.

Anyone else have experience with this or know anything about this process?

The findings highlight how untreated sleep disorders contribute to mental health challenges, traumatic injuries, and increased health care utilization in our service members.
Our collaboration with UMSOM underscores the urgent need to enhance access to timely, effective, and evidence-based sleep care throughout the Military Health System.
Military members across all branches, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Space Force, Coast Guard, Public Health Service, were analyzed in the study.","With more than 1 in 10 Americans suffering from obstructive sleep apnea putting them at increased risk of heart problems and other health ills, a new study conducted by the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) carefully analyzed the toll that this sleep disorder takes on U.S. active-duty military members, and their analysis was alarming: They found that soldiers with sleep apnea who are serving on the front lines are more than four times more likely to experience post traumatic stress disorder and three times more likely to suffer a traumatic brain injury compared to those who don’t have the condition.

Highlights of the comprehensive study were recently published in the journal CHEST. Conducted in conjunction with Uniformed Services University, the study marks the largest analysis of sleep apnea’s health effects and its burden on health resources in the U.S. military.

“This study underscores the growing importance of early intervention in sleep apnea and access to high quality, cost-effective sleep care for service members,” said Emerson M. Wickwire, PhD, lead study author and Section Chief of Sleep Medicine of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “By quantifying the health and resource burden of this condition we hope to help guide the development and allocation of clinical resources within the military health system, including advancing provider education and patient screening, triage, and treatment.”

Obstructive sleep apnea is among the most common sleep disorders, causing sleep disruptions that raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke and depression. The condition is characterized as a breathing disorder in which breathing stops and restarts throughout sleep. Common symptoms can include chronic snoring, daytime sleepiness, as well as mood and behavior changes.

Due to the demanding nature of military work schedules and non-traditional hours, only one-third of active-duty service members obtain the minimum recommended seven or more hours of sleep per night, according to previous research. There is also a growing awareness of sleep apnea in the military with diagnoses increasing well over ten-fold between 2005 and 2019, from 11 to 333 cases per 10,000 service members.

To conduct the latest study, Dr. Wickwire and his colleagues utilized de-identified data from the Military Health System data repository to create two matched cohorts of individuals with and without obstructive sleep apnea, comprised of nearly 60,000 service members each, ages 17-64. Service members with newly diagnosed sleep apnea were matched with those without controlling for demographic, clinical and military characteristics. The researchers found that during the 12 months following diagnosis, service members with sleep apnea had an additional 170,511 outpatient visits to doctors compared to their counterparts and also an additional 1,852 emergency department visits per year and 66 hospitalizations.

They also had a higher risk and faster time to specific medical problems including:

On top of that, Congress is considering additional defense funding through the reconciliation bill, likely bringing national security discretionary spending over $1 trillion for the first time ever.

While national defense is a top priority, an increase in funding without reform risks repeating past mistakes at the taxpayers’ expense. Without accountability, even well-intended funding becomes vulnerable to fraud and wasteful spending.

Any defense budget increases should be paired with concrete steps to improve how the Pentagon manages its resources. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a report with 79 priority recommendations for the DoD aimed at eliminating fraud, improving efficiency, and restoring fiscal discipline.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has promised to “clean house” at the Pentagon and has already announced a 20% cut to top general and flag officer positions, along with plans to streamline the force structure and rein in contractor overuse. While these early moves are promising, true reform depends on implementing deeper structural fixes like those recommended by the GAO. Below, we highlight seven practical and impactful reforms from the report that the Pentagon, with guidance from lawmakers, can implement immediately to protect taxpayers and strengthen transparency.

1) Improving Financial Management

The Department of Defense has never passed a full financial audit, and the Pentagon has failed seven in a row. A key reason is poor tracking of its assets like buildings, equipment, and inventory. Outdated IT systems and missing records make it impossible to track where all the money is going.

The GAO recommends investing in better IT systems, verifying assets, and using fraud detection tools. These changes would reduce waste, improve oversight, and finally move the Pentagon toward a clean audit, something every major agency is already expected to do.

2) Reining in F-35 Sustainment Waste

The F-35 fighter jet program will cost an estimated $1.3 trillion over its lifetime, mostly due to heavy reliance on outside contractors. The military doesn’t control key data systems, making it harder and more expensive to maintain the fleet.

The GAO recommends shifting sustainment work back in-house to save costs and increase readiness. Greater control would reduce contractor fees and help taxpayers get more value from one of the Pentagon’s most expensive programs.

3) Fixing Improper TRICARE and Military Health Payments

The DoD provides healthcare to over 9 million individuals through Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and TRICARE. The GAO found that this fragmented care system alongside improper payments leads to potentially millions of taxpayers’ dollars wasted.

By identifying the root causes of billing errors, increasing oversight of clinical quality, and assessing workforce changes, the DoD can eliminate overpayments and simplify a split care system. Veterans, military personnel, and their families deserve better services without spending more.

4) Reducing Contract Waste and Duplication

The Pentagon spends billions on service contracts each year, often without enough oversight. Secretary Hegseth discusses how the Defense Department “has become very much overreliant on management consultants and contractors . . . We found that we likely have more contractors than we have civilian employees.” The GAO flags overreliance on contractors as a high-risk area, citing mismanagement in weapon systems acquisition and contract oversight.

To fix this, the GAO urges better acquisition policies, stronger forecasting, and clearer contract management. Without reform, failures such as 12 of 24 critical IT systems going over budget or the logistics program that went $815 million over budget will continue to exist. Strengthening oversight of operational contracts would help reduce inefficiencies and fix a fragmented management system. These steps would rein in spending and bring greater transparency to a costly category of the defense budget.

5) Addressing “Forever Chemicals” (PFAS) Liability

The DoD faces significant financial exposure to “forever chemicals” contamination. Yet, it still hasn’t assessed the full cost of cleanup, leaving taxpayers vulnerable to unlimited future liabilities.

The GAO urges DoD to calculate its exposure and create a cleanup plan with clear funding limits. Without action, Congress may end up writing blank checks. Planning now would protect public health while containing long-term costs.

6) Improving Cybersecurity and Oversight

The GAO report finds that the current cybersecurity system is incomplete and fragmented, leaving critical networks exposed and driving up costs. GAO found that basic protections are poorly implemented across the Department.

To fix this, GAO recommends stronger cyber hygiene, better planning, and clear oversight of risk decisions. Without urgent improvements, the DoD risks costly breaches and continued waste in programs that handle trillions of dollars.

7) Avoiding Infrastructure Waste

The DoD manages over 700,000 buildings and facilities worldwide worth roughly $2.2 trillion. Yet, its facility management is weak, and infrastructure data is incomplete or unreliable. Hundreds of billions of dollars are earmarked for barracks, housing, and repairs, but, without tracking quality or contracting results, this money is easily wasted or underutilized.

GAO recommends improving data systems, monitoring housing quality, and enforcing contract standards. These steps would ensure that maintenance funds are used effectively and that service members and their families live in safe, well-managed facilities.

Conclusion

GAO’s report outlines a clear blueprint to fix the Pentagon’s most persistent and costly failures. Yet, despite agreeing in principle with many of GAO’s recommendations, the Department of Defense continues to fall short in implementation. Progress has been slow, inconsistent, and in some cases nonexistent—especially in critical areas like cybersecurity, financial tracking, and contractor oversight.

This mixed response makes it clear that simply throwing more money at the Pentagon won’t solve its problems and is an urgent reminder for the need for continued congressional oversight to turn reform plans into impactful outcomes. Defense spending must not be exempt from scrutiny. Implementing just these seven GAO recommendations would help reduce waste, improve transparency, and help the DoD efficiently spend taxpayer dollars. This isn’t about budgeting, it’s about ensuring the DoD engages in responsible governance and uses taxpayers’ money effectively.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2018/05/The-Pentagon-January-2008.jpg?v=20230919100900,N,0.0,2025-06-30 16:56:33.786570

For career fields, where it is deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, performance, and safety, the military services promote physical fitness programs that incorporate occupationally specific physical fitness requirements,” Shell said.
“Physical readiness standards are based on scientific research and establish both health-based criteria and operational physical performance-based criteria for physical fitness.
“It is important that DOD standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or MOS-specific task criteria,” Shell said.
This information gives the DOD the ability to measure and correlate injuries with failure and pass rates for body composition and physical fitness, Shell explained.","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a directive on March 12, 2025, describing the start of a “rapid” cross-force review of changes in physical fitness and body composition standards since Jan. 1, 2015. The secretary followed up on this order on April 24, 2025, signing a memorandum directing a 30-day review of medical conditions that disqualify individuals from joining the military—calling for applicants to “be physically and mentally able to perform their duties under the harshest of conditions without risk to themselves or others,"" Hegseth said in a video posted on Department of Defense social media accounts.

As the DOD reviews these requirements, the focus on service member fitness is emerging at the forefront—and experts in the Military Health System offer advice on potential solutions.

“Each military service has different operational requirements, and it is important to understand those differences,” said Dr. Donald Shell, director of the Disease Prevention, Disease Management, and Population Health Policy and Oversight program in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.

“’Overweight’ does not necessarily equal ‘overfat,’ particularly on the individual level. Two individuals that have the same weight and height may have different types of mass (for example, muscle vs. fat) and exhibit different levels of physical performance and different levels of health risks,” Shell said at a federal health symposium in spring 2025 where he discussed obesity in the military.

“It is important that standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or military occupational specialty (MOS)-specific task criteria,” Shell said.

Fitness Policies are a ‘Frame’ to Build On

“Military service fitness tests, at minimum, address the primary physical fitness components of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and body composition for all military service applications. For career fields, where it is deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, performance, and safety, the military services promote physical fitness programs that incorporate occupationally specific physical fitness requirements,” Shell said.

“Physical readiness standards are based on scientific research and establish both health-based criteria and operational physical performance-based criteria for physical fitness. Physical fitness and body composition testing programs promote readiness by emphasizing necessary physical capabilities, minimizing injuries, and meeting military service-specific operational mission requirements,” he explained.

“It is important that DOD standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or MOS-specific task criteria,” Shell said. “Standards exist to promote physical readiness and motivate healthy fitness behaviors. For instance, higher muscle mass and high performance is preferred over poor nutrition and unhealthy habits.”

Announced on April 25, 2025, the U.S. Army updated its fitness test to strengthen readiness and lethality. Phased implementation of the Army Fitness Test began June 1, 2025, with new scoring standards for active duty soldiers in 21 combat military occupational specialties taking effect on January 1, 2026. The five-event test will be “sex-neutral and age-normed.”

Muscle and Bone Injuries Are Top Reason for Mission Absence

Musculoskeletal injuries, such as sprained knees or torn ligaments, affect military readiness, unit cohesion, rank progression, and other facets required of a deployment-ready force. “There is a consistent association in the literature between obesity and musculoskeletal injuries,” Shell noted. The military has documented that these injuries remain the No. 1 reason service members are held back from missions or suffer permanent disability. For example, active duty soldiers experienced more than 3.6 million musculoskeletal injuries over a 9-year period from 2008 to 2017.

The DOD Instruction 1308.03 on physical fitness and body composition added muscle and bone-related injury monitoring across the military in March 2022. This information gives the DOD the ability to measure and correlate injuries with failure and pass rates for body composition and physical fitness, Shell explained.

Obesity and the Military

Just as in the civilian world, increased muscle and bone-injury rates are tied to the epidemic of obesity, according to Shell. Estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that obesity-related conditions cost the U.S. healthcare system nearly $173 billion a year. For the DOD, the per-year average increase in cost for obesity is estimated at $540 per person, which includes paying for diseases and conditions related to obesity, like heart diseases, high-blood pressure, and diabetes.

Shell said that in the March 2025 issue of “Lancet,” a leading weekly peer-reviewed medical journal, a special commission’s review of global obesity identified diagnostic criteria of clinical obesity in adults, adolescents, and children, which include recurrent or chronic severe knee pain, reduced range of motion, and limitations of mobility. This is not only a challenge for recruitment, but can significantly impact retention, readiness, and one’s ability to be worldwide deployable.

Recognizing that weight can change over time due to age or duty stations, all service branches have programs service members can use to lose weight and improve their fitness through lifestyle changes and diet and exercise. There are also initiatives aimed at helping potential recruits get in shape before they join, such as the U.S. Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course.

Nutrition and Exercise are ‘Foundation’ of Fitness

Physical fitness and optimum body weight composition should be based on a “foundation” of heart healthy exercise and nutrition, according to Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland.

He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum service member fitness and heart health.

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect: Move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Most service members should “really be doing three to four days in the gym [focusing on] large-muscle groups to maintain their strength.” This helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

Aerobic exercise maintains heart health and should include “150 to 300 minutes of moderate activity that makes you breath heavy, but you can still carry on a conversation. If you push to a level of exertion where you can’t talk, or vigorous activity, then the target is half that of moderate,” said Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.”

“The best exercise is what you do and what you enjoy, and what you see results from. You don't have to follow specific routines,” he added. “You have to follow something that you'll habituate to, and you'll do regularly.”

It's important to remember food is fuel for the warfighter, said Franzos. “You have to recognize those times that you're giving to yourself some grace, you're giving yourself … cheesecake … but also recognize that the bulk of the time you've got to really focus on healthy eating to ensure that you stay fit for the fight.”

Losing weight is hard to begin with, Franzos said. “Generally, when we put people on calorie-counting diets and put a lot of other physical effort in, we're seeing no more than 3–5% weight loss. And, oftentimes, that weight loss isn't maintained over time.”

Instead, he suggested staying fit, not fat, in the first place by cooking at home or in the barracks rather than eating out. Eating this way is “going to be better for your physical performance, because you're going to be able to control a lot of the macronutrients that are coming into your body, so that you minimize the bad fats and maximize the good proteins to perform better.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8932457/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-30 16:56:38.055478

The larger, nationwide Takedown involved federal and state law enforcement agencies across the country and represents an unprecedented effort to combat health care fraud schemes that exploit patients and taxpayers.

“Health care fraud costs this country billions of taxpayer dollars every year,” said U.S. Attorney Pirro. “This office fights rigorously, every day to uncover the fraud and abuse that steal precious resources from programs like these. To the thieves who are engaging in these fraud schemes: you think you’ve discovered how to walk away with free money; but we will find you and you will walk away with a new label - ‘convicted felon’.”

“This record-setting Health Care Fraud Takedown delivers justice to criminal actors who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens and steal from hardworking American taxpayers,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Make no mistake – this administration will not tolerate criminals who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars while endangering the health and safety of our communities.”

Demonstrating the significant return on investment that results from health care fraud enforcement efforts, the government seized over $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets as part of the coordinated enforcement efforts. As part of the whole-of-government approach to combating health care fraud announced today, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also announced that it successfully prevented over $4 billion from being paid in response to false and fraudulent claims and that it suspended or revoked the billing privileges of 205 providers in the months leading up to the Takedown. Civil charges against 20 defendants for $14.2 million in alleged fraud, as well as civil settlements with 106 defendants totaling $34.3 million, were also announced as part of the Takedown.

Today’s Takedown was led and coordinated by the Health Care Fraud Unit of the Department of Justice Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and its core partners from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The cases were investigated by agents from HHS-OIG, FBI, DEA, and other federal and state law enforcement agencies. The cases are being prosecuted by Health Care Fraud Strike Force teams from the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, 50 U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide, and 12 State Attorneys General Offices.

""Defrauding the American health care system is not a victimless crime,"" said Assistant Director in Charge Steven J. Jensen of the FBI Washington Field Office. ""It raises health insurance premiums, exposes patients to unnecessary medical procedures, and can lead to identity theft. Every dollar stolen is one fewer that's available to pay for needed care. The FBI will continue our relentless pursuit of those committing health care fraud and hold them accountable for their crimes.""

“The scale of today’s Takedown is unprecedented, and so is the harm we’re confronting. Individuals who attempt to steal from the federal health care system and put vulnerable patients at risk will be held accountable,” said HHS-OIG Acting Inspector General Juliet T. Hodgkins. “Our agents at HHS-OIG work relentlessly to detect, investigate, and dismantle these fraud schemes. We are proud to stand with our law enforcement partners in protecting taxpayer dollars and safeguarding patient care.”

The following individuals were charged in the District of Columbia:

Amstrong Chapajong, of Cheverly, Maryland, is charged with one count of health care fraud in connection with an overlapping billing scheme that allegedly defrauded the District of Columbia’s Medicaid program. As alleged in the information, from March 2020 to January 2022, Chapajong, while working as both a personal care aide and community support worker, fraudulently claimed to provide in-home personal care and behavioral health services to multiple clients in different locations at the same time. Additionally, Chapajong’s Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) data most often showed he was not in the vicinity of his client’s homes, where he purported to be providing services. In total, Medicaid paid $461,369 for Chapajong’s shifts with overlapping hours.

Michelle Shropshire, of Maryland, and Harlisha Jones, of Maryland and Washington, DC, both employed by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) were charged by indictment with health care fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy charges for allegedly using Jones’s insurance policies with American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (AFLAC) to submit fraudulent health care and short-term disability insurance claims for injuries, medical treatments, and disability periods that did not exist. The indictment alleges that as part of the scheme defendants created fraudulent medical paperwork, including medical excuse notes and physician’s statements, and forged doctors’ signatures on those forms. Then, after AFLAC paid each claim to Jones, she paid a kickback to Shropshire using a portion of the claim proceeds. As a result of those fraudulent insurance claims, AFLAC paid Jones approximately $58,750, of which Jones paid approximately 20% back to Shropshire.

Similarly, in addition to Jones, Shropshire is alleged to have assisted a number of other WMATA employees with submitting fraudulent health care and short-term disability insurance claims to AFLAC, which paid at least $362,035 in benefits based upon the false claims. Of those other WMATA employees, the following have been charged by information and have pled guilty to charges involving the scheme and paying kickbacks to Shropshire: Sharon Washington of Virginia, and Selethia Blake, Brady Turner, Lushawn Foreman, and Margot Jackson, all of Maryland.

These cases, in particular, were investigated by the FBI’s Washington Field Office. The Shropshire case was also investigated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Office of Inspector General. U.S. v Chapajong was also investigated by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), the D.C. Office of the Inspector General’s (DC-OIG) Medicaid Fraud Control Unit.

In addition to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, the Health Care Fraud Unit’s National Rapid Response, Florida, Gulf Coast, Los Angeles, Midwest, New England, Northeast, and Texas Strike Forces includes U.S. Attorneys Offices from around the nation; and State Attorney Generals’ Offices for Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania are prosecuting the cases in the National Health Care Fraud Takedown, with assistance from the Health Care Fraud Unit’s Data Analytics Team. Descriptions of each case involved in today’s enforcement action are available on the Department of Justice website.

Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who’s famous for his former hospital company’s record-setting Medicare fraud settlements, is currently leading an effort to make Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” even more painful for America’s poor.

The legislation already cuts $930 billion from Medicaid, the nation’s government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, and would eliminate coverage for millions. Scott’s amendment, expected to get a vote Monday, would take away another $313 billion in state Medicaid funds and force hundreds of thousands of additional people, at least, off the program.

Scott has framed his proposed Medicaid cuts as necessary to preserve the program “for those who truly need it” — and not “able-bodied” adults. “If you don’t want to work, you’re the one who decided you don’t want health care,” he recently said on Fox News. He’s suggested Democrats are using tax dollars to “give illegal aliens Medicaid benefits,” even though undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, claiming that blue states want to “exploit this safety net.”

Ironically enough, some of the claims against Scott’s old hospital company revolved around exploiting Medicaid, and billing for services that patients didn’t need.

Scott’s office did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone’s request for comment Monday.

The senator resigned as CEO of the hospital chain known as HCA Healthcare in 1997 amid an ongoing federal probe and a series of whistleblower complaints. He has long faced attacks from Democrats over the $1.7 billion that HCA paid to resolve fraud allegations in the early 2000s. Some of the allegations involved Medicaid.

In late 2000, as part of the “largest government fraud settlement ever” with the Justice Department, HCA pleaded guilty to criminal conduct and agreed to pay over $840 million in fines, penalties, and damages to resolve claims of unlawful billing practices.

Among the claims HCA settled over: The company was accused of billing “Medicare, Medicaid, the Defense Department’s TRICARE health care program, and the Federal Employees’ Health Benefits Program, for lab tests that were not medically necessary” and “not ordered by physicians.”

HCA was accused of “upcoding,” or pretending patients were sicker than they were in order to increase reimbursements to its hospitals. “The guilty plea includes one count relating to this upcoding practice,” the Justice Department wrote in a press release. The company was also accused of billing Medicaid “for home health visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them or were not performed,” the department said.

The civil and administrative settlement agreement between HCA and the U.S. Justice Department said the company, from 1995 to 1998, submitted claims to Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE, “(a) for visits to patients who did not qualify for home health services because (i) the patients were not homebound, (ii) there was no medical need for such services, or (iii) there was no medical need for skilled services; (b) for visits that were not provided; (c) for visits to deliver services that were in fact or should have been provided by an assisted living facility.”

HCA and the Justice Department entered into an additional settlement agreement in 2003, in which the company agreed to pay another $631 million to resolve false claims it submitted to federal health programs.

In a civil settlement agreement, the Justice Department wrote that health regulators “contend that they have certain administrative claims against HCA under the provisions for permissive exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs.”

Under both agreements, the Justice Department announced that HCA would pay millions of dollars to state Medicaid agencies: $13.6 million in 2000, and then $17.5 million in 2003. The department said the latter figure represented “direct state losses.”

A few decades later, Scott is now trying to extract a huge amount of money from state Medicaid funds to help finance Trump’s latest round of tax cuts for the rich.

Some things never really change.

This brief presents key facts about veterans enrolled in Medicaid and examines how proposed changes could affect their coverage and access to care.
Over the past decade, the number of veterans has declined, but the percent of veterans with Medicaid has increased.
Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten (69%) veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.
In 2023, 11% of veterans in Medicaid expansion states were enrolled in Medicaid, compared to 9% in non-expansion states.","The One Big Beautiful Bill passed by the House is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over the next 10 years, a cut that could lead to 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in Medicaid in 2034. The Senate Finance Committee’s draft reconciliation includes similar provisions. Medicaid currently provides health care coverage to 1 in 10 veterans (1.6 million people), and for some, it is their only source of coverage, especially if they do not qualify for military health benefits such as care provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA health care), or TRICARE, the health insurance program administered by the Department of Defense for eligible active-duty service members, retirees, and their families.

The Department of Veterans Affairs operates a nationwide health care system, but access is not guaranteed. Eligibility for VA health care depends on a veteran’s service history, discharge status, income, and whether a health condition is connected to their military service. As a result, about half of veterans are enrolled in VA health care. TRICARE, meanwhile, is generally limited to active-duty members and military retirees.

Medicaid helps fill gaps in coverage for veterans who are low-income, have disabilities, or are otherwise ineligible for military health benefits. Many veterans use Medicaid alongside Medicare or VA health care, particularly as they age and their health needs increase. Veterans enrolled in Medicaid have complex health conditions, including high rates of disability, mental illness, and substance use disorders. Medicaid ensures regular access to care for these veterans, helping them manage chronic conditions, access a broader range of providers outside the VA system, and pay for services not covered by VA health care, such as different forms of long-term care. It also reduces out-of-pocket costs that can pose a barrier to care. This brief presents key facts about veterans enrolled in Medicaid and examines how proposed changes could affect their coverage and access to care.

1. Over the past decade, the number of veterans has declined, but the percent of veterans with Medicaid has increased.

In 2023, there were approximately 16 million veterans ages 19 and older in the United States. The veteran population is both aging and shrinking: nearly half of all veterans are 65 and older, and the total number has declined by 7 million over the past decade, from 23 million in 2013, as older veterans from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War have passed away, and fewer individuals have entered military service in the recent years.

As the veteran population changes, so too have the pathways to coverage. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) created a new pathway to coverage for veterans who might otherwise have been uninsured by expanding Medicaid eligibility to nearly all adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level ($21,597 for an individual in 2025). Medicaid expansion covers adults who are parents of dependent children whose income is above the eligibility limit for parent coverage and adults who do not have dependent children and who were previously not eligible for Medicaid. Forty-one states, including DC, have adopted Medicaid expansion, and nearly seven in ten (69%) veterans ages 19 and older who have Medicaid coverage live in a state that has expanded Medicaid.

Since the implementation of Medicaid expansion, the share of veterans with Medicaid, either as their sole source of coverage or in combination with other insurances, has increased, and the share of those who are uninsured has dropped. Between 2013 and 2023, Medicaid enrollment among all veterans increased from 8% to 10% (Figure 1), representing 1.6 million veterans in 2023. However, the share of veterans enrolled in Medicaid varies across states, ranging from as low as 6% to as high as 15% (Appendix Table ). In 2023, 11% of veterans in Medicaid expansion states were enrolled in Medicaid, compared to 9% in non-expansion states. Over the 2013-2023 period, the uninsured rate for veterans fell by more than half, dropping to 2% from 6% (Figure 1). Studies link Medicaid expansion to increased coverage, improved access to care, greater healthcare affordability, and better health .

2. Medicaid often supplements coverage for an aging veteran population.

Among those 1.6 million veterans with Medicaid coverage, most had additional forms of insurance. While some rely on Medicaid as their only source of coverage, it more often supplements other types of insurance by covering services that other payers may not, such as long-term care. For veterans who are also enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid can help cover both premiums and cost-sharing responsibilities, reducing out-of-pocket costs for services like doctor visits, hospital stays, and prescription drugs.

Only 17% of veterans with Medicaid were covered by Medicaid alone. The remaining 83% had at least one other source of coverage. The most common combination was Medicaid and Medicare, which accounted for 60% of all veterans with Medicaid (some of whom were also enrolled in VA health care). This high share reflects the aging veteran population; half of all veterans with Medicaid were 65 and older. Many of today’s veterans served during the Vietnam and Gulf Wars. Smaller percentages of veterans were also enrolled in VA health care (17%), or another other form of insurance coverage, such as TRICARE or employer-sponsored insurance (6%).

3. Veterans with Medicaid have higher disability rates than those who are not covered by Medicaid.

Nearly half (49%) of veterans covered by Medicaid, either as their only source of coverage or in combination with other insurance, report having a disability, compared to fewer than three in ten (29%) veterans who are not covered by Medicaid (Figure 3). A person is considered to have a disability if they experience difficulty with hearing, vision, cognitive function, mobility, self-care, or independent living. While disability rates increase with age among all veterans, the difference in the rates between those with Medicaid and those not covered by Medicaid are especially pronounced in their working-age years. Among veterans ages 27 to 49, 33% of those with Medicaid reported a disability, compared to 17% of those with other coverage. The gap is even wider among veterans ages 50 to 64, with 51% of Medicaid enrollees reporting having a disability compared to 20% of those with other coverage. Veterans 65 and older have the highest disability rates of any age group, but even among this group, a higher percentage of veterans with Medicaid have a disability (55%) compared to those without (40%).

4. Medicaid supports regular access to care for veterans who have high rates of chronic conditions.

Veterans covered by Medicaid often have complex health needs. Nearly half (45%) of veterans with Medicaid describe their health as fair or poor, more than twice the share among those not covered by Medicaid (18%) (Figure 4). All veterans have high rates of chronic conditions (82% for those with Medicaid and 79% for those without), but some conditions are more common among veterans with Medicaid. Specifically, behavioral health conditions affect a larger share of veterans with Medicaid, with 46% reporting any form of mental illness and 26% reporting substance use disorder (SUD), compared to 17% and 13%, respectively, among those without Medicaid. Medicaid provides access to care, including mental health and SUD care for veterans. Among veterans covered by Medicaid, 41% received mental health or SUD treatment in the past year, nearly twice the share of those without Medicaid (21%).

5. Nearly seven in ten working-age veterans with Medicaid are working, but work varies by age, disability, and parental status.

Nearly seven in ten (68%) working-age veterans (ages 19 to 64) enrolled in Medicaid are working, excluding those who receive Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Insurance, or are dually enrolled in Medicare (Figure 5). The share of veterans in this age group varies by state (Appendix Table 2). Veterans who are older (ages 50 to 64), have a disability, or do not have dependent children are less likely to be working:

The share of veterans who are working declines with age: 79% of those ages 19 to 26 are working, compared to 59% of those ages 50 to 64.

While 75% of veterans without a disability are working, that share drops to 51% among those with a disability.

Parents are more likely to be in the workforce than veterans without dependent children (78% vs 60%), likely reflecting their relatively younger age and lower rates of disability.

Proposed changes to Medicaid that would impose work and reporting requirements as a condition of eligibility could negatively affect veterans and lead to coverage loss among those who are unable to work or those unable to report or document work or exemption criteria.

As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role as the only hospital delivering healthcare to service members and their families, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors, stationed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.","In the second year of the Defense Health Agency’s Annual Nursing Awards, Cmdr. Crystal Saraceni was honored with the 2025 award for Healthy Work Environment, a recognition reserved for those who define excellence in military nursing.

The award included civilians and nurses from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, distinguishing Saraceni from more than 29,000 nurses within the Military Health System.

Saraceni, a member of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Guantanamo Bay, transformed geographic isolation into innovation, crafting a resilient, mission-ready nursing culture at U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay.

Cmdr. Rebeca Rodriguez, the hospital’s chief nursing officer, nominated Saraceni for the award. “We often focus so hard on ensuring deckplate sailors are recognized for their accomplishments that we forget that leadership is at the deckplate as well,” Rodriguez said. “Seeing the hard work and determination that she puts into everything she does makes me so proud. I wanted everyone to be aware of her passion and incredible work ethic.”

The Healthy Work Environment Award recognizes Saraceni for her impact creating a better workplace environment and inspiring nurses and corpsmen to continuously improve and excel. “Leadership is about establishing trust and building a solid team,” Saraceni said. “I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to participate in this journey.”

As Clinical Nurse Specialist, Director of Clinical Support Services, and Chief Nursing Informatics Officer, Saraceni tackled challenges related to the hospital’s low-patient volume. Recognizing the risk of skill atrophy, she introduced hands-on training to maintain clinical readiness, covering procedures like anticoagulant injections and nasogastric tube care.

Her efforts enhanced clinical competencies and fostered a culture of continuous learning and patient safety. “I was shocked to get news of being selected for this award; it is humbling to receive this recognition,” Saraceni said. “To me, it’s a matter of doing my job. I come to work, do my best and hope that the lessons we learn together establish a groundwork for success in my teammates’ future careers. In my position, a huge part of my responsibility is to train and support our nursing and corps staff.”

Chief Hospital Corpsman LeMichael Wright, senior enlisted leader for Clinical Support Services, was one of several sailors who provided feedback to support Saraceni’s nomination. Wright praised her leadership and commitment to professional development. “Commander Saraceni is a dedicated and exceptional leader who balances mission success with the well-being of her team,” Wright said. “She consistently recognizes her staff's achievements and goes above and beyond to ensure the morale and functionality of her departments, even during critical manpower shortages. Her leadership was crucial during Operation Southern Guard, where she selflessly shifted roles to support the mission, prioritizing the needs of others over her own. Her commitment to her personnel and the mission exemplifies a leadership style that is truly unparalleled.”

Under her leadership, departments earned three of the last four Department of the Quarter awards. She also supported staff morale through activities like the Captain’s Cup, promoting camaraderie and self-care. “She’s a strong advocate for all personnel on the island,” said Capt. Tammy Servies, hospital director and commanding officer of USNMRTC Guantanamo Bay. “Our unique location and patient population require constant advocacy, and I can always count on her to fight for our patients. “This recognition is a long time coming,” Servies continued. “She is truly an expert in many fields and her push to cross-train our nurses in this remote location demonstrates her forward-leaning strategic thinking.”

Capt. Bond Henry, chief nursing officer for Defense Health Network Atlantic, coordinated award nominations across the region. “We selected one nomination from each category to move forward from our Network, fine-tuned the nominations, and submitted to be considered across the entire DHA,” said Henry. “Commander Saraceni was highlighted as a leader who has thrived in a small and isolated environment, which requires top performers to fill multiple roles at once. Her leadership style and proactive approach to problem solving created a healthy work environment for all the staff in Guantanamo Bay.”

The Defense Health Agency manages military treatment facilities across the Department of Defense, integrating healthcare services to enhance readiness, improve patient outcomes, and streamline medical operations. As part of this system, USNH Guantanamo Bay plays a vital role as the only hospital delivering healthcare to service members and their families, federal employees, U.S. and foreign national contractors, stationed at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay. The hospital also operates the Department of Defense’s only overseas military home healthcare program, providing ongoing care to elderly special category residents who sought asylum on the installation during the Cuban Revolution.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9136559.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-30 15:56:20.711452

Deputy Commissioner for Operations & Chief Operating Officer, Food and Drug Administration

Barclay Butler’s latest achievement is applying the lessons he learned while leading the consolidation of Army, Navy and Air Force hospitals into the Defense Health Agency to designing and launching FDA’s new shared services operating model.

“Our single vision in the COO’s office is to remove administrative burdens from the reviewers, inspectors, and investigators by providing them with effective and efficient shared services covering finance, human resources, facilities, IT, contracting, grants, FOIA, and more, by which we can improve on the time and cost of reviews and inspections, bring more products to the American public, while assuring we meet the FDA mission to protect the public health and preserve the national security,” Butler said.

Why Watch

Through 2025, Butler’s team will focus on building and training the shared service providers that support FDA centers, offices and programs. Their goal is to remove administrative burdens from the drug, biologics, medical device, tobacco and food review teams; ensure a safe food supply; keep inspectors and investigators in the field; and give FDA staff more time to carry out their mission of protecting public health and national security.

As one of the largest operational divisions within the Department of Health and Human Services, FDA is fully aligned with the efficient use of taxpayer-funded resources. It has exceeded the administration’s resourcing goals while continuing to fulfill its critical mission on behalf of the American public.

“We also have to modernize,” said Dr. Marty Makary, FDA commissioner. “On day one of me being on the job, I actively began an effort to organize to use AI for our scientific reviewers to make their jobs easier. Well, two weeks ago, we just announced our first AI-assisted review with the latest generation AI technology. One reviewer said that what normally took him two to three days, the AI did in six minutes. … The goal is to reduce the paperwork burden of reviewers, which is tremendous, so that we can deliver more cures and meaningful treatments to the American people faster.”

Fun Fact: Butler is an avid sailor who spends his vacations chartering bareboats along the U.S. East Coast and in the British Virgin Islands. He’s also a member of American Legion Riders, riding his Harley-Davidson in parades with three large flags mounted on the back and helping raise money for local charities.",https://washingtonexec.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-27-at-8.06.01 AM.png,N,0.0,2025-06-29 13:56:24.121607

I go to the VA a couple times a year for check ups to stay active in the system. I also use VA podiatry, as there are no podiatrists in my area that accept Tricare. I have also started using some Community Care referrals, such as a sleep study.

Since you have both available to you, you have options in the event that you aren't satisfied with the care you are receiving.

Ok, always, always leave as many options open as possible for your care. I worked at VHA for 30 years. I know what we do well and I know what we don't do so well. Nownthis is obviously different at each individual hospital. If a medication is not on the VA formulary, then use Tricare. You should always use VA for DME (durable medical equipment) because there is no cost to the veteran regardless of service connection or not. Medical Care, you should choose whatever opinion or option you feel comfortable with. Remember, not knocking the VA but they are a training hospital.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services.
We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.
These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy.","When I was Governor, we focused on providing great services to Nebraskans. The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/16/2024/06/Senator-Pete-Ricketts.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-29 13:56:44.332989

I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.
In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services.
We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.
These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy.","When I was Governor, we focused on providing great services to Nebraskans. The federal government should do the same. Now that I’m in the Senate, my team and I are here to help Nebraskans navigate the bureaucracy.

We have offices in Scottsbluff, Kearney, Lincoln, Omaha, and Washington, D.C. We also host Mobile Office Hours across the state. We have already visited all 93 counties this year and we visited them all twice last year. Our team is specially trained in assisting constituents with concerns and complaints. We can also answer questions about services, eligibility, or benefits from federal agencies like the Veterans Affairs, Medicare, or the Internal Revenue Service. I’m proud of our work to cut red tape and deliver wins for Nebraskans.

In 2024, we helped nearly 800 Nebraskans access federal services. We also helped constituents save or recover nearly $5 million from the federal government. We continue that work this year and have already returned $1.3 million in constituent savings for Nebraskans.

Richard out in the Panhandle is one example. He’s a disabled veteran. His disability requires him to get significant help for everyday tasks, like going through his mail. Late last year, the VA notified Richard that he owed nearly $20,000. This was because his dependent status had not been updated since 2015. Richard was shocked by this, as he had never been informed an update was needed. That’s because his VA notices had been inadvertently thrown away without his awareness.

Richard contacted my office in Lincoln after trying for months to submit the needed paperwork. This disabled veteran had no way of repaying this debt that he accidentally incurred. My team got involved and helped establish a claim. The VA updated his dependent status which wiped away Richard’s debt, saving him nearly $20,000.

A couple from Dodge County contacted my office asking for help. They always file their taxes on paper. In 2023, the IRS made a big mistake and said they owed over $34,000. Not only did these Nebraskans not owe money, but they were due a refund of over $25,000. The IRS then refused to pay their 2022 refund because of the mix-up.

This couple tried to fix it themselves. They sent letters asking for help and got no response. They even met with the IRS in Omaha. When they came to my office for help, our casework team got to work immediately. We found the IRS’s mistakes and showed them they were wrong.

Soon after that, the Nebraskans finally got a refund check for over $22,000. That included almost $1,500 in interest—which still wasn’t the right amount. After more hard work, we helped them get another check. In the end, the Dodge County couple received the money they were owed. It took more than a year, but we never gave up.

Other times, oversight means ensuring Nebraska companies are not overlooked on federal directories. A healthcare provider in Eastern Nebraska reached out to my office. They are an in-network provider for TRICARE. TRICARE is the health care program that serves our military members, veterans, and their families. However, TRICARE’s website failed to list this provider as an acceptable option.

That simple omission caused serious confusion. Patients didn’t know they could get care from this provider. As a result, this provider faced an estimated $150,000 in lost revenue.

My team reached out to TriWest, a contractor who manages TRICARE’s network in our region. We pushed them to fix the website and ensure this provider was listed correctly. Thanks to our efforts, the problem was resolved. The VA website was updated.

Now, military families and veterans who are TRICARE beneficiaries can see this proud Nebraska company listed as a trusted, in-network provider. That’s not just a win for this provider. It’s a win for every Nebraskan who depends on clear information and quality care.

These are just three of many examples of how my team and I work every day to help Nebraskans navigate the federal bureaucracy. We’re continuing the fight to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure federal agencies serve the people. From streamlining government to cutting taxes on Social Security, tips, and military retirement benefits, I’ll keep working to make government work better. We’re going to continue delivering excellent customer service for our constituents. Nebraskans deserve nothing less.",https://media.ruralradio.co/nrr/uploads/sites/16/2024/06/Senator-Pete-Ricketts.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-28 22:56:38.772131

Understanding Your TRICARE 1095-B The purpose of Form 1095-B is to serve as proof that you maintained Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC), a standard set by the Affordable Care Act.

Tax Filing with Form 1095-B When filing your federal income taxes, you do not need to attach Form 1095-B to your return.
How to Access Your Form 1095-B The most direct way to get your Form 1095-B is through the milConnect online portal.","The TRICARE Form 1095-B is a health coverage statement verifying that an individual and their covered family members had qualifying health insurance during a specific tax year. This form is part of the reporting requirements established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). For TRICARE beneficiaries, this document confirms their enrollment in a plan that satisfies national health coverage standards.

Understanding Your TRICARE 1095-B

The purpose of Form 1095-B is to serve as proof that you maintained Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC), a standard set by the Affordable Care Act. While the ACA originally included a federal tax penalty for not having health insurance, this penalty was reduced to $0 starting with the 2019 tax year. You no longer face a federal penalty for lacking coverage, but the Department of Defense continues to send these forms to fulfill its legal obligation to report health coverage information to the IRS and to plan enrollees.

Your TRICARE 1095-B contains specific details about your coverage. Part I identifies the “Responsible Individual,” which is the plan subscriber or sponsor. Part III names the issuer of the coverage, which for TRICARE is the Department of Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Part IV lists each covered individual by name and Social Security number and includes checkboxes to indicate for which months of the year they had MEC.

This form is for retirees, annuitants, former spouses, and others covered by TRICARE Select, TRICARE Retired Reserve, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Young Adult. Active-duty members and their families, as well as those enrolled in TRICARE Prime, receive a Form 1095-C. If a service member retires or separates during the year, they may receive both a 1095-C for their active-duty period and a 1095-B for their months as a retiree.

Tax Filing with Form 1095-B

When filing your federal income taxes, you do not need to attach Form 1095-B to your return. The IRS receives this information directly from the DMDC. You should, however, keep the form with your personal tax records as proof of coverage.

The relevance of Form 1095-B is more pronounced at the state level. While the federal penalty no longer exists, a handful of states have enacted their own individual health coverage mandates. These states require residents to have qualifying health coverage or pay a penalty on their state tax return.

Residents of the following jurisdictions may need the information from their 1095-B to complete their state tax forms and demonstrate they met the coverage requirement:

California

District of Columbia

Massachusetts

New Jersey

Rhode Island

Vermont

The information on your TRICARE 1095-B, particularly the months of coverage detailed in Part IV, is what you would use to satisfy these obligations and avoid a potential state-level penalty.

How to Access Your Form 1095-B

The most direct way to get your Form 1095-B is through the milConnect online portal. After logging in with a DS Logon, Common Access Card (CAC), or DFAS myPay account, you can navigate to the “Correspondence/Documentation” section to view, print, or save a PDF copy of your form. Forms are available by January 31 for the preceding tax year.

If you are unable to access the form online, you can request a copy by phone. You may call the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Support Center to ask for a copy to be mailed to your address on record. Having your sponsor’s Social Security number available when you call can help expedite the request.

A third option is to request the form via postal mail. You can send a written request to the DMDC Support Office. The request should include the sponsor’s full name, Social Security number, date of birth, and the tax year for which you need the form. This method is the slowest, so it is best to submit the request well in advance of any tax filing deadlines.",https://accountinginsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cropped-ai6icon.png,N,0.0,2025-06-28 18:56:24.436056

You don't say but I'm assuming you are medically retired for your cap to be $3000? If not then your Group A cap $4261. If you ARE medically retired, all other fees go by Select Group A costs. So you would have a $150 individual deductible and a $300 family deductible you would need to meet before costsharing begins. Costsharing is another word for copayments.

Lets look at what Select Retired Group A says under Maternity Inpatient: Network: $250 per day or up to 25% hospital charge (whichever is less); plus 20% separately billed services

Out-of-Network: $1,306 per day§ or up to 25% hospital charge (whichever is less); plus 25% separately billed services

So you would then figure if you went to an in- network or out-of-network hospital.

Some visits don't count towards your deductible, but after your deductible is met, everything goes towards the catastrophic cap. Then Tricare will pay 100% of all allowable charges.

Coordination with other health insurance Other health insurance, or OHI, is coverage in addition to Medicare and TFL.
Unlock your health—and peace of mind—by understanding how TFL and Medicare work together, as described in the Medicare publication How Medicare Works With Other Insurance.","JUNE 28, 2025 – Are you approaching the age of 65? Unlock your health by signing up for Medicare as soon as you’re eligible. Medicare Part A and Part B are required to remain eligible for TRICARE, with limited exceptions. Knowing how and when to sign up for Medicare will help you avoid gaps in coverage and late enrollment penalties.

“Signing up for Medicare three or four months before your 65th birthday is important to ensure a seamless transition to TRICARE For Life,” said Anne Breslin, TFL program manager, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Medicare and TRICARE will then work together to help minimize your out-of-pocket expenses.”

Understanding eligibility

Most people become eligible for Medicare the first day of the month they turn 65. Those with a birthday on the first of a month become eligible the first of the month before they turn 65.

Some become eligible for Medicare before age 65 after receiving Social Security Disability Insurance for 24 months or when diagnosed with certain medical conditions.

TFL is available to military retirees and their family members who qualify for TRICARE, are entitled to Medicare Part A, and have Medicare Part B, regardless of age or place of residence. You can sign up on the Social Security Administration website or by calling SSA to schedule an appointment.

Learn more by reading the TRICARE and Medicare Under Age 65 Brochure.

If you (or your spouse) are still working and have employer-sponsored health coverage when you turn 65, Medicare allows you to delay enrollment in Medicare Part B. But if you do delay enrollment, you won’t have TRICARE coverage. Answer a few questions on the Medicare webpage to find out what’s right for you.

If one family member becomes eligible for Medicare and is now covered by TFL, other family members not yet eligible for Medicare can still use TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Avoid penalties

It’s important to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B during your Initial Enrollment Period, which is seven months long. This is when you’re first eligible to sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. It starts three or four months before you turn 65. Learn more about late enrollment penalties and how to avoid them.

To avoid coverage gaps, keep your information current in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility System. This ensures you receive timely updates and benefits information.

Sign up for Medicare no later than two months before the month you turn 65 to avoid a break in your TRICARE coverage. There are no enrollment forms or fees required for TFL —it begins automatically the first date Medicare Part A and Part B are effective.

To learn more, check out the TRICARE and Medicare Turning Age 65 Brochure.

What parts of Medicare do you need?

To be eligible for TFL, you must have both Medicare Part A and Part B.

Part A typically covers:

Inpatient hospital care

Skilled nursing facilities

Hospice

Some home health care

Most people get Part A premium-free if they, or their spouse, worked and paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years.

Medicare Part B covers:

Outpatient care

Certain preventive services

Durable medical equipment

Part B has a monthly premium based on your income.

You don’t need to enroll in Medicare Advantage (Part C) or prescription drug coverage (Part D) to have TFL coverage. Read the TRICARE Newsroom article “Q&A: How Does TRICARE For Life Work With Medicare?” to learn more.

For dental and vision coverage, check to see if you qualify through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.

Coverage overseas

Medicare only provides coverage in the U.S. and U.S. territories. If you live or travel overseas, TRICARE becomes your primary payer. That means you’ll pay TRICARE’s annual deductible and cost for care abroad. You must still have Medicare Part B to remain eligible for TFL, even though it doesn’t pay for care.

Here’s what else to keep in mind if you have TFL and live or travel overseas:

You may visit any TRICARE-authorized provider for care.

If you’re in the Philippines, you must see a Philippine Preferred Provider Network or certified providers.

Be prepared to pay for services up front. You’ll need to file a claim later.

You have up to three years to file claims for overseas care.

Which pays first: Medicare or TRICARE?

When both Medicare and TRICARE cover a health care service, Medicare pays first and TRICARE pays second. TRICARE may also cover services that Medicare doesn’t. That’s why it’s important to confirm you’re covered by Medicare, TRICARE, or both—to help avoid costs.

You’ll also need to use Medicare providers. Check out TRICARE’s covered services to learn more.

Coordination with other health insurance

Other health insurance, or OHI, is coverage in addition to Medicare and TFL. This might be offered by an employer, based on current employment or retirement for you or your spouse.

How Medicare coordinates with OHI depends on whether the OHI is based on current employment. In either case, TRICARE pays last.

Unlock your health—and peace of mind—by understanding how TFL and Medicare work together, as described in the Medicare publication How Medicare Works With Other Insurance. You can view or print the booklet or call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227) to find out if a copy can be mailed to you.

According to TRICARE, The Defense Health Agency has extended the payment deadline for those enrolled in a TRICARE premium-based plan (TRICARE Young Adult, TRICARE Reserve Select, and TRICARE Retired Reserve). You now have until Tuesday, Mar. 31 to provide your payment information to TriWest.

If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, you also have until Tuesday, Mar. 31 to pay your fees.

The latest deadline extension comes as a number of beneficiaries and health care providers have reported difficulty with the TriWest online portal, including long wait times to reach TriWest’s call center.

According to the Defense Health Agency, it’s aware that TRICARE beneficiaries transitioning in the West are experiencing significant call wait times and that TriWest is bringing on additional staff to reduce wait time and ensure TRICARE beneficiaries have the support they need to get their questions answered, transfer payment information to maintain health care coverage.

DHA also says that it knows many beneficiaries have active referrals in the West Region that have not been authorized by TriWest and that all active referrals and pre-authorizations from the previous contractors (Health Net Federal Services or Humana) that were issued before Jan. 1, 2025, will be honored by TriWest and will be valid through their expiration or June 30, 2025, whichever comes first. The TRICARE Health Plan team is working directly with TriWest to actively process all existing referrals. You can check your referral status or get assistance by visiting the TriWest online or calling 888-874-9378.
