The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella.
This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.","FALLS CHURCH, Va. — You may have heard about the ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. As of April 10, there have been 712 confirmed cases in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/measles.png,N,0.0,2025-04-18 21:56:27.507781

Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.
She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families.
“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said.
Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families. “Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco. “I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer. “All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment. “We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations. “The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes. “We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration. “The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology. “We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project. “Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases. “We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed. “Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork. “The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms. “I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success."" Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8852987.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-19 00:56:36.622418

Key Initiatives by the Defense Health Agency

Innovative Training Programs

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is at the forefront of developing innovative training programs that are essential for enhancing the capabilities of military medical personnel. These programs are designed to ensure that healthcare providers in the military are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to handle the unique challenges posed by military operations.

One of the key initiatives undertaken by the DHA is the implementation of comprehensive emergency medical training programs. These programs focus on preparing military medical staff to respond effectively to a wide range of emergency scenarios, from combat injuries to natural disasters. By simulating real-world situations, these training programs help medical personnel develop the critical thinking and decision-making skills necessary to provide timely and effective care under pressure.

Another significant initiative is the development of specialized training modules that cater to the specific needs of different branches of the military. For instance, the DHA has introduced programs that focus on the unique medical challenges faced by special operations forces. These programs include tactical medical readiness training, which equips personnel with advanced skills in trauma care, field surgery, and evacuation procedures.

Moreover, the DHA’s commitment to innovation extends to the integration of cutting-edge technologies into its training programs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in training simulations has revolutionized the way military medical personnel are trained. These technologies provide a highly immersive and realistic training environment, allowing trainees to practice complex procedures and hone their skills in a controlled setting.

What is the impact of innovative training programs on military medical personnel? Innovative training programs developed by the Defense Health Agency enhance the skills and preparedness of military healthcare providers, enabling them to deliver effective care in diverse and challenging environments.

In addition to technological advancements, the DHA places a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. By fostering partnerships between military and civilian healthcare systems, the agency ensures that military medical personnel have access to the latest medical research and best practices. This collaborative approach not only enhances the quality of training but also strengthens the overall healthcare framework, benefiting both military and civilian populations.

The DHA’s innovative training programs are a testament to its dedication to maintaining the highest standards of military medical readiness. By continuously evolving and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of military medicine, the agency ensures that military healthcare providers are well-prepared to meet the demands of their roles, both on and off the battlefield.

Technological Advancements in Military Medical Training

The integration of technology into military medical training has revolutionized the way medical personnel are prepared for the unique challenges they face. Under the guidance of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), various technological tools and simulations have been introduced to enhance training efficiency and effectiveness. These advancements ensure that military healthcare providers are well-equipped to deliver optimal care in diverse and often high-stress environments.

One of the most significant technological advancements is the use of simulation-based training programs. These programs allow medical personnel to engage in realistic scenarios that mimic battlefield conditions. By utilizing virtual reality and augmented reality platforms, trainees can practice critical procedures in a controlled, yet lifelike setting. This not only improves their technical skills but also enhances their ability to remain calm and effective under pressure.

Moreover, the DHA has spearheaded the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical training. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to provide personalized feedback and adaptive learning paths for trainees. This ensures that each individual receives targeted instruction that addresses their specific strengths and areas for improvement. As a result, trainees can achieve a higher level of proficiency in a shorter amount of time.

Another crucial technological advancement is the implementation of telemedicine platforms, which facilitate remote training and consultation. These platforms enable military healthcare providers to access expert guidance and resources from anywhere in the world, ensuring that they are always up-to-date with the latest medical practices and protocols. This is particularly beneficial for personnel stationed in remote or austere locations, where access to traditional training resources may be limited.

The integration of these technologies into military medical training not only enhances the skills of healthcare providers but also contributes to the overall readiness of the military healthcare system. By ensuring that medical personnel are thoroughly prepared for any situation, the DHA plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and well-being of service members. This commitment to excellence and innovation underscores the importance of continued investment in federal support for military medical readiness.

In conclusion, technological advancements have transformed military medical training, providing healthcare providers with the tools they need to excel in their roles. As these technologies continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly play an even more integral role in preparing military medical personnel for the challenges of tomorrow.

Future Prospects for Military Medical Training

The future of military medical training is poised for significant advancements, spearheaded by the strategic plans of the Defense Health Agency (DHA). As we look ahead, it’s clear that the DHA is committed to evolving and enhancing the quality of military healthcare education. This commitment is crucial for maintaining the readiness and effectiveness of military medical personnel in an ever-changing landscape.

One of the key areas of focus for the future is the integration of cutting-edge technologies in training programs. The DHA is exploring the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create more personalized and adaptive learning experiences. AI can provide real-time feedback and tailor training modules to the specific needs of each trainee, ensuring that all personnel reach their full potential.

Additionally, the DHA is investing in the development of simulation-based training environments that replicate the complexities of battlefield medicine. These simulations are designed to mimic real-world scenarios, allowing trainees to practice their skills in a safe yet challenging setting. This approach not only boosts confidence but also enhances decision-making abilities under pressure.

Another exciting prospect is the expansion of telemedicine capabilities within military medical training. The DHA is working to improve remote consultation and training platforms, making it easier for medical personnel to access expert guidance and resources from anywhere in the world. This is particularly beneficial for those stationed in remote or austere locations, where traditional training resources may be limited.

Moreover, the DHA is committed to fostering collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems. By enhancing interoperability, the agency aims to ensure seamless coordination during joint operations and large-scale emergencies. This collaboration is essential for optimizing resource allocation and improving overall healthcare outcomes.

As we move forward, the DHA’s strategic plans also include strengthening partnerships with academic institutions and research organizations. These collaborations will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and innovation, driving continuous improvement in military medical training methodologies. By leveraging the expertise of external partners, the DHA can stay at the forefront of medical education and ensure that military healthcare providers are equipped with the latest skills and techniques.

In conclusion, the future prospects for military medical training are bright, with the DHA leading the charge in implementing innovative strategies and technologies. As these advancements continue to unfold, they will play a pivotal role in preparing military medical personnel for the challenges of tomorrow, ensuring that they remain ready and capable of providing exceptional care in any situation.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - April 18, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Through its strategic initiatives, the DHA not only supports the health of military personnel but also plays a significant part in the global health landscape.

One of the key ways the DHA contributes to global health security is through its involvement in rapid medical deployment strategies. The agency develops and implements protocols that allow for the swift mobilization of medical resources in response to international health crises. This capability is vital in addressing pandemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies that require immediate medical intervention.

Moreover, the DHA collaborates with various international organizations to enhance its global health impact. These partnerships are essential for sharing medical expertise, resources, and technology, which collectively strengthen the global health security framework. By engaging in joint exercises and training programs, the DHA ensures that its personnel are well-prepared to handle diverse health challenges across the globe.

In addition to its operational responsibilities, the DHA is at the forefront of technological innovation in military healthcare. By integrating advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and telemedicine, the agency enhances its capability to deliver effective healthcare services both domestically and internationally. These innovations are critical in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of medical responses in various scenarios.

The DHA’s commitment to global health security is further demonstrated through its efforts in modernizing military medical facilities. By investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure and equipment, the agency ensures that its healthcare delivery systems are resilient and capable of meeting the demands of modern military operations. This modernization not only benefits military personnel but also enhances the agency’s capacity to contribute to global health initiatives.

Overall, the Defense Health Agency’s role in global health security is multifaceted and integral to the broader health and safety objectives of the U.S. military. Through its comprehensive approach to healthcare management and its commitment to innovation and collaboration, the DHA continues to be a pivotal player in the global health arena.

Key Partnerships Enhancing Global Health Security

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) stands as a pivotal entity in the realm of global health security, primarily through its strategic partnerships. These alliances are crucial in expanding the agency’s capabilities to address complex health challenges that transcend national borders. By examining these partnerships, we gain insight into how the DHA leverages collaboration to enhance its operational effectiveness and contribute to international health safety.

One of the most significant collaborations involves interagency cooperation on biodefense and military vaccine production. This partnership ensures a robust response to biological threats by pooling resources and expertise from different sectors. The synergy between the DHA and other federal agencies enhances the development and distribution of vaccines, which is critical in managing pandemics and other infectious disease outbreaks.

Another vital partnership is with international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These collaborations focus on expanding military biodefense vaccine manufacturing, ensuring that military personnel have access to cutting-edge medical solutions. By working closely with these organizations, the DHA can implement best practices and innovative strategies in its health security initiatives.

Furthermore, the DHA actively engages with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to address global health crises. These partnerships are instrumental in providing humanitarian aid and medical assistance in regions affected by conflict or natural disasters. The collaboration with NGOs allows the DHA to extend its reach and impact, ensuring that essential medical services are delivered promptly and efficiently.

Moreover, the DHA’s partnership with academic institutions plays a crucial role in advancing research and innovation in military medicine. These collaborations facilitate the exchange of knowledge and technology, leading to the development of new medical treatments and interventions. By fostering a strong relationship with academia, the DHA ensures that its medical personnel are equipped with the latest skills and expertise necessary for effective health security operations.

In addition to these partnerships, the DHA is also involved in joint training exercises with allied nations. These exercises are designed to enhance interoperability and coordination in response to global health emergencies. By participating in these initiatives, the DHA strengthens its operational readiness and ensures that its personnel are prepared to respond to diverse health threats.

The role of telehealth in these partnerships cannot be overstated. The integration of telemedicine into the DHA’s operations allows for real-time communication and consultation with medical experts worldwide. This capability is particularly valuable in remote or underserved areas where access to healthcare is limited.

Finally, the DHA’s commitment to enhancing global health security is reflected in its efforts to build sustainable partnerships. By fostering long-term relationships with key stakeholders, the agency ensures that its initiatives are not only effective but also sustainable. This approach is essential in creating a resilient health security framework that can withstand future challenges.

These partnerships collectively enhance the DHA’s ability to respond to global health challenges and ensure the safety and well-being of military personnel and the broader international community. Through strategic alliances and collaborations, the DHA continues to play a vital role in strengthening global health security.

Technological Innovations in Defense Health Agency Collaborations

In the rapidly evolving landscape of global health security, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) leverages cutting-edge technologies to enhance its collaborative efforts. By integrating advanced tools such as telemedicine, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the DHA significantly improves its ability to respond to health threats with precision and speed. These technological innovations are not just enhancements but are pivotal in transforming how the agency operates and collaborates with its partners.

One of the most impactful technological advancements is the use of telehealth systems. Telemedicine allows healthcare professionals to provide real-time consultations and medical support to military personnel across the globe. This capability is particularly beneficial in remote or conflict zones where access to traditional healthcare facilities is limited. By utilizing telehealth, the DHA ensures that medical expertise is always within reach, thus enhancing its global health security network.

Data analytics is another critical component of the DHA’s technological framework. Through sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques, the agency can monitor health trends, predict potential outbreaks, and allocate resources more efficiently. This predictive capability is essential for effective public health collaboration and for making informed decisions that safeguard both military and civilian populations.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a transformative role in the DHA’s operations. AI-driven tools enhance the agency’s ability to detect and respond to health threats quickly. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI can identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate emerging health risks. This proactive approach enables the DHA to implement preventive measures and respond to threats before they escalate, thereby reinforcing its commitment to global health security.

Moreover, the integration of these technologies into the DHA’s partnerships extends beyond traditional healthcare boundaries. By collaborating with technology firms and research institutions, the agency fosters an ecosystem of innovation that continuously evolves to meet new challenges. These partnerships are vital for developing novel solutions and maintaining a competitive edge in the field of global health security.

One of the key areas where these technological innovations have a profound impact is in military healthcare logistics. By optimizing supply chains and improving logistical operations, the DHA ensures that medical supplies and personnel are deployed swiftly and efficiently during health emergencies. This logistical agility is crucial for maintaining combat readiness and ensuring that military operations are not hampered by health-related issues.

Furthermore, the DHA’s commitment to technological advancement extends to the development of next-generation medical devices and treatments. By investing in research and development, the agency supports the creation of innovative medical technologies that enhance treatment outcomes and improve the quality of care provided to military personnel.

In conclusion, the incorporation of technological innovations into the DHA’s collaborative efforts is a testament to its forward-thinking approach to global health security. By harnessing the power of telemedicine, data analytics, and AI, the agency not only improves its operational efficiency but also strengthens its partnerships with key stakeholders. These advancements are instrumental in enhancing the DHA’s ability to respond to global health challenges and ensure the safety and well-being of military personnel worldwide.

Challenges and Opportunities in Strengthening Global Health Security

In the quest to bolster global health security, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) faces a complex array of challenges and opportunities. These dynamics are critical in shaping the agency’s strategies and responses to global health threats. Understanding these factors is crucial for stakeholders who aim to support and enhance the DHA’s mission.

One of the primary challenges is resource limitations. The demand for healthcare resources often exceeds supply, especially in crisis situations. This scarcity can hinder the DHA’s ability to respond effectively to health emergencies. Additionally, geopolitical tensions can complicate international collaborations, making it difficult to establish and maintain partnerships that are crucial for global health security.

Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for growth and enhanced collaboration. The DHA can leverage its existing partnerships to expand its network and improve its response capabilities. By fostering stronger alliances with international organizations, governments, and non-governmental entities, the agency can enhance its capacity to address global health challenges.

Moreover, technological advancements present a unique opportunity for the DHA to improve its operations. Innovations in data analytics, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the agency’s ability to predict, monitor, and respond to health threats. By integrating these technologies into its strategies, the DHA can improve its efficiency and effectiveness in safeguarding global health security.

Furthermore, the DHA’s commitment to innovation can drive the development of new medical technologies and treatments. By investing in research and development, the agency supports the creation of cutting-edge solutions that can improve health outcomes and enhance the quality of care provided to military personnel.

Another significant opportunity lies in the potential for enhanced collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems. By improving interoperability, the DHA can ensure a more coordinated and efficient response to health emergencies, benefiting both military and civilian populations.

In conclusion, while the challenges in strengthening global health security are significant, the opportunities for growth and enhancement are equally substantial. By addressing these challenges head-on and leveraging available opportunities, the Defense Health Agency can continue to play a pivotal role in safeguarding global health security.

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations

Mediate concerns between you and your medical team

At right is John Vinson, CEO of the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, who also supported the policy. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)

Arkansas became the first state in the nation to prevent healthcare conglomerates from operating drugstores here when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed House Bill 1150 on Wednesday.

State law already regulates what pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) pay to reimburse independent pharmacies, but pharmacists have complained that the companies violate the law. The state has also fined four PBMs a total of $1.47 million for paying Arkansas pharmacies below the legally required amount for prescription drugs.

PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying these conglomerates are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients.

HB 1150 headed to Sanders’ desk April 9 after clearing the Senate with a bipartisan 26 votes, six days after it passed the House with 89 votes. The bill generated hours of discussion and public comment in the House and Senate committees on Insurance and Commerce this month.

“These massive corporations are attacking our state because we will be the first in the country to hold them accountable for their anticompetitive actions,” Sanders said in a statement Wednesday.

CVS Health issued a statement last week urging Sanders to veto HB 1150, calling it “misguided policy.” The organization, which includes the CVS Caremark PBM, issued another statement Wednesday afternoon.

“CVS Health welcomes a good faith discussion with policy makers in Arkansas and across the country on ways to make medicine more affordable and accessible,” the statement said. “Unfortunately, HB1150 is bad policy that accomplishes just the opposite: it will take away access to pharmacy care in local communities, hike prescription drug spending across the state by millions of dollars each year, and cost hundreds of Arkansans their jobs.”

Arkansas has 23 CVS pharmacies that CVS and other opponents of HB 1150 said will be forced to close under the new law. Arkansas Pharmacists Association CEO John Vinson said this is not true and pharmacies can still operate if they detach from PBMs.

Sanders, Vinson and other supporters of HB 1150 have said a lack of sufficient regulation of PBMs has allowed them to monopolize the pharmaceutical industry by setting their competitors’ prices.

OptumRX, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark – the three largest PBMs – are each owned by much larger corporations that each also own a top-10 health insurer. Together they control about 80% of the U.S. prescription market, according to last year’s Federal Trade Commission report.

The legal landscape

Act 1 and Act 3 of 2018 prohibit PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their competitors, locally owned independent pharmacies. PBMs routinely break these laws, said Vinson and HB 1150’s Republican sponsors, Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Rep. Jeremiah Moore of Clarendon.

PBMs have allegedly also violated Act 900 of 2015, which required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least as much as the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs. Pharmacies sent the Arkansas Insurance Department (AID) thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below this national average or paid them at or just above this amount, independent pharmacists and AID’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.

This led the Arkansas Legislative Council to require PBMs to include dispensing fees in their reimbursements for prescription drugs. The panel approved the rule a day after its Administrative Rules subcommittee rejected it.

Hammer told the Senate Insurance committee April 8 that the Legislature should not be “rewarding” violators of state law “by letting them stay in business.”

“Congress is pursuing this issue. Why? Because states like Arkansas are not sitting on the sidelines and being quiet about it,” Hammer said. “[If you say], ‘Let’s sit back and wait for Congress,’ like sitting back and waiting for the Lord to come, it ain’t going to happen soon enough.”

After more than a century serving Hammer’s constituents in Benton, Smith-Caldwell Drug Store closed in August 2023 due to financial insolvency and transferred its clients to Walgreens, a national chain that isn’t part of a PBM.

Brad Lawson, a Little Rock-based healthcare supervisor for Walgreens, told lawmakers in December that unfair PBM reimbursements have forced the company to close several locations and plan further closures nationwide.

Walgreens declined to comment Thursday on HB 1150.

Opposition

In an April 4 interview with the Advocate, CVS leaders said the Caremark PBM not only complies with Arkansas law but also reimburses independent pharmacies at a higher rate than its own chain pharmacies. They also said employers whose health insurance plans include CVS will face higher costs.

“Patients are choosing us, they have a choice, and I think we’re not allowing patients to have a choice in this bill,” Chief Pharmacy Officer Lucille Accetta said.

When asked about HB 1150’s potential financial impact on CVS, Accetta and Vice President of External Relations David Whitrap said the losses of pharmacists’ jobs and patients’ access to medication are higher priorities than money.

CVS closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 and 900 more stores between 2021 and 2024.

CVS District Leader of Pharmacy Operations Ashley Ellis spoke against the bill at both Insurance and Commerce committee meetings, saying she and her colleagues would lose their jobs if HB 1150 becomes law.

Ellis lives in Greenbrier, represented by Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View. Irvin was in the minority of Senate committee members to vote against HB 1150, and she said she would not vote for a constituent to lose her job.

Hammer said the potential loss of CVS employees’ jobs is “a lie.”

“If they want to argue these local [corporate] pharmacies shouldn’t be going out of business because they get paid adequately, fine,” he said. “Put your money where your mouth is. Prove it. Start paying yourselves like you’re paying these others.”

Several lawmakers said this month that they supported HB 1150 partly because they received emails urging them to vote against it that appeared to be from constituents but turned out to be from lobbyists opposing the legislation. Rep. Richard McGrew, R-Hot Springs, told the House Insurance Committee that CVS clients in his district had not consented to their names being used for this purpose.

Sen. Mark Johnson, R-Ferndale, told the equivalent Senate committee that he received similar misleading emails.

“This is not grassroots opposition to this bill,” Johnson said. “This is astroturf.”

Besides CVS Health, opponents of HB 1150 included the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce, the Navitus Health Solutions PBM, and the Omnicare and Accredo pharmacies.

Omnicare is owned by CVS Health, and Accredo is a subsidiary of Express Scripts.

Mail order concerns

Several PBMs are affiliated with interstate mail-order pharmacy operations, and House Bill 1150 includes mail-order pharmacy permits among those that PBMs would be prohibited from holding.

Opponents of HB 1150 said it would reduce patients’ access to specialty drugs, some of which might only be accessible via mail-order services – including for military members and veterans who receive pharmaceuticals via the Tricare insurance program’s partnership with Express Scripts.

HB 1150 allows the State Board of Pharmacy to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law. Hammer told the Senate this will allow Tricare beneficiaries to continue receiving medications while PBMs transition out of Arkansas.

Despite being a veteran on Tricare, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin’s pharmacy services have been moved from one provider to another by PBM interference, he said in January at a news conference announcing HB 1150. He also said he would defend the legislation in court if it were challenged.

On Monday, Griffin was the lead signatory of a bipartisan letter to Congress from attorneys general in 39 states and territories, advocating for the policy in HB 1150 to be enacted federally.

Griffin sued Express Scripts and OptumRX last year, alleging that they used data from drug manufacturers and distributors to maximize their financial gain instead of using it to mitigate the opioid addiction epidemic.

‘Winners and losers’

Irvin was one of nine senators, mostly Republicans, to vote against HB 1150 last week. She disputed the claim that PBMs have a monopoly in the pharmaceutical industry, saying this is only an opinion without a court’s declaration.

Senate Minority Whip Fred Love, D-Mabelvale, was the chamber’s only Democrat to vote against the bill. Love’s district does not have any local independent pharmacies, and his constituents will lose access to medications if corporate pharmacies like CVS close, he said.

“They’ve been talking to me saying, ‘Guess what? This will hurt us,'” Love said. “So we’re going to manufacture a pharmacy desert in southwest Little Rock? That’s not good for my people.”

Irvin also took issue with a statement April 8 from Greg Reybold, vice president of Healthcare Policy at the American Pharmacy Cooperative, that HB 1150 will “take the ball away” from PBMs in Arkansas’ pharmacy industry.

“We’re using the government to say, ‘We’re getting rid of your competition,'” Irvin said. “ It says that we’re denying a permit to be approved for you, but not for you. You’re picking winners and losers.”

GOP Sen. Justin Boyd, a Fort Smith pharmacist and the vice chairman of the Senate Insurance committee, argued that PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices is actually “picking winners and losers.”

Another 2025 Arkansas law that supporters said will increase patients’ access to medication is Act 52, which removed the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. The bill, co-sponsored by Irvin, initially failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee but later passed after being amended.

The Arkansas Pharmacists Association opposed Act 52 before it was amended. Vinson told the Senate Insurance committee that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by HB 1150. Both laws will go into effect in August.

Chris Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador is one way Democrats are increasingly speaking out against Trump. Two people gunned down in a shooting at Florida State University. And disruptions in the military's health care program have left some pregnant women with gaps in care.

Here’s what to know today.

A growing resistance to Trump, from Van Hollen to Harvard

Sen. Chris Van Hollen confirmed last night that he has met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man that the Trump administration said it mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The meeting comes after Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived before being deported, traveled to the country this week to push for his release.

Van Hollen shared the news of the meeting in a social media post and said he would provide a full update when he returns to the U.S. He also met this week with human rights groups, local embassy staff members and top Salvadoran officials, including the country’s vice president.

A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected an effort by the Trump administration to put on hold the requirement that it facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release. In the unanimous ruling, the court said the administration was trying to carry out deportations to foreign prisons “without the semblance of due process.”

Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador and federal courts’ pushback to the Trump administration’s actions on deportations are part of a growing second-term resistance to Trump. Earlier this week, Harvard University refused to yield to a list of Trump demands. In response, the president said he will freeze billions of dollars in federal funding, and his administration threatened to stop foreign students from enrolling the Ivy League school.

Meanwhile in Montana, a crowd swelled for a rally at which Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vowed to “fight oligarchy” in the Trump administration. And across the country, Democratic leaders are getting a “massive earful” from their base over those upset with a lack of resistance to the administration’s actions, one person said.

While the actions are still far from a full-fledged revolt, Democrats are trying to harness anti-Trump energy as the party looks ahead to next year’s midterm elections. They’re seeing small-dollar donations ticking up, and state and Congressional elections are beginning to take shape. But angst within the party and disagreements about which issues to focus on could present some complications.

Florida State University shooting leaves 2 dead

The Florida State University community is reeling after a shooting at the Tallahassee campus left two people dead and at least six injured. The suspect in custody was identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, the son of a sheriff's deputy who is believed to be an FSU student, Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil said yesterday afternoon. One former classmate says Ikner harbored white supremacist views.

The gunman got out of an orange Hummer and opened fire near the student union just before noon. McKenzie Heeter, a junior at FSU, was outside the building when she said she saw a person “shoot in my direction” with a rifle. Heeter added, “I think he was shooting and he missed. So he goes back into his car and grabs a pistol, then he turns and shoots the lady in front of him. That’s when I just started running.”

The two people who died in the shooting were not FSU students, authorities said. The six injured victims were in fair condition, Tallahassee Memorial Hospital said last night. Here’s what else we know about the shooting.

Police said the suspected shooter has been hospitalized with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. A gun that was a former service weapon belonging to his mother was found on the scene. Here’s what else we know about the suspect.

U.S. 'will move on' from Ukraine peace efforts if no progress within days, Rubio warns

The U.S. may be ready to “move on” from its efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine if there is no clear progress in the coming days, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday.

“We’re not going to continue with this endeavor for weeks and months on end,” Rubio told reporters in Paris after a grueling day of talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials in Paris.

“We need to figure out here now, within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on,” he said, adding that President Donald Trump “feels very strongly about that.”

His comments came after Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister and economy minister said that Kyiv and Washington signed a memorandum that is expected to bring both sides closer to clinching a minerals deal that will allow the U.S. access to Ukraine’s rare earth mineral wealth.

Military insurance snafus disrupt care for pregnant women

Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. Around the same time, at least two medical providers told Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Both women were supposed to be covered by Tricare, the military’s health insurance program, which has been plagued by widespread disruptions after a change in contracts earlier this year. The disruptions have included canceled appointments, a shrinking network of doctors and snafus that have prevented service members and their families from accessing health care. New and expectant mothers have been caught in the chaos during a critical time.

Four women who recently faced issues with Tricare spoke to reporter Melissa Chan, describing feelings of stress, frustration and fear that have overshadowed their pregnancies. “I feel like the military acts like they’re very family-focused, but I feel pretty abandoned,” one said.

Staff Pick : The not-so-hot commodity in the NFL Draft

The NFL Draft is less than a week away, and for fans of any of the 32 teams, anything is possible.

I’ve been watching the draft since I was a kid — and when a family vacation took me away from the later rounds, I walked through the airport listening to coverage on the radio. And every year the biggest scuttlebutt is always about the quarterbacks, who play arguably the most important position in any major sport.

Last year’s run on quarterbacks — six in the first 12 picks — was historic, and teams got some serious bang for their buck. But this year’s crop hasn’t generated as much buzz. Here’s where things stand going into next week’s first round and what analysts have to say. — Ben Kamisar, national political reporter

The women were all supposed to be covered by the military’s health insurance program called Tricare — a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts that unleashed a cascade of unanticipated consequences.

Top leadership with both the Navy and Air Force have warned that the Tricare upheaval could create enormous problems for service members and their families, from canceled appointments and a shrinking network of doctors to snafus that prevent those who are insured from accessing necessary health care.

“That’s going to have detrimental effects to our family, to our family readiness and possibly to our military readiness,” Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea testified last week during a congressional hearing on quality-of-life issues for members of the military.

This chaos is particularly urgent and damaging for new and expectant mothers, when health experts say medical and mental health care is crucial. Four women who recently faced issues with Tricare that disrupted their medical care told NBC News that the stress overshadowed their excitement about their pregnancies. It has caused them to question a health system meant to take care of members of the military and their loved ones.

“It’s just so stressful,” said Simmons, who is four months pregnant. “I feel like the military acts like they’re very family-focused, but I feel pretty abandoned.”

The Defense Health Agency, which runs Tricare, said it could not comment on individual cases, citing federal privacy laws, and would not confirm whether the problems detailed by the women were caused by the larger Tricare disruptions.

“The uniformed service members and their families deserve the best health care available and anytime there is a shortfall of any kind we take it seriously and strive to correct it and reduce the chances of it happening in the future,” the agency said in a statement.

With little to no out-of-pocket costs depending on the plan, Tricare is billed as a major perk to those who join the armed forces, especially in the U.S., where the inability to pay for health care and medicine recently hit a new high, a recent survey found. Health care costs are only growing. In 2024, the national average annual health insurance premium for an individual was nearly $9,000, according to KFF, a nonprofit research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Military members who serve at least 20 years, or those who retire for medical reasons, can keep their coverage for life, and so can their spouses. Their children can also stay enrolled until age 21, or 23 if they attend college, said Eileen Huck, acting director of government relations for the National Military Family Association, which advocates for service members and their families.

Tricare serves about 9.5 million people, including active-duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees and their families. About a third are active-duty service members or their loved ones, according to the latest data.

In a March news release, Tricare extolled its maternity care benefits and its newly expanded childbirth and breastfeeding support services. In addition to routine doctor visits, ultrasounds and deliveries, Tricare also pays for unlimited doula care during birth, prenatal and postpartum physical therapy, breast pumps and even a third dental cleaning in a 12-month period.

“It is a very valuable benefit,” Huck said. “It is definitely an incentive to join the military and stay in the military, knowing that you and your family will have this health care coverage.”

Simmons, 30, her three young children and her husband, a Missouri Air National Guard member, have been covered for the last three years. She found out in mid-January that she was pregnant, and when she called to make a doctor’s appointment, she was told her OB-GYN couldn’t see her because of ongoing insurance negotiations.

Her concerns grew when her endocrinologist said the same thing, and the hospital where she was initially referred also wasn’t an option. She tried to find a provider she could see. Within 50 miles of her home, only one facility came up — a hospital where she used to work and where she said she and her family had negative experiences.

It was a big change from her previous pregnancy, when she had no trouble finding and booking appointments with in-network providers.

“I’m having to fight with insurance constantly and feeling literally like I have nowhere to go when there’s a problem,” Simmons said. “I almost feel like we don’t have insurance.”

She vented on BabyCenter, a pregnancy-support app with an online forum, and learned she was not alone. About 20 miles away in Lee’s Summit, Frazon wrote on the app that she was also frustrated by the health care system and heartbroken to lose her trusted doctor, too.

Frazon, 35, a heavy equipment operator with the Air National Guard, didn’t know that her OB-GYN had left the network until she arrived for her 20-week ultrasound in February, she told NBC News.

“That’s like the first one they do when you get to see the baby,” she said. “I was super excited about it.”

After two miscarriages, Frazon hoped the ultrasound, a scan of her baby’s anatomy that shows growth and development, would ease her nerves. But when she checked in for her appointment, she said the receptionist told her she’d have to pay out of pocket for the visit because the office no longer accepted Tricare. (The health care provider told NBC News it’s working to finalize an agreement with a new Tricare contractor.)

“I had to have them tell me multiple times because I wasn’t processing it,” Frazon said.

She chose not to pay out of pocket — or come back. She said it hurt to lose a physician she had built a five-year relationship with, who understood her health history and prior complications, but she could not afford the full costs.

Frazon said she called Tricare for a list of other providers within 30 miles.

“They gave me two,” she said. Frazon booked with one and had the scan done.

The Defense Health Agency outsources Tricare operations, relying on two companies to manage health care benefits in its two U.S. regions. Much of the wider trouble began Jan. 1, when a company called TriWest Healthcare Alliance took over West Coast management and took on six additional states that were once part of the East Coast region managed by a different contractor, Humana Military.

Tricare is honoring referrals made under the previous contractor through the end of June, the Defense Health Agency said in a statement. And providers, including hospitals that were considered in-network under the last contractor, are being treated as in-network until then.

The transition was a “huge undertaking,” but the Defense Health Agency said it took “painstaking steps” to limit potential interruptions.

The new contract was meant to “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries, the agency said.

That’s not what has happened. About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast went unpaid from December 2024 until at least March due to a data error, Humana said. That forced many to drop Tricare patients altogether, reduce their hours or even consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said beneficiaries have been struggling with long wait times at call centers and delays with processing new referrals for outpatient specialty care.

Humana said it fixed the data issue in March. TriWest referred questions to the Defense Health Agency.

Civilian providers are increasingly critical to Tricare’s network, after funding shortages reduced availability at military facilities. The longer the disruptions go on, the more concern grows that civilian providers may drop off, Honea, the senior Navy leader, said during his House testimony last week. The Defense Health Agency confirmed to NBC News that providers have left the West Coast region but would not say how many.

In the meantime, there’s been finger-pointing, with providers telling some of the pregnant women that Tricare issues were to blame and the Defense Health Agency saying some providers were failing to honor the referral waivers.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago. While officials still have not said what prompted the reversals, the couple said Tricare resolved the issue after NBC News published an article about their plight in March, ensuring they did not owe anything.

The disruptions meant that Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii.

When she went to a new medical center for prenatal care, she said she was told she didn’t have a referral on file and couldn’t be seen.

Harper said she repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution.

By early February, she was a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound. “I could feel her moving, so I knew she was OK generally, but I didn’t know what limbs she had,” she said. “It was very, very nerve-wracking.”

Desperate, she said she tried to see an Army OB-GYN at a military hospital. After 30 minutes of waiting, she said they told her to call her insurance. Harper said she stormed up to the hospital’s labor and delivery unit and burst into tears. “My emotions were everywhere,” she said.

She said providers there gave her an ultrasound and a referral to get further care off-base. She said she called a list of civilian physicians and took the first one who had an opening.

“It’s been very scary,” said Harper, who is due in mid-May.

Early and consistent health care during pregnancy is critical and can help prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus, according to Dr. Noha Ahmed, a resident OB-GYN at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C.

Each step matters, as does the timing. Blood tests done around 10 to 13 weeks of pregnancy can detect chromosomal abnormalities, while a 20-week anatomy scan, a major milestone, identifies whether the fetus and its organs are growing adequately, Ahmed said.

Around 25 weeks, a screening can determine risks for gestational diabetes. In the last trimester, Ahmed said, weekly visits are recommended.

“Pregnancy is not a benign condition. It takes a really big toll on the mother,” Ahmed said.

The Navy veteran from Indiana who found out that Tricare had dropped her after she gave birth had no problem enrolling last year in the maternity program run by Humana. In an email reviewed by NBC News, a case manager welcomed her to the program in September, when she was six months pregnant. She delivered the baby on Christmas Eve.

The health care was a bright spot in an otherwise troubling end to her service. She had retired from the military in 2017 because of post-traumatic stress disorder, developed after she said she was raped by another sailor. Her certificate of release from active duty, which NBC News reviewed, shows she was honorably separated under disability retirement — so she was eligible for Tricare.

“The one consolation I had walking away was at least I have my health care so I can start over,” the woman said. NBC News is withholding her name because she said she was a victim of sexual assault. “I feel robbed.”

In January, when she went to a local military office with her marriage certificate, separation papers and her baby’s birth certificate to add her newborn daughter as a dependent, she said she was told she was no longer eligible for insurance, over what she believes was a recordkeeping mistake.

She insisted she should get health care coverage; she had a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs, which NBC News reviewed, confirming she had a permanent disability connected with her military service.

Soon after, she said she got a call canceling her six-week postpartum appointment because the doctor’s office had been notified that she was uninsured.

She also had to cancel her mental health appointments to treat her postpartum depression and anxiety and begin to ration the medication she had left. She got what she thought was norovirus — vomiting, chills and fatigue — but didn’t see a doctor.

And she struggled with breastfeeding, as many new mothers do. Under Tricare she would have had access to breastfeeding counseling and a dozen other postpartum services.

“I feel like I have failed her,” she said of her baby girl. “This anxiety is worse than it had to be. It’s constant.”

Amid all this, Tricare sent a series of letters, which NBC News reviewed, requesting more than $15,700 in refunds from her medical providers for 66 claims from February 2024 until after she gave birth.

The letters said the providers were responsible for repaying Tricare, and “should there be a need for the beneficiary to make a payment, you will be contacted directly by your provider.” She’s waiting to hear if she’ll need to pay.

In its statement to NBC News, the Defense Health Agency suggested the veteran reach out to customer service.

But she’s long past that. She cobbled together temporary insurance for her baby under a separate Veterans Affairs program, and her husband’s regular enrollment period opened recently, allowing them all to get coverage under his civilian job. The benefits kicked in on April 1.

The first thing she did was book appointments: one for her baby’s four-month check-up, one to see about the painful lumps at her incision site, and another to address her deteriorating mental health.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250417-pregnant-women-military-insurance-tricare-cover-se-219a-08b126.jpg",N,-1.0,2025-04-18 05:56:27.335039

Military Families Feel Financial Burden Military families from every branch have shared their growing concerns about the rising financial burden of maintaining healthcare coverage for their young adult dependents.
Many families have shared that the high cost of TRICARE Young Adult forces them into a difficult waiting game—hoping their child will become eligible for their own employer-based insurance.
A Cost Too High TRICARE Young Adult isn’t just expensive—it’s out of reach for many.
Each story is a stark reminder that military families deserve better and, at the very least, have better plan options.","Milestones are a part of the military family journey. We see service member promotions, military spouse achievements, and kindergarten and high school graduations—and for those with young adult dependents, we may also see college graduation! What should be a time of joy can quickly shift to concern when families realize that health coverage for their graduates may be interrupted.

Regular TRICARE plans cover young adult dependents only until age 21 or up to age 23 if they’re enrolled in college, with coverage ending on their graduation date. After age 23 and through age 26, maintaining TRICARE coverage beyond that point requires families to enroll their young adult dependent into TRICARE Young Adult (TYA), a premium-based health plan.

However, costs for TYA have skyrocketed over the last decade. Similar to regular TRICARE coverage, there are two plan options: TYA Prime and TYA Select. In 2025, TYA Select carries a premium of $337 per month, while TYA Prime’s monthly premium is currently $727 a month per young adult dependent—a staggering 250% increase since 2015!

The cost of TYA premiums is per dependent, which many families feel is unsustainable. One Air Force retiree detailed this exact scenario and said, “Both of our kids are in college. They can’t afford $337/month each. But because they both work to help pay for school, they don’t qualify for assistance like ‘BadgerCare’ [Wisconsin Medicaid]”.

Military Families Feel Financial Burden

Military families from every branch have shared their growing concerns about the rising financial burden of maintaining healthcare coverage for their young adult dependents. Their stories reflect deep frustration and a strong sense of unfairness—especially when compared to civilian families, whose children can stay on health plans until age 26 without any additional cost.

Many families have shared that the high cost of TRICARE Young Adult forces them into a difficult waiting game—hoping their child will become eligible for their own employer-based insurance. In the meantime, they’re left straining their own finances or scrambling to find alternative coverage.

“My son was on the five-year plan for college and turned 23 in December before graduating in May last year. We had to pick up TYA for the remaining six months and then more while he waited for job-based insurance.” — Army spouse

“We had to switch off TRICARE to private insurance to keep our son on (who was still in college for his master’s degree) because he aged out. Now that he’s graduated, he’s still eligible to remain on our private insurance, and we’re keeping him on to give him a little saving money before he starts paying for insurance himself. I’d rather be on TRICARE, but we’ll be in the same boat in 2 years with our youngest. —Army spouse

Their message is clear: TRICARE’s age requirements for coverage is an undue burden for military families.

A Cost Too High

TRICARE Young Adult isn’t just expensive—it’s out of reach for many.

“It’s a hardship on the parents who have to pay out of pocket.” — Marine spouse

“We need something better than TYA. Paying almost $800/month per child is not helpful.” — Military retiree

“Our son just graduated and is a full-time graduate student. We had to find other coverage because he’ll be 23 soon, and we can’t afford TRICARE prices.” — Army spouse

These are the lived experiences of families who have already sacrificed so much in service. Each story is a stark reminder that military families deserve better and, at the very least, have better plan options.

We’re Amplifying These Voices on Capitol Hill

NMFA continues to support legislation that would align TRICARE coverage with civilian plans and extend dependent coverage until age 26 without additional costs.

This isn’t just about policy—it’s about fairness, stability, and peace of mind for families who have earned it.

We’ve shared these stories in Congressional briefings, through advocacy campaigns, and in direct conversations with lawmakers. But your voices are our most powerful tool.

It’s time for TRICARE to align with civilian healthcare standards by extending coverage for young adult dependents through age 26. Our military-connected families should not be forced to shoulder additional healthcare costs simply because of their service. They deserve the same peace of mind and support afforded to their civilian peers.

Together we’re stronger®.",https://www.militaryfamily.org/wp-content/uploads/FA-SEO-TRICARE-YA-1.png,N,-1.0,2025-04-17 23:56:22.643275

She described the gaps that can exist in veterans' medical coverage and how Medicaid can provide a safety net.
He takes care of veterans with disabilities and veterans who have been injured during service.
The Institute found that over 47,000 veterans access health coverage through Medicaid, including nearly one in 13 veterans in Virginia.
In a statement to 13News Now, Wittman said: “No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid.","HAMPTON, Va. — ""When a veteran reaches out their hand for support, oftentimes the only hand that's extended is Medicaid.""

Virginia Delegate Jackie Glass is a Navy veteran, and she said the safety net provided by Medicaid is critical for veterans.

""The thing about service is there's a level of certainty with it. You join, you know that you're serving, you're going to be taken care of. You've gotten to a better place where you get out, you feel a high level of certainty on most things. What we're seeing now puts so much uncertainty in the eyes of people who I know have seen much worse, and it's heartbreaking,"" Glass said.

She described the gaps that can exist in veterans' medical coverage and how Medicaid can provide a safety net.

""The VA doesn't fill all the gaps, and quite frankly, not a lot of veterans choose to use the VA. Not a lot of veterans have access to Tricare in the way that I'm fortunate to have access to, so they stop getting prescription meds, they stop getting the care that they're seeking. It is life or death for some folks, so you go broke trying to stay healthy.""

Glass was one of six members of Thursday's roundtable discussion in Hampton discussing these issues.

Tony Hedgepeth is a veteran and member of SEIU Virginia 512, as well as a Medicaid-funded home care provider. He takes care of veterans with disabilities and veterans who have been injured during service.

""When we hurt, we hurt. When we start taking away some of the fundamental things that we're promised, we hurt,"" said Hedgepeth, ""People have been injured, they need their equipment, they need their ongoing care, and if you're denied that, what's left of them? What are their options? That's what we're here to combat.""

Freddy Mejia from The Commonwealth Institute joined the roundtable as well, providing data from a new report unveiling the impact of potential cuts to Medicaid on veterans and military families. Mejia reported that over 56,000 individuals -- including active duty members, some veterans, and their families -- are dually enrolled in Tricare and Medicaid. He said Tricare has some limitations in terms of what they provide, including children who need home and community-based services.

Medicaid is able to pick up where Tricare ends. The Institute found that over 47,000 veterans access health coverage through Medicaid, including nearly one in 13 veterans in Virginia.

Mejia said these individuals may be in the ""sandwich generation"" taking care of their parents and young children, and if any cuts to Medicaid happens, those individuals would lose coverage.

Speaking before the roundtable began, Congressman Bobby Scott (D, VA-03) said the Energy and Commerce Committee is tasked with finding $880 billion in cuts under the most recent budget resolution. Medicaid is one of the programs included under the Energy and Commerce jurisdiction.

""Technically, it doesn't mention Medicaid, but the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) points out there aren't $880 billion worth of programs in the Energy and Commerce jurisdiction without going deeply into Medicaid,"" Scott said.

This comes days after Scott's fellow Virginia representatives, Jen Kiggans and Rob Wittman, joined nine other Republican colleagues in advocating to preserve Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations as Congress considers budget reconciliation legislation.

In a statement to 13News Now, Wittman said:

“No one has proposed or voted on cuts to Medicaid. Medicaid is an indispensable lifeline for our nation’s most vulnerable, including people with disabilities, seniors, and expectant mothers. That’s why we must act now to strengthen the program. To preserve Medicaid, we need to focus on rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse within the system. This issue is personal for me since I was adopted at 8 months old out of Children's Home Society of Virginia in Richmond. My birth mother’s choice to put me up for adoption gave me more opportunities than she felt she could provide. I want to fix our broken Medicaid system so we can ensure vulnerable members like my birth mother get the care they need.”

Asked about the coalition, Scott said, ""This letter on Medicaid suggests that they're not going to vote for Medicaid cuts. Unfortunately, that's not the case. If you read the letter, they say they're not going to cut Medicaid for 'vulnerable populations' or this population or that population. But it doesn't rule out cuts in Medicaid.""

Scott went on to say about the letter from 11 Republican lawmakers: ""The fact of the matter is they voted twice to cut Medicaid because we had the budget framework. CBO said it guaranteed that Medicaid would have to get cut. We'll have to see as the budget goes on what the numbers are on line items, but the CBO said the budget framework requires massive cuts on Medicaid.""",https://media.13newsnow.com/assets/WVEC/images/697e478d-5339-42b4-b8c8-fa58914a02c6/697e478d-5339-42b4-b8c8-fa58914a02c6_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 19:56:23.905884

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Or have a commute that is more than 30 minutes from your primary care physician? As a part of the new contracts, in light of the TriWest Healthcare Alliance takeover, TRICARE is making it easier for you to keep your TRICARE Prime coverage. While a patient’s distance from military hospitals or clinics used to require waivers if they had a Prime plan, there is no longer a restriction, and most families can continue to see their PCM.

TRICARE Prime Travel Restrictions Lifted

TRICARE Prime patients no longer need a waiver to keep their coverage and receive care at a military hospital or clinic that doesn’t fit the traditional distance requirements.

Under the new TRICARE contracts, beneficiaries can keep their current primary care manager (PCM) or can choose to change. Patients who move to a location outside that access standard for primary care can choose to receive their care at a DoD facility, or they can keep their primary care manager without having to secure a waiver.

To help everyone transition, TRICARE is providing letters to those affected with the details and steps to switch if they choose that option.

""This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs,"" said DHA management and program analyst Shane Pham.

Why TRICARE Prime Is Changing

This change comes about under the new management contracts that TRICARE continues to navigate.

The DoD is working to get more military families into military hospitals and clinics as private healthcare facilities continue to gain ground in the market.

While many are pushing for more choice and options involving the private healthcare sector, the VA still needs to maintain enough patients to remain a viable option for military families.

According to a DoD memo in 2023, the goal is to increase the patients going to military healthcare facilities to 3.3 million by 2027, which would be a 7% increase.

“The last thing that a family or that service member needs is to be worried about whether their family is getting adequate or high-quality care,” said Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara.

Increasing Patient Satisfaction

TRICARE has been paying attention to what patients feel with these moves, as the data collected from satisfaction surveys have shown that many are willing to keep their primary care doctors, even if they have to drive over 30 minutes to do so, but have no desire to switch physicians.

Therefore, the TRICARE Prime change will allow beneficiaries who live over 30 minutes from their principal care management to continue their coverage.

Adult patients who are on the Prime coverage will be contacted by a TRICARE regional contract and offered options to continue their healthcare plan. According to the Defense Health Agency, beneficiaries who meet the criteria will receive a letter notifying them that their homes are outside of the coverage range.

If they don't respond to the letter, they will remain with their current primary care managers at their military treatment facility.

Actions TRICARE Prime Beneficiaries Need to Take

If a TRICARE Prime beneficiary moves more than 30 minutes from their PCM, their TRICARE regional contract will contact all adult patients in the houshold via phone, email, mail, or text, explaining options for continuing health coverage.

For those with a TRICARE Prime plan, you’ll have 90 days to decide what you want to do. While you aren’t required to move on from Prime, there is still an option to choose coverage under TRICARE Select or the U.S. Family Health Program, provided it’s available near you.

Failure to do so for patients who have moved over 100 miles from their TRICARE Prime Service Area will result in losing coverage. Furthermore, if you go to a military hospital or clinic, you can only receive care if there’s space.

It’s also important to make sure that your personal info in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) is up to date and accurate for the DoD.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella.
This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.","You may have heard about the ongoing measles outbreak in the U.S. As of April 10, there have been 712 confirmed cases in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

MHS civilians earned first place in eight categories, with Douglas Stutz at Naval Hospital Bremerton taking first for best information story about U.S. Navy Lt. Jane W. Njenga ensuring forces are medically ready when facing tropical diseases.

“We’ve had the honor to cover less-than-ideal subjects which still needed to be shared, including suicide and remembering loss on Memorial Day. Njenga’s commitment in the Military Tropical Medical Program offered us the opportunity to share how investing the time and effort can help save lives in future conflicts,” said Stutz.

When asked what drove him to enter the competition, Stutz said, “We submitted content to help highlight and hopefully increase focus on our valued Navy Medicine team of Navy Medical Corps, Medical Service Corps, Nurse Corps, Dental Corps, and especially our enlisted Hospital Corps and our support staff. Every one of them is a subject matter expert. They may not openly realize it, but we believe that each of our staff has a tremendous amount of value and insight to tap into, helping to share who, what, where, when, and why we do our work.”

Additional winners included Bernard Little from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who won the prestigious Civilian Writer of the Year award, while Jorge Gomez from Irwin Army Community Hospital was named Civilian Videographer of the Year.

“I’m honored to have been recognized as the Civilian Writer of the Year among a very talented group of writers,” said Little. “I want people to know that the staff and care at Walter Reed is second to none. I want people to read the stories that I write and consider coming to Walter Reed for their care if they don’t. For those who do, I want them to feel pleased they are receiving their care here and continue to receive their care here, feeling secure and confident that they are receiving the best care anywhere.”

Brandon Henry from the Uniformed Services University won two top prizes—first place in both animation and multimedia product categories. Thomas Balfour, also from USU, won first place for his featured photo.

The university is no stranger to these achievements. “We’re very proud of the incredible talent we have here at USU,” said Sharon Holland, acting vice president for external affairs and director of alumni affairs. “Our writers, graphic designers, photographers, and multimedia staff have consistently been recognized for their work, either at the local level, the MHS level, the Department of Defense level, and sometimes all three. We’re thrilled to be part of a community that values excellence in telling the military health story.”

In similar categories, Thomas Cieslak from Naval Health Clinic Cherry Point won first in photojournalism, and Justin Moeller from Blanchfield Army Community Hospital took first in the picture story category.

Not only did MHS lead the competition with the most first-place wins, MHS secured the most second and third place finishes of any agency.

Honoring Creativity and Impact While Advancing Mission Readiness

The awards recognize communications professionals for more than just the quality of their products. They are honored for their role in advancing warfighter readiness and telling the military health story in creative, meaningful ways, said Richard H. Breen Jr., director of communications and public affairs for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs and the Military Health System. “The work of the MHS is beyond health care–it’s about ensuring that every service member is fit to fight, that our medical teams are trained and ready, and that our families receive the care they deserve. The awards capture the essence of this mission in one article, frame, photo, or video.”

“Winning or placing in any category at the DMMA is a testament to the MHS team’s creativity, precision, and ability to translate complex health topics into messages that resonate across the force,” said Derik W. Crotts, communication strategist with the MHS. “Their work directly supports warfighter readiness by ensuring the right information reaches the right people at the right time.”

Karen Roberts, director of the Defense Health Agency Director’s Communications and Public Affairs Division, agrees. “These communicators represent DHA’s deep well of talent and the commitment shared by all of our communication professionals who work hard to highlight the high-quality health care our military hospitals and clinics deliver to millions of service members, retirees, and their families,” she said.

All winners will advance to the Department of Defense Media Awards competition later this year. Visit Defense Media Activity for more information.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2412/8819337/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-04-17 15:56:24.206160

On Feb. 18, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order with the intention of lowering costs and reducing barriers to in vitro fertilization. The order gives resources to military families who currently face the crippling costs of infertility treatments that go uncovered by TRICARE insurance.

The executive order requires the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy to submit a list to the president within 90 days consisting of policy recommendations on protecting IVF access and reducing out-of-pocket and health plan costs for IVF treatment.

“My Administration recognizes the importance of family formation, and as a Nation, our public policy must make it easier for loving and longing mothers and fathers to have children,” the order states. “Therefore, to support American families, it is the policy of my Administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable.”

Julie Eshelman, founder of Building Military Families Network, thinks the executive order is a positive first step that will hopefully lead to a broader range of options for military families struggling to conceive.

“We’re making progress,” Eshelman said. “I definitely don’t think it goes far enough because it’s just an executive order. But we’re thrilled that this is something he is considering. We’re making these incremental steps toward the end goal.”

Eshelman started Building Military Families Network after she and her husband, Andrew, a major in the Active Guard Reserve assigned to the James Madison University Army ROTC program, experienced infertility. They learned firsthand the financial and logistical barriers American families face when pursuing IVF treatment, suffering multiple miscarriages while paying tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket. The Eshelmans were finally successful after years of struggle when Julie gave birth to their daughter, Millie, in 2021.

Like most American health insurance, TRICARE does not cover the cost of IVF unless infertility is due to a service-connected injury or illness. Service members and their families receive coverage for diagnostics and treatment of injury or illness of the reproductive system, as well as diagnostic services for causes of infertility such as semen analysis, hormone evaluation and chromosomal studies. But IVF can cost between $15,000 and $30,000 for a single cycle, and most people require multiple cycles due to inconsistent success rates.

Eshelman, who won the Fort Leavenworth Military Spouse of the Year award in 2022, is optimistic that even if Trump’s executive order doesn’t result in immediate change, progress may be imminent on the legislative front. A bill mandating TRICARE coverage for IVF had bipartisan support in both houses of Congress last year but did not make it into the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act.

“That was a little bit of a heartbreak because we got so close,” Eshelman said. But she believes the country is on the precipice of real change in regard to infertility treatment coverage. “It is a marathon, and we’re in it for the long haul to try and get this done.”",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_9829-2-scaled.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-04-17 14:56:19.259128

What Happened?

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue “shortfall” in the quarter “due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex’s stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

What Is The Lawsuit About?

The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

If you purchased or otherwise acquired Zynex securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than May 19, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Cmdr.
Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.
“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said.
“I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said.
Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families.

“Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco.

“I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer.

“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment.

“We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations.

“The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes.

“We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration.

“The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Preventing Disease and the Spread of Infection

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington.

“Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology.

“We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project.

“Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases.

“We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed.

“Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork.

“The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms.

“I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success.""

Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

Beneficiaries who live within 100 miles of a military hospital or clinic but at least 30 minutes away by car no longer need to request a waiver to stay with Tricare Prime, the Defense Department's managed-care health program.

Under the next-generation Tricare contracts that went into effect Jan. 1, patients who move to a location outside that access standard for primary care can choose to receive care at the DoD facility or, if they already receive care there, keep their primary care manager without seeking a waiver.

According to the Defense Health Agency, beneficiaries who meet the criteria will receive a letter notifying them that their homes are outside the access-standard measure, but if they don't respond, they will remain with their current primary care managers, or PCMs, at their military treatment facility.

[TELL MOAA: Have You Faced TRICARE Access Barriers?]

Those who want to change primary care managers, however, can do so by following instructions in the letter.

""This new approach will help prevent unnecessary coverage gaps and ensure families keep access to their PCMs,"" said Shane Pham, a DHA management and program analyst, in a news release last week.

The change was among the requirements of the new contracts, known as T-5, which were issued to TriWest Healthcare Alliance in the Tricare West Region and Humana Military in the Tricare East Region on Jan. 1.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

The allowance also coincides with an effort at the Defense Department to bring family members and military retirees back into military hospitals and clinics to ensure that the facilities have enough patients to maintain provider proficiency and curb the rising costs of private-sector care.

According to a memo issued Dec. 6, 2023, by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, the DoD hopes to increase the number of patients seen at military treatment facilities by 7% by the end of 2026, or a total of 3.3 million patients.

In a speech to uniformed and civilian federal health officials in March, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara said the DoD is pursuing the efforts in order to create a high-functioning medical system.

""The last thing that a family or that service member needs is to be worried about whether their family is getting adequate or high-quality care,"" Ferrara said.

According to Tricare officials, the decision to drop the drive time waiver was made based on patient satisfaction surveys showing that many beneficiaries are willing to drive more than 30 minutes to keep their primary care doctors and would prefer not to switch physicians.

If a Tricare Prime beneficiary moves more than 30 minutes from their PCM, their Tricare regional contract will contact all adult patients in the household by phone, text, mail and email to provide options for continuing their health coverage.

Patients will have 90 days to decide what to do. If they now live more than 30 minutes but less than 100 miles away, they won't have to do anything to keep their Tricare Prime coverage and primary care manager. Or they can switch health plans -- to Tricare Select or the U.S. Family Health Program, if it is available in their region.

If patients have moved more than 100 miles away from a Tricare Prime Service Area, they must decide within 90 days to switch to another plan. They will be dropped from Tricare Prime after 90 days and will be able to be seen at a military hospital or clinic only if space is available.

Defense Health Agency officials urge all beneficiaries to ensure that their addresses are updated in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS, and they also should check the email addresses and phone numbers the DoD has on file for accuracy.

Since the contract changeover Jan. 1, Tricare providers and patients have experienced disruptions to patient care and payments, resulting in patients having to switch providers or delay care and prompting providers to take out loans to pay staff while they wait for reimbursements.

The problems have caught the eye of lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as military leadership, including the services' top enlisted leaders.

During a hearing last week before the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees military construction, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy James Honea said he personally has received complaints from providers about the reimbursement delays.

""The Defense Health Agency to their credit has worked diligently with me, with the contract, to have those bills paid as quickly as possible. But as we are continuing through this transformation, we are finding more and more places that we are challenged [to find] health care providers,"" Honea said.

Last month, Republican Reps. John Rutherford and Aaron Bean of Florida wrote to David Smith, the acting DHA director, asking him to explain the delays and fix them.

""It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical care coverage. This crisis must be immediately rectified,"" they wrote.",https://insurancenewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/inn-social-default.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 11:56:42.187886

I have written the president, Elon Musk, and the head of Veterans Administration and given them my recommendations for improving VA. VA should not be in the mortgage business. Military personnel should be able to get a form from their command or issued along with their discharge certificate which they can take to any mortgage lender.

Education benefits should be managed by the states and the schools participating in the program.

Expand vets' access to local medical professionals, the same ones which provide medical coverage to military retirees under Tricare, so they don't have to travel any distance to a VA facility or wait because VA is understaffed.

Only one government agency should negotiate with drug manufacturers, not several like Tricare, VA, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. VA's list of meds is often incomplete.

VA clinics and hospitals should be for military-specific issues like PTSD, prostheses, etc. Frequently the specialists a vet is seeing at a VA facility are not VA docs, but those from a local university or major health-care provider in the community. Most VA clinics do not have specialists, usually just generalists, therefore requiring the vet to be referred elsewhere and often out of the immediate area.

The entire system needs to be reviewed.

Narcissistic king's tale

Imagine this bedtime story: There once was an arrogant narcissistic king who believed the country in which he lived treated him unfairly. Unjustly. He became so very mad that the trajectory of his life became a narcissistic bullet-ride straight to punish all who lived in The Land.

The king first concocted the most beautiful set of words the world would ever know or speak. Then he gathered groups of men and women who rejoiced and glowed in his shadow and basked in his privilege, money and power so they could learn how to use those beautiful words, say them, believe them. And they did.

Soon, millions and millions of people of all colors and in all walks of life went forth spreading those beautiful words--words that didn't have to have meaning or truth as long as they spread like covid and like incurable cancer, hid fact from fiction and truth from lies.

After a short time had passed the king sensed he had a full sovereign buy-in and that it was time to inflict punishment upon the Land. In one big breath, he tugged at the string that held his plan together. The markets and all that was attached came loose.

Throwing back his head, the king spoke out loud: ""So what!""

Betraying their oath

Where are Sen. Tom Cotton, Sen. John Boozman, and Rep. French Hill? The Trump regime is making every Arkansan less safe every day. The regime is thumbing its nose at the rule of law. Our allies are treated like enemies, and dictators who threaten freedom everywhere are being given whatever they want. Public health and science are being devastated. The Department of Justice is Trump's tool of vengeance.

The civil rights of everyone who is not white, Christian, male and straight are disappearing. Immigrants, and even citizens, who have committed no crimes are being detained and deported without due process.

Our elected legislators have sworn to uphold the Constitution and protect the fundamental rights of every person. But they are silent. They are complicit. They are too afraid of us to even show up at a town hall and listen to the people who elected them.

They work for us, but they are doing nothing to protect us. They are betraying us and their oath of office.

Senator Boozman, Senator Cotton, Congressman Hill: Do your jobs!

More than medicine

As a pharmacist at Econo-Mart Pharmacy in Batesville, I appreciated Nicki Hilliard's message in Sunday's Perspective section, which reminded Arkansans of all the essential services pharmacists can provide.

As a new mom, I understand how scary it is to deliver a baby in Arkansas (the state with the second-highest infant mortality rate in the country and one of the lowest maternal health standings in the country).

Fortunately, as a pharmacist, I am in a fantastic position to help other mothers in the state navigate the process of having and caring for their babies and themselves through pregnancy, family planning and beyond.

In small rural towns like mine, where specialized health care can be hours away, your neighborhood pharmacy can be the most accessible point of care. We're not just the folks who fill your prescriptions. We're helping pregnant women navigate which medicines are safe, answering calls from new parents with questions, consulting on contraceptive options, and giving vaccines to whole families. We're here to offer guidance, listen, and look out for the well-being of our community.

Pharmacists in Arkansas are trained and ready to help combat the maternal health crisis in our state. We can check blood pressure, screen for postpartum depression, consult on and prescribe birth control, and more. We're here to support moms and families.

I want my fellow small-town Arkansans to help spread the word and make sure everyone knows that their local pharmacist is more than just a friendly face behind the counter--we can be part of the solution to a healthier community with healthier women, moms and babies. Pharmacists across Arkansas are ready to help turn our maternal health stats around, one conversation, one screening and one patient at a time.

Kageleiry said that he has seen civilian employees receive test kits at military facilities.","KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany — Defense Department civilian employees and contractors abroad can no longer get rape test kits done at military medical facilities, a decision that attorneys say will likely make it easier to get some evidentiary exhibits levied against accused service members excluded at court-martial.

The Military Health System said the recently issued guidance is meant to clear up confusion around who can receive the forensic evidence collection tests under existing policy.

It requires non-Tricare beneficiaries, which would include most civilian workers who aren’t married to service members, to seek testing at foreign clinics, which may have different standards for processing evidence.

The March 13 memo from the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs states that military health care providers only can treat civilians who say they were sexually assaulted in emergency situations — where life, limb or eyesight are put at risk.

“Forensic healthcare examination or follow-up care is not included in the definition on limited emergency services,” the memo states.

The memo also says military facilities must establish a process that ensures non-Tricare beneficiaries are stabilized and transferred to a civilian facility should they request a forensic exam.

Regardless of eligibility, patients who seek care at military facilities after interpersonal violence should be treated as emergencies, the memo said.

About 35,000 civilian employees support 172,000 active-duty service members stationed overseas, according to Defense Department data from December 2024, with the largest civilian populations living in Germany, Japan and South Korea.

Proper evidence collection can be an important part of a victim’s legal argument in the event they accuse a service member of sexual assault and the case leads to a court-martial.

The U.S. military has detailed protocols for the handling of evidence after an assault allegation, including rules about the chain of custody. Outside the military, collection methods vary by country.

A foreign test kit may be easier to discredit in court compared with one collected on a U.S. base, said retired Lt. Col. Will Helixon, a former special victims prosecutor who now works as a civilian military defense lawyer in Wiesbaden, Germany.

“Any skilled defense lawyer is going to be able to ask the questions that would exclude a lot of that evidence,” Helixon said in an interview.

Some nations, particularly in parts of the Middle East and Africa, also view the concept of sexual assault very differently, which can dissuade victims from seeking help off base.

Defense Department employees already face challenges when it comes to accessing health care in their host nations.

Medical facilities overseas offer limited care for those who aren’t active-duty service members, providing care for a fee depending on capacity. Services offered can vary vastly from month to month.

In Japan, DOD-affiliated civilians and families cite language barriers, complex billing and differences in approach to care as common hurdles, according to a recent report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

Pete Kageleiry Jr., a retired lieutenant colonel and former judge advocate who now works as a private military defense lawyer in Virginia, said the memo raises questions about the reliability of evidence.

Kageleiry said that he has seen civilian employees receive test kits at military facilities. The memo is a step backward compared to recent improvements the military has made to its handling of sexual assault, and it’s likely to impact overseas cases, he said.

“I know from experience that these cases arise in every environment, like a contingency operation,” Kageleiry said. “There’s civilians with the force everywhere.”

Peter Graves, a spokesperson for the Military Health System, said forensic evidence collection policies were developed for the treatment of service members and their dependents, and do not include testing for people who are not insured by Tricare.

“There are significant gaps in policy and processes that contribute to risk, revictimization, and confusion when persons from outside the system present to (military health facilities) after a sexual assault,” Graves said in a statement. “This is compounded in overseas locations where host nations may not provide or recognize (sexual assault forensic exams).”

“The Department will continue to explore potential policy changes that mitigate risks associated with providing (such exams) to these persons,” Graves said.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/nvdb4r-180425testkitsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/180425TESTKITSphoto01.jpg,N,0.0,2025-04-17 09:56:52.529416

NEW YORK, April 16, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP , a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (“Zynex” or the“Company”) (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See .

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled“How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” The report claimed Zynex engaged in an“oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to“bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were“kicking the company out of network.”

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue“shortfall” in the quarter“due to slower than normal payments from certain payers.” Zynex further revealed“Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Zynex's conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

On Monday, April 14, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) convened the first meeting of the Protect Access to Health Care Act Stakeholder Advisory Committee, responsible for advising DHCS on developing and implementing components of Proposition 35.

The California Medical Association (CMA) co-chaired the coalition that put Prop. 35 before the voters in November 2024. The initiative provides a dedicated, ongoing source of funding to increase access to health care and increase Medi-Cal reimbursement rates.

During the first advisory committee meeting, Linnea Koopmans, Chief Executive Officer of Local Health Plans of California – and a key member of the Prop. 35 coalition – was elected chair of the committee.

Though Prop. 35 was overwhelmingly supported by voters this past November, the state has been slow to begin implementation.

“After three years of work, it’s incredibly rewarding to see Prop. 35 moving from concept to implementation,” said CMA Chief of Staff Janice Rocco, who testified during the meeting. “Our priority now is to act swiftly—so we can get the 2025 dollars flowing and begin delivering on the promise of meaningful payment reform.”

While this first meeting was largely procedural, the committee has committed to holding its next meeting in May. CMA will remain engaged to ensure physician payment updates are implemented without further delay to make access to care a reality for California’s 15 million Medi-Cal enrollees.

Facts and Stats on Suboxone and Drug Addiction in Middle Tennessee

Facts and Stats on Suboxone and Drug Addiction in Middle Tennessee

Suboxone use statistics in Middle Tennessee reveal both progress and ongoing challenges in the fight against opioid addiction. As of 2023, Tennessee had a buprenorphine dispensing rate of 10.4 per 100 people, with 131 treatment facilities prescribing Suboxone or similar medications.

Despite 1,007 certified providers for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD), the state faced an estimated 70,000 people affected by OUD, creating a significant treatment gap. In 2016, 67 deaths were linked to buprenorphine, highlighting the need for careful oversight. However, a 2019 JAMA study showed nearly 75% of adults using buprenorphine took it as prescribed. These figures suggest that while Suboxone is widely used and often safely managed, access to care remains a major issue across Middle Tennessee.

Why Suboxone Is Commonly Used in Recovery Programs

Suboxone is commonly used in recovery programs because it eases opioid withdrawal symptoms and reduces cravings, making it easier for you to focus on healing. It’s typically prescribed and used under the close supervision of a medical expert to ensure it’s safe and effective.

Why Suboxone Works for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) Recovery

Suboxone effectively treats Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) because it helps you manage withdrawal symptoms, reduce cravings, and support long-term recovery. By combining buprenorphine and naloxone, Suboxone promotes wellness, minimizes symptoms, and decreases the risk of overdose. Below, we’ll explore how Suboxone supports these essential aspects of recovery.

Minimizes Symptoms During Detox and Recovery

Minimizes Symptoms During Detox and Recovery

Suboxone minimizes symptoms during detoxification and recovery by helping to ease withdrawal. It stabilizes your brain chemistry, reducing cravings and discomfort.

By minimizing these challenges, Suboxone increases your chances of staying on track during your recovery.

Promotes Wellness and Daily Functioning

Promotes Wellness and Daily Functioning

Suboxone promotes wellness and daily functioning by stabilizing your physical and mental health. It balances your brain’s chemistry, allowing you to focus on rebuilding your life.

Decreases Risk of Overdose in Opioid Recovery

Decreases Risk of Overdose in Opioid Recovery

Suboxone decreases the risk of overdose during opioid recovery by preventing the misuse of opioids. The naloxone component in Suboxone blocks the effects of any opioids you might try to misuse, while the buprenorphine helps reduce cravings and withdrawal. This combination reduces the likelihood of relapse and overdose, making it a safer option for your recovery.

Statistics Into Suboxone Use in Tennessee

Statistics Into Suboxone Use in Tennessee

According to SAMHSA, in Tennessee, 131 substance use treatment facilities prescribe Suboxone or other medications combining buprenorphine with naloxone.

In 2023, the buprenorphine dispensing rate in Tennessee was 10.4 per 100 people, according to the CDC.

The Tennessee Department of Health found 67 deaths associated with buprenorphine in 2016.

A 2019 study published in JAMA revealed nearly 75% of U.S. adults who used buprenorphine in the past year followed their prescriptions as directed.

Dismal Q4 Results Prompts Multiple Downgrades

On April 15, 2025, RBC Capital Markets reportedly further reduced its price target for Zynex stock to $5 per share. This marks the second downward revision in as many months and represents a significant erosion from RBC’s initial $11 per share target, effectively cutting its valuation outlook by approximately 55%.

The latest adjustment from RBC Capital analyst Shagun Singh follows a disappointing fourth-quarter 2024 earnings report on March 11 that revealed a year-over-year revenue decline of approximately 2%, landing at $46.0 million. The company also swung to a net loss of $0.02 per share, a stark contrast to the $0.04 profit reported in the same period a year prior, despite a stable gross profit margin of 78%.

Singh, who also downgraded Zynex's rating to ""Sector Perform"" from ""Outperform"" last month, cited a lack of clarity surrounding the company's operational and commercial prospects following the recent financial disclosure.

A significant factor weighing on Zynex is the temporary suspension of payments from Tricare, its largest customer, as the insurer conducts a review of past claims. The company has also declined to provide financial guidance for the current year and has initiated a workforce reduction of roughly 15%. Singh previously flagged the potential for a ""domino effect"" stemming from the Tricare situation, further eroding investor confidence.

The payment woes with Tricare appear to be intertwined with more serious allegations leveled against Zynex in a newly filed securities class action.

Zynex Securities Class Action Alleges ""Oversupplying"" Scheme

The securities class action lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleges that Zynex engaged in a practice of ""oversupplying"" customers with products, notably electrodes, which purportedly inflated revenue figures. The complaint contends that this practice drew the scrutiny of insurers, including Tricare, and that Zynex failed to adequately disclose the potential for adverse consequences such as network exclusions and potential government penalties. The class action seeks to represent investors who purchased Zynex securities between March 13, 2023, and March 11, 2025.

The truth allegedly began to emerge through a June 4, 2024 report by the medical journal STAAT, which detailed an alleged ""oversupplying scheme"" involving excessive shipments and inflated billing. The report also indicated that insurers were moving to exclude Zynex from their networks.

The lawsuit then points to Zynex's March 11, 2025, announcement of its weak fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results as the moment the alleged truth was revealed. During the earnings call, Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard attributed the revenue shortfall to ""slower than normal payments from certain payers"" and the Tricare payment suspension.

Hagens Berman’s Investigation

Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims. “The recent developments, including the lowered outlook and the specifics of the class action, underscore the serious concerns surrounding Zynex's disclosures. Our investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for any potential wrongdoing that may have harmed investors,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

What to Expect in an Inpatient Military Mental Health Program While no two programs are the same, most inpatient military mental health treatment centers follow a structured, evidence-based approach.
The Long-Term Benefits of Inpatient Treatment While inpatient treatment is intensive the benefits can be life-changing.
Inpatient military mental health treatment offers a way to heal that acknowledges the experiences of service members and veterans.
Tricare Rehabs can help you find inpatient mental health treatment programs that will give military personnel a sense of security in their recovery.","Inpatient mental health treatment means 24/7 care in a structured, hospital-like or residential environment. For military personnel these programs are designed with their unique experiences, traumas and culture in mind. Unlike outpatient care where you can go home after therapy sessions, inpatient care provides round the clock monitoring, medical supervision and a focused healing environment.

This type of care is recommended for those experiencing severe mental health symptoms, co-occurring disorders (like PTSD and substance use), suicidal ideation, or those who haven’t responded well to outpatient therapy. It’s also used as a stepping stone when proceeding to more long-term outpatient treatment after completing initial levels of care.

The military experience is unlike any other. Service members go through rigorous physical training, strict discipline, prolonged separation from loved ones, and the constant possibility of combat. These factors can lead to a range of mental health challenges including:

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

Depression and Anxiety Disorders

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

Moral Injury

Substance Use Disorders (SUDs)

Adjustment Disorders

Suicidal Ideation

Traditional mental health treatment may not always resonate with military members. They may feel misunderstood, stigmatized, or reluctant to open up in civilian therapy settings.

Inpatient military mental health treatment programs are built around cultural competence and understanding of the military mindset—values like honor, duty, loyalty, and resilience are recognized and incorporated into therapeutic approaches.

Entering inpatient treatment is a big step and for many military members, whether they have been referred by a medical provider or are taking this step on their own. In most cases, they are starting this chapter after months or even years of struggling in silence.

Here are some signs inpatient care might be necessary:

Intense PTSD symptoms that interfere with daily life

Severe depression or anxiety that doesn’t improve with outpatient care

Suicidal thoughts or behaviors

Substance misuse that’s spiraling out of control

Unable to manage daily life, relationships, or responsibilities

Recent crisis or mental health emergency

Co-occurring mental and physical health issues including chronic pain or TBI

In many cases inpatient care is the safest and most effective environment to stabilize and start meaningful recovery.

What to Expect in an Inpatient Military Mental Health Program

While no two programs are the same, most inpatient military mental health treatment centers follow a structured, evidence-based approach. Here’s what you can expect:

1. Comprehensive Assessment

Upon admission individuals undergo a full physical, psychological and psychiatric evaluation. This includes a review of medical history, trauma history, any past treatments, current symptoms and risk factors. The goal is to create a personalized treatment plan that addresses the individual’s unique needs.

2. 24/7 Supervised Care

One of the hallmarks of inpatient treatment is around-the-clock supervision by medical professionals, psychiatrists, and therapists. This ensures safety and allows for immediate intervention if a crisis arises. It’s especially important for those who are at risk of self-harm or struggling with severe PTSD flashbacks, dissociation, or panic attacks.

3. Individual and Group Therapy

Therapy is the core of inpatient treatment. Patients participate in one-on-one sessions and group therapy. These may include:

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

Prolonged Exposure Therapy

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

Moral Injury Repair Therapy

Trauma-Informed Therapy

4. Family Involvement

Military culture emphasizes loyalty and unit cohesion—and family is often part of that unit. Many inpatient programs offer family therapy, education sessions, or structured visits to involve loved ones in the healing process. This can be key in rebuilding trust, communication, and support systems after mental health has disrupted relationships.

5. Medication Management

In some cases, psychiatric medication is part of the treatment plan. Whether it’s antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or medication to assist with sleep, all prescriptions are closely monitored and adjusted based on the individual’s response and needs.

6. Holistic and Experiential Therapies

Many modern inpatient facilities incorporate holistic approaches like:

Mindfulness and meditation

Yoga and physical fitness

Art or music therapy

Equine-assisted therapy

Adventure or wilderness therapy

These modalities can help veterans reconnect with their bodies, manage stress, and access emotions in nonverbal ways.

7. Transition and Discharge Planning

From day one clinicians begin planning for what comes next. Whether it’s stepping down to outpatient care, entering a sober living home, or returning to duty (if applicable) a personalized aftercare plan ensures continuity and reduces the risk of relapse or regression.

So how does someone start this journey? Access points can vary based on whether someone is active duty, a veteran or a military family member.

For Active Duty Service Members

Most military personnel can access inpatient care through their branch’s medical facilities or TRICARE-approved civilian programs. They may need to go through their base’s behavioral health clinic or receive a referral from a primary care provider or command.

In emergencies, service members can be hospitalized immediately without a referral. Confidentiality and career concerns are common fears but there are safeguards in place. In fact, seeking help is now widely promoted as a sign of strength, not weakness.

For Veterans

Veterans can access inpatient mental health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or community-based programs that partner with the VA. The VA offers a range of inpatient options including:

PTSD residential treatment

Substance use rehabilitation

Dual diagnosis programs

Crisis stabilization units

Some nonprofit organizations and private providers also offer veteran-focused care that accepts VA benefits or other forms of coverage.

For Military Families

While spouses and children of service members may not need the same kind of military-specific mental health treatment they too face unique pressures. Inpatient options are more limited but can sometimes be accessed through TRICARE-authorized facilities or community mental health centers.

Despite the growing awareness and advocacy around mental health in the military, stigma still prevents many from seeking the help they need. The idea that admitting to mental health struggles could hurt one’s career, reputation, or perceived strength runs deep. But here’s the truth: taking action and seeking treatment—especially inpatient care when it’s needed—is one of the bravest most proactive steps a person can take.

Leaders across branches are working hard to normalize mental health care and ensure policies support rather than punish service members who seek help. Initiatives like embedded behavioral health units, peer support programs, and command-level training are creating safer environments for honest conversations.

The Long-Term Benefits of Inpatient Treatment

While inpatient treatment is intensive the benefits can be life-changing. Here’s what many military members and veterans gain:

Improved symptom management and emotional regulation

Better relationships with family, peers, and themselves

Greater insight into their triggers and coping strategies

Reintegration support for transitioning to civilian life

Connection to peers who understand the military mindset

A foundation for lifelong recovery and wellness

Healthy coping skills and mechanisms

For some inpatient care is the first time in years—or ever—that they feel seen, understood, and supported.

Service members are strong, sacrifice and resilient. But even the strongest need help sometimes. Inpatient military mental health treatment offers a way to heal that acknowledges the experiences of service members and veterans. It’s not just about managing symptoms – it’s about rebuilding lives, restoring hope and redefining what it means to be strong.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GRAL. GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL)’s share was trading at $25.93 as of April 15th.

Grail, the undisputed leader in multi-cancer early detection (MCED), was spun off from Illumina in June 2024 following antitrust pressures in Europe, despite Illumina acquiring it for $8 billion in 2020. The spin-off, which left Illumina with a 14.5% stake, included a $775 million cash infusion—enough for a 2.5-year runway—making Grail’s current market cap roughly equal to its net cash. Its flagship product, Galleri, is a breakthrough blood test capable of detecting up to 50 types of cancer—many of which have no routine screening options—using machine learning to identify cancer-specific methylation patterns in cell-free DNA. Initial results from the PATHFINDER study were promising, and three major trials are underway: the 140,000-person NHS-Galleri trial in the UK, the 20,000-person PATHFINDER II trial with Medicare, and the REFLECTION study via the VA, which led to Tricare coverage for at-risk individuals over 50. The NHS and Medicare trials, with results expected in late 2025 and 2026, could trigger broad reimbursement approval. A successful Medicare rollout alone—at a $300 reimbursement per test, 30% adherence, and one test every two years—could drive $2.25 billion in sales, implying an $11 billion valuation at 5x sales. That’s a potential 14x return from today’s levels, with minimal market awareness.

GRAIL, Inc. (GRAL) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 28 hedge fund portfolios held GRAL at the end of the fourth quarter which was 25 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GRAL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

“South Carolina,” he noted, “too small for a republic, but too large for an insane asylum.” This editorial was originally published by the Charleston City Paper.
Charleston City Paper is an award-winning weekly newspaper in Charleston, S.C.","The Charleston City Paper

It’s a good thing Dr. Edward Simmer is a psychiatrist.

Any other kind of physician might have been baffled last week when the S.C. Senate Medical Affairs Committee voted 12-5 to reject his gubernatorial nomination to lead the state Department of Public Health.

After all, his credentials are nothing short of spectacular: 30 years as an active duty Navy doctor. Chief medical officer of TRICARE, where he oversaw care for millions of service members, veterans and families. And since 2021, the director of the former state Department of Health and Environmental Control and then interim director of public health right here in South Carolina, garnering valuable state experience and winning the trust of Gov. Henry McMaster, who nominated him last November.

So, yes, most doctors are probably mystified by the committee’s rejection. But not Simmer, who sat patiently as one senator after another condemned his record of recommending — not mandating, just recommending — masks and vaccines during the Covid pandemic that killed 19,000 people in the Palmetto State.

As a trained mental health professional, he must have known exactly what was going on: The inmates were running the asylum.

“What you’re asking us to do is have confidence in your judgment to do this job,” said hard right Sen. Matt Leber (R-Charleston), after attacking Simmer for supporting voluntary masking and vaccination. “And the history of it, uh, I’m not confident.”

Simmer, ever the gentleman throughout the hearing, respectfully reminded the senator that under his leadership, the state consistently followed the best available science — even when it was at odds with the advice coming from federal officials.

That’s why Palmetto State schools were allowed to reopen in August 2020, well before most. And it’s why our public health authorities did everything in their power to help S.C. businesses keep their doors open throughout the crisis.

But Republicans on the committee made it clear that they weren’t going to be dragged into a tedious conversation about facts and science. Humbug! Not when the only medical research S.C. public health officials should ever concern themselves with was published and peer reviewed by the states in 1787.

“We didn’t have all the information,” Sen. Tom Fernandez (R-Dorchester) told Simmer. “We had the United States Constitution, we had personal liberty, we had personal freedom. That’s the best information at any time of any emergency.”

Of course, Fernandez offered no evidence that Simmer had ever violated the Constitution. But no matter. Vibes, not substance, were the order of the day when Simmer faced these lemmings and accusers.

To his credit, McMaster stood by his man after the vote, urging the full Senate to override the committee.

“I remain resolute in my support of Dr. Ed Simmer and am hopeful that the full Senate will see through the falsehoods and mistruths being spread about his service to our state and nation,” McMaster said in a social media post.

Still, the prognosis for Simmer’s nomination is grim, with one senator suggesting he’d be better off looking for work in the Department of Mental Health.

Which, inevitably, put us in mind of the most famous words ever uttered about the Palmetto State, offered by Charleston attorney James L. Petigru on the eve of secession in 1860.

“South Carolina,” he noted, “too small for a republic, but too large for an insane asylum.”
