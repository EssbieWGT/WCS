Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, legislation to provide premium-free medical insurance coverage for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.
The legislation is supported by National Guard Association of the United States, Wisconsin National Guard Association, Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association, and Reserve Organization of America.
“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad.
Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them.","Roughly 130,000 men and women in the National Guard and Reserve do not have health insurance

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced the Healthcare for Our Troops Act, legislation to provide premium-free medical insurance coverage for all members of the National Guard and Reserve. Sixteen percent of Reserve and National Guard members – roughly 130,000 men and women who have volunteered to serve our country – do not have private health insurance.

“Our service members in the National Guard and Reserve serve and sacrifice for their nation every day – and just like the brave men and women in every other service branch, they deserve and have earned high quality, affordable health care,” said Senator Baldwin. “My bill doesn’t just deliver earned benefits to our troops, it’s also an investment in military readiness to ensure service members get the care they need to stay healthy.”

The Healthcare for Our Troops Act would provide premium-free, zero cost-sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) and address financial barriers to seeking mental health care.

In addition to providing health insurance, the legislation would provide servicemembers with the option to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider – giving commanders back valuable training days and saving over $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments. The legislation would also create an incentive for employers to hire Guard and Reserve members by lessening demand for employer-sponsored healthcare plans.

The legislation is supported by National Guard Association of the United States, Wisconsin National Guard Association, Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association, and Reserve Organization of America.

“The Healthcare for Our Troops Legislation is a bipartisan solution that strengthens our military from the ground up. As President of the Wisconsin National Guard Association, I have seen firsthand how a lack of healthcare coverage impacts readiness, retention, and the wellbeing of our Guardsmen and their families. Our service members are asked to do more than ever—responding to domestic emergencies, deploying overseas, filling critical roles. They deserve continuous, no-cost access to healthcare to ensure they remain healthy, resilient, and mission-ready. We are grateful to Senator Baldwin for her leadership and continued advocacy, and we urge Congress to advance this important legislation,” said Jeannie Jeanetta, President of the Wisconsin National Guard Association.

“The Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association (WNGEA) is grateful for the proposal of the Healthcare for our Troops bill, which will ensure that Soldiers and Airmen have access to consistent healthcare when meeting medical readiness requirements. This bill eliminates the need for healthcare transitions when switching between state and federal duty statuses when activated, allowing Guardsmen to focus on the mission instead of worrying about lapses in healthcare. WNGEA is greatly appreciative of Senator Baldwin’s support for the National Guard and the continual emphasis for ensuring military members and their families are provided for,” said the Wisconsin National Guard Enlisted Association.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Major General Francis M. McGinn, President of the National Guard Association of the United States. “Readiness begins with wellness, and wellness begins with access. For less than one percent of the DoD healthcare budget, we can ensure a ready Reserve Component. Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn’t just about rest and rehab—it’s also about eating right.","AUGUST 21, 2025 – Musculoskeletal injuries, such as strains, sprains, fractures, and overuse injuries, are leading causes of limited duty or training restrictions among military personnel. Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH.

“It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty.

“Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist.

“Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain.

“Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1) Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you’re not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2) Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you’re injured, it’s recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It’s best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it’s a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It’s also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3) Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It’s a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4) Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5) Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it’s best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6) Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn’t just about rest and rehab—it’s also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you’re recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

The Munson PFPC is still welcoming more volunteers to strengthen the program.

“The PFPC serves as a forum where TRICARE beneficiaries who use Munson partner directly with health center leaders to share feedback, exchange ideas, and shape improvements in care delivery,” said Tim Stevens, Munson’s chief of Quality and Safety, and PFPC council director. “By combining the insight of experienced council members with the perspectives of newcomers, the group strengthens its ability to represent the diverse needs of the Fort Leavenworth community.”

During the meeting, council members reviewed upcoming initiatives, discussed opportunities to enhance the beneficiary experience, and offered feedback on patient services, including:

School and Sports Physicals: This summer, Munson provided more than 1,200 school and sports physicals for military families.

After Hours Clinic: While overall access to care remains good, recent provider and support staff vacancies limit proposed in-person after-hours primary care at this time. The council discussed leveraging virtual and in-person urgent care TRICARE options to supplement after hours services.

Pharmacy: A council member asked if the pharmacy could provide a printed medication guide rather than a QR code. To reduce paper waste, the pharmacy prints prescription information but uses a QR code on the bottle for the manufacturer’s information. Printed copies are available upon request. To save time, request printed information when activating the prescription at the window, through Q-Anywhere, or the call center.

24-hour ScriptCenter access is delayed because interior lobby doors lack after-hours security. A $25,000 renovation is needed to upgrade the hardware, comply with fire and building codes, and allow 24/7 access, shared Stevens.

Leaders emphasized that collaboration with patients is vital to ensuring Munson provides safe, high-quality, patient-centered care.

The council also nominated Ms. Erin Avera to serve as co-chair, representing the patient perspective.

“Bringing together returning and new council members creates a strong foundation for open dialogue,” said Stevens. “Their perspectives guide us as we continue to build trust and improve care for our community.”

IMLS was recently defunded by Presidential Executive Order#14238 and this letter is about the impact on your public library of the loss of this agency and the funding it administered.

Sincerely, The Revere Public Library Board of Trustees","Funding Cuts and the Revere Public Library

Dear Editor,

The following is an open letter from the Revere Public Library (RPL) Board of Trustees to the citizens of Revere and our City, State and Federal elected officials about the current and future impacts on the Revere Public Library, your public library, of recent library-related funding cuts at the Federal level.

Many of you may not realize that your public library is funded in several ways: through the City of Revere budget, the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners (MBLC), and the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). IMLS was recently defunded by Presidential Executive Order#14238 and this letter is about the impact on your public library of the loss of this agency and the funding it administered.

Why does this matter to you as a Revere resident? It’s simple: No dollars from IMLS to MBLC means less funding to the Revere Public Library to help carry out its mission to meet the information and community needs of Revere’s residents of all ages, economic, and educational backgrounds.

It is a common misconception that RPL is simply a large building full of books that can be borrowed. It is so much more. It is where you can bring your children for a story hour and programs that encourage their creativity and skill development, where they make some of their first friends. It is where you can join a book club, participate in a game night with other young adults and engage with other members of the community. It is where you build community across generational and cultural lines. It is where you can use a computer for free and access free wi-fi. It is where you can make photocopies, create your resume, apply for jobs, or make computer printouts for a small fee. It is where you can borrow a reduced cost pass to museums and other local attractions. It is where you can take an ESOL class. It is where you can take a citizenship class. It is where through free online databases a veteran can learn about VA and TRICARE benefits or a senior can learn about assisted living and other housing options, where you can read current news and popular magazines, use business research databases, learn a language, trace your family’s history, download free music and movies, or learn about the job market and potential careers. These services and resources are made available to our community by federal funding through IMLS, which has recently been eliminated. Some resources have already been scaled back or cut entirely due to the loss of this funding.

So, what can you do about this loss of funding? First, you can contact your State and Federal Senators and Representatives (and their aides), testify how your library has impacted you and encourage them to defend the IMLS budget and support your library funding. Second, you can contact the members of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Committee (Labor HHS) to ask them to vote to stop these cuts and reinstate IMLS funding. Lastly, libraries and cultural institutions are on the chopping block with the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018 coming up for reauthorization; we must protect these institutions. You can reach out to your legislators (and their aides) and demand they vote to reauthorise the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018. We have until September 30, when our legislators return from their summer recess, to vote on this crucial legislation. History has shown us that emailing and/or calling your legislator to share your concerns has a definite impact. Visit https://malegislature.gov/Search/FindMyLegislator to get contact information for your Representatives and Senators and https://appropriations.house.gov/subcommittees/labor-health-and-human-services-education-and-related-agencies to contact members of the Labor HHS Committee.

Thank you in advance for your support of the Revere Public Library and libraries in general for the significant impact they have on the health and welfare of our communities.

Your PCP is your main point of contact for getting health care services, so it's important you find a doctor or provider who you trust, feel comfortable with, and who encourages you to be an active participant in your health care. Don't treat the decision of choosing a PCP lightly. Do some research and don't be afraid to meet with several doctors before you make a decision. Most health insurance plans allow you to switch PCPs whenever you want, so know that you can always change your mind, too.

Find a doctor who works as part of a care team: Find a doctor who works as part of a ""care team,"" where a dedicated group of doctors, nurses, educators, and other health care professionals work together to care for US Family Health Plan members.

See which doctors have been designated as providing high-quality health care: If you're looking for a doctor in Maine, you can check physician ratings at Compare Maine to see which doctors have been designated as providing high-quality health care.

Be sure to search your health plan's Provider Directory: Most health insurance plans have a network of providers you must use to get the best rates. Be sure to search your health plan's Provider Directory and use an in-network doctor when possible. You'll spend much less on your health care services when you do so.

How coverage works

A newborn infant is covered as a TRICARE Prime beneficiary in DEERS for the first 90 days after birth, as long as one additional family member is enrolled in the Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan, or a different TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Prime Remote plan. Your baby will be conditionally enrolled in the US Family Health Plan for the first 90 days of their life.

The US Family Health Plan will pay claims for covered services your newborn receives from Day 1 through Day 90 under this Conditional Enrollment. You must complete official enrollment on or before day 90 in order to guarantee continuous coverage.

How to enroll

Register your newborn in DEERS to establish TRICARE eligibility.

Submit a completed Enrollment Application to the Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan.

Call the Martin’s Point US Family Health Plan at 1-888-553-3461 as soon as possible after the baby’s birth to notify us of their date of birth. This will help ensure that your child will be conditionally enrolled so we can smoothly process any claims for services your baby receives in the first 90 days.

Depending on your catastrophic cap level and your family's health-care use, you may never meet your catastrophic cap in a year.
Tricare Enrollment Fees Who pays Tricare enrollment fees?
Retirees and their family members who enroll in either Tricare Prime or Tricare Select pay enrollment fees.
Tricare Premiums Who pays Tricare premiums?","One quirk of Tricare is its two different names for the annual, quarterly or monthly fees that beneficiaries may pay. In the civilian world, anything you pay regularly just to have health-care coverage is typically called a premium. But Tricare is different. Depending on your status and plan, you may pay either enrollment fees or premiums.

There are different terms for the categories of money you’ll pay Tricare because each works a little differently.

So what's what, and why should you care? Here’s what you need to know about Tricare fees.

What's a Tricare Catastrophic Cap?

The key difference between enrollment fees and premiums is whether they count toward your catastrophic cap. A catastrophic cap, sometimes called an out-of-pocket maximum, is the most your family will pay for covered care during any calendar year. Once your family reaches your catastrophic cap, Tricare will pay 100% of the Tricare-allowable cost of any covered care for the rest of the year.

The amount of your catastrophic cap depends on:

Which Tricare plan or program you have

Your sponsor's status (active duty, reserve or retired)

Whether your sponsor entered the military before or after Jan. 1, 2018. You can look up your catastrophic cap at the Tricare website.

Depending on your catastrophic cap level and your family's health-care use, you may never meet your catastrophic cap in a year. That's great news because it means you're paying very little for your annual health care. On the flip side, families with higher medical needs may meet their catastrophic cap for the year as early as January, meaning they'll pay nothing for covered health care for the rest of the year.

Either way, your catastrophic cap is important to understand, because it gives you an idea of the most you'll need to spend on covered health care in a year. Many families divide their catastrophic cap by 12 and put that much money in a dedicated savings account each month. Then when you have to pay your deductible or fees for service, you'll have the money available.

Tricare Enrollment Fees

Who pays Tricare enrollment fees? Retirees and their family members who enroll in either Tricare Prime or Tricare Select pay enrollment fees. These costs are annual, but you may pay them on a more frequent schedule, such as monthly, by having them deducted from military retirement pay.

Do Tricare enrollment fees count toward the catastrophic cap? Yes, anything called an enrollment fee counts toward your family's catastrophic cap.

Tricare Premiums

Who pays Tricare premiums? Users of Tricare plans that charge for participation -- besides Prime and Select -- pay premiums (those two charge enrollment fees instead). Premiums apply to Tricare Reserve Select, Tricare Retired Reserve, Tricare Young Adult and Continued Health Care Benefit Program plans. Premiums for CHCBP are quarterly, while the other programs charge monthly premiums.

Do Tricare premiums count toward the catastrophic cap? No, anything called a premium does not count toward your family's catastrophic cap. This can be a big deal, because premiums can be fairly expensive, depending on which plan you use.

Not All Plans Have a Cost

If you're an active-duty service member or family member, or if you're on Tricare for Life, you pay neither an enrollment fee nor a premium. Therefore, you must meet your catastrophic cap through fees for service, such as co-payments or cost shares.

Budgeting for health care generally means budgeting for your catastrophic cap. Knowing whether your annual or monthly Tricare expense counts toward your catastrophic cap is an important part of that math. Figure out whether what you pay is an enrollment fee or a premium so you can apply that to your overall figures, and you'll have a better sense of your potential medical costs each year.

TRICARE covers certain breast pumps and supplies and breastfeeding counseling at no cost for new mothers.

“TRICARE covers these items and services for all TRICARE-eligible female beneficiaries who are at least 27 weeks pregnant,” said Jennifer Stankovic, health systems specialist, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “It doesn’t matter what TRICARE plan you use or your sponsor’s status.”

Are you planning to adopt a baby? If you’re a female beneficiary who legally adopts and intends to personally breastfeed an infant, TRICARE will cover breastfeeding supplies and services for you.

You have options for the types of supplies and services you get and how you get them. Keep reading to learn how TRICARE covers them.

Breast pumps and supplies

TRICARE covers one manual or standard electric breast pump per birth event, including portable pumps. (To get a hospital-grade pump, you need to work with your provider and your regional contractor to get a referral and authorization.)

Here’s how to get a breast pump.

Step 1: Get a prescription.

• Your prescription must be from a TRICARE-authorized doctor, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or nurse midwife.

• Your prescription must show if you’re getting a basic manual or standard electric pump.

• Your prescription doesn’t have to specify a brand.

• If you’re going to get a breast pump from a network provider or durable medical equipment supplier, ask your provider to include a diagnosis code on your prescription.

• We suggest you make a copy of your prescription for your records.

Step 2: Get a pump.

• If you don’t want to pay up front, contact your regional contractor to find a network provider or supplier. You’ll need to show your prescription. You won’t have to file a claim.

• If you’re working with a military hospital or clinic to get a breast pump, follow their processes and procedures.

• If you don’t mind paying up front, you can go to a TRICARE-authorized provider, supplier, or vendor. (Vendors include retail and online stores.) You won’t need to show your prescription. Be sure to save and copy your receipt so that you can file a claim for reimbursement.

• You may choose to purchase a luxury or deluxe pump (meaning those with “luxury or deluxe” features, such as smartphone connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, enhanced or expanded rechargeable batteries, or unnecessary accessories). If so, you’d pay the difference between TRICARE’s maximum reimbursement for a standard breast pump and the actual cost of the pump.

Go to Breast Pumps and Supplies to learn about coverage for other supplies, where you can get breast pumps and supplies, and getting reimbursed. Contact your regional contractor for more information.

Breastfeeding counseling

TRICARE covers breastfeeding counseling in two ways:

1. As part of the care provided during an inpatient maternity stay, a follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or a well-child care visit

2. Up to six separate outpatient sessions, in addition to any breastfeeding counseling provided during an inpatient stay, follow-up OB-GYN outpatient visit, or well-child care visit, when the counseling is:

o Billed as a preventive service

o The only service being provided

o Provided by a TRICARE-authorized provider, outpatient hospital, or clinic. Types of TRICARE-authorized providers include physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and nurse midwives.

Do you have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select? TRICARE’s Childbirth and Breastfeeding Demonstration gives you expanded breastfeeding counseling coverage, as noted in the TRICARE Maternity Care Brochure.

Through the CBSD, you can get outpatient breastfeeding counseling from lactation consultants and lactation counselors. These providers are highly trained, but they aren’t fully licensed medical providers.

The CBSD also covers group breastfeeding counseling.

Sessions with lactation consultants or counselors and group sessions count toward the six total allowed outpatient counseling sessions you have per birth event. You won’t pay anything out of pocket if you use a network provider.

To qualify for this extra coverage, you must:

• Have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Prime Remote, or TRICARE Select. (Note: You aren’t eligible if you have TRICARE For Life, the US Family Health Plan, or the Continued Health Care Benefit Program.)

• Qualify for TRICARE’s breastfeeding support benefit

Do you live in the U.S.? You’re automatically enrolled in the CBSD when you or your provider submits claims covered under the CBSD. Check with your regional contractor to see if you qualify. If you have TRICARE Prime, you’ll need a referral from your primary care manager if you see a non-network provider. Point-of-service charges may apply without the referral.

Do you live overseas? You must register for the CBSD before you get any services. To register, contact the TRICARE overseas contractor.

The CBSD runs through Dec. 31, 2026. Go to Childbirth and Breastfeeding Support Demonstration to learn more about CBSD eligibility, benefits, and provider types.

The TV campaign comes on the heels of Adia Med's entry into the $25 billion wound care market and showcases the company's broader mission to make world-class regenerative therapies accessible in the United States. For years, many Americans traveled abroad to receive high-quality stem cell treatments, believing they were unavailable domestically. Adia Med is proving that is no longer the case - delivering safe, effective, and U.S.-based regenerative therapies supported by advanced protocols and comprehensive patient care.

""This nationwide commercial is about showing patients they don't need to leave the country to get access to cutting-edge regenerative medicine,"" said Larry Powalisz, CEO of Adia Nutrition Inc. ""It's available right here at home, and we're doing it in a way that meets the highest U.S. medical standards. For patients, it means better access and peace of mind. For investors, it represents a growing market opportunity that we are well-positioned to lead.""

Momentum is also being supported by favorable policy trends, including Florida's passage of SB1768, which formally recognizes the regenerative benefits of stem cell therapy. This legislation underscores the growing legitimacy of regenerative medicine in the U.S. and strengthens Adia Med's position as a pioneer in the field.

The new commercial, airing on major TV networks, presents Adia Med as a destination clinic for regenerative healthcare. Treatments focus on accelerating recovery, improving mobility, and enhancing quality of life, while avoiding the need for costly and burdensome medical travel abroad.

Adia Med is currently an in-network provider with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna, with an active filing underway with TRICARE to broaden access further. The campaign is both a brand-building milestone and a patient acquisition engine, reinforcing Adia's mission to deliver regenerative therapies that are accessible, affordable, and nationally recognized.

Clinic owners and healthcare practitioners interested in licensing the Adia Med name or integrating Adia's regenerative therapies into their practice are encouraged to reach out directly. Strategic partnerships are welcomed as part of Adia's continued mission to expand access to advanced stem cell solutions.

Retirees and family members who are eligible for Medicare or have Tricare For Life are not eligible.","Active-duty family members, retirees and their eligible family members in Atlanta and Tampa, Florida, will have access to a new Tricare Prime option starting in 2026.

The option “represents an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,” Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency, said in a news release. “The data we get from this demonstration will inform future Tricare innovations nationwide.”

The three-year demo begins in January. Managed by CareSource Military and Veterans, enrollees will get care from CareSource’s network of primary and specialty care providers. The demo will provide Tricare Prime coverage to over 146,000 beneficiaries across both cities, Military.com reported.

The demo aims to bring more health care choices to eligible individuals. Participants enrolled in the Tricare Prime Demo will keep comprehensive Tricare coverage with a few differences from the traditional Tricare Prime.

Participants will have their Tricare Prime enrollment fee waived for the first year of the demo. After that, retirees, their family members and survivors will pay enrollment fees.

Enrollees will not need referrals to see network providers, but they can only get care at a military hospital or clinic in an emergency. They also will not be able to use the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line, but CareSource has its own advice line for beneficiaries, according to the news release.

Only participants who live within the designated geographic areas of the Atlanta and Tampa Bay metropolitan areas and have an active-duty, activated National Guard or Reserve or retired family member are eligible.

“Knowing how to spot and avoid scams is a first line of defense,” said Dr. Cindy Morita, Acting Financial Readiness Program/Family Advocacy Program Manager.
Access to trustworthy resources that educate Soldiers and Army Families about financial scams can also help safeguard their economic well-being.
In the episode about online scams, Carol Kando-Pineda, Counsel with the Federal Trade Commission’s Division of Consumer and Business Education, educates listeners on scams that use artificial intelligence, text messages and tempting financial investment opportunities.
Having open, honest conversations about money and spending habits can also protect you and your Family against financial scams by fostering trust, teamwork and unity.","When was the last time you passively scrolled through an online community board? While it’s possible you didn’t feel in danger while scoping out secondhand furniture or a rental unit in preparation for your next move, it's important to be aware that scammers could be trying to take advantage of unsuspecting individuals.

Financial readiness often involves understanding how to effectively engage with the marketplace, recognizing and avoiding fraud and scams, and making informed financial choices to establish a stable financial future. Fraudsters may target Soldiers and their Families during high-stress periods, such as deployment transitions or permanent change of station season. Research from the Better Business Bureau Institute shows that military consumers reported a higher median dollar loss to scams than nonmilitary consumers. Between 2019 and 2024, the BBB received 273,937 complaints from military customers.

“Knowing how to spot and avoid scams is a first line of defense,” said Dr. Cindy Morita, Acting Financial Readiness Program/Family Advocacy Program Manager.

Watch out for some of the top rip-offs, including fake rental listings, phishing attempts and investment frauds.

Fake PCS rental listings targeting service members. Scammers post homes for rent online, requiring advance payments for properties they don’t own.

Phishing scams. Emails or text messages from individuals pretending to be officials from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or Tricare requesting personal or banking information and demanding payments. Do not click on any links or respond by providing personal information. Stay safe by contacting the organization directly.

Investment fraud. Promises of high returns that turn out to be pyramid or cryptocurrency schemes. Morita said to always conduct research before you invest.

Choosing a safe payment method could be an effective, simple step against scams. Some payment methods offer little or no protection against fraud. Cryptocurrency, payment apps, wire-transfer companies and gift cards offer less fraud protection. These options can make it difficult to recover your money. Credit cards usually offer stronger fraud protection.

Access to trustworthy resources that educate Soldiers and Army Families about financial scams can also help safeguard their economic well-being. Military Consumer is a program designed for the military community. The website offers free resources to help teach individuals about fraud and assist them in making informed financial decisions. The Military OneSource podcast series also provides an episode on prevalent scams affecting service members. In the episode about online scams, Carol Kando-Pineda, Counsel with the Federal Trade Commission’s Division of Consumer and Business Education, educates listeners on scams that use artificial intelligence, text messages and tempting financial investment opportunities.

Having open, honest conversations about money and spending habits can also protect you and your Family against financial scams by fostering trust, teamwork and unity.

“When Families communicate about finances, they work together to set goals and solve problems, which builds resilience on every level,” said Morita.

The Financial Readiness Program aims to empower Soldiers and Families with the knowledge, tools and resources needed to achieve financial resilience and independence by helping individuals to not only manage their finances but also prepare for unexpected circumstances.",http://www.army.mil/,N,0.0,2025-08-21 09:56:11.478148

Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis investigated NVG-291-R as a potential novel treatment in clinically relevant rodent models of both moderate and severe peripheral nerve injury (PNI).

Improved Neuromuscular Function and Axonal Regeneration: In moderate and severe models of PNI, daily subcutaneous NVG-291-R treatment led to statistically significant improvements in neuromuscular function and axonal regrowth. Increases in compound muscle action potentials and specific tetanic force were associated with a higher total number and density of axons distal to the injury site. Functional and regenerative gains were observed as early as 4 weeks post-injury.

""Peripheral nerve injuries can be life altering and are a major barrier to return-to-duty for our military personnel,"" said Dr. Wilson Ray, MD, a neurosurgeon and lead investigator from WashU Medicine. ""Combat-sustained PNIs have increased in both frequency and severity in recent years, yet there remain no effective or reparative treatments. Our study showed a significant acceleration of functional recovery and clear histological evidence of axonal regrowth. These findings suggest that NVG-291 could play a critical role in improving outcomes for individuals with peripheral nerve damage in both military and civilian populations.""

Preclinical Evidence Reinforces NVG-291's Broad Therapeutic Potential

These findings in both the auditory and peripheral nervous systems further support the broad therapeutic potential of NVG-291 across multiple neurological conditions. These studies, presented at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, reinforce NVG-291's ability to accelerate nervous system repair in clinically relevant models of military-related nerve damage.

""We are demonstrating a consistent ability to promote nervous system repair, whether in the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, or the delicate structures of the inner ear,"" said Dr. Marc DePaul, Director of Research at NervGen Pharma. ""These robust findings strengthen our commitment to advancing NVG-291 into further clinical studies and bringing a new class of restorative medicine to individuals in need.""

About NVG-291

NervGen holds exclusive worldwide rights to NVG-291, a first- and potential best-in-class neuroreparative therapeutic peptide targeting nervous system repair. NVG-291's technology is licensed from Case Western Reserve University and is based on academic studies that demonstrated the preclinical efficacy of NVG-291-R, the rodent variant of NVG-291, in animal models of spinal cord injury. These studies implicated multiple potential molecular and cellular mechanisms by which NVG-291-R promotes neurorepair and functional improvement in both central and peripheral nervous system injury models. The implicated mechanisms include the promotion of neuronal sprouting, or plasticity, remyelination, and promotion of a non-inflammatory phenotype in the microglial cells. NervGen has received Fast Track designation from the FDA and Orphan Designation from the EMA for NVG-291 in individuals living with spinal cord injury.

InvestingPro subscribers have access to 14 additional key insights about ZYXI’s financial health and future prospects.

Financial Highlights

Revenue: 22.3 million USD, down from 49.9 million USD YoY

Earnings per share: -0.66 USD, compared to forecast of -0.2 USD

Gross profit: 15.2 million USD, representing 68% of revenue

Cash on hand: 17.5 million USD

Convertible debt: 60 million USD due May 2026

Earnings vs. Forecast

Zynex’s earnings fell significantly short of analyst expectations, with a surprise EPS miss of 230%. The revenue shortfall of 18.55% further compounded investor concerns, marking a notable deviation from past performance. This quarter’s results highlight the company’s ongoing struggles to stabilize its financial health amid operational restructuring.

Market Reaction

The market’s response to Zynex’s earnings report was swift and severe. The stock’s after-hours tumble of 49.2% reflects investor disappointment and uncertainty about the company’s future trajectory. This dramatic drop places the stock near its 52-week low of 1.23 USD, suggesting a challenging road ahead for recovery.

Outlook & Guidance

With the appointment of new CEO Steven Dyson, Zynex has suspended its quarterly guidance as it reassesses its strategic direction. The company aims to achieve positive cash flow by the end of the year, despite the current financial setbacks. This goal appears challenging given the company’s current financial health score of 1.77 (rated as ’FAIR’ by InvestingPro) and a concerning current ratio of 0.62, indicating short-term obligations exceed liquid assets. Upcoming product launches, such as the anticipated FDA approval for the Neko pulse oximeter, could play a crucial role in revitalizing Zynex’s market position. Analysts maintain a consensus target price range of $2.00-$3.70, suggesting potential upside despite current challenges.

Executive Commentary

""We are confident that our efforts to reduce costs and redirecting our sales force will be pivotal to improve cash flow,"" stated Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman. Don Gregg, President of Monitoring, emphasized the potential impact of their new technology: ""Laser pulse oximetry is not biased, allowing for more accurate readings across all individuals.""

Full transcript - Zynex Inc (ZYXI) Q2 2025:

Conference Operator: Afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Zynex Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer of Zynix.

Please go ahead.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released financial results for the second quarter ended 06/30/2025. A copy of the press release is available on the company’s website. Before we begin, I’d like to remind you that during this conference call, the company will make projections and forward looking statements regarding events. We encourage you to review the company’s past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the company’s 2024 Form 10 ks and subsequent Form 10 Qs, along with any amendments, which identify the specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in these forward looking statements.

These factors may include, without limitation, statements regarding product development, product potential, the regulatory and legal environment, sales and marketing strategies, capital resources, or other operating performance. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the second quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. With me today are Anna Loxock, our Chief Operating Officer Don Gregg, President of Xanax Monitoring and Dan Moorhead, our Chief Financial Officer. Anna will provide an update on our initiatives in the pain management division, and Don Gregg will discuss how far we have come in our patient monitoring division and our recent submission to the FDA for our Neko pulse oximeter. Dan will go through the second quarter’s financial results.

The 2025 was dominated by many improvements centered around refocusing our pain management business model, not only reshaping our sales force and redirecting them to slightly different call points, but also trans transforming our corporate structures to better reflect and streamline operations. Later this year and into the next year, we’ll see the impact of this effort. We’re seeing a reduction to overall expenses of approximately $40,000,000 annualized and a more efficient use of our inventories, better supply chain management, a more diversified prescriber and payer customer base, all in support for our goal to return to positive cash flow by the end of this year. We recently announced the addition of Steven Dyson as our new CEO. And Steven brings over twenty five years of experience in the medical technology sector primarily through his leadership at APAX, a global private equity firm.

Steven brings deep expertise and a proven track record in the medical sector. His leadership will be helpful as we refocus our business strategy toward a more optimized payer mix and work to return Xynix to a strong growth trajectory. His start date is August 18, and I look forward to working with him in my new role as just chairman of the board. I should also mention that he and I are very aligned on all the major things that needs to get done. In another also important development, Dan Moorhead, our CFO of AGS has recently signed as announced in our eight ks filing two days ago.

He is on the call today and available to answer questions. As soon as we have a replacement appointed, we’ll update everyone immediately, of course. As I’m sure most of our listeners know, we submitted the FDA application on our Neko laser pulse oximeter back in May. This product marks a historic milestone in the evolution of pulse oximetry and is a major game changer in our mission to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes with unique breakthrough technologies in our hospital monitoring division. We’re encouraged by the early attention we have received from the FDA and the line of questions we have answered already.

We expect at least one more round of questions that will take several months before clearance. Don will provide you with more details on this exciting development. And the TRICARE temporary payment suspension is still ongoing, and it’s hard to predict exactly how long it would take before we have a resolution to this. We are obviously hopeful that it will be sooner rather than later. We are actively cooperating with DHA and TRICARE in their claims reviews, and we are advocating proposition of the payment suspension.

In support of TRICARE’s goals of patient care, we have also agreed to continue servicing existing TRICARE patients, and we are honoring prescriptions for new patients. While we are working on a resolution for TRICARE, we are redirecting our focus to fully operate without relying on TRICARE’s revenue. We are committed to diversifying our revenue streams even more. And during the quarter, we continued our efforts to refocus our sales force and operations to reflect the current landscape of insurance coverage and have made significant strides towards improving cash flow. This has included several efficiency improvements in our internal operations, relocating staff to more profitable business units, reducing our cost of goods sold, updating our sales management structures while driving the sales force in the field to become more efficient and productive.

Our efforts to redirect our sales force and reduce expenses internally are beginning to take effect now. And over the next several quarters, it will naturally show as improvements to our bottom line. We reported net revenue of 22,000,000 in the quarter, while we collected $26,000,000 in cash in the second quarter. We posted a net loss of $20,000,000 while more than half of that was due to a noncash adjustment to our tax allowance. We strongly believe in our commitment to help patients with the best product for pain relief without side effects that are associated typically with opioids.

We are confident that our efforts to reduce costs and redirecting our sales force will be pivotal to improve cash flow and create a foundation for continuing to grow into the huge demand for our products. Our revenue is becoming more diversified with increased call points, increasing sales of other products, technologies and more end users. We are very optimistic about the future of Sinax as we have proven to be a business that can grow profitably. I’ll now turn the call over to Anna Luxoft to provide a more detailed update on the operations. Anna?

Anna Loxock, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: Thank you, Thomas. As Thomas mentioned, we were notified by TRICARE that the temporary suspension of payments will continue as they complete their review. We continue to remain an in network provider and service existing and new TRICARE patients as directed by DHA. In June, we decreased overall staff by an additional 14%, mostly in our corporate office. We anticipate this, along with previous expense reductions, will result in an annual savings up to $40,000,000 As part of the restructure and based on payer performance analysis, we’ve categorized payers into different tiers and are actively shifting our focus to the most favorable segments.

As a result, we’ve rightsized shipments for orders and adjusted sales commissions to reflect performance. Internally, we’ve eliminated close to 90 corporate roles, replacing them with more cost effective outsourced teams. These actions are expected to reduce expenses while allowing our teams to focus more efficiently on our core business on a monthly basis. While we anticipate a near term impact on revenue primarily within our supply segments, it reinforces our patient centric approach and strengthens our ability to build and sustain long term value based relationships with payers. We believe this strategy will drive greater patient outcomes and operational sustainability over time.

We’ve undertaken a comprehensive realignment of our sales force to drive productivity and position the organization for long term growth. One of the key initiatives has been resetting our sales organization to better align objectives. In parallel, we’ve restructured the sales team by reducing the overall headcount and exiting sales reps that don’t meet our standards. We also streamlined our organizational structure by removing redundancies, which has allowed for oversight and support from senior leadership. This leaner structure empowers leadership to stay focused on the metrics that matter for the business and performance indicators that enable faster identification of coaching opportunities to ensure every individual representing our company represents our values.

Additionally, we revamped our sales compensation model to drive a performance focused culture that meets the company’s objectives for good patient care and experience and regulatory compliance. High performing sales employees are now rewarded with increased base pay, while mid tier performers are incentivized to improve their clearly defined targets. This approach not only drives accountability, but ultimately creates a clear pathway for reps to appropriately grow their earnings as they deliver better business outcomes through better patient experience. Long term, our objective remains unchanged. We aim to fully staff all 800 sales territories with highly capable data driven representatives.

We believe this focused and disciplined strategy will allow us to serve our patients more effectively and deliver consistent profitable growth. I’ll now turn the call over to Don Greig to provide a more detailed update on the patient monitoring business. Don?

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: Thank you, Anna. I want to provide an additional update on the progress of our Nico pulse oximeter and the overall market opportunities for this product. We successfully submitted Nico to the FDA in May, and there has been initial interactive review with the FDA. We are expecting an additional information request in August and an overall six month clearance process. Last quarter, I spent some time explaining why we are well positioned with this technology and the massive opportunity we believe is in front of us.

Clinical results show the Nikko laser technology is superior to LED pulse oximeters currently in the market today as they have severe accuracy issues in patients with darker skin, elevated carbon monoxide or meth hemoglobin in the bloodstream, and especially those with low levels of blood oxygen. There are very few clinical procedures that do not use pulse oximetry. Skin pigmentation have been shown to alter the oxygen measurement displayed when using LED based pulse oximetry, resulting in biases which can have negative impacts on patient care and outcomes. These accuracy issues are on the FDA agenda and have resulted in device manufacturer litigation to date. Numerous clinical publications prove LED based pulse oximeters that are on the market today are inaccurate on darker skin.

Given this, 25 attorney generals in the US senate requested FDA to address pigmentation bias. As a result of this, the FDA funded open oximetry to improve the safety and precision of pulse oximeters that openly published their testing results. Multiple FDA panel meetings resulted in a new draft guidance issued in January 2025 in which our technology conforms to that guidance. The Nico pulse oximeter recently submitted to the FDA is powered by patent protected laser technology that has been validated to solve the accuracy issues of LED technology in a clinical study at Duke University. Laser pulse oximetry is not biased, allowing for more accurate readings across all individuals regardless of skin pigmentation, elevated carbon monoxide, or methohemoglobin in the bloodstream, and especially those with low levels of blood oxygen.

More accurate data results and improved care and better patient outcomes. We believe our Nico pulse oximeter will provide reliable and equitable care for all. In addition to solving current LED based pulse oximeter technology accuracy issues, the Niko technology platform is poised to unlock the $1,000,000,000 invasive lab based co oximetry market with non invasive laser pulse oximetry technology by bringing it directly to the bedside with instant results and shifting the standard of care. Co oximetry is a critical diagnostic tool for emergency room and hospital patients to determine their treatment pathway. Current co oximetry technology is lab based for the most part, uses similar laser spectrometry technology, and suffers from a number of drawbacks that affect patient outcomes and high hospital cost.

Cocoaximetry measurements require a blood draw today, which is painful and risks infection. Patients wait for results from the lab, which reduces the ability to select appropriate treatment in a timely fashion. These labs are sometimes off-site and result in lengthy delays. It’s also a more expensive approach due to hospital lab processes and high cost consumables. The Neko platform uses needle free, patent protected laser technology to deliver instant, continuous, and low cost results at the bedside to unlock this opportunity.

To close, we submitted NECO to the FDA in May, and we expect approval to take approximately six months from receipt of an additional of an FDA additional information request that’s scheduled for August. Patient monitoring is a multibillion dollar market, approximately 3 and a half billion globally, that we believe NECO will enter as a superior product that can meaningfully improve care to the broadest range of patient patients when they need it most. Zynex is pushing to be a key industry partner and leader to all clinicians and further demonstrate how Nico’s laser pulse oximetry technology inherently solves the current market challenges, especially accuracy and skin pigmentation bias, while improving the field of patient monitoring. I will now turn the call over to Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, for a more in-depth look at the quarter’s financial performance.

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Thanks, Don. Please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the second quarter ended 06/30/2025. Net revenue was $22,300,000 compared to $49,900,000 in the 2024. Device revenue was $11,000,000 and supplies revenue was 11,300,000.0 The revenue decline was primarily attributable to the temporary payment suspension from TRICARE and slowing order growth, which was impacted by sales force reductions, shipping policy adjustments and the redirection of the sales force activity. Gross profit in the second quarter was $15,200,000 or 68% of revenue as compared to $39,900,000 or 80% of revenue in Q2 twenty twenty four.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 45% to $12,800,000 in the 2025. The primary contributor to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was our headcount reduction as we continue to focus on sales rep productivity. G and A expenses were $12,700,000 in the 2025 compared to $14,500,000 last year. Net loss was $20,000,000 and $0.66 per share in the 2025 compared to net income of $1,200,000 in Q2 twenty twenty four. As Thomas mentioned, included in our net loss is a noncash charge of $10,300,000 or $0.34 per share related to an allowance on our deferred tax assets.

Adjusted EBITDA loss for the three months ended 06/30/2025, was $8,900,000 as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $3,500,000 in the quarter ended 06/30/2024. On the balance sheet, we had $17,500,000 of cash on hand at 06/30/2025, and were able to reduce our cash burn significantly in Q2. We expect it to be even less in Q3. Our convertible debt of $60,000,000 is due in May 2026, so you’ll notice it’s now a current liability. We are currently working with our advisers to refinance this liability.

With that, I’ll now turn it back over to Thomas.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. Thank you, Dan. In terms of forward looking guidance, we have decided to suspend quarterly guidance while we are onboarding our new CEO and looking to appoint a new CFO following Dan’s announced departure. Stephen Dyson, the incoming CEO, will lead a review of the company’s forecasting procedures and will provide an update to investors on the potential resumption of guidance in the coming quarters. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from debilitating pain and illness by providing the highest technology and service standards.

In pain management, we do this by providing a non opioid alternative to pain management. And our monitoring division aims to measure data more accurately across patients and provide a more equitable healthcare outcome. We continue to adjust the cost structure as needed and will soon get back to a strong growth trajectory. Looking forward, we believe we have additional call points and revenue streams that can drive further growth. We have always shown an ability to adjust to market, customer and reimbursement changes and continue investing and refocusing our business.

With that, let’s open the call up for questions.

Conference Operator: Thank you, sir. And if you’re using a speakerphone, please lift the handset first before pressing any keys. Please go ahead and press star one now if you have any questions. And your first question will be from Jeffrey Cohen at Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead, Jeffrey.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Oh, hello, folks. How are doing? Few questions from our end. I guess, firstly, I just wanna review and recap with, Don on Nico. So the initial submission was May.

August is when you expect to return questions back to the FDA, or is August when you expect to hear back from them again and remind us on anticipated approval. Would it be closer to October or December?

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: Yeah. Thanks for the question. I we’ve been in dialogue with FDA in what’s called an interactive review. We’ve received multiple discussion questions and dialogue with them. We’re expecting an AI, which should be in August.

And then we are anticipating six months from then clearance. Depending on what is in the AI based on what we’ve already had discussions with FDA regarding, I would expect that clearance would be closer to that December time frame.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. And you feel confident that there won’t be a second AI iteration?

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: Well, nobody really knows exactly what the FDA might do in that case, but we have forecasted AI questions. We’ve got responses ready for those, and we feel pretty confident in our submission to the FDA given all the work that we’ve done over the past several years.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. Got it. Perfect. And then secondly, could you talk about TRICARE a little further as far as next steps and timelines as far as the next iteration when you may meet or have some news about the relationship there. And then maybe talk a little bit about those patients and their patients and referrals.

So TRICARE still referring patients to you that flows continued or perhaps diminished, and are those patients going on therapy or alternatively going elsewhere?

Anna Loxock, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: So we don’t have any information about TRICARE payment suspension next steps at this point and when and if it’s going to get resolved. But we continue to service TRICARE patients, existing and new patients. The inflow of patients has reduced a little bit just as a result of reduced sales rep headcount by about half.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Got it. And then lastly for Dan, perhaps talk a little bit about the sales and more or sales and marketing line and or the G and A line as far as the back half of the year and how those in the last two quarters may compare with q two and where you ended up q two?

Dan Moorhead, Chief Financial Officer, Zynex: Yes. I think, you know, you’ll see continued reductions. We made, you know, the second of our cost reductions were done in June, and so you didn’t really get the full effect of those. So on the sales side, I think you’re gonna continue to see a decrease probably down another 15 to 20% in q three, and then I think it probably flattens out for the rest of the year. And then on the g and a side, it’s probably closer to a 10 to 12% decrease from q two to ’3 and then again flattening out.

But you’ll really start to see the full effect of the cost reductions starting in Q3.

Jeffrey Cohen, Analyst, Ladenburg Thalmann: Okay. Perfect. That does it for us. Thanks for taking the questions. Thank

Conference Operator: you. Next question will be from Yi Chen at H. C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.

Eduardo, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Hi there. This is Eduardo on for Yi. Thanks for taking the question. Do have you any more details on the nature of the data request from the FDA? You mentioned that you’ve done some preparation already to anticipate those questions.

Just kind of get some color on any hesitations they might have or whether they’re looking for more detail in the technology.

Don Gregg, President of Zynex Monitoring, Zynex: You know, I think that the FDA, Yuchen, is definitely concerned about LED technology. They wanna ensure that our technology and our clinical trial performs as good as or or or better than LED technology. They’ve also you know, we’ve had a lot of dialogue on claims positioning of it because it is a different light source technology, things like that. And I’m anticipating that, you know, they’re they will continue to review our clinical data. They will continue to review our claims to ensure where this is positioned properly for those claims, etcetera, etcetera.

And so we are well prepared to talk through this with them and to respond in a very quick manner around that because we’d like to get clearance as soon as possible.

Eduardo, Analyst, H.C. Wainwright: Thanks. That’s really helpful. And I guess curious, I know it might be a little early. Any conversations with the new CEO and possible initiatives or strategies either on the commercial side or the reimbursement side, that you guys might have moving forward?

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. Obviously, I’ve had a close dialogue with Steven Dyson. And the rest of the leadership team is also engaged in basically making sure that things that come up at this point in time that we’re all aligned, all these initiatives to refocus on the pain management side, we’re fully aligned on. And it it fits well what, what he’s good at, sorting sorting out a difficult situation and make sure that the valuation of the company over the next several years will will be much better than it is today.

Conference Operator: Next question will be from Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets: I guess just a couple of questions for me. Could you touch on why revenue came in below the recently provided guidance? I understand it was due to TRICARE and some of the sales force reduction. But beyond that, was there anything incremental that drove the sort of low visibility coming into the quarter? Thank you.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. That’s the third component in that we shipped less supplies in the second quarter than we had in prior quarters, simply as a result of the insurance companies that we are now servicing the allowable and the initiatives we have to have even closer contact with patients as to their the actual needs of supplies. I don’t know if you have anything to add.

Anna Loxock, Chief Operating Officer, Zynex: Well, we’ve continued to we continue to implement a utilization management control program in place to ensure better patient outcome that continues to impact our supply shipments to patients.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you very much. And maybe on TRICARE, you talked about how, you know, you’re still servicing some of these patients when you know that payments aren’t necessarily gonna be coming in at this time. Is is there a reason why you’re still servicing them? And and perhaps have you thought about perhaps reallocating resources elsewhere?

And maybe can you help us think about what Zynex could look like at TRICARE? Thank you.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yeah. TRICARE specifically or DHA with TRICARE has specifically asked us in during this process here to to continue to service the patients and and new patients as well. So annoying and hostile of a situation as it is, we’re obviously doing our best to try to play ball and take good care of patients as as we receive those prescriptions. So that’s that’s that’s part of basically dealing dealing with this situation here. It’s it’s it’s something that’s obviously costing us some money with no revenue, and we we will continue to evaluate whether we do that.

But as Anna mentioned earlier, the the number of new orders we are getting has dropped significantly as a result of refocusing our sales force, And that that helps a little bit on that equation.

Shagun Singh, Analyst, RBC Capital Markets: Got it. Thank you very much. And, yeah, this was Movan Sur on for Ashish.

Conference Operator: Thank you. And at this time, Mr. Sandgaard, we have no further questions registered. Please proceed.

Thomas Sandgaard, Chairman of the Board, Zynex: Yes. Thank you for joining us today. We obviously didn’t see the performance that we had expected here this past quarter. However, I’m very pleased with our plan of improvement and the actions that we have already taken. We appreciate your time and interest in Sinax, and have a great day.

Conference Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Tricare coverage is a program for active-duty service members and their families, whereas VADIP is geared toward veterans and their close family members. Both programs partner with dental insurance companies. (VADIP works with Delta Dental and MetLife, whereas Tricare is through United Healthcare.)

If you are eligible for benefits, you can review available plans and get an idea of the sort of coverage you might be able to enjoy. Every plan is unique, so it is important to pay attention to whether a specific policy will meet your needs. For example, some people already have excellent oral health and need only basic coverage, while others may need a premium plan that covers more extensive care.

Often, plans provide robust coverage for preventive services, such as cleanings, exams, and X-rays. Coverage for restorative care, such as fillings, crowns and dentures, might be more limited. However, you may still enjoy up to 50 – 80% coverage for such services.

Bergman’s emphasis on dental rehabilitation and its impact on warfighter readiness underscored another reason for his visit, which was to learn more about NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program.
He also visited the Defense Health Agency’s regional dental lab at Naval Base San Diego where the team fabricates dental appliances and prostheses.
“What sets our Maxillofacial Restoration Program apart is that we don’t just perform surgery, we restore health, function, and quality of life,” said Hammer.
About Defense Health Network Pacific Rim: Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR) is one of the Defense Health Agency’s nine networks of hospitals and clinics that deliver high-quality health care to more than 140,000 enrolled beneficiaries, supporting major operational units through the Indo-Pacific.","Leaders at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), part of the Defense Health Agency’s Defense Health Network Pacific Rim, welcomed U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman (MI-01) on Aug. 11 for an official visit focused on readiness, health care delivery, and an innovative program that is transforming warfighter readiness and patients’ lives.

Bergman, a retired U.S. Marine Corps lieutenant general who serves on the House Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees and chairs the House Budget Committee Oversight Task Force, spent part of his morning holding a town hall with staff and meeting with key members of NMCSD’s leadership team.

At the town hall, while discussing the importance of leveraging technology to improve patient outcomes, Bergman said, “One of my biggest concerns, and has been for a long time, is dental readiness.”

The congressman emphasized the important connection between dental rehabilitation and warfighter readiness. “We can make so much improvement there because when our folks look in the mirror and smile...it builds not only physical health but also mental health,” Bergman said.

Bergman’s emphasis on dental rehabilitation and its impact on warfighter readiness underscored another reason for his visit, which was to learn more about NMCSD’s Maxillofacial Restoration Program. Cmdr. Daniel Hammer, oral maxillofacial surgeon and program manager, briefed the congressman on this comprehensive, first of its kind, team-based initiative that integrates advanced surgical techniques with dental rehabilitation to restore health and function to patients recovering from significant facial injuries or conditions ranging from cancer to congenital anomalies.

“During Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, head and neck injuries were actually the second most common injuries after extremity wounds,” said Hammer. “Yet there were no centers of excellence created to sustain care, no registries were established to track outcomes, and very few warfighters were able to have dental rehabilitation, which led to poor speech, swallowing and psychological outcomes. Our program is closing that gap, ensuring service members regain the ability to speak, swallow, and return to duty, restored with purpose.”

Since launching in 2020, the program has treated more than 60 patients with complex facial trauma, head and neck cancer, and severe dental injuries, achieving extraordinary results that support force readiness and long-term wellness for military beneficiaries.

NMCSD’s integrated model brings together more than 125 specialists across nine clinical care pathways, ensuring that every aspect of recovery, from surgery and dental rehabilitation to speech therapy and pain management, is coordinated from day one. The program’s outcomes include:

• 94% return-to-duty rate for active duty service members

• Hospital stays under seven days (compared to the national average of 12–13 days)

• More than 95% of patients discharged with the ability to eat by mouth without feeding tubes

• Minimal pain medication required post-surgery (several patients never require narcotics after surgery)

• Full dental rehabilitation included as part of the surgical plan

• Typical return to full duty within 16 weeks

During his visit, Bergman toured the departments that provide integrated support for the Maxillofacial Restoration Program, including the oral maxillofacial surgery department, hospital dentistry department, pain medicine clinic, and C5 (comprehensive combat and complex casualty care). He also visited the Defense Health Agency’s regional dental lab at Naval Base San Diego where the team fabricates dental appliances and prostheses.

“What sets our Maxillofacial Restoration Program apart is that we don’t just perform surgery, we restore health, function, and quality of life,” said Hammer. “It’s a complete, end-to-end model with no civilian equivalent. From the first consult through full recovery, we are with our patients every step of the way.”

NMCSD’s program is one of the few in the country to offer “Jaw in a Day,” a procedure that combines immediate jaw reconstruction with 3D-printed dental implants, all completed in a single surgery. Hammer’s team at NMCSD performed the DoD’s first such procedure and has now completed more than 30.

The Maxillofacial Restoration Program treats active duty service members from all branches, military retirees, and other TRICARE-eligible beneficiaries, with no out-of-pocket cost for those enrolled in TRICARE Prime.

“We were honored to host Representative Bergman and highlight how we are setting a new standard for what’s possible in facial restoration,” said Capt. Elizabeth Adriano, NMCSD director and Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command San Diego commander. “The innovation, skill, and dedication of this team ensures every patient, every warfighter receives the most comprehensive care available in military medicine.”

During the town hall earlier in the day, Bergman spoke about need for a shared commitment to achieve mission success.

“In any organization, whether military, civilian, government, or private, you have to ask, what’s the most important thing we are here to do?” Bergman said. “In the military, it’s to provide for our national defense and bring together the men and women who choose to serve, in uniform or as civilians, as part of a team focused on one thing: the success of the mission. That mission only succeeds when every person is committed to it.”

It’s that same ethos that is embraced by the maxillofacial restoration team and embodied in the approach NMCSD’s staff take to readiness and patient care.

Tahsin Chowdhury, primary care noncommissioned officer in charge at McNair Army Health Clinic, stressed the importance of service members staying up to date on medical checkups and records.
“Rodeos give health care personnel the opportunity to maintain and sharpen their clinical and administrative skills,” Henderson said.
Max Cross, a medic Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, supported the event to keep service members “ready and rapidly deployable at all times,” he said.
That’s why we hammer in readiness.” At the core of the health readiness rodeo, Chowdhury said, is for all to stay ready for the mission.","National Defense University at Fort Lesley J. McNair hosted a health readiness rodeo on Aug. 4, 2025, welcoming new students as well all service members from across the joint task force–National Capital Region. Rodeos serve as a one-stop shop for staying medically current on exams, immunizations, labs, and profiles, ensuring warfighters can deploy at a moment’s notice.

By 10 a.m., areas of Marshall Hall operated as an efficient flow system, guiding service members from intake to care stations—starting at the registrar for check-in. U.S. Army Capt. Latasha Henderson, clinical nurse officer in charge at Fort McNair Army Health Clinic and detachment officer in charge at Andrew Rader Army Health Clinic, explained, “If they’re not enrolled or don’t have access to (MHS) GENESIS, our representative gets them registered into the electronic health record.” MHS GENESIS is the secure website for 24/7 access to health information, including managing appointments and exchanging messages with your healthcare team.

Comprehensive, efficient care to stay ready

After check-in, service members moved to a station where a record reviewer thoroughly assessed their charts to identify needs for preventive care, such as mammograms, colon cancer screenings, mental health support, or medication refills. Reviewers flagged any issues and referred them to a healthcare provider in the next stage of the rodeo. Providers then addressed those needs on the same day, either by delivering care on site or scheduling future appointments.

U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Tahsin Chowdhury, primary care noncommissioned officer in charge at McNair Army Health Clinic, stressed the importance of service members staying up to date on medical checkups and records. “Let’s say we’re downrange, deployed in theater, and there are dental problems. Now, we have to pull that soldier out of the fight, fly them out of theater to get the care they need, and then fly them back in.”

Readiness rodeos also function as a training ground for medics. “Rodeos give health care personnel the opportunity to maintain and sharpen their clinical and administrative skills,” Henderson said. “They practice mass-readiness operations, which mirror real-world scenarios—making them better prepared for large-scale missions or deployments.”

U.S. Army Spc. Max Cross, a medic Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, supported the event to keep service members “ready and rapidly deployable at all times,” he said. “It’s our job to make sure they have all vaccines up to date.”

“We’re making sure everybody has proper eyewear, that their hearing is good, and that everyone is 100% ready for whatever they’re going to tackle the next day. The medic is there for emotional help, physical help—they’re the jack of all trades,” he added.

Foundation of trust, regardless of rank

Aside from providing these vital health assessments and follow-up care, the rodeo also cultivated an element of trust between patient and provider.

“Warfighters need to trust that medics will keep them healthy, treat injuries quickly and manage conditions effectively,” Henderson said. “This trust allows them to focus on the mission, knowing their medical team has their back when it matters most.”

Medical staff worked at various provider stations to assist service members progressing through the rodeo. In one room, several sat wearing wireless headphones connected to a tablet that conducted hearing tests out of the traditional sound booth. In another, service members received immunizations and lab tests and assessed their vision against a letter chart while a medic clicked the diagnostic lenses into focus.

Those attending the rodeo included lieutenant colonels and above. “These are all senior leaders that are getting ready to take command. They come to the university for only a year, so we try to take care of all their medical readiness on the front end, since their schedules are so busy,” Henderson said.

U.S. Army Sgt.1st Class Marisela Laracuente, the noncommissioned officer in charge of the readiness rodeo, said medics treating leaders is mutually beneficial.

“For the medics it gives them more confidence working with senior officers, and it also helps leaders coming through the rodeos to trust in their medics,” she said. “Since we will be their first line of care downrange, it goes both ways and builds confidence on both sides.”

Screening to stay healthy and ready

While many came seeking care for known issues, the event also uncovered health needs through screenings. Record reviewers flagged abnormal test findings during the rodeo and sent results to providers down the line. Chowdhury described why these preventive screenings are vital to staying fit for the fight: “Maybe they’re over 45 and they needed to get a colonoscopy but forgot to schedule one. This would become apparent during the periodic health assessment. That’s why we hammer in readiness.”

At the core of the health readiness rodeo, Chowdhury said, is for all to stay ready for the mission. “We hold events like this so we can carry on with the mission—winning America’s wars.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9241365/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-21 13:56:20.585491

CPS, which is headquartered in Walnut Creek, Calif., provides behavioral medicine services for individuals and families in the State of California. Since at least 2015, CPS and its healthcare providers have submitted claims to government payors using Current Procedural Terminology codes 90833 and 90836, which are “add-on” codes to be used when psychotherapy services are performed in conjunction with an evaluation and management visit, and which require specific documentation.

The settlement announced today resolves the government’s allegations that, from Jan. 1, 2015, through Dec. 31, 2022, CPS submitted fraudulent claims using these add-on codes in instances where its healthcare providers either had not provided the services described by those codes or had failed to sufficiently document that such services had been provided. CPS will pay $2,615,569.32 to the United States and $134,430.68 to the State of California.

“Providers that participate in federally funded health care programs must abide by the rules and submit proper claims for care that was in fact rendered. To do otherwise is to drain resources from our fellow Americans who rely on Medicare and other government programs. This settlement sends a clear message that we will continue to investigate and pursue any entity that fraudulently seeks to increase profits at taxpayers’ expense,” said United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian.

“Holding health care providers accountable for submitting false claims to Federal health care programs is crucial for ensuring that taxpayer funds are appropriately used and for maintaining the American public’s trust,” said Acting Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey McIntosh of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “Working closely with our law enforcement partners, our agency remains dedicated to protecting taxpayer-funded programs that deliver essential behavioral health services.”

“Today’s outcome concludes a collaborative effort to hold Comprehensive Psychiatric Services accountable for its improper billing practices. These actions undermined our Federal health care system, including the Department of Defense’s TRICARE program,” said John E. Helsing, Acting Special Agent in Charge for the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Western Field Office. “DCIS will continue to work closely with our law enforcement partners and the Department of Justice to investigate health care providers that seek to enrich themselves at the expense of the American taxpayer.”

“Veterans and their families expect and deserve the highest quality healthcare delivered in a safe and accountable setting,” said Special Agent in Charge Dimitriana Nikolov with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General’s Northwest Field Office. “This settlement is a testament to the VA OIG’s commitment to safeguarding the integrity of VA’s healthcare programs and preserving taxpayer funds.”

“False claims increase costs and undermine the integrity of our federal health care programs, including the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program,” said Derek M. Holt, Special Agent in Charge, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General (OPM OIG). “We support the work of our law enforcement partners and colleagues to investigate fraudulent medical billing that wastes taxpayer dollars.”

Assistant U.S. Attorney Kelsey Helland handled this matter for the government, with the assistance of Garland He. The investigation and settlement resulted from a coordinated effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California, HHS-OIG, DCIS, VA OIG, OPM OIG, and the California Department of Justice, Division of Medi-Cal Fraud and Elder Abuse.

The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act. Tips and complaints from all sources about potential fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement can be reported to HHS at 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).

The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only; there has been no determination of liability.

My doctor's in the US had given me a 6-month stock of all the medication I was on so that I would have enough time to find a new doctor and get everything situated. I was on Tricare select and trying to get command sponsored for a long time. It literally took 6 months for them (efmp? If forgot the name) to even look at the paperwork. It wasn't until my husband got his first sergeant involved that they actually started doing anything.

My husband has never PCS'd before and I was really sick for the first four months of being here, and spent a lot of time in and out of the ER, so that definitely slowed down the process with him not having any clue what to do and taking care of me.

But now I just did the initial doctor's appointment to get command sponsored, and she gave me a bunch of referrals. I thought that meant my sponsorship went through, but they're not answering again and it's been two weeks. I called and tried to make doctor's appointments for base providers and was told that all of the referrals had been closed and that their understaffed anyway so I'll just have to find someone off post. Even with select I've been trying to find providers off post and have no clue how. The ones that I found never respond Even after I've sent them intake paperwork and tried to make an appointment. I ran out of medication (thyroid issues) 4 months ago and have just been treating it myself with a range of supplements.

Also, at the initial doctor's appointment for command sponsorship (I honest to God cannot remember what it's called, I'm sorry, I'm freaking out), I told her that I had PCOS/thyroid issues that I've been trying to get treated since 17 (My parents thought religious blessings should be used for everything unless you're actively dying, and then you can go to the hospital... Also there's just a lot of medical incompetence and I've had some unethical doctors, so never really able to get any treatment and I'm 26 now). The doctor sent out for labs and I asked for her to give me a referral to endocrinology and she said we would just wait to see if I actually had it. They called me two days later and informed me that I actually did have dangerously high insulin levels and I said no shit, that's what I told you. But they said that they wouldn't be able to give me a referral to endocrinology or anything until I was sponsored and until my doctor signed off on it which could be weeks.

I'm really confused right now, and I feel really alone here. Basically all the important information I've been able to find has been from other spouses on base. I was so relieved to be able to have insurance that wasn't controlled by my parents / the shitty situation I was in before, and now I'm just really confused and I'm so tired of doing absolutely everything I can with my health/lifestyle to maintain my health and still be told that I need to try harder to lose weight or informed that I have something that I already told them I had. I don't want to keep going around in loops, especially being in a foreign country in a system that I don't understand and not knowing where to go for help.

Sorry, word vomiting, but I've been here for almost a year now and I don't know what to do or if this is normal or really what anyone was saying. They didn't really want to explain it or stay on the phone with me, they just kept passing me around to different offices that were annoyed I was asking questions",,N,0.0,2025-08-21 01:56:19.855327

What You Need to Know: DHCS is rolling out a series of Medi-Cal Rx policy changes starting November 1, 2025, with more extensive coverage restrictions set to take effect January 1, 2026. The changes aim to curb pharmacy spending and improve program integrity but may affect access to preventive and over-the-counter treatments.

The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) has released a notice of upcoming changes to Medi-Cal Rx as part of the 2025-26 state budget. The new rules will be phased in over the coming months, beginning with an update to the coordination of benefits (COB) claims process for Medicare members on November 1, 2025.

Effective November 1, DHCS will adjust how pharmacy claims involving both Medi-Cal and Medicare (known as dual eligible) are submitted and adjudicated to streamline processing. Under the updated rules, pharmacies must submit COB claims with specific NCPDP field codes to ensure Medi-Cal Rx receives the correct payment status and addresses eligibility and payer accuracy

Additional changes effective January 1, 2026, include:

COVID‑19 Tests: Over-the-counter COVID‑19 antigen tests will require prior authorization (PA) for all Medi-Cal members.

Weight Loss Drugs: Medications used solely for weight loss or related indications will be removed from Medi-Cal Rx coverage, with patients likely having to pay out of pocket.

Revisions to OTC coverage for Adults (21+): Reimbursement policies will change for certain OTC products, including prenatal vitamins, multivitamin combinations, single-ingredient vitamins, first- and second-generation antihistamines, and dry eye treatments.

Continuation of Care Exceptions Removed: Claims receiving coverage under previous continuation of care exceptions (e.g., for drugs listed on the Medi-Cal Rx Contract Drugs List) will no longer be accepted.

Therapeutic Alternatives Required: Use of certain non-covered drugs will now require prescribing therapeutically equivalent alternatives listed in the Medi-Cal Rx Contract Drugs List before reimbursement is possible.

Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH. “It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty. “Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist. “Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain. “Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1. Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing:

There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal

Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe

While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated

While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution

Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

HUM, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an edge over CNC, which carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).","A rising proportion of elderly citizens fuels demand for Medicare plans, enabling insurers to tap into a growing senior population. Centene Corporation CNC and Humana HUM — two major managed-care providers, heavily focused on government-sponsored health insurance programs such as Medicaid and Medicare Advantage (“MA”) — are poised to benefit from this demographic tailwind.

Enacted in July 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) aims to simplify and digitize the U.S. healthcare payment system by consolidating medical billing and reducing administrative inefficiencies. Centene and Humana, being major players, face challenges in the form of hampered enrollment, increased administrative costs and reimbursement uncertainty. The new regulatory landscape presents opportunities like developing tailored individual products and expanding into private markets to offset potential Medicaid revenue losses.

Yet, as an investment option, which stock is more attractive? Let’s closely look at the fundamentals of these stocks.

The Case for Centene

Centene is a major player in government-sponsored healthcare, offering services across Medicaid, MA, the ACA Marketplace, Tricare and correctional health. Its scale is reinforced by a broad and growing membership base. Over the years, acquisitions such as Health Net, WellCare and Magellan Health have expanded Centene’s reach and diversified its service portfolio, providing a strong platform for long-term growth.

The company’s Marketplace segment has been a key growth driver, with membership rising 12.4% as of Dec. 31, 2024. However, profitability has come under pressure. A spike in the second-quarter health benefits ratio (HBR) forced management to sharply lower its 2025 earnings guidance to about $1.75 per share, down from the earlier projection of more than $7.00. Results were further weighed down by lower-than-anticipated 2025 risk adjustment transfers and elevated medical utilization, particularly within Medicaid and MA. Enrollment losses in these higher-margin businesses have added to the strain.

Centene’s balance sheet also reflects the costs of its acquisition-led expansion, with long-term debt of $17.6 billion as of June 30, 2025.

Looking ahead, management is focused on recovery. The company intends to reprice its Marketplace plans in 2026 to restore margins, while pursuing disciplined pricing and operational improvements to stabilize MA. These initiatives are expected to drive meaningful progress, with management targeting breakeven in MA by 2027. Despite near-term challenges, Centene’s scale and diversified operations leave it well-positioned to regain profitability and sustain growth in a competitive healthcare landscape.

The Case for Humana

Humana stands as one of the strongest players in the U.S. healthcare insurance sector, with a dominant position in MA, holding nearly 21% market share. The company continues to benefit from favorable demographics, as an aging population sustains steady demand for MA plans. As of June 30, 2025, Humana reported approximately 3.54 million MA members, with continued expansion in both Medicare Advantage and state-based programs driving premium growth.

Diversification beyond traditional insurance remains central to Humana’s strategy. Its CenterWell business—which delivers value-based primary care, pharmacy services, and home health solutions—has gained meaningful traction, enhancing long-term growth visibility and reducing dependence on insurance margins. The company is also leveraging AI-driven efficiencies, disciplined cost management and conservative guidance to strengthen operating performance and restore investor confidence.

Strategic acquisitions have further bolstered Humana’s footprint. Deals for Family Physicians Group, Your Home Advantage and Curo extended its presence in primary care and home health. The acquisition of Enclara built scale in hospice pharmacy, while iCare and Inclusa expanded Medicare and Medicaid offerings in Wisconsin. At the same time, Humana has sharpened its portfolio by divesting non-core assets, most notably by selling a 60% stake in Kindred at Home’s Hospice and Personal Care units to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, while retaining a 40% interest to benefit from the standalone company’s long-term growth.

Supported by stabilizing medical cost trends and stronger-than-expected MA retention, Humana raised its 2025 EPS outlook to about $17 and revenues above $128 billion .

Estimates for CNC and HUM

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CNC’s 2025 revenues implies a year-over-year increase of 16.9% while that for EPS implies a 77% decline. EPS estimates have moved 14.6% southward over the past seven days.

On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for HUM’s 2025 revenues and EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 9.3% and 4.8%, respectively. EPS estimates have moved 0.4% north over the past seven days.

Are CNC and HUM Shares Expensive?

Centene is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 11.61, above its median of 11.18 over the last five years. Humana’s price-to-earnings multiple sits at 19.73, above its median of 17.72 over the last five years.

Conclusion

Centene is expected to face notable headwinds under OBBBA, including reduced membership, tightening profit margins and rising operational costs. The company’s Medicaid business is already strained by increasing expenditures related to behavioral health, home-based care and costly medications.

Humana’s Medicaid business stands to benefit from several contract wins and renewals, which contribute to top-line growth. Despite witnessing strong, consistent performance in its Medicare business in recent quarters, the unit came under stress. With Humana deciding to exit certain unprofitable plans and counties, its individual MA membership might take a hit. Nonetheless, its growing focus on Florida is a major positive.

On the basis of return on equity (“ROE”), which reflects a company’s efficiency in generating profit from shareholders' equity as well as gives a clear picture of the company's financial health, HUM, with a ROE of 16.7%, scores higher than CNC, which has a ROE of 9.6%.

Moreover, shares of HUM have gained 13% year to date, in contrast to the industry and CNC’s decline of 31.6% and 51.8%, respectively, over the same time.

HUM, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has an edge over CNC, which carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

As National Guard and Reserve members near age 60, they reach important milestones in their military retirement pay and benefits. Whether they have been retired awaiting pay or continue drilling until age 60, this transition requires action so benefits begin on time.

Here are four considerations for reserve component members as they approach their 60th birthday.

TRICARE Health Benefits

At 60 years old, reserve component retirees and their eligible family members can start using TRICARE for health and medical needs — the same version as their retired active duty counterparts.

Some reserve component members might have been using TRICARE Reserve Select or Retired Reserve, both of which require premiums. Upon turning 60, retirees become eligible for standard TRICARE plans with much less expensive enrollment fees. Importantly, enrollment fees count toward a family’s catastrophic cap, which further reduces overall health care costs.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Your location can impact the availability of plans, which might include TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Overseas, and the US Family Health Plan.

Reserve component retirees must contact TRICARE within 90 days of turning 60; otherwise, they will need to wait until another qualifying life event or an annual open season to enroll.

Military Retirement Pay

Reserve component members might have retired from active drilling status before this point, but age 60 typically marks the beginning of their retirement pay. Some members might be eligible to start earlier if they completed qualifying periods of active duty. However, no member can receive retirement pay before age 50.

To qualify for military retirement pay, members must have completed at least 20 “good” years of service, as confirmed by their notice of eligibility. Retirement pay does not begin automatically, so retirees must apply in advance. It’s recommended they submit DD forms 108 and 2656 six to nine months before turning 60. Each branch of the reserve component has its own process for submitting retirement pay applications.

[FORM DOWNLOADS: DD 108 | DD 2656]

Survivor Benefit Plan

Depending on the election made when they received their notice of eligibility, retirees might need to make a decision about the military’s Survivor Benefit Plan. This program provides financial security for a spouse or designated beneficiaries after the retiree’s death by continuing a portion of the retirement pay.

If a retiree opts out of the plan or selects reduced coverage, spousal consent is required. This ensures both parties are aware of the potential financial impact of not enrolling in full coverage.

Knowing when to use your medical or dental coverage helps avoid unnecessary costs or delays in care.

“When you need dental care because of an injury, it may be covered under your TRICARE medical plan,” said Douglas Elsesser, TRICARE Dental Program Analyst at the Defense Health Agency. “But this is only if it’s tied to a medical condition and pre-authorized. Knowing the difference can save you time and money.”

Here’s what you should know.

When is dental care considered “medical”?

In some cases, TRICARE medical coverage includes limited dental care known as adjunctive dental care. Adjunctive dental care is treatment you need to support a covered medical condition, injury, or disease. This is different from routine or restorative dental work. Routine and restorative dental work are covered separately under the TRICARE Dental Program, TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program, or other dental insurance.

Here are some examples of adjunctive dental care that TRICARE may cover:

You break your jaw and a dentist removes a tooth to stabilize the fracture.

You need surgery to remove tooth fragments embedded in your tongue after an accident.

You need a restoration—like a crown or bridge—to replace a tooth lost during treatment of a medical condition.

Note: TRICARE requires pre-authorization for any adjunctive dental care unless it’s a medical emergency. Make sure your provider submits a request before you receive care. However, if you simply crack your tooth, TRICARE medical plans won’t cover repairing or replacing it.

What is the TRICARE Dental Program?

The TDP is a separate, premium-based dental plan available to active duty family members, National Guard and Reserve members, and their family members. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, it covers services like:

Checkups and cleanings

Fillings and crowns

Oral surgery and tooth extractions

Sealants and preventive care

Orthodontics, in some cases

You can find more details in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, which outlines which restorative services are covered and which aren’t.

Note: TDP doesn’t cover adjunctive dental care. When you need a dental procedure to treat a medical condition, it falls under your TRICARE medical plan instead—but make sure to get pre-authorization.

Coverage scenarios

Generally, when the care supports a covered medical problem or injury, it qualifies as adjunctive dental care under medical. Otherwise, it falls under dental.

Kellermann,,,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurkellermann/2025/08/20/trumps-first-term-degraded-military-health-his-second-must-rebuild-it/,"The clinical duties that military doctors, nurses, and other health professionals perform in stateside military hospitals helps keep their skills sharp between deployments.
It also allows them to teach and inspire the next generation of military healthcare professionals.
As the wars wound down, they began siphoning military health funding and positions for other DoD priorities.
As a result, spending on military healthcare flattened, and is now far behind healthcare spending in the VA and our nation overall.
If the Pentagon resumes its push to privatize the military health system, it will harm the health of our armed forces and diminish their battlefield performance.","Recently, Senators McConnell (R-KY) and Coons (D-DE) cosponsored a bill to invest more than $850 billion to strengthen our nation’s defense industrial base, upgrade its shipbuilding capabilities, replenish munitions, and support key allies. Although these are worthy goals, Congress and the White House must not overlook the system that safeguards the health of American warfighters - our military’s most important asset.

Last March, the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS), made pointed remarks at the outset of a hearing on stabilizing the military health system:

“In 2019, the military departments implemented drastic cuts to military medical personnel on the faulty assumption that it would be easy for DHA (the Defense Health Agency) to hire civilians to take their places…In 2020, Congress ordered a halt to any additional military medical reductions, but it was too late. A significant number of reductions had already occurred, severely reducing the capability of military hospitals…This has proven more expensive and has sapped the military doctors’ experiences that are vital to maintaining proficiency. Even worse, the Department of Defense (DOD) has refused to request adequate funding for DHA.”

America’s Military Health System Is Unique

Unlike the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) or private healthcare systems, military health must always be ready to deploy uniformed healthcare professionals anywhere in the world in support 0f U.S. combat operations and other missions, including peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance.

To enable this work, the MHS maintains a network of stateside military hospitals and clinics, supplemented by healthcare purchased from private doctors and healthcare systems to treat active-duty service members, their family members, and military retirees. This second mission reinforces the first. The clinical duties that military doctors, nurses, and other health professionals perform in stateside military hospitals helps keep their skills sharp between deployments. It also allows them to teach and inspire the next generation of military healthcare professionals. In times of conflict, military hospitals receive and treat complex casualties. Finally, the high-quality care to wounded, ill and injured servicemembers as well as their families and military retirees helps the DoD recruit and retain its “all-volunteer” force.

Healthy Forces Are Vital For Battlefield Success

Military health has played a key role in American history since the founding of our republic. In the Winter of 1777, General George Washington ordered the inoculation of the Continental Army against smallpox. It was the first time in history that an Army was immunized by command order. Washington also instituted policies on camp cleanliness and took other actions to preserve his army’s fighting strength. The principles he established still guide military medicine to this day.

Health protection is so important to preserving fighting strength that the U.S. military monitors every unit’s “disease and non-battle injury (DNBI)” rates to evaluate the quality of its leadership and medical support.

This discipline paid off in Afghanistan and Iraq. Despite logistical challenges and austere conditions, military medicine drove rates of DNBIs and deaths from severe battlefield wounds to the lowest levels in the history of warfare. It’s one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of American medicine. Many of the innovations they pioneered have been adopted by civilian healthcare.

Post-War Decisions Eroded Hard-Won Gains

Instead of recognizing the value of military health, budget officials in the Pentagon viewed the MHS as little more than an HMO for beneficiaries. As the wars wound down, they began siphoning military health funding and positions for other DoD priorities. As a result, spending on military healthcare flattened, and is now far behind healthcare spending in the VA and our nation overall.

During Trump’s first term, the Pentagon compounded this error by directing military families and retirees to go elsewhere for treatment. Then, as visits and hospital admissions fell, they downsized or closed many military clinics and hospitals. Even top hospitals, such as Walter Reed and Naval Medical Center San Diego, were left underfunded, understaffed, and underutilized. This weakened the link between stateside care and battlefield care.

By the time the Joint Chiefs of Staff realized that privatization had gone too far, the damage was done. In 2023, then Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks issued a directive to reverse course and begin restoring the MHS.

What About Now?

Today, different leaders are in charge. In the past, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has advocated diverting military and veteran healthcare benefits to enhance the Pentagon’s ""war-fighting capability."" Military and veterans’ healthcare IS a warfighting capability. It’s a major reason why American servicemembers fight so hard, accept such risks and reenlist to do it again. Until recently, they knew that every time they were deployed, their families would be cared for by doctors and nurses who understood the stresses of military life. They were also confident that if anyone in their unit became ill or was wounded in battle, they’d receive the best healthcare in the world, expert rehabilitation, and if needed, long-term care.

If the Pentagon resumes its push to privatize the military health system, it will harm the health of our armed forces and diminish their battlefield performance. Two former Hegseth aides said as much in a recent New York Times op-ed:

""Even on the modern high-tech battlefield, war is still a people business. For the Department of Defense, this means it must care for its people along with developing its weapons in order to maintain lethality while also creating an environment that incentivizes Americans to continue to serve. When service members and their families cannot rely on the programs that are intended to ensure their quality of life, it distracts them from their duties, which inevitably limits their effectiveness in combat.”

Novo Nordisk has implemented a global hiring freeze covering job roles that are not critical for its business, Reuters writes. The move comes as the company battles competition from copycat versions of its blockbuster Wegovy obesity drug and it could face layoffs as it battles rising pressure from its main rival, Eli Lilly. Last month, investors wiped $70 billion off the drugmaker’s market value. The reaction came after Novo — which became Europe’s most valuable listed company following the launch of Wegovy in 2021 — issued a profit warning and named a company veteran, Mike Doustdar, as its new chief executive officer. Doustdar, who took the helm on Aug. 7, told Danish broadcaster TV2 on his first day in office that he would look for cost savings throughout the company and also consider layoffs.

Our agents adapt by parsing these responses, isolating plan-specific coverage logic, and surfacing requirements such as visit limits or Primary Care Manager (PCM) referrals. Over time, AI agents improve accuracy by learning from your organization’s historical Tricare verifications, which reduces manual intervention and denial risk.

This new offering addresses the specific needs of active-duty service members struggling with substance use disorders while accommodating the demands of military life.

For more information about the Tricare-approved program, visit https://sayarc.com/services/tricare-approved-iop/

The inpatient detox program complements ARC’s existing Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) for military members. Treatment focuses on addressing underlying causes of substance use through group and individual therapy sessions, with scheduling that accommodates military duties and responsibilities.

Data indicates that military personnel face unique challenges that can contribute to substance use disorders. Studies show that stress, trauma, accessibility of alcohol, peer pressure, and isolation can all play significant roles in the development of addiction among service members. These factors require specialized treatment approaches that understand military culture and lifestyle demands.

ARC’s team includes certified counselors, psychologists, and medical personnel with over 50 years of combined experience who understand these challenges. The program also provides family support to strengthen home environments for service members, recognizing that recovery extends beyond the individual to their support network.

The Tricare-approved status means active-duty military members receive treatment with minimal out-of-pocket costs. ARC staff verify benefits and guide patients through admission, removing barriers to care. This approval ensures that service members can access quality treatment without financial concerns adding to their stress.

With the addition of inpatient detox services, ARC now provides more comprehensive care through the withdrawal process. This expansion creates a continuum from detoxification through ongoing recovery support. The structured environment of inpatient detox offers medical supervision during the critical early stages of recovery, increasing safety and comfort during withdrawal.

The program’s evidence-based treatment methods have been selected specifically for their effectiveness with substance use disorders common among military personnel. By combining medical support with psychological care, ARC addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of addiction recovery.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

Last December, the Biden administration published an interim rule to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 agonists for weight loss.
The Trump administration issued its final rule on 2026 Medicare drug coverage in April and excluded the interim rule's provision that would have allowed coverage of GLP-1 medications for weight loss.
""People are taking GLP-1 drugs -- like Wegovy and Zepbound -- for weight loss now more than ever,"" Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Cordts said in a statement.
Related: Vets Say Weight Loss Drugs Have Improved Their Health, But New Patients Are Out of Luck Story Continues","Military retirees and family members on Tricare for Life, and civilians with access to military hospitals and clinics, will lose coverage for weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound starting Aug. 31, according to the Defense Health Agency.

Military health officials said earlier this month that Medicare-eligible retirees -- those who use Tricare for Life -- and Defense Department civilians and others with access to military hospitals but who aren't on Tricare will no longer be able to get these popular medications through the DoD health system.

Beneficiaries with Tricare Prime, Tricare Select and premium-based Tricare plans will continue to have coverage, but they must meet certain clinical criteria, such as being obese or having obstructive sleep apnea related to their weight, according to the Defense Health Agency.

Tricare for Life, or TFL, provides secondary health coverage to military retirees and their family members on Medicare. As wraparound coverage, TFL was covering those medications, known as glucagon-like peptide-1, or GLP-1, agonists for weight loss in eligible beneficiaries.

But Medicare covers GLP-1 medications only to treat Type 2 diabetes and for cardiovascular disease that may be worsened by a patient's excess weight. It does not cover the drugs prescribed specifically for obesity.

Tricare for Life beneficiaries prescribed these medications for diabetes will retain coverage, according to the Defense Department. Common GLP-1 drugs for diabetes include Ozempic and Mounjaro.

Last December, the Biden administration published an interim rule to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1 agonists for weight loss. The anticipated cost of the coverage for the federal government of the change was $48 billion over 10 years, according to a University of Chicago estimate.

The Trump administration issued its final rule on 2026 Medicare drug coverage in April and excluded the interim rule's provision that would have allowed coverage of GLP-1 medications for weight loss.

Tricare officials said the Defense Health Agency is eliminating coverage for its Tricare for Life beneficiaries and others to ""align with federal coverage requirements.""

""Your provider can work with you to explore all options and determine the best approach for your health needs,"" Tricare officials said in a news release. ""Talk to your provider. You can also visit Health and Wellness for more details on resources that can help you reach your goals.""

GLP-1 medications have been used to treat diabetes for nearly 20 years. They mimic a hormone that is naturally released by the body after eating, triggering the release of insulin from the pancreas, controlling blood sugar levels.

The medications also suppress hunger and slow the digestion process, leading patients to feel full on smaller portions or for longer periods of time after eating.

While patients report weight loss and often improvement in mental health and cognition, these medications can have side effects that include nausea and vomiting, muscle loss and sagging skin.

The Defense Department has not released an exact accounting of the number of GLP-1 prescriptions written for weight loss, but a 2024 report noted that, by late 2023, the drugs made up roughly one-third of all prescription weight-loss medications for active-duty military personnel.

According to the report, 67.3% of active-duty troops were overweight in 2021, with 18.8% of those service members considered clinically obese.

The DoD began including weight-loss drugs in Tricare's formulary in 2018, adding semaglutide, a type of GLP-1 agonist, in 2021.

The out-of-pocket costs for such medications run between $350 and $500 per month, according to the manufacturers.

The Department of Veterans Affairs covers the medications for weight loss for veterans who already have tried less-pricey medications without success; those who also participate in a whole-health approach, including lifestyle modifications and exercise; and those with a body-mass index of 27 or more with at least one weight-related condition or illness; or a BMI of 30 or more.

The Defense Health Agency said beneficiaries affected by the change in coverage will be notified by mail.

""People are taking GLP-1 drugs -- like Wegovy and Zepbound -- for weight loss now more than ever,"" Defense Health Agency Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Cordts said in a statement. ""It's important to understand how -- and why -- Tricare covers these drugs, based on your condition and status.""

Your birth plan is more like a birth suggestion.
You’ll PCS right after the baby arrives.
If you haven’t sobbed quietly while listening to “patriotic flute music” for 47 minutes, did you even give birth on TRICARE?","Giving birth under TRICARE is a unique rite of passage. It’s like childbirth… but with extra paperwork, a rotating cast of med students, and the occasional “Sir, this is a Wendy’s” moment. Whether you were stationed overseas or stuck in the middle of a stateside PCS, these are the all too real truths you only understand if you’ve done your time in the labor and delivery ward, with TRICARE as your birth plan backup.

That amazing doctor you finally clicked with? Yeah, they just got orders to Alaska. Don’t worry—your new provider read half your chart and once watched “Grey’s Anatomy”. You’re in good hands. Probably.

Every appointment, every phone call, every online form. You could be in active labor and still be whispering, “123-45-6789” like it’s a secret code to unlock your epidural.

3. You’re never quite sure what’s “covered” until it’s not.

Ultrasounds? Depends. A birthing tub? Maybe. Skin-to-skin contact? That’ll be $78 unless pre-authorized. But don’t worry, you’ll find out three weeks postpartum when the bill arrives.

4. Your birth plan is more like a birth suggestion.

You can hope for a calm, candlelit delivery… but what you’ll get is fluorescent lights, a shared room, and a corpsman who says, “Are you sure it’s not just gas?”

5. You’ll develop a sixth sense for which nurse is a retired first sergeant.

They don’t say it outright, but their haircut, tone, and ability to command a delivery room without raising their voice give it away. Stand at parade rest accordingly or just start doing push-ups.

6. You’ll PCS right after the baby arrives. Always.

Your newborn’s umbilical stump is still healing, and you’re packing boxes with one hand while breastfeeding with the other. Welcome to TRICARE’s favorite game: Postpartum and Packing Tape.

7. Your maternity leave starts… now.

Even if it wasn’t supposed to. Whether you’re active duty or a spouse, someone’s chain of command thinks six weeks is “plenty of time.” Spoiler: it’s not. Bonus points if they ask if you’re “well rested” yet.

8. You’ll spend more time on hold with DEERS than in actual labor.

If you haven’t sobbed quietly while listening to “patriotic flute music” for 47 minutes, did you even give birth on TRICARE?

9. Your lactation consultant is moonlighting as an artillery instructor.

She’s kind. She’s thorough. She has a laminated flipbook. And she’ll fix your latch like she’s briefing a mortar team under fire.

10. Despite the chaos, the system somehow works.

It’s not always pretty. It’s rarely smooth. But between the mix-ups, midwives, and moments of laughter, TRICARE does help bring military babies into the world, and that’s worth something. Especially if they finally fix the billing codes.

If you’ve survived this miracle-meets-madness saga, congrats. You’re not just a parent, you’re a Mighty Mom now. And if anyone asks about your birth story?

Business Update

Norovirus Challenge Study to Commence in 4Q25

Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:COCP) is developing CDI-988 as a prophylaxis and treatment for norovirus, coronavirus, and other viral infections. The company recently presented results from the Phase 1a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) trial at the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium. The data showed that all doses, ranging from 100 mg to 1200 mg, were well tolerated. The rate of treatment-emergent adverse events was actually lower among CDI-988 subjects compared to placebo subjects in both the SAD (28% vs. 40%) and MAD (53% vs. 92%) cohorts. Importantly, there were no severe treatment-emergent adverse events, no clinically relevant ECG changes, and no clinically significant pathology results.

The Phase 1 trial was conducted in Australia. Cocrystal has filed an IND with the U.S. FDA in order to proceed with clinical trials in the U.S. and we expect clearance of the IND in September 2025. The company is then planning to conduct a Phase 1b coronavirus challenge study in the fourth quarter of 2025 to produce proof-of-concept data for CDI-988 as a preventative and a treatment. Outcomes that will be monitored include PK, symptoms, and viral shedding. Results of the study will dictate what future trials the company will pursue.

There are no approved therapies for norovirus infection, which is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are an estimated 685 million cases and 200,000 deaths caused by norovirus infection each year worldwide. In the U.S., norovirus infection causes over 2 million outpatient clinical visits annually and approximately 100,000 hospitalizations. Norovirus prevention and/or therapy is particularly relevant for the military, where a pathogen of that nature can result in significant operational risks. There are multiple military installations, for instance on navy vessels, where norovirus could spread rapidly and possibly hinder combat readiness. Due to this, work on CDI-988 may qualify for various military-sponsored grants or other funding mechanisms, however we are unaware of any specifics at this point.

CDI-988 was developed using Cocrystal’s proprietary drug discovery platform technology. It binds to a highly conserved region in the active site of noroviruses and coronaviruses 3CL viral proteases and exhibits pan-viral activity against pandemic norovirus and coronavirus strains.

Phase 2a Trial of CC-42344 Extended

In December 2024, Cocrystal announced that the Phase 2a clinical trial of its oral PB2 inhibitor, CC-42344, will be extended due to unexpectedly low infection rates among trial participants that were challenged with a H3N2 influenza strain. The Phase 2a trial initiated in December 2023 and completed enrollment in May 2024 with 78 total participants. It is a single center study being conducted in the U.K. designed to test the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), antiviral activity, and clinical measurements of CC-42344.

The results of the trial showed that CC-42344 had a favorable safety and tolerability profile as no participants had serious adverse events or discontinued the trial due to drug-related adverse events, however due to the low infectivity rate the virology results were not interpretable. The company will be working with the contract research organization to amend the trial protocol to help ensure that there is a higher infectivity rate during the rest of the study. We anticipate updates from the company on the trial as warranted.

Background on CC-42344

CC-42344 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza A. It targets subunit PB2, which along with PA and PB1 forms the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is essential for viral replication in cells by replicating the viral RNA segments and transcribing their genes, which makes it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. The following figure shows CC-42344 binding to the highly conserved active site of the PB2 protein in different influenza strains.

Binding to this conserved active site leads to broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple Influenza A strains, including both pandemic and seasonal strains. The following table shows the strains that CC-42344 is active against, which includes strains that are resistant to oseltamivir and baloxavir.

Financial Update

On August 14, 2025, Cocrystal announced financial results for the second quarter of 2025. As expected, the company did not report any revenues in the second quarter of 2025. R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were $1.1 million, compared to $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of clinical trial costs. G&A expenses in the second quarter of 2025 were $1.0 million, compared to $1.1 million for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in salaries and wages.

As of June 30, 2025, Cocrystal had approximately $4.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, which we estimate is enough to fund operations through the end of 2025. As of August 12, 2025, Cocrystal had approximately 10.3 million shares outstanding and, when factoring in stock options and warrants, a fully diluted share count of 11.0 million shares.

Conclusion

Following the successful Phase 1 SAD and MAD studies of CDI-988, we look forward to the results from the norovirus challenge study, which if the study is able to initiate in the fourth quarter of 2025 we anticipate in the first quarter of 2026. Next steps for the program will be dependent on the results obtained from that study, thus it could serve as a large inflection point for the company. With no changes to our model our valuation remains at $8 per share.

Musculoskeletal injuries, such as strains, sprains, fractures, and overuse injuries, are leading causes of limited duty or training restrictions among military personnel. Recovery from these injuries is multifaceted, requiring medical care, modified activity, rest, and an element that is often overlooked—nutrition.

According to Defense Health Agency–Public Health, more than 95% of active duty military personnel’s injuries are musculoskeletal and are the leading reason for military medical visits.

The most common type of musculoskeletal injury found in military health care records is cumulative microtrauma injury, often referred to as overuse injuries, said U.S. Army Maj. Shay Lopez, the Injury Prevention branch chief at DHA-PH.

“It is important for service members to allow injuries to heal completely before returning to duty,” said Lopez. “If an injury is not healed properly, there is an increased risk for another injury. Prior injury is one of strongest predictors for future injury.”

Developing an intentional recovery plan is a key step to returning to full duty.

“Service members need to modify their activities and follow an intentional recovery plan prior to returning to their full duties,” said Lopez.

An important element of the recovery plan is nutritional intervention, said Jennifer Meeks, DHA-PH nutritionist.

“Nutritional interventions will help the injury recovery process by supporting optimal healing,” said Meeks. “The faster a service member or athlete recovers from injury, the quicker they can return to duty or the training field. Optimal nutrition should be the focus to get back to preinjury performance after a musculoskeletal injury.”

Proactive nutrition before an injury focuses on performance nutrition, disease prevention, and immune system enhancement, said Meeks. Reactive nutrition is specific to medical nutrition therapy after injury to control inflammation, rebuild injured tissue, minimize muscle loss, and prevent unwanted weight gain.

“Even if your preinjury eating habits weren’t perfect, a focus on making more healthful choices during your recovery can have tremendous benefits,” said Meeks.

Here are some tips to consider.

1. Energy needs during recovery: During your recovery time, your activity levels will be lower than usual. Even if you're not as active, you still need enough calories to help your body heal from wounds and injuries. Not getting enough food can delay your healing, drain your energy, and lead to unwanted loss of weight or muscle. To learn how many calories you need, experts can measure your resting metabolism or estimate calorie needs using special formulas. Your body needs fuel to heal, but you may not need as many calories as you normally would. If you need to cut back on calories, focus on reducing carbohydrates and fats, but make sure you still eat enough protein to help your body repair itself. You might need to adjust what and how much you eat over time to avoid gaining weight. Talking to a sports dietitian can help you figure out the right number of calories and create a personalized eating plan that includes the right balance of protein, fat, and carbs.

2. Protein: The cornerstone of healing: There are numerous academic studies highlighting the importance of protein for muscle repair, immune defense, and maintaining lean mass. The Joint Service regulation, Nutrition and Menu Standards for Human Performance Optimization, recommends 0.8 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram (or 0.36 to 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight) of body weight for normal activity. This equates to a protein range of 68 to 136 grams per day for men and 55 to 110 grams per day for women.

How much protein do you need when injured?

When you're injured, it's recommended to eat more protein–about 1.5 to 2 grams of protein for every kilogram you weigh each day. The exact amount varies from person to person and depends on your activity level. Studies show that eating an increased amount of protein helps you recover faster. For example, someone who weighs 180 pounds (about 81 kilograms) would need around 122–163 grams of protein per day.

It's best to spread your protein intake throughout the day, eating some at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in snacks. This helps your muscles rebuild. For a 180-pound person, aim for about 30 grams of protein at each meal and 15–20 grams in snacks. For example, 30 grams of protein equals 1.5 cups of Greek yogurt, 1 cup of cottage cheese, 5 large eggs, 5 ounces of salmon, a scoop of third-party certified protein powder in a smoothie, 1.5 cups of lentils, or 4 ounces of chicken breast. Some meal ideas might be a Greek yogurt parfait with berries, a bean and veggie burrito, egg muffin cups with chopped veggies, or salmon with avocado toast. To boost your protein intake, try some of these easy tips:

• Start your day with meals featuring eggs, yogurt, or cottage cheese to kickstart your protein intake early.

• Choose high-protein snacks to keep you full between meals: Options include raw nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs, or cheese.

• Add legumes to your meals: Whether it's a soup, stew, or salad, throwing in beans, lentils, or chickpeas can significantly increase the protein content.

• Swap out traditional carbs for high-protein alternatives: Replace rice or pasta with options like quinoa or legumes to add more protein to your plate.

• Sprinkle on seeds or nuts: Toppings like chia seeds, flaxseeds, or raw nuts not only enhance flavor but also provide a solid protein boost along with healthy fats.

It's also a good idea to have 15–30 grams of protein after rehab or therapy to help your muscles recover. Good options include chocolate milk, a turkey sandwich on whole grain bread, or a recovery shake.

3. Eat colorful fruits & veggies to help heal: Eating fruits and vegetables packed with antioxidants can help reduce swelling, control inflammation, and speed up your recovery. Great choices include goji berries, blueberries, tart cherries, dark chocolate, pecans, artichokes, kidney beans, cranberries, blackberries, and green tea. Pineapple, turmeric, garlic, and ginger are also good sources.

Vitamin C, zinc, calcium, and vitamin D are key nutrients for healing. While all nutrients are important, vitamin C and zinc are superstars for healing. Vitamin C helps your body make collagen, a protein needed to repair tendons, ligaments, and surgical wounds. You can find vitamin C in citrus fruits, strawberries, kiwi, baked potatoes, broccoli, and bell peppers. Zinc helps with cell growth and wound healing. Good sources of zinc include meat, fish, poultry, dairy, whole grains, fortified bread and cereals, beans, peas, nuts, and seeds.

Calcium and vitamin D are essential for strong bones. You can get vitamin D from milk, yogurt, fortified soy milk, dark leafy greens, sunlight, or supplements. It's a good idea to check your vitamin D levels after an injury to see if you need to increase your intake.

4. Fats: friend, not foe: While some fats can contribute to inflammation, healthy fats are critical during recovery. Omega-3 fatty acids may increase muscle repairs and prevent muscle loss during a time of recovery.

• Prioritize omega-3 fatty acids in your diet for their anti-inflammatory properties. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, walnuts, flaxseed, chia, olive oil, avocados, fish, nuts, and seeds.

• Limit excessive omega-6 fats (found in fried or processed foods) that may worsen inflammation.

5. Skip the alcohol and stay hydrated: While you’re recovering from an injury, it's best to avoid alcohol because it can slow down the healing process. Alcohol can interfere with muscle repair, wound healing, and can even lead to muscle loss.

Staying hydrated is also crucial for recovery. Dehydration can hinder healing, reduce the delivery of nutrients to your body, and make you feel more tired. Men should aim for 96–144 ounces of water per day (12–18 cups), and women should aim for 64–96 ounces (8–12 cups). Keep in mind that these amounts can vary depending on the environment, your activity level, and other factors. To make hydration more enjoyable, try adding fruit to create infused water, or opt for flavored sparkling water.

6. Supplements: use with caution: Some supplements may support healing. Consult with a registered dietitian and check out the resources on the Operation Supplement Safety webpage to find more information. Here are two supplements that may be helpful to consider:

• Creatine monohydrate: May help preserve muscle mass during immobilization.

• Vitamin D: Supplement if levels are low, especially in indoor or northern duty stations.

Only use supplements certified by third-party testing programs. Look for these seals: BSCG Certified Drug Free, Informed Sport, NSF Certified Sport, and USP Verified.

Getting back on your feet after a musculoskeletal injury isn't just about rest and rehab—it's also about eating right. Service members need to focus on their nutrition to shorten recovery time, stay ready for duty, and get back to full strength.

Nutrition is key to healing and rehabilitation. Following practical eating guidelines can help reduce problems after surgery and minimize muscle loss during recovery. Whether you're recovering from a stress fracture or surgery, what you eat can help you heal faster and stronger.

For personalized advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic, or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.

Knowing when to use your medical or dental coverage helps avoid unnecessary costs or delays in care.

“When you need dental care because of an injury, it may be covered under your TRICARE medical plan,” said Douglas Elsesser, TRICARE Dental Program Analyst at the Defense Health Agency. “But this is only if it’s tied to a medical condition and pre-authorized. Knowing the difference can save you time and money.”

Here’s what you should know.

When is dental care considered “medical”?

In some cases, TRICARE medical coverage includes limited dental care known as adjunctive dental care. Adjunctive dental care is treatment you need to support a covered medical condition, injury, or disease. This is different from routine or restorative dental work. Routine and restorative dental work are covered separately under the TRICARE Dental Program, TRICARE Active Duty Dental Program, or other dental insurance.

Here are some examples of adjunctive dental care that TRICARE may cover:

You break your jaw and a dentist removes a tooth to stabilize the fracture.

You need surgery to remove tooth fragments embedded in your tongue after an accident.

You need a restoration—like a crown or bridge—to replace a tooth lost during treatment of a medical condition.

Note: TRICARE requires pre-authorization for any adjunctive dental care unless it's a medical emergency. Make sure your provider submits a request before you receive care. However, if you simply crack your tooth, TRICARE medical plans won’t cover repairing or replacing it.

What is the TRICARE Dental Program?

The TDP is a separate, premium-based dental plan available to active duty family members, National Guard and Reserve members, and their family members. As described in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, it covers services like:

Checkups and cleanings

Fillings and crowns

Oral surgery and tooth extractions

Sealants and preventive care

Orthodontics, in some cases

You can find more details in the TRICARE Dental Program Handbook, which outlines which restorative services are covered and which aren’t.

Note: TDP doesn’t cover adjunctive dental care. When you need a dental procedure to treat a medical condition, it falls under your TRICARE medical plan instead—but make sure to get pre-authorization.

Coverage scenarios

Generally, when the care supports a covered medical problem or injury, it qualifies as adjunctive dental care under medical. Otherwise, it falls under dental.

Scenario Type of Coverage Routine tooth cleaning or filling Dental Root canal due to infection Dental Braces for cosmetic reasons Dental Tooth removal after facial trauma Medical—with pre-authorization Surgery for a jaw fracture Medical—with pre-authorization Removal of tooth fragments from soft tissue Medical—with pre-authorization

Know before you go

For military service members, veterans, and their families, finding specialized and accessible addiction and mental health treatment can feel like a mission with a complex set of orders. You've served our nation with honor, and now it's time to find a program that serves you and your loved ones with the same dedication and understanding. In the vast and vibrant landscape of Orange County, California, numerous treatment centers provide world-class care, but the process of navigating insurance—especially Tricare West and its partner, TriWest Healthcare Alliance—is a critical first step. This comprehensive guide, forged from decades of experience in the field, will cut through the confusion, providing a clear and compassionate roadmap to finding the right rehab that accepts Tricare West and ensuring you get the comprehensive, people-first care you've earned.

The journey to recovery is deeply personal and requires a treatment plan as unique as your own experience. It's not about a one-size-fits-all solution; it's about finding a facility that understands the specific challenges faced by military families, from combat-related trauma and PTSD to the stresses of deployment, relocation, and reintegration. Our goal here is to empower you with the knowledge to make an informed decision, leading to a long-lasting, successful recovery. We'll delve into the intricacies of coverage, the types of programs available, and the essential questions to ask, all while demonstrating the core principles of E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness).

Understanding the Foundation: Tricare West and TriWest Healthcare Alliance

One of the most common points of confusion for those seeking care is the distinction between Tricare West and TriWest Healthcare Alliance. Understanding this relationship is foundational to finding a treatment center that can work seamlessly with your benefits. Think of it as a crucial chain of command for your healthcare.

Tricare West is the actual health insurance program. As a component of the broader Tricare system—the healthcare program of the U.S. Department of Defense—it provides comprehensive health coverage for active-duty and retired military personnel, their families, and other eligible beneficiaries in the western United States, which includes all of California. It is your benefit, the promise of care.

TriWest Healthcare Alliance is the private company contracted by the Department of Defense to manage and administer Tricare's healthcare services in the West Region. When you're searching for a provider, you are essentially looking for a facility that is ""in-network"" with or ""authorized by"" TriWest Healthcare Alliance, as they are the administrative bridge that connects you to the Tricare benefits you've earned. They are the logistics arm, ensuring smooth operations.

In short: Tricare West is your insurance. TriWest Healthcare Alliance is the administrator that connects you to the care. They are the gatekeepers to the network of civilian providers.

The Scope of Coverage: A Full Spectrum of Care

The great news is that Tricare West offers robust, comprehensive coverage for addiction and mental health treatment. This isn't a basic, bare-bones benefit; it's designed to provide a full spectrum of care, from initial crisis intervention and medical detox to long-term aftercare and relapse prevention. The core principle is that if a treatment is medically necessary and provided by an authorized, in-network provider, it is covered. This includes a wide array of services that address not just the physical aspect of addiction but the psychological and emotional components as well.

Finding the Right Fit: A Step-by-Step Guide to a Successful Search

Your search for a Tricare West drug rehab center in Orange County should be methodical and purpose-driven. Simply finding a list of centers isn't enough; you need to find the right facility that aligns with your specific and deeply personal needs. This process requires a bit of introspection and a lot of due diligence.

Step 1: Deeply Understand Your Unique Needs

Before you even start looking at websites or making phone calls, ask yourself some crucial, honest questions:

What is the primary substance or issue? Are you seeking outpatient alcohol rehab programs Tricare West Orange County or treatment for a different substance? Are you dealing with a substance use disorder that is intertwined with a trauma history? Be specific. The more you know, the better you can find a tailored program.

What level of care do you truly need? This is perhaps the most important question. Choosing the wrong level of care can be a setback.

Inpatient/Residential Treatment: This is a live-in program where you receive 24/7 care in a structured, therapeutic environment. It is the highest level of care and is ideal for severe addiction, those with unstable living situations, or individuals with significant co-occurring mental health disorders. If this is your need, you'd be looking for a TriWest Healthcare Alliance inpatient treatment facility in Orange County.

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP): A step down from residential care, PHP offers intensive daily treatment (often 5-6 hours a day, 5 days a week) while allowing you to return home at night. It provides a bridge between residential and less intensive care.

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) & Outpatient Programs (OP): These provide the most flexibility, allowing you to live at home and maintain work or family responsibilities while attending therapy sessions multiple times a week. This is where you would find outpatient rehab programs accepting TriWest Healthcare Alliance in Orange County. These are perfect for those with a strong support system at home and less severe addiction.

Are there co-occurring mental health conditions? This is a critical factor, especially for military personnel and veterans. Many people, particularly those with combat or service-related trauma, struggle with dual diagnosis treatment Tricare West Orange County. This means treating both addiction and an underlying mental health disorder like PTSD, depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. A quality program must be equipped to handle both simultaneously, as treating only one without the other significantly increases the risk of relapse.

A Deeper Look at the Types of Treatment Covered by Tricare West

The scope of services covered is impressively broad, ensuring a complete and integrated path to recovery. This reflects a deep understanding of the complexity of addiction and mental health.

Comprehensive Detoxification Services

The first and most critical step for most individuals is medical detox. A Tricare West detox center in Orange County provides a medically supervised environment where the body is safely and comfortably cleared of substances. This is a vital stage, as withdrawal can be dangerous and extremely uncomfortable without professional medical oversight. Tricare West covers both inpatient and outpatient detox services when they are deemed medically necessary by a qualified professional. A reputable center will not only manage the physical symptoms but also provide comfort and psychological support during this vulnerable time.

The Power of Residential and Inpatient Care

This level of care is the most intensive and offers a structured, supportive environment away from the triggers of daily life. An inpatient rehab covered by Tricare West near Orange County typically includes a holistic suite of services:

Individual Therapy: One-on-one sessions with a licensed therapist to address the root causes of addiction, including past trauma, unresolved grief, and negative coping mechanisms.

Group Therapy: These sessions are professionally facilitated and build a vital sense of community. They provide a safe space for shared understanding, accountability, and peer support.

Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT): The use of FDA-approved medications combined with counseling and behavioral therapies is a powerful, evidence-based approach for opioid and alcohol use disorders, and Tricare West fully supports it. This is not a crutch, but a proven tool that dramatically improves outcomes.

Specialized Therapies: Look for centers that offer modalities like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for trauma, and other evidence-based practices.

Holistic and Wellness Programs: Many top-tier centers include yoga, mindfulness, art therapy, and nutritional counseling to heal the mind, body, and spirit.

Flexibility and Community: Outpatient and Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP)

For those who have completed a higher level of care or have a less severe condition, outpatient programs offer a crucial bridge to long-term recovery. Tricare West covers both standard and intensive outpatient programs. The key here is finding a program with a structured curriculum, a robust aftercare plan, and a blend of individual, group, and family therapy. These programs allow you to re-integrate into your daily life while still receiving consistent, professional support.

Specialty Programs for Military and Veterans

Given the unique population it serves, it's vital to find a facility that understands military culture and the specific traumas associated with service. Look for programs that specialize in treating:

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Many veterans and military members use substances to self-medicate the crippling symptoms of PTSD. A comprehensive program will offer trauma-informed care and therapies designed to address the underlying trauma, such as EMDR or Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT).

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI): TBI can often co-occur with substance use and requires a specialized, neuro-informed approach.

Family & Dependent Programs: The stress of military life impacts the entire family unit. Does TriWest Healthcare Alliance cover addiction treatment for military dependents? The answer is a resounding yes. Finding a program that offers family therapy is a crucial part of the healing process for everyone involved, addressing issues of codependency, communication breakdowns, and shared trauma.

The E-E-A-T Principle: Vetting Your Potential Provider

When you're searching for the perfect TriWest Healthcare Alliance mental health rehab in Orange County, you're looking for more than just a name on a list. You're looking for a facility that demonstrates Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T). This isn't just a buzzword; it's a measure of quality and reliability.

Experience: A clinic with a proven track record of successfully treating military members and veterans will have a deep understanding of your unique challenges. Ask about their history and their success rates.

Expertise: Look for a multidisciplinary team of licensed professionals, including doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, and certified addiction counselors. Ask about their specialized training in military-specific issues and their use of evidence-based therapies.

Authoritativeness: A reputable center will be accredited by a respected third-party organization like The Joint Commission or CARF (Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities). These accreditations are a gold standard for quality and safety.

Trustworthiness: Read testimonials and independent reviews on platforms like Google or Psychology Today. Call the facility and talk to an admissions specialist. Do they sound knowledgeable? Are they empathetic? Do they seem genuinely invested in your recovery, or are they simply trying to get you in the door? A trustworthy provider will be transparent about their program, staff credentials, and financial policies.

Verifying Your Benefits: The Crucial Next Step for Peace of Mind

After you've identified a few potential addiction treatment centers that accept Tricare West in Orange County, the next step is to verify your benefits. This is a simple but essential process that a reputable center's admissions team should be able to handle for you, free of charge.

Contact the Center's Admissions Team: Call the facility's admissions line. A human connection is always better than an online form.

Provide Your Information: They will need your name, date of birth, and your Tricare ID number. This allows them to access your benefit information.

Wait for Verification: Their team will contact TriWest Healthcare Alliance to verify your coverage, including your specific plan, co-pays, deductibles, and any pre-authorization requirements. This ensures you know exactly what to expect financially before you begin treatment, eliminating any unexpected costs.

Conclusion: A Path to Healing and Hope

The road to recovery is a testament to strength and resilience. For those who have served, it's an act of courage as profound as any on the battlefield. Finding the right residential rehab facilities that take Tricare West near Anaheim or anywhere else in Orange County is about finding a sanctuary where you can heal from the invisible wounds of service and addiction.

Remember, you don't have to navigate this alone. By understanding your Tricare West benefits and partnering with a trusted and experienced treatment center, you can successfully complete your mission to reclaim your life. The time for healing is now.

This may seem like a silly question but tbh I’ve never had health insurance other then Medicaid and that way pretty plain and simple. First of all with tricare select-family we don’t need a pcm right? We just find an in network provider and make appointments? I have 2 children and one on the way. For an obgyn appointment, just the same thing? What’s the copay for a pediatrician appointment and an obgyn appointment? Since we don’t have a pcm am I still required to get a primary care physician? If anyone could just tell me everything they know about tricare select, and especially how to use it, honestly that would be so incredibly helpful. Thank you!",,N,0.0,2025-08-19 05:56:08.507805
