All counties are affected.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates: https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather

While I have a VERY ROBUST VA system in my area, it still ... - Reddit",Not Available,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/comments/1mzlim5/im_a_100_disabled_veteran_while_i_have_a_very/,"The only time a veteran can elect either Tricare or VA health care is if they retired from the military, either medical retirement, regular retirement, or reserve/national guard retirement with age requirements met.
VA Healthcare is VA. You may want to look into Community Care through the VA.
The problem isn’t contained to the VA. VA access wise is somewhat faster than the civilian side if you compare point of referral to intervention (surgery).
My VA system isn’t very good in Northern NJ.
A good option if the VA care sucks where you live, you have a family to cover and you can’t afford private health insurance.","You were told incorrectly. The only time a veteran can elect either Tricare or VA health care is if they retired from the military, either medical retirement, regular retirement, or reserve/national guard retirement with age requirements met.

The veterans who are 100% P&T but do not meet those standards cannot elect Tricare.

Tricare is DOD. VA Healthcare is VA.

You may want to look into Community Care through the VA.

The problem isn’t contained to the VA.

VA access wise is somewhat faster than the civilian side if you compare point of referral to intervention (surgery).

Basically the VA answers to congress and the executive branch, but hospital systems answer to shareholders and patients/insurance companies.

It’s largely why if you have an amazing PPO that pays well a lot of groups will find a slot for you to keep you in the system, whereas if you have Medicare solo or Tricare since it’s pretty much shit reimbursement depending on how shady the system is you might go in the regular line. Obviously if you have something urgent no one is doing anything unethical.

Example, I needed to see ENT for sinus problems. My local area healthcare system has a chronic problem of having enough surgeons, not enough OR time slots and way too many patients. It’s basically each surgeon getting a half day OR slot one day a week right now at multiple hospitals and surgery centers.

The VA has a problem with not enough surgeons, but a ton of OR time slots. So you get bogged down on the referral wait, but it eases up after the visit.

I still went to the regular health system though since my rule is anything close to the brain goes to the university and the VA didn’t offer stealth.

Also, most ROBUST VAs are staffed by your local academic hospital so you’re largely getting the same specialty care so it’s really just same doctors different scrubs. So a lot of the time it just makes no sense for me to pay a copay at the university and wait in the same line when I can just go to the VA, not pay a copay but wait in the same line.

I find that VA primary care does a better job than normal people family medicine. VA primary care has longer time slots, pharmacy takes more of an active role to prevent interactions instead of relying on your doctor to interface with Costco and hoping that they notice that one medication you got from Walgreens that interacts with one of your Costco medications.

Obviously a lot of this doesn’t apply to you with Tricare, but it paints the picture pretty well enough.

My VA system isn’t very good in Northern NJ. Thankfully, I have amazing private insurance through my employer and I can be seen the same day by a specialist if need be. My primary care physician is amazing and she has helped me way more than the VA has over the years.

The only thing I go to the VA for is to replace my hearing aids. I’m retired and honestly, my family gets great care and while not cheap, it’s totally worth it.

Edit: As for Tricare… I had it after returning from deployment and while it was cheap, the process of getting care from specialists was tedious. A good option if the VA care sucks where you live, you have a family to cover and you can’t afford private health insurance.",,N,0.0,2025-08-25 12:56:08.996766

It's crucial to understand the nuances: Emergency Care: If you experience a medical emergency while overseas, TRICARE will typically cover the necessary care.
Non-Emergency Care: TRICARE typically does not cover non-emergency medical care received internationally.
Even with TRICARE, purchasing supplemental travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international travel.
Travel insurance can help cover expenses not included under TRICARE, such as: Non-emergency medical care: Routine check-ups or treatments for pre-existing conditions.","TRICARE, the health insurance program for military members, retirees, and their families, offers comprehensive coverage within the United States. However, its coverage for international travel is a complex issue, varying significantly depending on several factors. This guide will delve into the specifics, answering common questions and clarifying the intricacies of TRICARE's international health benefits.

What Does TRICARE Cover Overseas?

TRICARE's coverage for international travel is not a simple ""yes"" or ""no."" It depends heavily on the circumstances of the travel and the specific TRICARE plan you're enrolled in. Generally, TRICARE can cover emergency care received while traveling internationally, but this isn't automatic. It's crucial to understand the nuances:

Emergency Care: If you experience a medical emergency while overseas, TRICARE will typically cover the necessary care. However, you'll likely need to pay upfront and then file for reimbursement. The process and amount of reimbursement can vary.

Non-Emergency Care: TRICARE typically does not cover non-emergency medical care received internationally. Routine check-ups, elective procedures, and pre-existing condition treatment generally aren't covered under standard TRICARE plans when outside the U.S.

Authorized Travel: For individuals on authorized military assignments or deployments overseas, TRICARE coverage is usually more extensive and aligned with the specifics of the assignment. Coverage details should be addressed in orders or through the military chain of command.

Plan Variations: The different TRICARE plans (Prime, Select, Reserve Select, etc.) have varying levels of coverage and cost-sharing responsibilities for international care, even in emergencies. Understanding your specific plan's benefits is critical.

What if I Need Urgent Care While Traveling Abroad?

If you require urgent or emergency medical care while traveling internationally, here's what you should do:

Seek immediate medical attention: Your health is the priority. Go to the nearest appropriate medical facility.

Document everything: Keep copies of all medical bills, receipts, and documentation regarding the care received. This is vital for reimbursement claims.

Contact TRICARE: Once you're stable, contact TRICARE to initiate the claims process. Be prepared to provide detailed information about the incident and the medical care.

Understand your plan: Before traveling, review your TRICARE plan's international coverage details carefully. Understanding your responsibilities and limitations is crucial.

Does TRICARE Cover Evacuation from a Foreign Country?

TRICARE's coverage for medical evacuation from a foreign country is also dependent on the circumstances. In many instances, medical evacuation is covered under certain circumstances, particularly for emergency situations where the care isn't available locally. However, this is usually subject to certain pre-approvals and requirements. Again, contacting TRICARE directly before international travel is advisable to clarify the conditions under which medical evacuation is covered.

What About Travel Insurance for TRICARE Beneficiaries?

Even with TRICARE, purchasing supplemental travel insurance is highly recommended, especially for international travel. Travel insurance can help cover expenses not included under TRICARE, such as:

Non-emergency medical care: Routine check-ups or treatments for pre-existing conditions.

Trip cancellations or interruptions: Unexpected events that force you to cut your trip short.

Lost or stolen baggage: Protection against financial losses due to lost belongings.

Comprehensive travel insurance can offer peace of mind and protect you from significant out-of-pocket costs, supplementing the coverage you receive from TRICARE.

How Can I Learn More About TRICARE International Coverage?

The best source of information is the official TRICARE website. They provide detailed information on specific plan benefits, claims procedures, and international coverage guidelines. You can also contact TRICARE customer service directly to ask specific questions about your circumstances and plan.

Remember, proactive preparation is crucial. Understanding TRICARE's international coverage before you embark on your journey will save you time, stress, and potentially significant financial burden. Don't rely on assumptions—check the official information sources and plan accordingly.",https://www.mos.vwv.co.uk/image/does-tricare-cover-international-travel.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-08-25 12:56:26.446899

Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., would ensure premium-free medical insurance coverage is provided for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.

If passed, the Healthcare for our Troops Act would give Guard and Reserve members access to no-fee health care through TRICARE Reserve Select.

Currently, TRS charges a fee for medical and dental coverage.

Health care coverage is critical to increasing long-term readiness and strengthening efforts to recruit and retain service members.

“The National Guard is continually on the front lines both at home and abroad. Comprehensive healthcare is not a benefit; it’s a necessity for readiness,” said retired Maj. Gen. Francis M. McGinn, the NGAUS president.

“Our Guard members need this, and our nation needs them. I thank Senator Baldwin and her staff for their dedication to the National Guard and for their work on this effort.”

In remarks made at the 147th NGAUS General Conference & Exhibition in Milwaukee, Aug. 23, Baldwin noted that about 130,000 Guardsmen and Reservists lack private health insurance.

“I believe it is morally wrong. It is bad for preparedness and readiness. And, yes, we need to change it,” Baldwin told the audience.

Baldwin was the 2025 recipient of the Harry S. Truman Award, the association’s most prestigious honor. [Video of Baldwin’s remarks can be found here. They begin at 13:25.]

Besides expanding TRS, the bill would strengthen military readiness by ensuring access to needed physicals for no-notice deployments.

The bill also would incentivize employers to hire Guard and Reservists.

The bill would provide all service members with access to health services provided by network providers with no cost-sharing burden.

It would also facilitate more affordable access to critical preventive medical services as well as mental health care.",https://www.ngaus.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2025-08/baldwin082425final1000.jpg?itok=BenVB1py,N,0.0,2025-08-24 18:56:07.759967

Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s Healthcare for Our Troops Act would, specifically, provide premium-free, zero cost-sharing medical coverage for Selected Reserve members eligible for TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS) and address financial barriers to seeking mental health care.
The legislation would also create an incentive for employers to hire Guard and Reserve members by lessening demand for employer-sponsored healthcare plans.
Sen. Baldwin said of the measure, “Our service members in the National Guard and Reserve serve and sacrifice for their nation every day – and just like the brave men and women in every other service branch, they deserve and have earned high quality, affordable health care.
My bill doesn’t just deliver earned benefits to our troops, it’s also an investment in military readiness to ensure service members get the care they need to stay healthy.”","A Wisconsin Senator in Washington has introduced a measure that aims to provide premium-free medical insurance coverage for all members of the National Guard and Reserve.

In addition to providing health insurance, the legislation would provide servicemembers with the option to complete annual medical readiness requirements with their preferred civilian provider – giving commanders back valuable training days and saving over $162 million annually in contracted medical assessments.

Question

Avi Dahan, on for Shagun Singh, asked about the specifics of the 2022 TRICARE audit, the lack of advance warning on the payment suspension, and the rationale for not providing full-year 2025 guidance given that 75% of revenue is unaffected. He also questioned the company's plan for its upcoming April meeting with the Defense Health Agency.

Answer

Executive Anna Lucsok described the 2022 audit as a routine post-payment review with standard adjustments and no major issues identified. Executive Thomas Sandgaard explained that full-year guidance was withheld because the potential revenue impact from TRICARE is substantial, possibly exceeding $50 million, creating too much uncertainty. He emphasized the issue is isolated and not indicative of a domino effect with other payers. For the April meeting, Anna Lucsok stated they will present data on policy compliance and reference the adjustments made following the 2022 audit, although TRICARE's specific concerns remain vague.

Answer

Executive Chairman and CEO Thomas Sandgaard explained that while Q3 growth slowed, October's year-over-year order growth was already at 17%, and he expects continued double-digit growth in the high teens. Regarding the strategic review, Sandgaard confirmed the company has received letters of intent and is actively engaged with one party, though a resolution is not expected in the immediate future.

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for Tricare beneficiaries to participate in research via remote meetings between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. The lab will hold several studies, asking participants to test out specific scenarios. Each session will last about one hour.

Officials want feedback on the content, navigation, visuals and layout of the website.

It comes at an opportune time, as Tricare’s open season begins Nov. 10, when people will be exploring their options for Tricare coverage. However, it’s not clear whether any recommendations for changes in the website would be implemented before open season.

Researchers are looking for participants from a variety of Tricare health plans, ages, locations and experiences.

Those eligible must be current Tricare beneficiaries who are at least 18 years old and have a computer or mobile device in order to access Tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams. A Microsoft Teams account is not required. Participants must have a stable internet connection, the ability to share their screen and a working microphone. They must be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time.

Participants don’t need a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate.

Researchers and the Tricare communications team will use the data to help update and redesign different parts of the Tricare.mil site. The Defense Health Agency won’t publicly share names or information of study participants, but participants will be asked to share their input with other participants on the call.

Those who want to participate should send an email by Wednesday, Sept. 3, to dha.jblm.solution-deliv.list.dha-usability-lab@health.mil.

Include “Tricare Usability Study” in the email subject line, and in the email, provide your name, age, location, Tricare health plan, how long you’ve been a Tricare beneficiary and your beneficiary category, such as active duty service member, retiree, or active duty family member, for example.

Participants will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis. Researchers may not be able to include everyone due to capacity constraints.

CPAP sent a breach notification letter to numerous impacted individuals, informing them of the 2024 cyberattack. According to the letter, cybercrooks breached CPAP’s network between December 13th and December 21st of last year.

Information the company submitted to the Maine Attorney General’s Office revealed that over 90,000 individuals were impacted by the attack.

CPAP provides sleep therapy gear. The company’s website strongly emphasizes its focus on US military personnel. CPAP also accepts Tricare, a US Defense Department health program for service members.

“We commenced a prompt and thorough investigation into the incident and worked very closely with external cybersecurity professionals experienced in handling these types of situations to help determine whether any personal or sensitive data had been compromised as a result of this incident,” reads the data breach notice.

Meanwhile, the data breach notice that CPAP posted on its website indicates that attackers may have accessed customer names, Social Security numbers (SSNs), and other “identifiable protected health and personal information.”

Individuals whose data may have been stolen could experience increased levels of cybersecurity threats. For example, attackers could leverage the stolen data for identity theft. Cybercrooks could also use the details to craft phishing attacks by attempting to impersonate healthcare providers, hoping to lure additional sensitive details.

Depending on what health information was exposed, attackers could also attempt medical identity theft. Medical details are a prized possession in the cyber underworld, as they enable attackers to file fraudulent insurance claims and prescriptions for regulated drugs.

While CPAP pointed out that it has no indication that exposed details were misused, the company said it will offer affected individuals complimentary credit and identity monitoring services.

Healthcare institutions are among the most targeted. According to research from the Business Digital Index, the majority of the largest US hospitals have recently dealt with cyberattacks and data breaches. For example, in 2024, healthcare-related data breaches led to the theft of over 267 million records.",https://media.cybernews.com/images/featured-big/2025/06/patient-data-breached.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-23 11:56:07.701301

Want to help improve it? Now’s your chance to provide feedback on the usability of the site and suggestions for improving it.

The Defense Health Agency Usability Lab is looking for Tricare beneficiaries to participate in research via remote meetings between Aug. 25 and Sept. 5. The lab will hold several studies, asking participants to test out specific scenarios. Each session will last about one hour.

Officials want feedback on the content, navigation, visuals and layout of the website.

It comes at an opportune time, as Tricare’s open season begins Nov. 10, when people will be exploring their options for Tricare coverage. However, it’s not clear whether any recommendations for changes in the website would be implemented before open season.

Researchers are looking for participants from a variety of Tricare health plans, ages, locations and experiences.

Those eligible must be current Tricare beneficiaries who are at least 18 years old and have a computer or mobile device in order to access Tricare.mil and Microsoft Teams. A Microsoft Teams account is not required. Participants must have a stable internet connection, the ability to share their screen and a working microphone. They must be available on weekdays between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern Time.

Participants don’t need a current Common Access Card or Uniformed Services ID card to participate.

Researchers and the Tricare communications team will use the data to help update and redesign different parts of the Tricare.mil site. The Defense Health Agency won’t publicly share names or information of study participants, but participants will be asked to share their input with other participants on the call.

Those who want to participate should send an email by Wednesday, Sept. 3, to dha.jblm.solution-deliv.list.dha-usability-lab@health.mil.

Include “Tricare Usability Study” in the email subject line, and in the email, provide your name, age, location, Tricare health plan, how long you’ve been a Tricare beneficiary and your beneficiary category, such as active duty service member, retiree, or active duty family member, for example.

Participants will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis. Researchers may not be able to include everyone due to capacity constraints.

If you’re not able to join the study, beneficiaries may submit feedback via the Tricare.mil questionnaire.

Rescission reinforces regulatory clarity and aligns with energy security priorities.

In each case, we raised serious concerns about the ongoing importance of peeling back the regulatory excesses of the unelected bureaucracy in recent years:

1. DHA’s Misuse of Credit Checks for Health Access (DOD-2025-HA-0006)

CRF challenged the Defense Health Agency’s policy of using “soft” credit checks and credit card data as identity verification for access to MHS GENESIS. Not only does this compromise privacy and invite confusion, but it also creates unnecessary barriers to care for young dependents and low-income families. There is no clear legal authority for this requirement, and it appears to have been implemented without public input or congressional notification.

2. DOI’s Smart Move on Offshore Wind Mandates (BOEM-2025-0036)

CRF supported the Department of the Interior’s direct final rule rescinding the outdated requirement to publish a five-year offshore renewable energy leasing schedule. The rule had no statutory foundation and falsely signaled inevitable lease sales, distorting markets. Rescission reinforces regulatory clarity and aligns with energy security priorities.

3. EPA’s New Source Review Paperwork Buildup (EPA-HQ-OAR-2022-0037)

CRF urged EPA to remain vigilant against growing paperwork burdens from information collection requests tied to solid waste incinerators and combustion turbines. While EPA has improved burden estimates, CRF stressed the cumulative impact of overlapping mandates that harm energy sector investment and competitiveness.

4. DOE’s Misguided School Mental Health Expansion (ED-2025-OESE-0153)

CRF opposed the Department of Education’s proposed expansion of school-based mental health programs, citing lack of evidence, parental rights concerns, and ideological risk. Instead of vague, top-down “wellness” mandates, CRF called for targeted, clinically grounded interventions for students with diagnosed mental illness.

Regulatory Reform in the News

Dr. Susan Dudley on Congress’s Role After Loper

At a Senate hearing on July 30, former OIRA Administrator (and the founder of the George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center) Dr. Susan Dudley testified on the implications of the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo, which overturned the Chevron doctrine. Dr. Dudley emphasized:

Courts, not agencies, will now interpret statutes—but agency expertise on technical matters will still matter.

Congress must draft laws with greater clarity, distinguishing between legal, factual, and policy questions.

Transparency is key: agencies must disclose their assumptions and acknowledge policy tradeoffs.

Overreliance on “science” as a cover for value judgments must stop; legislative accountability must return.

She endorsed creating a congressional regulatory office to complement OIRA, helping lawmakers write clearer statutes and evaluate regulations over time.

Upcoming Next Week

CPAC to Weigh In on Election Technology Security

The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) is seeking public comments on proposed updates to the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG 2.0), specifically regarding performance benchmarks for high-speed scanning equipment used in elections: EAC-2025-0001-0006.

CRF will submit comments emphasizing the need for:

Election Integrity – Every vote must be verifiable, auditable, and secure.

Transparency – Voters and election observers must be able to understand and scrutinize election technologies.

Accountability – Election vendors and local officials must be held to the highest standards of performance.

Security – No system should be certified without rigorous, third-party-tested protections against manipulation.

We intend to use this opportunity to reaffirm that secure elections are the cornerstone of a free republic.

The Defense Health Agency oversees the nation’s largest health-care system that serves a patient population of more than 9.5 million service members, retirees and their families.
More than 39,000 employees at the Defense Health Agency are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, according to AFGE.
But an employee’s application for the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment, or VSIP, option does not guarantee an offer, the agency said.
Certain jobs were exempted from the buyout program at the discretion of the network directors, the Defense Health Agency said.","WASHINGTON — The Defense Health Agency that oversees more than 700 military hospitals and clinics worldwide disclosed Thursday that it made a buyout offer to an unidentified number of civilian personnel to be considered for lump-sum payouts to leave their jobs under a restructuring of the federal agency.

The Defense Health Agency said it plans to grant the voluntary buyouts to certain employees on a job-by-job basis as part of a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment program. Employees were required to submit applications this week to express their interest in accepting an incentive payment to resign, the agency said. But the agency declined to discuss the specific terms outlined in the buyouts. But the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment Authority, also known as the buyout authority, allows federal agencies downsizing or restructuring to offer employees one-time payments of up to $25,000 as an incentive to resign from their jobs, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

The Defense Health Agency oversees the nation’s largest health-care system that serves a patient population of more than 9.5 million service members, retirees and their families.

“Any effort to slash the Department of Defense’s health care civilian workforce without a careful analysis is a threat to our national security and service members’ ability to access health care and other critical services,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

More than 39,000 employees at the Defense Health Agency are represented by the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, according to AFGE.

An AFGE spokesman said Thursday that the buyout offer is among several initiatives by the Defense Health Agency to draw down its workforce, including deferred resignations and early retirements. The agency’s offer of voluntary resignations follows an announcement by the Defense Department earlier this year that it would reduce its workforce by 5% to 8% as part of a larger downsizing of federal agencies ordered by President Donald Trump.

Network directors who manage the Defense Health Agency with a workforce of 130,000 were authorized to identify certain jobs to eliminate and ask employees to submit applications by Aug. 18, according to the agency. But an employee’s application for the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment, or VSIP, option does not guarantee an offer, the agency said.

“This is a voluntary program, and network directors retain authority to approve or disapprove of requests,” according to the agency. The agency also declined to identify the number of employees who turned in applications by a Monday deadline or the types of jobs targeted for downsizing. The agency’s decisions on the applications are expected by the end of August, according to AFGE.

Certain jobs were exempted from the buyout program at the discretion of the network directors, the Defense Health Agency said.

“Defense Health Agency network directors were authorized to offer the Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment or VSIP incentive to shape their workforce and enable our military hospitals and clinics to deliver their capabilities and services within the scope of their facilities’ plans,” the agency said in a written statement.

An “agency may offer VSIP to employees who are in surplus positions or have skills that are no longer needed in the workforce who volunteer to separate by resignation,” according to the Office of Personnel Management. “Agencies such as the Department of Defense that have been granted agency-specific VSIP authority are not required to seek OPM approval for their use of this option.”

The Defense Health Agency is a combat support agency with a mission to provide and manage a medically ready force, according to the Defense Department.

The Defense Department is the nation’s largest employer, with more than 2.1 million service members and more than 800,000 civilian workers.",,N,0.0,2025-08-22 20:56:08.077383

The exclusion is for all access to GLP-1s for TFL beneficiaries that don’t meet the Medicare criteria.
Under the Tricare plan, Prime and Select patients continue to get their GLP-1s, TFL don't.
Nothing in § 1074g limits that availability to Prime/Select enrollees or excludes TRICARE For Life (TFL).
However, if your goal is to include GLP-1s on the uniform formulary for obesity alone, I would support that.","Nicely done. But, you’re only partly right, just not the right part:

True: Title 10 §1079 says “[t]reatment of obesity may not be provided if obesity is the sole or major condition treated.” That’s in 10 U.S.C. §1079(a)(10)—the basic CHAMPUS benefit baseline.

True: The 2017 carve‑out for Prime/Select (services) in DoD’s 2017 interim final rule, (IFR) implementing FY2017 NDAA authority, expressly allows treatment of obesity (even when it’s the sole/major condition) for TRICARE Prime and Select. That language is at 32 C.F.R. §199.17(f)(3).

BUT: What Tricare is proposing now is more than just excluding GLP-1s to TFL for treatment of obesity. The exclusion is for all access to GLP-1s for TFL beneficiaries that don’t meet the Medicare criteria. There are many TFL (and Prime and Select) beneficiaries on GLP-1s for conditions that include obesity coupled with comorbidities – satisfying Tricare criteria, but not Medicare criteria. Under the Tricare plan, Prime and Select patients continue to get their GLP-1s, TFL don't.

Where you overreach:

The Tricare pharmacy program sits on different legal rails than §1079.

TRICARE’s pharmacy benefit is authorized by 10 U.S.C. §1074g and implemented at 32 C.F.R. § 199.21. The regulation explicitly notes this law is independent of other Title 10 sections that govern TRICARE medical benefits, i.e., the § 1079 rules don’t automatically control the basic pharmacy program. The “uniform formulary” is for eligible covered beneficiaries—not just Prime/Select.

Section 1074g requires DoD to maintain a uniform formulary and to assure availability of formulary agents to eligible covered beneficiaries through MTF, retail, or mail order channels. Nothing in § 1074g limits that availability to Prime/Select enrollees or excludes TRICARE For Life (TFL). DoD has long articulated the “uniform” nature of the formulary; for example, the Federal Register has stated that drugs on an MTF formulary must be available to all beneficiaries (MTF context, but it reflects the uniformity principle).

The 2017 rule’s obesity language you reference is about services, not a ceiling on drugs. The carve‑out in §199.17(f)(3) sits in the managed‑care (services) section. It does not speak to, or limit, the separate pharmacy authority in § 199.21. The rule itself specifies that TFL is “unaffected by this section” (See 199.17(a)(6)(ii)(C) and is generally governed by §§199.3, 199.4, and 199.8—again underscoring that §199.17’s managed‑care enhancements don’t define the pharmacy program.

The IFR contains long standing exclusions for weight reduction services and medications—e.g., appetite suppressants and other medications used primarily for weight control. These exclusions apply across the Basic Program, not to any single plan. This is the text DoD/DHA could cite to deny coverage when a GLP 1 is prescribed solely for weight loss, but it does not support limiting GLP 1s to Prime/Select enrollees when otherwise covered under Tricare criteria. No plan specific limitation appears.

Yes, the 2017 IFR spoke in terms of “Prime/Select “when operationalizing coverage for anti obesity treatments, but, again, that limitation doesn’t come from the language of § 706 or § 729. Sections 706 and § 729 are plan neutral and speak in terms of “covered beneficiaries.” The 2017 IFR reference to Prime/Select appears to be an administrative choice, not a limitation imposed by §§ 706/729.

The proposed TFL restrictions are an effort to make a policy choice – only its not a choice they have the authority to make. They need a statute to give them that authority, and until they amend the law, they do not have it.

Bottom Line: Tricare is out of luck unless Congress acts – and I seriously doubt that will happen. This is a major FU and I plan on making sure its noted.

However, if your goal is to include GLP-1s on the uniform formulary for obesity alone, I would support that. This is a class of drugs that are very effective in addressing a host of serious illnesses. I would support making these much more widely available - Medicare/Medicaid, Affordable Care Act plans?

As governments grapple with fiscal constraints and strategic priorities, the interplay between budget allocations, regulatory frameworks, and labor policies has profound implications for both operational readiness and long-term investment viability. This article examines how recent political actions—ranging from budget cuts to workforce modernization efforts—impact healthcare access and labor stability in the defense sector, offering insights for investors navigating this complex landscape.

The Dual Challenge: Labor Shortages and Healthcare Access

The defense sector faces a dual crisis: a shrinking pool of skilled labor and a declining reliance on military healthcare services. According to the 2025 Aerospace and Defense Industry Outlook, over 67% of manufacturers cite talent attraction and retention as their top business challenge. This is compounded by an aging workforce, with 25% of defense sector employees nearing retirement. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense (DoD) reports that TRICARE beneficiaries using military healthcare facilities have halved over the past two decades. To address these issues, the DoD has launched a “right sizing” initiative to realign medical staffing and improve healthcare access for service members and their families.

Political decisions, however, complicate these efforts. The Trump administration's unilateral spending freezes and executive orders to delay discretionary funding—such as veterans' healthcare programs—threaten to undermine workforce stability. For instance, the FY 2025 defense budget allocates $128 billion for veterans' healthcare, yet this discretionary spending is vulnerable to impoundment or cuts if Congress fails to pass timely appropriations. Such instability risks eroding trust in the sector's ability to provide consistent care, potentially deterring talent from joining or remaining in defense roles.

Budgetary Constraints and Workforce Modernization

The FY 2025 defense budget of $849.8 billion includes targeted investments in labor stability, such as a 4.5% pay raise for service members and $2.0 billion for family housing. These measures aim to bolster retention and morale, but their effectiveness hinges on broader fiscal policies. For example, proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid—though not directly tied to defense—could ripple into the sector by reducing the availability of civilian healthcare services for military families. Similarly, the administration's push to restore impoundment powers under the 1974 Impoundment Control Act introduces uncertainty, as it may allow unilateral reductions in discretionary spending, including veterans' healthcare.

Investors must also consider how political decisions influence workforce modernization. The defense sector is increasingly adopting AI, extended reality (XR), and automation to address labor shortages. For instance, apprenticeship programs have tripled in advanced manufacturing roles since 2021, while XR is being tested to accelerate employee training. However, these innovations require sustained funding and regulatory support. If political priorities shift toward austerity, investments in digital transformation may stall, hampering the sector's ability to adapt.

Healthcare Access: A Strategic Lever for Workforce Stability

The DoD's “right sizing” initiative underscores the link between healthcare access and labor stability. By realigning medical staffing to meet current demand, the department aims to re-engage TRICARE beneficiaries and reduce reliance on external healthcare providers. This strategy aligns with global trends in healthcare, where digital tools and AI are being deployed to streamline operations and reduce clinician burnout. For example, the 2025 Deloitte global healthcare outlook highlights the role of AI in administrative efficiency—a principle the DoD could leverage to free up clinical staff for direct patient care.

Yet, political decisions may hinder progress. The administration's focus on reducing federal deficits through mandatory spending cuts—such as site-neutral payment policies for Medicare—could indirectly affect defense sector healthcare. If hospitals face reduced reimbursements, they may cut services or raise costs, limiting access for military families. Similarly, delays in veterans' healthcare funding could exacerbate wait times and reduce satisfaction, further straining workforce morale.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Opportunity

For investors, the defense sector presents both risks and opportunities. Companies that align with workforce modernization—such as those developing AI-driven training platforms or advanced manufacturing technologies—stand to benefit from long-term growth. Conversely, firms reliant on traditional labor models or vulnerable to budget cuts may face headwinds.

Key sectors to monitor include:

1. Defense Contractors with Digital Capabilities: Firms integrating AI and automation into workforce training and operations (e.g., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman).

2. Military Healthcare Providers: Companies like Humana or UnitedHealth Group, which may see increased demand if TRICARE beneficiaries return to military facilities.

3. Workforce Development Platforms: Providers of apprenticeship programs or VR/XR training tools, which are critical for addressing labor shortages.

Investors should also assess geopolitical risks. For example, the Biden Administration's National Security Strategy emphasizes a “whole-of-government” approach to workforce resilience, which could lead to increased funding for defense-related healthcare and training. Conversely, a shift toward austerity or deregulation may prioritize short-term savings over long-term stability.

Conclusion: A Call for Strategic Resilience

The defense sector's ability to navigate political decisions will determine its success in maintaining labor stability and healthcare access. While budget constraints and regulatory shifts pose challenges, they also create opportunities for innovation. Investors who prioritize companies adapting to these dynamics—through digital transformation, workforce development, or strategic partnerships—will be well-positioned to capitalize on the sector's evolution. In an era of geopolitical uncertainty, the defense sector's resilience is not just a national imperative but a compelling investment thesis.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,0.0,2025-08-22 16:56:14.862427
