,,2025-07-03 15:51:57+00:00,DVIDS,TRICARE Moves Forward With Prime Service Area Reductions - DVIDS,Not Available,,,,,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/507695/tricare-moves-forward-with-prime-service-area-reductions,"The Defense Department will reduce the number of TRICARE Prime service areas in the United States beginning Oct. 1, affecting about 171,000 retirees and their family members.
As always, officials noted, TRICARE beneficiaries still are covered by TRICARE Standard.
For those living within 100 miles of a remaining Prime service area, re-enrolling in Prime may be an option, depending on availability.
Prolonged protests resulted in a staggered transition, they added, and all Prime service areas were retained until all three new regional contracts were in place.
To provide affected beneficiaries with enough time to plan, Defense Department officials elected to delay the Prime service area reductions until Oct. 1.","The Defense Department will reduce the number of TRICARE Prime service areas in the United States beginning Oct. 1, affecting about 171,000 retirees and their family members.

Those beneficiaries, who mostly reside more than 40 miles from a military clinic or hospital, received a letter earlier this year explaining their options. They will receive a second letter later this month.

TRICARE Management Activity officials said changing the location of Prime service areas has been planned since 2007 as part of the move to the third-generation of managed care support contracts and will allow them to continue their commitment to making high-quality health care available while supporting DOD efforts to control the rising cost of health care for 9.6 million beneficiaries.

Health care under TRICARE Prime costs about $600 more annually per enrollee, but on average, each member of a family of three using TRICARE Standard will pay only about $20 more per month than if they were using Prime.

“The first thing TRICARE beneficiaries should know about the reduction in the number of Prime service areas is that it doesn’t mean they’re losing their TRICARE benefit,” said Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. “Next, it’s important to remember this change does not affect most of the more than 5 million people using TRICARE Prime, and [it affects] none of our active duty members and their families.”

All affected beneficiaries will receive a letter this month following up on their initial notification to ensure they have the time and information to make important decisions about their future health care options, officials said.

Current details on Prime service areas and the option for beneficiaries to sign for email updates are available at http://www.tricare.mil/PSA. A ZIP code tool is available on the site to help beneficiaries determine if they live in an affected area.

As always, officials noted, TRICARE beneficiaries still are covered by TRICARE Standard. For those living within 100 miles of a remaining Prime service area, re-enrolling in Prime may be an option, depending on availability. To do this, beneficiaries must waive their drive-time standards, and they may have to travel long distances for primary and specialty care.

“I urge all impacted beneficiaries to carefully consider their health care options – they should talk them over with family members and their current health care provider,” Woodson said. “Many beneficiaries may be able to continue with their current provider using the Standard benefit. Being close to your health care team usually offers the best and safest access to care.”

Those enrolled in TRICARE Prime are assigned a primary care provider who manages their health care. Retirees pay an annual enrollment fee and have low out-of-pocket costs under this plan. TRICARE Standard is an open-choice option with no monthly premiums and no need for referrals, but it has cost shares and an annual deductible.

The Prime service areas being eliminated are not close to existing military treatment facilities or base realignment and closure sites, officials said. Prolonged protests resulted in a staggered transition, they added, and all Prime service areas were retained until all three new regional contracts were in place. The West region completed the transition April 1.

To provide affected beneficiaries with enough time to plan, Defense Department officials elected to delay the Prime service area reductions until Oct. 1.

""Health care for military families is one of the most important things for recruitment and retention.
Addressing concerns about potential downsizing or changes to IACH's mission, Ferrara was clear in his support for the facility.
Despite acknowledging the financial challenges facing military healthcare, Ferrara expressed admiration for the innovation and adaptability he consistently observes at military treatment facilities.
Ferrara’s visit affirmed what those on the front lines already know: readiness begins with care, and care begins here.","FORT RILEY, Kansas – What does it mean to be mission-ready—medically, operationally, and as a team? For the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the answer lies not in policy memos or PowerPoint decks, but in the work happening inside military hospitals like Irwin Army Community Hospital.

On June 30, Ferrara walked the halls of IACH to understand firsthand how the Military Health System can better support the 1st Infantry Division and its families. He spent the day engaging with healthcare providers, leadership, and staff to assess the facility's capabilities and address concerns about the future of military healthcare at Fort Riley, home to the oldest continuously serving active-duty division in the U.S. Army.

Ferrara, who serves as what he describes as ""the CEO of the Military Health System,"" brings a unique perspective to his role as principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all health-related matters. His purview includes oversight of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which now manages all military treatment facilities across the globe, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide.

""It's really important for me to get to the deck plate, to get to where people are doing the work, so that I can understand it,"" Ferrara said during his visit. As a former Navy officer, he understands that each military installation has its own unique mission and character. ""I find that each site, whether it's a hospital or whether it's an operational unit, is incredibly unique. It has its own mission. It has its own texture, so to speak.""

This hands-on leadership approach drives Ferrara's frequent visits to military installations. Rather than relying solely on reports and briefings from the Pentagon, he prioritizes direct engagement with the medical professionals and support staff who deliver care daily. ""When you're back at the Pentagon, information that comes to you is always highly curated, highly filtered,"" he said. ""I don't like to think of Fort Riley or Irwin Army Community Hospital as a line on a spreadsheet or a slide on a PowerPoint. I want to see the work that's being done.""

Ferrara's visit to Fort Riley was particularly significant given the critical role the Big Red One plays in deploying forces to fight and win the nation’s wars. ""The First Division is incredibly important to the Army and to our national security,"" he said. ""So how we can support the healthcare here in rural Kansas is really important.""

The Acting Assistant Secretary recognized IACH's vital role in supporting military families, particularly through its robust obstetrics and gynecology program. He highlighted how quality healthcare for military families directly impacts recruitment, retention, and mission readiness. ""Health care for military families is one of the most important things for recruitment and retention. It also is really critical to ensuring that our soldiers are able to stay focused on their mission when they know that they or their family are getting high quality healthcare.""

Ferrara stressed the importance of maintaining a ""medically ready force"" while ensuring deployed soldiers have confidence their families receive excellent care in their absence. ""If they go downrange, they know that their family is in excellent hands,"" he said, referring to the trust soldiers must have in their military treatment facility.

Addressing concerns about potential downsizing or changes to IACH's mission, Ferrara was clear in his support for the facility. ""I don't want to downsize IACH. That's not my goal,"" he said. Instead, his focus is on enhancing the hospital's capabilities and ensuring it operates at maximum capacity. ""To me, the definition of success for a hospital is a busy hospital doing high volume, high complexity care,"" Ferrara said. ""My goal is to figure out how I can make IACH even more successful. That is the reason I'm here.""

The Acting Assistant Secretary acknowledged that IACH represents a significant investment as a relatively new facility that must be optimized for patient care and military readiness training. His vision focuses on ensuring medical personnel maintain their skills through consistent, complex patient care that will prepare them for potential deployment scenarios.

The visit reinforced Ferrara's philosophy that healthcare delivery is fundamentally about trust – what he called ""the compact that we form with those families and with those service members."" This compact represents a promise to provide the resources, personnel, equipment, and supplies necessary to deliver exceptional care.

Despite acknowledging the financial challenges facing military healthcare, Ferrara expressed admiration for the innovation and adaptability he consistently observes at military treatment facilities. ""This is a resource constrained environment. That's not a mystery to anyone,"" he said. ""What I'm always impressed by is people's ability to innovate and to adapt and to solve problems either through sweat equity or through great ideas.""

This perspective reflects his understanding that the Military Health System operates as ""a giant team sport,"" where best practices developed at one facility can benefit the entire system. His visits help identify successful innovations that can be shared across the network of military treatment facilities.

As the 1st Infantry Division trains to fight and win the nation’s wars, IACH stands ready, not just with beds and equipment, but with the trust of soldiers and the care of families. Ferrara’s visit affirmed what those on the front lines already know: readiness begins with care, and care begins here.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9144882.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-03 13:56:21.028165

Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary for defense for health affairs, and Air Force Lt. Gen. (Dr.) Douglas J. Robb, director of the new Defense Health Agency, appeared before subcommittee members to update them on DHA’s progression.
The agency is “an important reform in the Military Health System [and] a needed reform in this era of significant challenges for [DOD] in American health care at large,” Woodson said.
“Our national security and defense strategies must be supported by a strong, relevant, agile and forward-leaning Military Health System,” he said.
“There is dramatic change occurring in American health care that will affect how we do business,” Woodson said, “and require us to refresh our thinking of health, health care, and health care delivery systems.” Rising costs, technology sub-specialization, information management access and workforce issues challenge the American health care system, he said.","The Defense Department’s new health care organization has exceeded its goals since standing up five months ago, top health care officials told the House Armed Services Committee’s personnel subcommittee here Feb. 26.

Dr. Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary for defense for health affairs, and Air Force Lt. Gen. (Dr.) Douglas J. Robb, director of the new Defense Health Agency, appeared before subcommittee members to update them on DHA’s progression.

Both officials said the agency is ahead of expectations and goals.

DHA was established after defense leaders organized a task force three years ago to look at how to make military medicine more efficient, more effective and more affordable.

The agency is “an important reform in the Military Health System [and] a needed reform in this era of significant challenges for [DOD] in American health care at large,” Woodson said.

“Our national security and defense strategies must be supported by a strong, relevant, agile and forward-leaning Military Health System,” he said.

Good evidence exists that joint integrated care improves results in combat, Woodson said. If a service member is wounded in combat, a Navy corpsman will often be the first to treat the patient, who is then transported while receiving critical care to a military medical center staffed by all three services, where “definitive, advanced care will be given by a multiservice health care team, he explained.

The synchronized system “transcends service and command distinction [and] has resulted in the highest survival rates and the lowest case fatality rates in recorded warfare,” Woodson said.

“[Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel] has outlined his priorities for managing the significant change needed in the coming years,” Woodson said.

“These include introducing institutional reforms, re-evaluating military force planning construct, preparing for prolonged readiness challenges, protecting investments in emerging military capability, balancing forces between active and reserves and reforming personnel and compensation policies.”

Woodson said he has six lines of effort to support Hagel’s priorities:

-- Modernizing Military Health System management with an enterprise focus;

-- Defining and delivering medical capabilities needed in the 21st century;

-- Investing in and expanding strategic partnerships;

-- Assessing the balance of DOD’s medical core structure;

-- Modernizing the TRICARE health program, and

-- Defining the Military Health System’s global health engagement requirement.

Those efforts will help DOD meet its “overwhelming” aims of readiness, improve the health of people it serves, improve the experience of care in the military and responsibly manage costs, Woodson said.

By modernizing management structure, DHA represents a major DOD milestone and is a starting point for comprehensive enterprise-wide reform, he said.

“There is dramatic change occurring in American health care that will affect how we do business,” Woodson said, “and require us to refresh our thinking of health, health care, and health care delivery systems.”

Rising costs, technology sub-specialization, information management access and workforce issues challenge the American health care system, he said.

“Health systems across the country -- including ours -- are focused on ways to reduce variation in care, improve patient safety and more effectively use health information technology to improve clinical decision-making and outcomes,” Woodson said. “Within the military, there are additional imperatives for designing an integrated health system which includes more joint phasing, joint operations and maintaining readiness.”

DOD Health Affairs, the Military Health System and DHA are partnered in such a process, he said.

“We have created agile governance for policy and enterprise-wide operational decision-making,” Woodson said. “We are holding ourselves accountable using a disciplined process for identifying opportunities in using comments [and] enterprise-wide performance measures to see and check what we are doing.”

DHA uses the Government Accountability Office’s approach to conduct business case analyses and business process re-engineering efforts, Woodson said.

DHA director Robb said his agency “stands as a supporting organization, ensuring that the combatant commanders and the service medical departments have the resource support” to meet their missions.

“We have made significant progress in the first 150 days of this reform effort. And we are in-track with most of our major milestones,” he said.

The discipline and rigor necessary to “do business” also has given DHA insight into its most-challenging issues and in some cases has allowed it to “rapidly introduce new processes,” Robb told legislators.

“We have accelerated timelines for implementation and achieved savings, reduce variation and streamlined processes earlier than initially projected,” he said.

One role of DHA is managing numerous “shared services” that combine activities like medical information technology, medical logistics and TRICARE for the Army, Navy and Air Force.

For example, Robb said, identifying and changing buying behaviors in medical logistics is putting DOD’s health care on a path “to cover our investment costs and save over $10 million when we previously projected no savings for this year.”

Another $25 million in savings this fiscal year has been identified by consolidating service medical chief information officers into DHA, he added.

“The most significant cost savings potential for the department still remains in the purchase health care sector,” Robb said. “Our efforts to improve the execution of the TRICARE health plan are focused on the long-term systemic challenges, and how we better integrate our direct care and private-care health services delivery and contract for health care support.”

As the existing generation of TRICARE contracts expires, DOD is looking at reshaping contracts to take advantage of strategic sourcing, improving integration with military medical facilities, reducing unnecessary overhead, and achieving more simplicity and flexibility for its patients and the government, the DHA director said.

“[We’re] proud of the work we have accomplished,” Robb said, “But [we’re] even more eager to identify ways we can integrate our system on behalf of the incredible people that we are privileged to serve.”

KAISERSLAUTERN, Germany — Defense Department civilian workers and contractors stationed overseas can once again undergo rape kit exams at U.S. military medical facilities, following a reversal of a short-lived policy that had restricted their access to such care.

In recent weeks the Military Health System rescinded a March 13 directive to medical providers that limited rape test kits at overseas military treatment facilities to people enrolled in Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.

That policy effectively excluded most DOD civilian workers who aren’t spouses or dependents of service members.

It required those civilians to seek forensic evidence collection at foreign clinics, which have different standards for processing evidence. Such evidence would be easier to discredit at court-martial, according to defense attorneys who spoke with Stars and Stripes in April.

On June 20, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, reversed the policy.

The updated guidance permits adult civilians who aren’t enrolled in Tricare to receive emergency medical treatment, including forensic exams and limited follow-up care, for up to 30 days after a sexual assault. Tricare will cover the cost and the patient will not be billed for services.

“This will ensure non-beneficiaries seeking care at an MTF have access to the care they need following a sexual assault,” a Military Health System officials said in response to questions Wednesday.

About 35,000 federal civilian employees support 172,000 active-duty service members stationed overseas, according to Defense Department data from December 2024, with the largest civilian populations living in Germany, Japan and South Korea.

The U.S. military has detailed protocols for handling evidence after an assault allegation, including rules about the chain of custody.

But outside the military, collection methods can vary by country, and different cultural attitudes around sexual assault could dissuade victims from seeking help off base.

The Military Health System is working on additional implementation guidance, according to the command.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/tfcho6-040725testkitsphoto01.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/040725TESTKITSphoto01.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-03 12:57:11.481046

I have a claim for an ER visit (for an animal bite) from September of last year. I have been struggling since then to try to get Tricare to pay. It took months for them to even receive the claim from the hospital, despite talking with several representatives on both sides to make sure they had the right info. It spent a long time in processing. It was abruptly denied last month due to the Third Party Liability form not being submitted, which I had no idea was required. The EOB for the denial shows an address that I haven't lived at for over a decade, despite updating it several times, so that may be why I never received it. And now, after mailing the form late and a letter of explanation, I'm stuck waiting again and hoping it's going to work.

On top of that, I recently received a letter from the hospital indicating that there might be some kind of OHI issue, despite me only having one plan, and each representative I've spoken to doesn't seem to know anything about that.

It's getting close to a year now, and I'm getting mixed answers on how long the reprocessing might take - if it's even accepted. This has been dragged on for a ridiculous amount of time due to issues I don't think I could control. Every step takes 30+ days to make any progress and new problems keep popping up. I've never received any communications about the claim (probably because of the address issue) so I didn't realize I was waiting too long at some points or missing things. I'm also new to insurance stuff so I never know what to expect. I'm very used to TRICARE rejecting routine eye exam claims for no reason so I don't have much faith it won't be denied/delayed again even if I can resolve these issues. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?",,N,-1.0,2025-07-03 11:56:49.007341

A General’s Legacy: Choose the Hard “NO” That Saves Lives

To: Rep. Bacon

From: A constituent in Omaha , NE

July 3

As a retired brigadier general, you’ve no doubt had to make hard calls for the good of your troops. Your vote on the OBBBA is another hard call: Do you protect the people who protected us—or align with a policy that undermines their care in a time of need? You served with men and women from all over the country, including rural America. Many of them—and their families—still call places like North Platte, Grand Island, and Beatrice home. Their nearest hospital might be the only one for 60 miles. And if Medicaid funding is slashed, that hospital could close. Yes, they may have TRICARE. Yes, veterans have the VA. But when a crisis strikes and the closest VA is three hours away, they depend on that rural hospital. If it’s gone, they have nothing. You’ve led soldiers in harm’s way. You understand that leadership is about preserving life, not balancing ledgers at the expense of the vulnerable. Right now, Medicaid is the backstop keeping hospitals open—not just for low-income families, but for reservists, retired service members, children, and seniors. This isn’t about party or politics. It’s about people. Your NO vote could save lives—not in theory, but in the emergency rooms of rural Nebraska.

Investment Considerations: Proceed with Caution For investors, Zynex's story is a cautionary tale of overexposure to regulatory risk.","Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZYXI) finds itself at a precarious crossroads. A months-long payment suspension by its largest payer, Tricare, paired with mounting legal challenges, has exposed critical vulnerabilities in the company's business model. For investors, this situation raises urgent questions: Is Zynex's reliance on Tricare sustainable? Can it navigate regulatory scrutiny and rebuild investor confidence? And perhaps most importantly, does the company have a viable path forward?

The Tricare Crisis: A Single Point of Failure

Tricare, the U.S. military's health care program, accounts for Zynex's largest revenue stream. Yet since March 2025, the Department of Defense has suspended payments to the company pending an internal review. While Zynex has appealed the decision and provided data to Tricare officials, the suspension remains unresolved. This has slashed revenue: Q1 2025 net income fell to $26.6 million, a 43% drop from $46.5 million in the same period in 2024.

The financial toll is evident. Zynex's stock has plummeted over 70% in six months, and its cash reserves have dwindled to $24 million as of Q1 2025. The company has slashed 14% of its workforce—86 employees—to save $5 million annually. Yet these cuts, while necessary, do nothing to address the core issue: Tricare's hold.

Legal and Regulatory Red Flags

The Tricare suspension is intertwined with a class-action lawsuit, Tuncel v. Zynex, Inc., which alleges the company engaged in “oversupplying” its medical devices to inflate revenue. Plaintiffs claim Zynex misled investors by failing to disclose risks tied to these practices, which may have prompted Tricare's scrutiny. While the lawsuit is still in its early stages, its existence underscores a systemic governance problem.

Zynex's leadership has struggled to provide clarity. CEO Thomas Sandgaard has stated the suspension will remain until Tricare concludes its review—but no timeline has been given. This opacity is problematic. In industries like healthcare, where regulatory relationships are critical, a lack of transparency can amplify reputational damage.

Strategic Moves and Long-Term Viability

Zynex is not without assets. It recently secured a UK patent for a non-invasive sepsis monitoring device, which could diversify its product portfolio. Additionally, the appointment of Steven Dyson as CEO in August 2025 aims to refocus the company on operational efficiency and innovation. However, these positives pale against the immediate Tricare threat.

The company's long-term survival hinges on two factors: resolving the Tricare dispute and reducing reliance on a single payer. Diversifying its customer base—such as expanding into private insurance markets—could mitigate future risks. But with cash reserves shrinking, Zynex may need to consider equity financing, which could dilute existing shareholders.

Investment Considerations: Proceed with Caution

For investors, Zynex's story is a cautionary tale of overexposure to regulatory risk. Key red flags include:

1. Overreliance on Tricare: A single payer's suspension has crippled its financial health.

2. Legal Uncertainty: The class-action lawsuit adds potential liabilities.

3. Cash Flow Strains: With Q1 2025's adjusted EBITDA loss of $11.8 million, liquidity remains a concern.

While analysts at H.C. Wainwright maintain a “Buy” rating with an $8 price target—a significant premium to its June 2025 price of $4—the stock's recovery hinges on Tricare lifting the suspension. Until then, Zynex's prospects remain hostage to a decision it cannot control.

Conclusion: A High-Risk Gamble

Zynex's situation is a stark reminder of how regulatory missteps and single-payer dependency can unravel a company's value. While the UK patent and new leadership offer glimmers of hope, the immediate challenges are existential. For investors, this is a high-risk, high-reward scenario. Only those with a tolerance for prolonged uncertainty—and faith in Tricare's eventual reversal—should consider exposure to Zynex. For most, the red flags outweigh the potential upside.",,N,-1.0,2025-07-03 00:56:21.559705

In other recent news, Zynex Inc. reported disappointing financial results for the first quarter of 2025, with earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.33 and revenue of $26.58 million, both significantly missing analyst expectations. These figures fell short of the forecasted EPS of $0.06 and anticipated revenue of $53.47 million. In a strategic move, Zynex announced the appointment of Steven Dyson as the new Chief Executive Officer, effective August 18, 2025. Dyson, who has over 25 years of experience in the medical technology sector, is expected to guide the company towards a more optimized business strategy. Additionally, Zynex has secured a UK patent for a noninvasive sepsis monitoring device, which aims to provide early alerts on a patient’s sepsis status. The company also executed a workforce reduction affecting 86 corporate roles, aiming for $5 million in annualized cost savings. Meanwhile, H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating on Zynex, maintaining an $8 price target, expressing confidence in the company’s potential to refocus and grow under Dyson’s leadership.

The Colorado-based manufacturer of non-invasive medical devices for pain management, rehabilitation, and patient monitoring had previously appealed the suspension and met with Tricare officials in April to present data supporting why the suspension should be lifted.

(NASDAQ: ZYXI), creating a high-stakes scenario for investors to assess whether the company's operational restructuring and liquidity management can offset the risks of its largest payer remaining non-compliant. With its stock down 51% since the suspension was first disclosed in March 2025, the question is whether ZYXI's current valuation presents a contrarian opportunity—or if the risks of prolonged uncertainty and legal liabilities outweigh the potential rewards.

The Tricare Stranglehold: A Liquidity Time Bomb?

As of June 2025, Tricare's suspension of payments—which began in March 2025—has slashed Zynex's revenue by 43% year-over-year, dropping Q1 2025 net revenue to $26.6 million. This stark decline underscores the company's overreliance on Tricare, which accounts for an unspecified but “substantial” portion of its revenue. While Zynex's liquidity ratio of 3.46 suggests short-term solvency, the prolonged suspension has already forced drastic measures:

- Cash Position: $24 million as of Q1 2025, down from $28.3 million in Q4 2024.

- Adjusted EBITDA Loss: $11.8 million in Q1 2025, compared to a $1.7 million profit in the prior year.

The stock's collapse since March 2025 mirrors the severity of the Tricare issue. Analysts now question whether Zynex can survive if Tricare's payments remain frozen beyond late 2025. The company's decision to withhold full-year guidance—providing only muted Q2 2025 estimates of $27 million in revenue and a $0.20 EPS loss—further signals uncertainty.

Workforce Reductions: A Necessary Evil or Strategic Overreach?

On June 18, Zynex announced the elimination of 86 corporate roles (14% of its workforce), aiming to save $5 million annually. While the company insists this restructuring is unrelated to the Tricare suspension—attributing it to operational efficiency—it's clear the move is a cost-cutting measure to extend liquidity. However, concerns linger:

- Focus Shift: The cuts emphasize a pivot toward “streamlined order processing and billing strategies,” which may reduce overhead but do little to address the core issue: Tricare's withheld payments.

- Cost Savings Limitations: Even with annualized savings of $5 million, Zynex's Q1 2025 revenue decline of $20 million (year-over-year) dwarfs these gains, suggesting deeper structural issues.

Legal and Regulatory Risks: The Class-Action Wildcard

A March 2025 class-action lawsuit alleging Zynex's “oversupplying scheme” to inflate revenue has added another layer of risk. The suit claims Zynex misled investors by not disclosing practices that triggered Tricare's scrutiny, leading to a 51% stock plunge in March 2025. Key implications:

- Investor Confidence: The lawsuit's success could force costly settlements or fines, further straining liquidity.

- Regulatory Spillover: If insurers beyond Tricare begin auditing Zynex's billing practices, the revenue hit could multiply.

Strategic Initiatives: Betting on the NICO Pulse Oximeter

Zynex's hope for long-term recovery hinges on its NICO Pulse Oximeter, a new product expected to generate revenue starting in 2026. However:

- Timing Risk: The device's launch won't offset near-term Tricare-related losses.

- Market Competition: The oximeter market is saturated, raising questions about Zynex's ability to carve out a meaningful share.

Investment Thesis: Contrarian Buy or Fade the Distraction?

Bull Case:

- Tricare Resolution: If payments resume by early 2026, Zynex's revenue could rebound sharply, potentially erasing the current valuation discount.

- Liquidity Buffer: The $24 million cash balance and 3.46 current ratio suggest it can survive 12–18 months without Tricare payments, assuming no further workforce cuts or lawsuits.

Bear Case:

- Prolonged Suspension: If Tricare remains non-compliant, Zynex may need to dilute shareholders via equity raises, further depressing the stock.

- Legal Fallout: The class-action suit could drain resources and deter institutional investors.

Conclusion: A High-Risk, High-Reward Gamble

Zynex's valuation—currently trading at ~$140 million market cap, down from $400 million pre-suspension—reflects deep skepticism about its ability to resolve the Tricare issue. For contrarian investors willing to bet on a Tricare resolution by early 2026, the stock offers asymmetric upside. However, the risks are manifold: a prolonged suspension, legal liabilities, and a lack of near-term revenue catalysts could sink the company.

Recommendation:

- Aggressive Investors: Consider a small position (e.g., 1–2% of portfolio) with a strict stop-loss tied to Tricare's public statements. Monitor cash burn and any regulatory updates closely.

- Conservative Investors: Avoid ZYXI until Tricare provides clarity or the company secures alternative revenue streams.

In short, Zynex is a “heads I win, tails I'm wiped out” play. Only those with a high risk tolerance—and a timeline aligned with a Tricare resolution—should consider it. For everyone else, the risks remain too great.

“It’s been a privilege to serve as the Project Officer for the French Creek Medical Clinic,” said Miles.","JACKSONVILLE, N.C. – Navy Medicine, Marine Corps, and the Defense Health Agency celebrated the opening of a brand new, state-of-the-art Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation (SMART) Clinic and Human Performance Center with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on July 02, 2025.

The facility spans approximately 20,000 square feet and integrates sports medicine physicians, athletic trainers, and allied health professionals in a state-of-the-art environment focused on returning injured School of Infantry-East students to full mission readiness.

“The Camp Geiger SMART Clinic brings targeted, performance-based care to our Marines,” said Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Miles, DHA health facilities planning & project officer. “Every decision–from design to delivery–focused on getting warfighters back to full strength faster. It’s rewarding to see the clinic now open and fulfilling that mission.”

The Camp Geiger SMART Clinic/SOI-East Human Performance Center is part of the Marine Centered Medical Home project which began in 2013. The focus is modernizing all of Camp Lejeune’s various branch clinic services in a joint effort between the Defense Health Agency, the Navy and Marine Corps.

“We're coming from a 6,500 square feet [facility] to 20,000 square feet, so the scalability is there to take bigger groups on and not have to break our companies or platoons into smaller groups; which allows us to work with and educate more people with the same amount of resources,” said Darin Peterson, the Human Performance Center director for SOI-East.

According to Peterson, the new facility is an elite hub for physical education, training, and getting warfighters back in the fight.

“It might sound cliché but walking in and seeing a facility that rivals any divisional and college facility creates an immediate buy-in from the warfighter,” Peterson said. “This investment in the Marines and the Sailors is about giving back to the warfighter, the actual person with boots on the ground, that has always been the main effort.”

In addition to the updated facilities for the Camp Geiger SMART Clinic, the MCMH initiative has already modernized services at Hadnot Point, Wallace Creek, New River, and French Creek clinics with construction on the Camp Johnson clinic underway.

MCMH French Creek celebrated its grand reopening on June 10. The upgraded facility boasts multiple services under one roof, serving approximately 7,000 Marines and Sailors attached to 2nd Marine Logistics Group. Services include primary care, readiness, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, and immunizations among others.

“It’s been a privilege to serve as the Project Officer for the French Creek Medical Clinic,” said Miles. “This facility reflects the teamwork, precision, and commitment it takes to deliver a modern healthcare environment in direct support of operational forces. From design through activation, every step of this project has been about readiness, access, and ensuring Marines receive the care they need where it matters most.”

My mother has suffered an aneurysm yesterday. My dad somehow realized something was wrong in the nick of time and started CPR/ contacted emergency services so they made it to the hospital in time to save her life. From my memory in the past I am pretty sure they are on TRICARE Prime, what I would like to know is has anyone had a life threatening emergency while having TRICARE as their main insurance? What did the coverage look like? Is there any way I can contact someone to get details as to what should be covered and what kind of out of pocket costs my parents will have to deal with? If my mother makes it out of this the first thing she will go to worrying about when she wakes up and is stable is how much being in the hospital is going to cost. I would like to at least get a good idea of what I or my dad should be doing to make this as smooth as possible (I know it wont be).

I have been living overseas for a few years now but I am more than willing to make an international phone call, my dad has enough on his plate right now monitoring my mom at the hospital and going back home to check on our family dog. He's told me not to come home but I can't bare to sit here and be of no help to my family.

""Health care for military families is one of the most important things for recruitment and retention.
Addressing concerns about potential downsizing or changes to IACH's mission, Ferrara was clear in his support for the facility.
Despite acknowledging the financial challenges facing military healthcare, Ferrara expressed admiration for the innovation and adaptability he consistently observes at military treatment facilities.
Ferrara’s visit affirmed what those on the front lines already know: readiness begins with care, and care begins here.","FORT RILEY, Kansas – What does it mean to be mission-ready—medically, operationally, and as a team? For the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, the answer lies not in policy memos or PowerPoint decks, but in the work happening inside military hospitals like Irwin Army Community Hospital.

On June 30, Ferrara walked the halls of IACH to understand firsthand how the Military Health System can better support the 1st Infantry Division and its families. He spent the day engaging with healthcare providers, leadership, and staff to assess the facility's capabilities and address concerns about the future of military healthcare at Fort Riley, home to the oldest continuously serving active-duty division in the U.S. Army.

Ferrara, who serves as what he describes as ""the CEO of the Military Health System,"" brings a unique perspective to his role as principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense on all health-related matters. His purview includes oversight of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which now manages all military treatment facilities across the globe, serving 9.5 million beneficiaries worldwide.

""It's really important for me to get to the deck plate, to get to where people are doing the work, so that I can understand it,"" Ferrara said during his visit. As a former Navy officer, he understands that each military installation has its own unique mission and character. ""I find that each site, whether it's a hospital or whether it's an operational unit, is incredibly unique. It has its own mission. It has its own texture, so to speak.""

This hands-on leadership approach drives Ferrara's frequent visits to military installations. Rather than relying solely on reports and briefings from the Pentagon, he prioritizes direct engagement with the medical professionals and support staff who deliver care daily. ""When you're back at the Pentagon, information that comes to you is always highly curated, highly filtered,"" he said. ""I don't like to think of Fort Riley or Irwin Army Community Hospital as a line on a spreadsheet or a slide on a PowerPoint. I want to see the work that's being done.""

Ferrara's visit to Fort Riley was particularly significant given the critical role the Big Red One plays in deploying forces to fight and win the nation’s wars. ""The First Division is incredibly important to the Army and to our national security,"" he said. ""So how we can support the healthcare here in rural Kansas is really important.""

The Acting Assistant Secretary recognized IACH's vital role in supporting military families, particularly through its robust obstetrics and gynecology program. He highlighted how quality healthcare for military families directly impacts recruitment, retention, and mission readiness. ""Health care for military families is one of the most important things for recruitment and retention. It also is really critical to ensuring that our Soldiers are able to stay focused on their mission when they know that they or their family are getting high quality healthcare.""

Ferrara stressed the importance of maintaining a ""medically ready force"" while ensuring deployed Soldiers have confidence their families receive excellent care in their absence. ""If they go downrange, they know that their family is in excellent hands,"" he said, referring to the trust Soldiers must have in their military treatment facility.

Addressing concerns about potential downsizing or changes to IACH's mission, Ferrara was clear in his support for the facility. ""I don't want to downsize IACH. That's not my goal,"" he said. Instead, his focus is on enhancing the hospital's capabilities and ensuring it operates at maximum capacity.

""To me, the definition of success for a hospital is a busy hospital doing high volume, high complexity care,"" Ferrara said. ""My goal is to figure out how I can make IACH even more successful. That is the reason I'm here.""

The Acting Assistant Secretary acknowledged that IACH represents a significant investment as a relatively new facility that must be optimized for patient care and military readiness training. His vision focuses on ensuring medical personnel maintain their skills through consistent, complex patient care that will prepare them for potential deployment scenarios.

The visit reinforced Ferrara's philosophy that healthcare delivery is fundamentally about trust – what he called ""the compact that we form with those families and with those service members."" This compact represents a promise to provide the resources, personnel, equipment, and supplies necessary to deliver exceptional care.

Despite acknowledging the financial challenges facing military healthcare, Ferrara expressed admiration for the innovation and adaptability he consistently observes at military treatment facilities. ""This is a resource constrained environment. That's not a mystery to anyone,"" he said. ""What I'm always impressed by is people's ability to innovate and to adapt and to solve problems either through sweat equity or through great ideas.""

This perspective reflects his understanding that the Military Health System operates as ""a giant team sport,"" where best practices developed at one facility can benefit the entire system. His visits help identify successful innovations that can be shared across the network of military treatment facilities.

As the 1st Infantry Division trains to fight and win the nation’s wars, IACH stands ready, not just with beds and equipment, but with the trust of Soldiers and the care of families. Ferrara’s visit affirmed what those on the front lines already know: readiness begins with care, and care begins here.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9144882/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-07-02 14:56:32.844933

Ferrara received a comprehensive overview of the medical center’s operations, including briefings from the Defense Health Agency’s Genetics Reference Laboratory, the Critical Care Air Transport Team, the Internal Medicine residency program, and Radiation Oncology, among others.

“We have an outstanding team that dedicates themselves daily to caring for our beneficiaries,” said Col. Peter Kulis, Director of Keesler Medical Center. “Our relationship with community partners is unparalleled, and we are continually seeking opportunities to strengthen these collaborations, including with the VA and civilian medical centers. These partnerships are crucial for our airmen, as they not only maintain but also enhance their clinical skills.”

Ferrara agreed, emphasizing the importance of understanding perspectives of those on the ground. “I think it is important to get the ‘boots on the ground” perspective, to talk to the people who do the work. I’ve met a lot of great staff, hugely professional people in an outstanding military treatment facility, Ferrara said. “I’m looking forward to working with the leadership team in developing the opportunities and courses of action that were discussed today.”

During his visit, Ferrara emphasized the critical role of Keesler to the local community and the broader mission of the Department of Defense. “Keesler is an essential part of the Military Health System and serves as a lynchpin in our mission,” he said. “I can say unequivocally that I have not been anywhere that has as much local and state support as Keesler. My visit here is a show of our commitment to this team and these relationships.”

Ferrara shared his personal connection to military treatment facilities. “My children were born in an MTF. There is nothing more important than taking care of the people our service members care for the most. When our airmen are deployed, they don’t have to worry about their family – they can focus on the mission because MTFs like Keesler will take care of their family members.’

He concluded by underscoring the unique role of the Military Health System. “There are many great healthcare systems in America, but we’re the only Great American Healthcare System that goes to war—so that always has to be our focus. We must be ready to fight tonight. You cannot cram for readiness.”

A Defense Health Agency project called Targeted Care, aimed at enhancing access to mental health support, is showing promising results. Patients at sites using Targeted Care are getting their first mental health appointment more quickly.

Data shows that Targeted Care reduces the average time for patients to get support by 5.3 days, said Angelica Escalona, who holds a doctorate in clinical psychology with a specialty in neuropsychology and is the clinical director of outpatient behavioral health in DHA’s behavioral health clinical management team.

The average number of days from intake to the first follow-up or group appointment decreased by 7.1 days from January 2023 to May 2024.

Targeted Care streamlines the process for people seeking mental health care. After an intake interview by a trained mental health professional, patients are directed to the mental health resource that best suits their needs. This can include military and family life counselors, primary care, mental health specialty care, chaplains, or many other clinical or nonclinical programs on the installation.

“Not every challenge is best met by clinical mental health services,” said Escalona. “The Targeted Care process helps mental health staff identify the needs of incoming patients and match them with the best resource to get help quickly.”

This approach enables more efficient use of clinical mental health resources, helping patients get help quickly. You don’t need a referral, and you won’t be turned away or denied specialty care. “Patients don't leave the clinic without an appointment or some kind of guidance,” said Escalona. “Clinic staff make sure that the person has something in hand, whether it's a resource, a phone number to reach a resource, an attempt to reach the resource and get them into that resource, or they’ve booked an appointment.”

Winn Army Community Hospital, which serves Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia, began using Targeted Care in 2024. U.S. Army Lt. Col. Gina Wright, the chief of behavioral health at the hospital and a licensed clinical social worker, said Targeted Care has a positive impact on patients. “Targeted Care increases awareness of mental health prevention and treatment programs and improves the synergy between them.”

Another feature Wright and Escalona highlighted is the warm handoff for patients in the clinic. “We help the patient make the phone call to book an appointment with their own phone,” said Wright. “That way, they’re taking the initiative themselves, and they have an appointment before they leave the clinic.”

“We try to make sure that a person feels they're heard,” said Escalona. “They're not being turned away.”

Nearly 27 mental health clinics across the DHA are currently using Targeted Care, said Escalona. It’s rolling out to the rest of the Military Health System this year.

Service members and families alike have access to a wide range of mental health support programs, including primary care behavioral health, specialty outpatient behavioral health, alcohol and other substance misuse, and gambling programs, inpatient hospitalization, and intensive outpatient programs.

That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games.
So, I’m going to put the Irish flag on my bike and dedicate it for her mom.” For Hong, his participation at Warrior Games is much bigger than winning.","As he trains for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games in July, U.S. Army Sgt. 1st Class David Hong attributes his success to “a real team”—though, he’s not talking about his fellow athletes on Team Army.

“I’ve had a team of people that went through my journey, from the platoon sergeants, the squad leaders, my nurse case manager … they’ve participated in my ‘scrimmages,’ my meetings and appointments,” he said.

The team captain: His primary care physician at the time, Paul Haufe, a physician assistant at Evans Army Community Hospital, who encouraged Hong to get a routine colonoscopy at age 50.

“He initiated all of this,” said Hong. “He was always there for me from the get-go, even behind the scenes.”

When Hong received a lifechanging diagnosis, stage 4 colon cancer, his doctor urgently formed a comprehensive care team to start treatment: Specialists, nurses, and other dedicated personnel within the Military Health System.

“They were my coaches, they pushed me,” Hong said.

A Cancer Diagnosis, A Path to Recovery

When Hong was due for his first routine colonoscopy in July 2022, his primary care physician “didn't give me a choice,” he said.

“It was the second time my PCP recommended that I get the screening done. I actually refused to do it because I was busy,” Hong said. “He was going to talk to my command to make sure that I went through with that referral to do the colonoscopy … so I went.”

Besides, he said, he felt fine.

The screening caught a cancerous blockage in his colon, which Hong credits the preventive screening with saving his life.

“These types of cancers, people are getting younger and getting them—they are preventable,” he said. At Hong’s encouragement, twelve chaplains he worked with scheduled their colonoscopies.

He was immediately connected to the gastrointestinal specialist, surgical team, and nurses within Evans.

“It was right at the hospital, and with their capabilities—they were able to have all the resources there to do the cancer removal there the following week,” Hong said.

He had part of his colon removed, but the cancer spread to his lymph nodes. The following month, he started chemotherapy at CommonSpirit Penrose Cancer Center through the TRICARE health plan network, which gives access to a wide range of healthcare services by TRICARE-authorized providers—offering streamlined access and reduced costs to nonmilitary hospitals and clinics.

“It was a combination of treatments” through both hospitals, he said, that started his recovery journey.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I've been working with very closely, now,” Hong said. He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.

Hong went through a total of 23 treatments of chemotherapy and had several surgeries to remove the cancer, as well as part of his liver and stomach lining. He kept up with treatment and appointments through Maria Schuch, the nurse case manager assigned to the Fort Carson Soldier Recovery Unit—a support system that he credits with a proactive approach to his care.

“Right from the beginning, she was really engaged, and she knew what she needed to provide. She was on top of all my referrals. It really was teamwork,” he said. “Get connected with a nurse case manager. They aren’t there to babysit you, and they make sure all your records are updated.”

While he recovered, he found adaptive sports therapy through the Soldier Recovery Unit, a program within the Army Recovery Care Program at Fort Carson, Colorado, and participated in archery, cycling, and field events. That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games. While at the trials, he was awarded “Heart of the Team” from his fellow athletes.

Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover. “They’re all excellent in their own way. They've been providing the same care, very professional and on top of things,” he said. “It's a blessing.”

Service Rooted in Faith, Recovery in Adaptive Care

Hong, a religious affairs specialist who joined the U.S. Army as a chaplain’s assistant, knows from both perspectives that seeking help is a sign of strength. Chaplains, he learned, are often the first line of defense when service members may be struggling.

“We screen soldiers that may have issues, and we try to link them up with the right resources,” he said. “We try to work very closely with behavioral health, because I think our culture in the military, any branch, if you show any type of weakness—especially mentally—people may get scared or afraid, you know, because they don't know that resources are out there.”

As one who sought mental health support himself, he encourages anyone to talk to a chaplain for support.

“I think as religious affairs and chaplains, we bring a different perspective. We can introduce you to a resource that might work for you,” he said. “It's always the safety of the individual that is important. We try to give them all the resources necessary, especially with mental health.”

Backed by Team on the Way to the Games

On the sidelines are Hong’s cheerleaders: his wife, Monica, and family who has been his support throughout all of his health challenges.

“Going to cancer treatment with my wife, having her there next to me, having my sister, going through my treatment— there are days that I didn't want to do it,” he said. “My children are everything.”

He also credits his military leadership and fellow chaplains for being there for him.

“They were there to sacrifice their time and then all the phone calls that (I made) whenever I needed to talk to somebody like the chaplains, friends, even the leadership, they were there checking up on me. I think that's so important.”

Hong is also finding strength through his fellow wounded warriors, as they shared stories of recovery and resilience leading up to the Warrior Games.

“When I went to the Army trials, I heard everybody's different story. And I was like, ‘wow, I want to be part of this,’” he said. “I was seeking a community. It's so therapeutical and so good for you to be part of a mission.”

Hong is still receiving care, and he feels like he’s in good hands through continued monitoring and checkups: “It's all hands on deck and they’re doing all of the things they should be doing.” It’s because of his healthcare team, he said, that he can still serve in the U.S. Army.

“It’s harder because I'm not able to do the job that I want to do because of my health, and it took time for me to process, but I’m still here,” he said. “Maybe (serving) can be a different, in the way of helping soldiers and their families and the veterans—a different kind of position, maybe part of a plan to give strength to others who might be going through something similar.”

While at the games in Colorado Springs, he plans to pay homage to a particular healthcare team member while competing: Schuch, his nurse case manager at the SRU.

“I’ve had a team of people that went through my journey, from the platoon sergeants, the squad leaders, my nurse case manager … they’ve participated in my ‘scrimmages,’ my meetings and appointments,” he said.

The team captain: His primary care physician at the time, Paul Haufe, a physician assistant at Evans Army Community Hospital, who encouraged Hong to get a routine colonoscopy at age 50.

“He initiated all of this,” said Hong. “He was always there for me from the get-go, even behind the scenes.”

When Hong received a lifechanging diagnosis, stage 4 colon cancer, his doctor urgently formed a comprehensive care team to start treatment: Specialists, nurses, and other dedicated personnel within the Military Health System.

“They were my coaches, they pushed me,” Hong said.

A Cancer Diagnosis, A Path to Recovery

When Hong was due for his first routine colonoscopy in July 2022, his primary care physician “didn't give me a choice,” he said.

“It was the second time my PCP recommended that I get the screening done. I actually refused to do it because I was busy,” Hong said. “He was going to talk to my command to make sure that I went through with that referral to do the colonoscopy … so I went.”

Besides, he said, he felt fine.

The screening caught a cancerous blockage in his colon, which Hong credits the preventive screening with saving his life.

“These types of cancers, people are getting younger and getting them—they are preventable,” he said. At Hong’s encouragement, twelve chaplains he worked with scheduled their colonoscopies.

He was immediately connected to the gastrointestinal specialist, surgical team, and nurses within Evans.

“It was right at the hospital, and with their capabilities—they were able to have all the resources there to do the cancer removal there the following week,” Hong said.

He had part of his colon removed, but the cancer spread to his lymph nodes. The following month, he started chemotherapy at CommonSpirit Penrose Cancer Center through the TRICARE health plan network, which gives access to a wide range of healthcare services by TRICARE-authorized providers—offering streamlined access and reduced costs to nonmilitary hospitals and clinics.

“It was a combination of treatments” through both hospitals, he said, that started his recovery journey.

“My surgeon recommended me to go to Penrose Cancer Center, which I've been working with very closely, now,” Hong said. He initially received 12 rounds of chemotherapy at the center, but the cancer spread to his liver and stomach.

Hong went through a total of 23 treatments of chemotherapy and had several surgeries to remove the cancer, as well as part of his liver and stomach lining. He kept up with treatment and appointments through Maria Schuch, the nurse case manager assigned to the Fort Carson Soldier Recovery Unit—a support system that he credits with a proactive approach to his care.

“Right from the beginning, she was really engaged, and she knew what she needed to provide. She was on top of all my referrals. It really was teamwork,” he said. “Get connected with a nurse case manager. They aren’t there to babysit you, and they make sure all your records are updated.”

While he recovered, he found adaptive sports therapy through the Soldier Recovery Unit, a program within the Army Recovery Care Program at Fort Carson, Colorado, and participated in archery, cycling, and field events. That took him all the way to the Army Trials, where he earned a spot on Team Army and a trip to the 2025 Warrior Games. While at the trials, he was awarded “Heart of the Team” from his fellow athletes.

Aside from his U.S. Army teammates, he credits the team at Evans and at Penrose with helping him recover. “They’re all excellent in their own way. They've been providing the same care, very professional and on top of things,” he said. “It's a blessing.”

Service Rooted in Faith, Recovery in Adaptive Care

Hong, a religious affairs specialist who joined the U.S. Army as a chaplain’s assistant, knows from both perspectives that seeking help is a sign of strength. Chaplains, he learned, are often the first line of defense when service members may be struggling.

“We screen soldiers that may have issues, and we try to link them up with the right resources,” he said. “We try to work very closely with behavioral health, because I think our culture in the military, any branch, if you show any type of weakness—especially mentally—people may get scared or afraid, you know, because they don't know that resources are out there.”

As one who sought mental health support himself, he encourages anyone to talk to a chaplain for support.

“I think as religious affairs and chaplains, we bring a different perspective. We can introduce you to a resource that might work for you,” he said. “It's always the safety of the individual that is important. We try to give them all the resources necessary, especially with mental health.”

Backed by Team on the Way to the Games

On the sidelines are Hong’s cheerleaders: his wife, Monica, and family who has been his support throughout all of his health challenges.

“Going to cancer treatment with my wife, having her there next to me, having my sister, going through my treatment— there are days that I didn't want to do it,” he said. “My children are everything.”

He also credits his military leadership and fellow chaplains for being there for him.

“They were there to sacrifice their time and then all the phone calls that (I made) whenever I needed to talk to somebody like the chaplains, friends, even the leadership, they were there checking up on me. I think that's so important.”

Hong is also finding strength through his fellow wounded warriors, as they shared stories of recovery and resilience leading up to the Warrior Games.

“When I went to the Army trials, I heard everybody's different story. And I was like, ‘wow, I want to be part of this,’” he said. “I was seeking a community. It's so therapeutical and so good for you to be part of a mission.”

Hong is still receiving care, and he feels like he’s in good hands through continued monitoring and checkups: “It's all hands on deck and they’re doing all of the things they should be doing.” It’s because of his healthcare team, he said, that he can still serve in the U.S. Army.

“It’s harder because I'm not able to do the job that I want to do because of my health, and it took time for me to process, but I’m still here,” he said. “Maybe (serving) can be a different, in the way of helping soldiers and their families and the veterans—a different kind of position, maybe part of a plan to give strength to others who might be going through something similar.”

While at the games in Colorado Springs, he plans to pay homage to a particular healthcare team member while competing: Schuch, his nurse case manager at the SRU.

“My manager’s mom passed away, and she’s from Ireland. So, I’m going to put the Irish flag on my bike and dedicate it for her mom.”

For Hong, his participation at Warrior Games is much bigger than winning. It’s all part of being a team.

“Obviously we want to win because we're competitive, but we also want to win in every way, shape in life,” he said. “I didn't get here on my own.

Ferrara received a comprehensive overview of the medical center’s operations, including briefings from the Defense Health Agency’s Genetics Reference Laboratory, the Critical Care Air Transport Team, the Internal Medicine residency program, and Radiation Oncology, among others.

“We have an outstanding team that dedicates themselves daily to caring for our beneficiaries,” said Col. Peter Kulis, Director of Keesler Medical Center. “Our relationship with community partners is unparalleled, and we are continually seeking opportunities to strengthen these collaborations, including with the VA and civilian medical centers. These partnerships are crucial for our Airmen, as they not only maintain but also enhance their clinical skills.”

Ferrara agreed, emphasizing the importance of understanding perspectives of those on the ground.

“I think it is important to get the ‘boots on the ground” perspective, to talk to the people who do the work. I’ve met a lot of great staff, hugely professional people in an outstanding military treatment facility, Ferrara said. “I’m looking forward to working with the leadership team in developing the opportunities and courses of action that were discussed today.”

During his visit, Ferrara emphasized the critical role of Keesler to the local community and the broader mission of the Department of Defense.

“Keesler is an essential part of the Military Health System and serves as a lynchpin in our mission,” he said. “I can say unequivocally that I have not been anywhere that has as much local and state support as Keesler. My visit here is a show of our commitment to this team and these relationships.”

Ferrara shared his personal connection to military treatment facilities.

“My children were born in an MTF. There is nothing more important than taking care of the people our service members care for the most. When our Airmen are deployed, they don’t have to worry about their family – they can focus on the mission because MTFs like Keesler will take care of their family members.’

He concluded by underscoring the unique role of the Military Health System.

“There are many great healthcare systems in America, but we’re the only Great American Healthcare System that goes to war—so that always has to be our focus. We must be ready to fight tonight. You cannot cram for readiness.”

Recent research from the University of Maryland School of Medicine has revealed concerning health and resource implications of sleep apnea among active-duty military personnel in the United States. The study highlights that over 10% of Americans suffer from obstructive sleep apnea, a condition that significantly increases the likelihood of developing severe health issues, including heart disease.

The findings indicate that soldiers diagnosed with sleep apnea are more than four times more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and three times more likely to sustain a traumatic brain injury compared to their peers without the disorder. Published in the journal CHEST, this comprehensive study represents the most extensive examination of the health impacts and resource burdens posed by sleep apnea within the military.

Lead author Emerson M. Wickwire, who is also the Section Chief of Sleep Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, emphasized the critical need for early detection and intervention for sleep apnea among service members. He stated that quantifying the health and resource burden of this condition could assist in directing clinical resources within the military health system, including enhancing provider education and improving patient screening and treatment.

Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep, leading to a range of health risks, such as type 2 diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and depression. Symptoms typically include chronic snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and alterations in mood and behavior.

Military personnel often face demanding work schedules that hinder their ability to achieve the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. Research indicates that only one-third of active-duty service members manage to meet this sleep guideline. Furthermore, there has been a significant increase in sleep apnea diagnoses within the military, with reported cases skyrocketing from 11 to 333 per 10,000 service members between 2005 and 2019.

In conducting the study, researchers utilized anonymized data from the Military Health System repository, creating two matched cohorts of nearly 60,000 active-duty service members aged 17 to 64, one group diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and the other without. The study revealed that, within the year following a sleep apnea diagnosis, affected service members incurred an additional 170,511 outpatient medical visits, 1,852 emergency department visits, and 66 hospitalizations compared to their counterparts.

Moreover, those with sleep apnea exhibited a higher risk and quicker onset of various medical issues, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injuries, and musculoskeletal injuries. Col. Vincent F. Capaldi, II, Chair of Psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University, pointed out that sleep apnea extends beyond being a mere medical concern; it poses a significant threat to military readiness.

The collaboration between the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Uniformed Services University aims to address the shortage of sleep specialists within the military health system. They are initiating a new clinical trial called 'Tele-Sleep OSA,' which seeks to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of telehealth consultations for military personnel diagnosed with sleep apnea.

Mark T. Gladwin, Dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, expressed eagerness to commence patient enrollment in this vital study, which aims to enhance health outcomes for military members. With fewer than 40 active-duty sleep physicians available in the military health system, improving access to specialists is critical. Research has shown that providing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can significantly lower the risk of mortality related to heart conditions by 55% and overall mortality by 37%.",https://themunicheye.com/content_images/open-graph-tme.webp,N,0.0,2025-07-02 06:56:25.426336

Important Information Regarding Existing Referrals Specialty care referrals approved before May 27, 2025, remain covered under the DHA Referral Waiver until September 30, 2025.","JULY 1, 2025 – TRICARE beneficiaries on Fort Leavenworth and surrounding communities are now able to access their specialty care referrals and authorizations faster and more efficiently through the TriWest Patient Portal. This change, recently implemented, streamlines the referral process for beneficiaries needing care off-post for services not offered at Munson Army Health Center.

Previously, beneficiaries relied on receiving referrals via mail. Now, accessing them online through the TriWest Patient Portal allows for quicker appointment scheduling and a more convenient healthcare experience.

“We began routing new referral processing for specialty care through TriWest, our TRICARE Regional Contractor,” said Col. Jolanda L.J. Walker, Munson Army Health Center director, during her monthly update to community leaders on the installation, June 18. “This is for beneficiaries who need a referral for care off post in the community for services not offered at our facility. The main change for our beneficiary population is that they will now need to visit the TriWest Patient Portal at: https://tricare-bene.triwest.com/signin to get a copy of their referral or wait for it to arrive from TriWest via snail mail.”

Here’s how to register for the TriWest Patient Portal and access your referrals:

Go to https://tricare.mil/west.

Use the self-service link at the top to access the secure beneficiary portal.

Sign up as a new user (or log in if you’re already registered).

Start enjoying the self-service features and benefits.

Take Control of Your Healthcare

The beneficiary self-service portal simplifies accessing healthcare information, allowing you to manage benefits easily and efficiently, all in one place. Once the authorization appears in the TriWest Patient Portal, patients are responsible for scheduling their civilian network specialty care appointments, following the instructions provided in the authorization letter.

Important Information Regarding Existing Referrals

Specialty care referrals approved before May 27, 2025, remain covered under the DHA Referral Waiver until September 30, 2025. Referrals from military or civilian Primary Care Managers (PCMs) outside of MAHC written before May 27, 2025, are also covered until September 30, 2025.

“We understand that this change may require some adjustment for our population,” Walker said. “We are committed to providing the necessary support and resources to ensure a seamless transition.”

Unlock your health by understanding the types of care—and when to use them—to make better choices for you and your family.

Emergency care

If your life, limb, or eyesight is at risk, you’re having a medical emergency. Chest pain, trouble breathing, severe bleeding, and broken bones are examples of emergencies that need immediate attention. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

TRICARE covers emergency care anywhere in the world. You also don’t need a referral or pre-authorization to get it. However, for TRICARE Prime, you should contact your primary care manager within 24 hours—or the next business day—after receiving care. You may also need a referral for any follow-up treatment to avoid out-of-pocket costs.

Urgent care—but not an emergency

Not every issue is an emergency, but that doesn’t mean it can wait. Urgent care is for conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t emergencies.

Most TRICARE plans allow you to visit any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center without a referral, but it all depends on your plan and beneficiary group. Certain rules apply if you’re active duty or enrolled in a TRICARE overseas plan, so be sure to check ahead of time.

If you’re unsure about the seriousness of your symptoms, the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line is available 24/7. If you live overseas, call your TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center.

Routine care

Routine or primary care is the foundation of everyday health. Whether it’s a routine physical, managing chronic conditions, or a lingering cough, your PCM is your first point of contact. These providers know your medical history and can treat a wide variety of conditions and follow ups—or refer you to a specialist if needed.

Use the Find a Doctor Tool to locate a provider near you.

Specialty care

Sometimes, your health concern requires care from a provider who’s trained in a specific area of medicine. Specialists—like cardiologists, neurologists, or dermatologists—can diagnose and treat more complex conditions within their field.

Depending on your plan, you may need a referral to see a specialist. With TRICARE Prime, for example, you need a referral from your PCM. If your plan doesn’t require one, you can schedule directly with a TRICARE-authorized provider. If you’re unsure, the TRICARE Customer Service Directory is a good place to start.

(Note: If you’re enrolled in TRICARE Prime in the West Region, the specialty care referral approval waiver expired June 30. Starting July 1, you should follow all normal referral processes according to the rules of your TRICARE plan.)

Preventive care

You don’t have to be sick to see a health care provider. Preventive care—like cancer screenings, immunizations, and well-child care—are key to long-term health and readiness. Even when you feel fine, these services can catch problems early or help prevent them altogether.

TRICARE covers a wide range of preventive services. What’s more, you’ll have no cost for these services when received from a network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet.

Be prepared

It’s easier to make the right decision when you know your options ahead of time. Unlock your health by reviewing your TRICARE plan, finding covered providers, and saving contact numbers.

Both agents and military retirees need to understand how TRICARE and Medicare coverage works in tandem. While both programs provide robust healthcare coverage, the rules around enrollment, coordination of benefits, and plan options may be confusing.

In this post, we’ll break down what TRICARE is, how it works with Medicare, key eligibility requirements, and what agents and beneficiaries need to know to ensure continuous and cost-effective coverage.

What Is TRICARE

TRICARE is the health care program for:

Uniformed service members (active duty and retired)

Their families

National Guard/Reserve members

Survivors and some former spouses

Administered by the Defense Health Agency (DHA), TRICARE provides coverage similar to private insurance plans and includes prescription drug benefits.

When a TRICARE Beneficiary Becomes Medicare-Eligible

When a TRICARE beneficiary turns 65 (or qualifies for Medicare earlier due to disability), they typically must enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B to maintain their TRICARE coverage.

Once they enroll in Medicare, TRICARE becomes TRICARE for Life (TFL).

What Is TRICARE For Life (TFL)

TRICARE for Life is the coverage that kicks in after a beneficiary becomes eligible for Medicare and enrolls in both Part A and Part B. TFL acts as a secondary payer to Medicare. Here’s how it works:

Medicare pays first (as the primary insurance)

TFL pays second, covering most or all of the remaining costs

Out-of-pocket costs are minimal or nonexistent for covered services

Important: If a TRICARE beneficiary does not enroll in Medicare Part B, they will lose TRICARE coverage, unless they are an active-duty service member or family member of one.

Coverage Details: Medicare TRICARE for Life

Can TFL Beneficiaries Enroll in Medicare Advantage

Technically, yes; TFL beneficiaries can enroll in a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, but this often creates coverage conflicts and doesn’t offer cost savings.

Agents should caution beneficiaries:

TFL does not coordinate well with MA plans.

Some services covered by TFL may be denied if the MA plan doesn’t approve them.

MA plans may interfere with how TFL pays claims.

Most beneficiaries are better off staying with Original Medicare + TRICARE for Life.

Do TFL Beneficiaries Need Medicare Part D

No, TFL includes a robust pharmacy benefit through Express Scripts. Enrolling in a separate Medicare Part D plan may result in:

Loss of TRICARE pharmacy coverage

Unnecessary monthly premiums

Coordination issues

Agents: When working with TRICARE beneficiaries, always ask if they use the Express Scripts program before discussing Part D options.

Key Points for Medicare Agents

Do not sell Medicare Advantage or Part D plans to TFL beneficiaries without reviewing the consequences.

Always verify TRICARE status before recommending plan changes.

Turning 65 is a triggering event that requires Medicare Part A & B enrollment to keep TRICARE.

TFL works best with Original Medicare not Advantage plans.

Help clients plan for premium costs; Medicare Part B still has a monthly premium, even with TFL.

Key Takeaways for Beneficiaries

Enroll in Medicare Part A and B when eligible to keep your TRICARE benefits.

TRICARE for Life + Medicare offers comprehensive, low-cost healthcare.

Avoid Medicare Advantage or Part D unless you understand the impact on your TRICARE benefits.

You do not need Medigap; TFL acts as your Medicare supplement.

For military retirees and their families, TRICARE for Life is a valuable benefit that pairs seamlessly with Medicare; when used correctly. As an agent, your role is to educate and protect beneficiaries from making decisions that could disrupt their healthcare.

Nationwide, the crackdown resulted in charges against 324 defendants, 96 of whom are doctors or other licensed professionals, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in North Texas. The charges against the four Texas defendants include billing Medicare, Tricare and other insurers for millions of dollars in false or fraudulent claims or services that were never performed.

Demetrious Gilmore, 46, of Lubbock was charged by indictment with conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, according to the statement. Through his businesses, Gilmore allegedly submitted $19 million worth of phony claims to a federal worker’s compensation program, according to the indictment. The claims were for benefits, items and services that were ineligible for coverage, not necessary or never performed. Federal authorities seized $1 million from accounts controlled by Gilmore, according to the statement.

Gary Martin, 62, of McKinney was charged by indictment with soliciting and receiving kickbacks for referrals to federal healthcare programs, according to the statement. Martin allegedly submitted $73 million in fake claims to Medicare for over-the-counter COVID-19 tests in 2023. Once Medicare paid the reimbursement for the tests, a co-conspirator of Martin’s paid a kickback based on the reimbursement, federal attorneys said.

Khadeer Khan Mohammed, 44, of India was charged by indictment with healthcare fraud, according to the statement. Mohammed allegedly submitted $93 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare for genetic testing that was never requested, ordered or performed, federal attorneys said. Mohammed submitted the claims using identifying information of physicians who had no relationship to the patients for whom the claims were submitted. $65 million of Mohammed’s claims were paid and authorities seized $6 million from accounts Mohammed controlled, according to the statement.

Olatunbosun Osukoya, 67, of Plano was charged by indictment with conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud, according to the statement. Osukoya allegedly submitted over $25 million in phony claims to Medicare, Tricare and other insurers for electroencephalogram testing. Osukoya allegedly sought out patients with insurance plans to undergo EEG tests, then recruited and paid kickbacks and bribes to physicians to refer those patients to a specific company, federal attorneys said. Osukoya was paid over $5 million for the fraudulent claims and paid out over $450,000 in bribes and kickbacks.

“These individuals lined their own pockets, egregiously stealing beneficiaries’ identities and pillaging the coffers of federal programs,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Nancy Larson. “We will never tolerate this behavior and will relentlessly pursue prosecution of these offenders to the fullest extent possible.”

Developed in 2001 by U.S. Air Force Col. Richard Niemtzow as a rapid-relief option in deployed settings, battlefield acupuncture, or BFA, uses up to five tiny needles placed in the outer ear to help patients manage pain without sedatives or opioids.

BFA targets five specific auricular points to disrupt pain signals and stimulate the body’s natural healing response according to “Pinpoint precision: How Battlefield Acupuncture is reducing pain and boosting readiness,” a recent article posted to the Defense Health Agency website. The technique encourages the release of serotonin, dopamine, melatonin, and endorphins. The procedure is low risk, portable, and well suited for use in clinical and field settings.

At BJACH, BFA is administered by four trained primary care providers: Capt. Charles Rosado, physician; Danielle Craft, nurse practitioner; and certified physician assistants Henry Johnson and Willie Shelton.

“I consider use of battlefield acupuncture in both acute and chronic pain presentations,” Shelton said, noting its effectiveness in treating fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, anxiety and musculoskeletal pain when standard therapies have failed.

“The pain they’ve carried for years is suddenly gone — and they’re in tears from the relief,” he said.

Retired 1st Sgt. Thomas Washington began receiving BFA at BJACH two years ago after suffering from chronic back pain.

“Immediately — within the first five, ten minutes — I noticed relief,” Washington said. He now receives treatment every 14 days and encourages other patients to explore it as an option.

TRICARE Prime beneficiary Kathy Adams reported significant improvement in vocal strain, stress and shoulder pain after beginning BFA treatment, following nearly a year of speech therapy.

“It’s helped not just my voice, but also my stress and shoulder pain,” Adams said.

Studies from the Department of Veterans Affairs indicate that more than 75 percent of BFA recipients report immediate, short-term relief. The procedure does not impair cognitive function, does not involve medication, and can be administered quickly in a clinical setting.

BJACH providers may offer BFA as a standalone therapy or in combination with other treatments such as physical therapy, behavioral health services or medication management.

I did it for my kids thinking it would be better but the two insurance companies would just fight over who paid first. The other company tried everything to get out of paying first.

I have an employer sponsored plan stacked with Select and it’s kind of hit or miss. My primary has a really shitty out-of-network coverage policy (they won’t cover most things OON unless it’s an emergency), so it becomes a hassle trying to get Tricare to not deny those things as well on the premise that I “didn’t follow my primary insurance rules”, even if it’s something Tricare would generally cover. But when it’s in network for my primary, I pay nothing, not even copays because Tricare picks up the rest of the bill. It also comes in handy when you live in an area where there’s a limited number of specialists who take Tricare. Honestly though, the only reason I do it is because my employer health plan is free, but I’m planning on dropping my primary insurance during open enrollment this year. It’s just not worth the hassle to save ~$500 year in out of pocket costs.

Smokeless tobacco use is also prevalent, with 9 percent of veteran and current service member students at postsecondary institutions reporting smokeless tobacco use in 2018.
Tobacco harm reduction (THR) approaches, which involve substituting cigarettes with lower-risk nicotine products like smokeless tobacco or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are less emphasized within VA programs.
While THR research shows potential for those resistant to quitting, VA programs and policies heavily favor traditional approaches.
The VA should continue to support trials comparing THR to existing methods and expand harm reduction approaches for veterans who smoke.","Approximately 11 percent of veterans presenting for first-time care at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities meet criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD), compared to 8.6 percent of the general population. This difference is more pronounced in specific subgroups, such as veterans with combat exposure or co-occurring mental health disorders. For example, 20 percent of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) also have an SUD, and 63 percent of recent Afghanistan/Iraq veterans with SUDs meet PTSD criteria. The lifetime prevalence of SUDs among veterans is estimated at 53 percent—significantly higher than the general population rate of approximately 17 percent. The VA offers a robust suite of SUD services including screening, outpatient and inpatient treatment, harm reduction, and specialized programs for veterans of Middle East conflicts, women veterans, and veterans from rural areas. These programs help reduce mortality, improve SUD and mental health symptoms, and address social needs like homelessness.

Tobacco use among U.S. veterans also remains a significant health concern. Data from the 2010-2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health shows that 29.2 percent of veterans reported using tobacco, with cigarettes (21.6 percent) being the most common, followed by cigars (6.2 percent) and smokeless tobacco (5.2 percent). Younger veterans (18-25 years old) showed the highest rates at 56.8 percent, influenced by factors like low income, lack of insurance, and psychological distress. Tobacco use in the Military Health System (MHS) declined from 2016 to 2022 but saw a slight uptick in the last two years. Military culture, deployment stress, and targeted tobacco industry marketing contribute to these elevated rates. Studies like the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study highlight that veterans, especially younger ones, use both cigarettes and non-cigarette products like e-cigarettes at higher rates than non-veterans. Smokeless tobacco use is also prevalent, with 9 percent of veteran and current service member students at postsecondary institutions reporting smokeless tobacco use in 2018. Cessation efforts face challenges, with counseling rates declining in the MHS.

The VA primarily focuses on traditional tobacco cessation approaches, emphasizing complete abstinence through counseling, pharmacotherapy (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], varenicline, bupropion), and digital tools like SmokefreeVET and Quit VET. While these approaches achieve some success, combat exposure and PTSD increase relapse risks. Tobacco harm reduction (THR) approaches, which involve substituting cigarettes with lower-risk nicotine products like smokeless tobacco or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), are less emphasized within VA programs.

Research suggests a multipronged approach—including harm reduction strategies—for veterans with schizophrenia that employs atypical antipsychotics, NRT, and bupropion to reduce cigarette consumption progressively; however, its effectiveness has not been fully evaluated. A 2010 study of Air Force personnel, including some transitioning to veteran status, found that 87 percent of smokers who initiated smokeless tobacco use post-training escalated harm (e.g., dual use of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco) rather than reducing it, with only 16 percent achieving the full benefits of tobacco harm reduction by switching entirely to smokeless tobacco. While this suggests THR’s potential, it also highlights the risks of dual use, which could undermine health benefits compared to VA’s abstinence-focused programs.

VA policies promote NRT and counseling without mentioning THR alternatives like ENDS. The barriers to THR adoption are significant, including concerns about the long-term safety of smokeless tobacco and regulatory restrictions on ENDS, which remain unaddressed in current VA guidelines. While THR research shows potential for those resistant to quitting, VA programs and policies heavily favor traditional approaches. The VA should continue to support trials comparing THR to existing methods and expand harm reduction approaches for veterans who smoke. Modernizing the VA’s tobacco cessation policies in a similar manner to how the agency has embraced harm reduction approaches in treating other SUDs would provide veterans with a larger toolkit to improve their personal health.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Military-Army-Conflict-BOATFOTO.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-01 14:56:26.051484

DHA partners with the organization to benchmark military facilities against civilian counterparts in key sustainability metrics. Practice Greenhealth represents healthcare systems committed to integrating sustainability to protect patients, staff, communities, and the environment.

The achievements stem from an enterprise-wide team effort focused on meeting top-tier sustainability goals and environmental compliance targets.

“These remarkable achievements would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of the DHA headquarters healthcare facilities efficiency program team collaborating with their teammates at our facilities,” said Robert L. Goodman, DHA assistant director for resources and personnel integration. “This collective success recognizes how DHA prioritizes environmental sustainability while delivering safe, reliable health care to our beneficiaries. Congratulations to all the facilities recognized this year.”

About the Armed Forces Blood Program The Armed Services Blood Program is the official Department of Defense provider of blood products for the U.S. armed forces.","In a powerful show of unity and commitment to saving lives, the American Red Cross and the Defense Health Agency’s Armed Services Blood Program have joined forces in a new partnership to fortify the nation’s blood supply and support America’s heroes.

This collaboration enables the Military Health System to receive life-saving blood products from the Red Cross, while expanding Red Cross blood drives on military installations and even aboard ships. The result: more opportunities for generous donors to give blood and a stronger, more resilient blood supply for both military and civilian communities.

“This partnership is a game-changer,” said Dr. Mary Ann Spott, acting director of the Armed Services Blood Program. “Together, we’re ensuring that our service members—whether in combat operations, in military hospitals, or on domestic bases —have access to the blood they need, while also reinforcing the civilian healthcare system.”

“The Red Cross has a long history of supporting our service members and we are honored to expand our support to help those in need of vital blood transfusions,” said Micah Holliman, director of national partnerships for American Red Cross Blood Services. “We are at our strongest when we come together. Blood donation is a simple yet powerful act of patriotism and compassion.”

The Red Cross, ASBP, and the Department of Defense share a unified mission: to meet the blood needs of active-duty service members in times of peace and conflict. Now more than ever, this partnership enhances that mission by ensuring our nation is always prepared with a reliable, responsive blood supply that supports military operations and saves lives.

Every two seconds someone needs a blood transfusion. All blood types are needed on an ongoing basis, but of greatest immediate need is Type O blood which doctors reach for in emergency situations. Type O negative is the universal type and Type O positive can be safely transfused to approximately 80 percent of the population. Individuals of all types, especially those with type O blood, are urged to make an appointment to donate in the coming weeks to help ensure a strong supply this summer. To find a blood drive or schedule a donation, use the Red Cross Blood Donor App, visit RedCrossBlood.org, or call 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767).

All who come to give July 1-14, 2025, will get an exclusive pair of Red Cross x goodr sunglasses, while supplies last. Donors can personalize their one-of-a-kind shades with a blood type sticker! For details, visit RedCrossBlood.org/goodr.

This Independence Day, let us unite in the American spirit of giving and give the gift of life. One American nation. One lifesaving mission. One drop at a time.

More Ways to Give, More Lives to Save

“Working in a hospital setting in patient administration, I see firsthand how critical blood donations are,” said Captain Bryan Wallace who donated blood for the first time at a Red Cross blood drive at Maxwell Air Force Base in May. “When I saw this awesome opportunity, I thought, what better time to give than now?”

Military spouses, retirees, and government civilians with base access can now donate blood at either ASBP or Red Cross drives without leaving the installation. Service members at sea will also have more chances to donate while deployed. And civilians who give blood at public Red Cross drives may support military personnel by helping maintain a robust community blood supply which will be shared with the military when needed.

“Every donation is a lifeline,” said Holliman. “Whether it’s a soldier overseas, a veteran at home, or a patient in a local hospital, your blood donation makes a difference.""

A Legacy of Service

This partnership builds on the long-standing Red Cross Services to the Armed Forces program, which helps members of the military, veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors prepare for, cope with, and respond to the challenges of military service, both in the U.S. and abroad.

Maintaining a global presence on more than 100 military installations and deployment sites worldwide, the Red Cross provides communication between service members and their families during times of emergency. The Red Cross also aims to improve the health and wellness of people in the military community through behavioral health and wellness workshops, hospital, clinic and peer support programs and the provision of care, comfort, and therapy items.

About Blood Donation

A blood donor card or driver’s license or two other forms of identification are required at check-in. Individuals who are 17 years of age in most states (16 with parental consent where allowed by state law), weigh at least 110 pounds and are in generally good health may be eligible to donate blood. High school students and other donors 18 years of age and younger also have to meet certain height and weight requirements.

Blood and platelet donors can save time at their next donation by using RapidPass® to complete their pre-donation reading and health history questionnaire online, on the day of their donation, before arriving at the blood drive. To get started, follow the instructions at RedCrossBlood.org/RapidPass or use the Blood Donor App.

Unlock your health by understanding the types of care—and when to use them—to make better choices for you and your family.

Emergency care

If your life, limb, or eyesight is at risk, you’re having a medical emergency. Chest pain, trouble breathing, severe bleeding, and broken bones are examples of emergencies that need immediate attention. If you reasonably believe you have an emergency, always call 911 or your international emergency number. Or, go to the nearest emergency room.

TRICARE covers emergency care anywhere in the world. You also don’t need a referral or pre-authorization to get it. However, for TRICARE Prime, you should contact your primary care manager within 24 hours—or the next business day—after receiving care. You may also need a referral for any follow-up treatment to avoid out-of-pocket costs.

Urgent care—but not an emergency

Not every issue is an emergency, but that doesn’t mean it can wait. Urgent care is for conditions that need attention within 24 hours but aren’t emergencies.

Most TRICARE plans allow you to visit any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center without a referral, but it all depends on your plan and beneficiary group. Certain rules apply if you’re active duty or enrolled in a TRICARE overseas plan, so be sure to check ahead of time.

If you’re unsure about the seriousness of your symptoms, the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line is available 24/7. If you live overseas, call your TRICARE Overseas Program Regional Call Center.

Routine care

Routine or primary care is the foundation of everyday health. Whether it’s a routine physical, managing chronic conditions, or a lingering cough, your PCM is your first point of contact. These providers know your medical history and can treat a wide variety of conditions and follow ups—or refer you to a specialist if needed.

Use the Find a Doctor Tool to locate a provider near you.

Specialty care

Sometimes, your health concern requires care from a provider who’s trained in a specific area of medicine. Specialists—like cardiologists, neurologists, or dermatologists—can diagnose and treat more complex conditions within their field.

Depending on your plan, you may need a referral to see a specialist. With TRICARE Prime, for example, you need a referral from your PCM. If your plan doesn’t require one, you can schedule directly with a TRICARE-authorized provider. If you’re unsure, the TRICARE Customer Service Directory is a good place to start.

(Note: If you’re enrolled in TRICARE Prime in the West Region, the specialty care referral approval waiver expired June 30. Starting July 1, you should follow all normal referral processes according to the rules of your TRICARE plan.)

Preventive care

You don’t have to be sick to see a health care provider. Preventive care—like cancer screenings, immunizations, and well-child care—are key to long-term health and readiness. Even when you feel fine, these services can catch problems early or help prevent them altogether.

TRICARE covers a wide range of preventive services. What’s more, you’ll have no cost for these services when received from a network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet.

Be prepared

It’s easier to make the right decision when you know your options ahead of time. Unlock your health by reviewing your TRICARE plan, finding covered providers, and saving contact numbers.

By: Richard L. Smith

According to information released by the U.S. Department of Justice, federal authorities have charged multiple individuals and reached civil settlements with healthcare providers and companies—some based in New Jersey—as part of a national effort to combat health care fraud schemes targeting Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and private insurers.

In total, 15 defendants connected to the District of New Jersey were charged or settled allegations as part of the DOJ’s 2025 National Health Care Fraud Takedown.

The coordinated enforcement action involved over 300 individuals across the country and addressed more than $14.6 billion in intended fraud.

Among the New Jersey-related matters:

• Alan Vaughan, 56, of the United Kingdom, was charged with conspiracy to pay illegal kickbacks in a scheme involving cancer genetic testing and durable medical equipment. Vaughan allegedly routed millions in kickbacks through a shell company in New Zealand, resulting in more than $80 million in losses to Medicare.

• Taejin Kim, 43, a licensed physical therapist from River Vale, was charged with conspiring to submit fraudulent claims to Amtrak’s healthcare plan for services never rendered. The scheme caused over $2.2 million in losses.

• Nestor E. Jaime, 36, of Pine Brook, and the owner of a pharmacy, is accused of submitting false Medicare claims for expensive drugs that were neither prescribed nor dispensed. Medicare paid his pharmacy over $2.5 million in connection with the alleged fraud.

• Newark Beth Israel Medical Center agreed to pay $250,000 to settle allegations that its Heart Transplant Program performed medically unnecessary procedures between 2018 and 2019 by failing to provide critical health information to patients and their families.

Several New Jersey pharmacies and dental groups also settled allegations involving fraudulent claims:

• Excel Pharmacy Inc. (Jersey City): $3 million

• QuickRx LLC/Community Pharmacy (Elizabeth): $962,821

• Raghu Ram Inc./Camden Discount Pharmacy (Camden): $310,000

• Rachit Drug Inc. (Newark): $225,000

• Premier Dental Holdings and affiliates: $540,000 for billing violations involving uncredentialed providers.

These actions reflect a broader federal initiative to dismantle fraudulent operations in the healthcare industry.

Officials emphasized the gravity of the threat and the collaborative effort among federal and state agencies.

The cases in New Jersey are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys from the District of New Jersey, and investigations were conducted by federal health care fraud task forces in coordination with HHS-OIG, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies.

Authorities reiterated their commitment to protecting public funds and ensuring patient safety by holding fraudulent actors accountable.",https://www.rlsmedia.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/field/image/article/IMG_5158_0.jpeg?h=cac64930&itok=2YzjGyPA,N,0.0,2025-07-01 11:56:30.201362

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center (JPMRC) rotation 25-01 in Hawaii and Salakanib-Balikatan (SABAK) 25 Pacific Pathways rotation in the Philippines, Task Force Gimlet successfully implemented and tested “Tactical Behavior Telehealth (TBT). TBT allows Soldiers in tactical environments, with limited access to care, to virtually connect with healthcare professionals. Building on successful telehealth use during the COVID-19 pandemic, this testing moved the concept into a field environment.[1]

Modern technology expands healthcare access, particularly in areas where it was previously limited. TBT works by enabling Soldiers at a Role 1 facility to use devices like iPads or computers to connect with Embedded Behavioral Health (EBH) personnel at Role 2 or higher locations via a Military Health System (MHS) video conferencing platform.[2] Research indicates that Soldiers report similar satisfaction levels with virtual and in-person behavioral health treatment.[3]

As one medical professional journal noted, today’s technology can “expand the geographic reach of health care services and improve access to care” that may not have been possible before.[4] Specifically, readily available data transports now allow units to access “reach-back” resources and potentially reduce the need for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). This is especially valuable in the Pacific region, where units may operate in archipelagos with limited and dispersed resources.

Recognizing that EBH resources would not deploy with the unit and accounting for the geographical dispersion of the unit during SABAK 25, the UMT focused on TBT as a critical resource. Ultimately, the team’s goal was to enable Soldiers to connect with specialty behavioral health providers to support real-world situations requiring assessment and treatment.

METHOD

During JPMRC 25-01 and SABAK 25, the Task Force Gimlet Unit Ministry Team (UMT) tested the TBT concept. The team aimed to verify the efficacy and connectivity of MHS Video Connect across all available data transports and establish virtual sessions from Role 1 to behavioral health providers at Role 2.

RESULTS

During the JPMRC 25-01 rotation, the UMT tested the capability to deliver behavioral health care remotely using MHS Video Connect over available secure data transports, including cellular telecommunication enabled devices (MiFi pucks) and low Earth orbit satellite networks (Storm and Starlink). Even though Starlink was the only system that could provide sufficient bandwidth to support a stable video connection, early stages of fielding and implementation limited the number points the unit could access.

The unit was able to successfully conduct a virtual session with behavioral health providers, but personnel had to relocate to Starlink access points, because it was not available at Role 1 or Role 2 locations.

Throughout JPMRC 25-01, Role 1 personnel performed psychological triage on a total of three Soldiers and determined that each of them needed next level of care for behavioral health assessment and treatment. Additionally, all three required ground MEDEVAC transport between Role 1 and Role 2, which were separated by approximately 20 miles. The Soldiers remained overnight at the Role 2 facility so providers could complete assessment and treatment. One Soldier required evacuation to Role 3 (Tripler Army Medical Center) for advanced care, while two returned to duty after treatment at the Role 2. Role 2 specialists could have used TBT to initially assess these patients virtually, potentially conserving MEDEVAC resources. Had TBT been available, the two return to duty Soldiers could have received treatment from Role 1 personnel under the guidance of Role 2 specialists.

Several months later, TF Gimlet deployed to the Philippines in support of SABAK 25 without EBH personnel. This made TBT with Schofield Barracks the primary method for deployed Soldiers to access behavioral health specialty care. The unit received additional Starlink systems, resulting in dedicated data connections at the co-located Role 1/2. During deployment, TF Gimlet used TBT to connect Soldiers to EBH specialty providers in response to three real-world situations:

Situation 1: A Soldier experienced a traumatic event early in the deployment that triggered multiple adverse symptoms. Following interventions conducted by the unit chaplain and Role 1/2 medical personnel, it was determined that the patient required next-level care. The patient was able to successfully connect with a specialty provider via MHS Video Connect for further assessment and treatment. He conducted regular virtual appointments with a provider and remained on deployment until the first scheduled main body redeployment.

Situation 2: A senior leader already receiving care from EBH experienced an intense onset of symptoms partway through the deployment. He was able to resume treatment with his assigned specialty provider via MHS Video Connect.

Scenario 3: A Soldier exhibiting possible suicidal ideations was brought to Role 1/2. Following initial assessment, a specialist virtually connected to evaluate the patient and determined the Soldier was unfit to remain on deployment and arranged for redeployment and escort to Tripler Army Medical Center. Following treatment, the patient returned to duty with the unit’s rear detachment.

INTEGRATING TELEBEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS

TBT offers significant potential to deliver specialized behavioral care for remote operational environments, mirroring the successful implementation in garrison locations and veteran care facilities.[5] As commanders and medical personnel plan for large-scale combat operations, they should include TBT as a solution to manage potential surges in casualties and conserve resources.[6]

TBT proved invaluable during TF Gimlet’s dispersed operations in the Pacific Theater (SABAK 25), connecting Soldiers with behavioral health providers when in-person care was impossible.

To further enhance TBT, we recommend exploring additional low-bandwidth virtual tools through initiatives like the Army Software Factory, Army Application Lab (AAL), or “Hacking for Defense (H4D).” Successfully implementing TBT at the point of need requires coordinated planning between medical, signal, and operations teams to create a virtual “mesh network” of providers that enables a hybrid care model across distances.

I am an AD dependent on tricare prime. I received a referral to a civilian hospital for my pregnancy/delivery.

I recently received a bill from the hospital for inpatient services.

Highlights of the comprehensive study were recently published in the journal CHEST. Conducted in conjunction with Uniformed Services University, the study marks the largest analysis of sleep apnea’s health effects and its burden on health resources in the U.S. military.

“This study underscores the growing importance of early intervention in sleep apnea and access to high quality, cost-effective sleep care for service members,” said Emerson M. Wickwire, PhD, lead study author and Section Chief of Sleep Medicine of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. “By quantifying the health and resource burden of this condition we hope to help guide the development and allocation of clinical resources within the military health system, including advancing provider education and patient screening, triage, and treatment.”

Obstructive sleep apnea is among the most common sleep disorders, causing sleep disruptions that raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart attack, stroke and depression. The condition is characterized as a breathing disorder in which breathing stops and restarts throughout sleep. Common symptoms can include chronic snoring, daytime sleepiness, as well as mood and behavior changes.

Due to the demanding nature of military work schedules and non-traditional hours, only one-third of active-duty service members obtain the minimum recommended seven or more hours of sleep per night, according to previous research. There is also a growing awareness of sleep apnea in the military with diagnoses increasing well over ten-fold between 2005 and 2019, from 11 to 333 cases per 10,000 service members.

To conduct the latest study, Dr. Wickwire and his colleagues utilized de-identified data from the Military Health System data repository to create two matched cohorts of individuals with and without obstructive sleep apnea, comprised of nearly 60,000 service members each, ages 17-64. Service members with newly diagnosed sleep apnea were matched with those without controlling for demographic, clinical and military characteristics. The researchers found that during the 12 months following diagnosis, service members with sleep apnea had an additional 170,511 outpatient visits to doctors compared to their counterparts and also an additional 1,852 emergency department visits per year and 66 hospitalizations.

They also had a higher risk and faster time to specific medical problems including:

""We are eager to begin enrolling patients in this important study to help improve overall health outcomes in our U.S. military population,"" said Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Dean of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Vice President for Medical Affairs, University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB), and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor.

""With fewer than 40 active-duty sleep physicians in the military health system, there is a clear need for better access to sleep physicians for our military personnel, and studies show providing CPAP treatment to those in need can reduce their risk of dying from heart-related causes by 55 percent and from any cause by 37 percent.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/female-soldier.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-30 16:56:23.604935

On top of that, Congress is considering additional defense funding through the reconciliation bill, likely bringing national security discretionary spending over $1 trillion for the first time ever.

While national defense is a top priority, an increase in funding without reform risks repeating past mistakes at the taxpayers’ expense. Without accountability, even well-intended funding becomes vulnerable to fraud and wasteful spending.

Any defense budget increases should be paired with concrete steps to improve how the Pentagon manages its resources. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a report with 79 priority recommendations for the DoD aimed at eliminating fraud, improving efficiency, and restoring fiscal discipline.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has promised to “clean house” at the Pentagon and has already announced a 20% cut to top general and flag officer positions, along with plans to streamline the force structure and rein in contractor overuse. While these early moves are promising, true reform depends on implementing deeper structural fixes like those recommended by the GAO. Below, we highlight seven practical and impactful reforms from the report that the Pentagon, with guidance from lawmakers, can implement immediately to protect taxpayers and strengthen transparency.

1) Improving Financial Management

The Department of Defense has never passed a full financial audit, and the Pentagon has failed seven in a row. A key reason is poor tracking of its assets like buildings, equipment, and inventory. Outdated IT systems and missing records make it impossible to track where all the money is going.

The GAO recommends investing in better IT systems, verifying assets, and using fraud detection tools. These changes would reduce waste, improve oversight, and finally move the Pentagon toward a clean audit, something every major agency is already expected to do.

2) Reining in F-35 Sustainment Waste

The F-35 fighter jet program will cost an estimated $1.3 trillion over its lifetime, mostly due to heavy reliance on outside contractors. The military doesn’t control key data systems, making it harder and more expensive to maintain the fleet.

The GAO recommends shifting sustainment work back in-house to save costs and increase readiness. Greater control would reduce contractor fees and help taxpayers get more value from one of the Pentagon’s most expensive programs.

3) Fixing Improper TRICARE and Military Health Payments

The DoD provides healthcare to over 9 million individuals through Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and TRICARE. The GAO found that this fragmented care system alongside improper payments leads to potentially millions of taxpayers’ dollars wasted.

By identifying the root causes of billing errors, increasing oversight of clinical quality, and assessing workforce changes, the DoD can eliminate overpayments and simplify a split care system. Veterans, military personnel, and their families deserve better services without spending more.

4) Reducing Contract Waste and Duplication

The Pentagon spends billions on service contracts each year, often without enough oversight. Secretary Hegseth discusses how the Defense Department “has become very much overreliant on management consultants and contractors . . . We found that we likely have more contractors than we have civilian employees.” The GAO flags overreliance on contractors as a high-risk area, citing mismanagement in weapon systems acquisition and contract oversight.

To fix this, the GAO urges better acquisition policies, stronger forecasting, and clearer contract management. Without reform, failures such as 12 of 24 critical IT systems going over budget or the logistics program that went $815 million over budget will continue to exist. Strengthening oversight of operational contracts would help reduce inefficiencies and fix a fragmented management system. These steps would rein in spending and bring greater transparency to a costly category of the defense budget.

5) Addressing “Forever Chemicals” (PFAS) Liability

The DoD faces significant financial exposure to “forever chemicals” contamination. Yet, it still hasn’t assessed the full cost of cleanup, leaving taxpayers vulnerable to unlimited future liabilities.

The GAO urges DoD to calculate its exposure and create a cleanup plan with clear funding limits. Without action, Congress may end up writing blank checks. Planning now would protect public health while containing long-term costs.

6) Improving Cybersecurity and Oversight

The GAO report finds that the current cybersecurity system is incomplete and fragmented, leaving critical networks exposed and driving up costs. GAO found that basic protections are poorly implemented across the Department.

To fix this, GAO recommends stronger cyber hygiene, better planning, and clear oversight of risk decisions. Without urgent improvements, the DoD risks costly breaches and continued waste in programs that handle trillions of dollars.

7) Avoiding Infrastructure Waste

The DoD manages over 700,000 buildings and facilities worldwide worth roughly $2.2 trillion. Yet, its facility management is weak, and infrastructure data is incomplete or unreliable. Hundreds of billions of dollars are earmarked for barracks, housing, and repairs, but, without tracking quality or contracting results, this money is easily wasted or underutilized.

GAO recommends improving data systems, monitoring housing quality, and enforcing contract standards. These steps would ensure that maintenance funds are used effectively and that service members and their families live in safe, well-managed facilities.

Conclusion

GAO’s report outlines a clear blueprint to fix the Pentagon’s most persistent and costly failures. Yet, despite agreeing in principle with many of GAO’s recommendations, the Department of Defense continues to fall short in implementation. Progress has been slow, inconsistent, and in some cases nonexistent—especially in critical areas like cybersecurity, financial tracking, and contractor oversight.

This mixed response makes it clear that simply throwing more money at the Pentagon won’t solve its problems and is an urgent reminder for the need for continued congressional oversight to turn reform plans into impactful outcomes. Defense spending must not be exempt from scrutiny. Implementing just these seven GAO recommendations would help reduce waste, improve transparency, and help the DoD efficiently spend taxpayer dollars. This isn’t about budgeting, it’s about ensuring the DoD engages in responsible governance and uses taxpayers’ money effectively.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2018/05/The-Pentagon-January-2008.jpg?v=20230919100900,N,0.0,2025-06-30 16:56:33.786570

For career fields, where it is deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, performance, and safety, the military services promote physical fitness programs that incorporate occupationally specific physical fitness requirements,” Shell said.
“Physical readiness standards are based on scientific research and establish both health-based criteria and operational physical performance-based criteria for physical fitness.
“It is important that DOD standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or MOS-specific task criteria,” Shell said.
This information gives the DOD the ability to measure and correlate injuries with failure and pass rates for body composition and physical fitness, Shell explained.","Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a directive on March 12, 2025, describing the start of a “rapid” cross-force review of changes in physical fitness and body composition standards since Jan. 1, 2015. The secretary followed up on this order on April 24, 2025, signing a memorandum directing a 30-day review of medical conditions that disqualify individuals from joining the military—calling for applicants to “be physically and mentally able to perform their duties under the harshest of conditions without risk to themselves or others,"" Hegseth said in a video posted on Department of Defense social media accounts.

As the DOD reviews these requirements, the focus on service member fitness is emerging at the forefront—and experts in the Military Health System offer advice on potential solutions.

“Each military service has different operational requirements, and it is important to understand those differences,” said Dr. Donald Shell, director of the Disease Prevention, Disease Management, and Population Health Policy and Oversight program in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs.

“’Overweight’ does not necessarily equal ‘overfat,’ particularly on the individual level. Two individuals that have the same weight and height may have different types of mass (for example, muscle vs. fat) and exhibit different levels of physical performance and different levels of health risks,” Shell said at a federal health symposium in spring 2025 where he discussed obesity in the military.

“It is important that standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or military occupational specialty (MOS)-specific task criteria,” Shell said.

Fitness Policies are a ‘Frame’ to Build On

“Military service fitness tests, at minimum, address the primary physical fitness components of cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and body composition for all military service applications. For career fields, where it is deemed necessary to ensure adequate skill, performance, and safety, the military services promote physical fitness programs that incorporate occupationally specific physical fitness requirements,” Shell said.

“Physical readiness standards are based on scientific research and establish both health-based criteria and operational physical performance-based criteria for physical fitness. Physical fitness and body composition testing programs promote readiness by emphasizing necessary physical capabilities, minimizing injuries, and meeting military service-specific operational mission requirements,” he explained.

“It is important that DOD standards are linked to substantiated health standards, common tasks, or MOS-specific task criteria,” Shell said. “Standards exist to promote physical readiness and motivate healthy fitness behaviors. For instance, higher muscle mass and high performance is preferred over poor nutrition and unhealthy habits.”

Announced on April 25, 2025, the U.S. Army updated its fitness test to strengthen readiness and lethality. Phased implementation of the Army Fitness Test began June 1, 2025, with new scoring standards for active duty soldiers in 21 combat military occupational specialties taking effect on January 1, 2026. The five-event test will be “sex-neutral and age-normed.”

Muscle and Bone Injuries Are Top Reason for Mission Absence

Musculoskeletal injuries, such as sprained knees or torn ligaments, affect military readiness, unit cohesion, rank progression, and other facets required of a deployment-ready force. “There is a consistent association in the literature between obesity and musculoskeletal injuries,” Shell noted. The military has documented that these injuries remain the No. 1 reason service members are held back from missions or suffer permanent disability. For example, active duty soldiers experienced more than 3.6 million musculoskeletal injuries over a 9-year period from 2008 to 2017.

The DOD Instruction 1308.03 on physical fitness and body composition added muscle and bone-related injury monitoring across the military in March 2022. This information gives the DOD the ability to measure and correlate injuries with failure and pass rates for body composition and physical fitness, Shell explained.

Obesity and the Military

Just as in the civilian world, increased muscle and bone-injury rates are tied to the epidemic of obesity, according to Shell. Estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that obesity-related conditions cost the U.S. healthcare system nearly $173 billion a year. For the DOD, the per-year average increase in cost for obesity is estimated at $540 per person, which includes paying for diseases and conditions related to obesity, like heart diseases, high-blood pressure, and diabetes.

Shell said that in the March 2025 issue of “Lancet,” a leading weekly peer-reviewed medical journal, a special commission’s review of global obesity identified diagnostic criteria of clinical obesity in adults, adolescents, and children, which include recurrent or chronic severe knee pain, reduced range of motion, and limitations of mobility. This is not only a challenge for recruitment, but can significantly impact retention, readiness, and one’s ability to be worldwide deployable.

Recognizing that weight can change over time due to age or duty stations, all service branches have programs service members can use to lose weight and improve their fitness through lifestyle changes and diet and exercise. There are also initiatives aimed at helping potential recruits get in shape before they join, such as the U.S. Army’s Future Soldier Preparatory Course.

Nutrition and Exercise are ‘Foundation’ of Fitness

Physical fitness and optimum body weight composition should be based on a “foundation” of heart healthy exercise and nutrition, according to Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland.

He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum service member fitness and heart health.

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect: Move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said.

Most service members should “really be doing three to four days in the gym [focusing on] large-muscle groups to maintain their strength.” This helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

Aerobic exercise maintains heart health and should include “150 to 300 minutes of moderate activity that makes you breath heavy, but you can still carry on a conversation. If you push to a level of exertion where you can’t talk, or vigorous activity, then the target is half that of moderate,” said Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.”

“The best exercise is what you do and what you enjoy, and what you see results from. You don't have to follow specific routines,” he added. “You have to follow something that you'll habituate to, and you'll do regularly.”

It's important to remember food is fuel for the warfighter, said Franzos. “You have to recognize those times that you're giving to yourself some grace, you're giving yourself … cheesecake … but also recognize that the bulk of the time you've got to really focus on healthy eating to ensure that you stay fit for the fight.”

Losing weight is hard to begin with, Franzos said. “Generally, when we put people on calorie-counting diets and put a lot of other physical effort in, we're seeing no more than 3–5% weight loss. And, oftentimes, that weight loss isn't maintained over time.”

Instead, he suggested staying fit, not fat, in the first place by cooking at home or in the barracks rather than eating out. Eating this way is “going to be better for your physical performance, because you're going to be able to control a lot of the macronutrients that are coming into your body, so that you minimize the bad fats and maximize the good proteins to perform better.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2503/8932457/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-30 16:56:38.055478
