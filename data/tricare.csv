In 2025 the pharmacy filled more than 187,000 individual prescriptions for service members, retirees, and family members, in addition to supporting clinical operations.

Munson’s outpatient pharmacists work behind the scenes and at the pharmacy counter to ensure medications are safe, effective and appropriate for each patient, helping service members remain healthy and ready to perform their missions.

“Our pharmacists do far more than fill prescriptions,” said Capt. Michael Nguyen, Chief of Munson’s Department of Pharmacy. “They are an essential part of the healthcare team, helping patients understand their medications, preventing harmful drug interactions and working closely with providers to support the best possible outcomes.”

Munson pharmacists also play a critical role in patient safety and readiness by identifying potential medication errors before prescriptions are dispensed, ensuring patients understand how to take their medications correctly, and helping minimize side effects that could impact performance.

“Every prescription represents multiple safety checks,” said Dr. Jason Brozek, an outpatient pharmacist and supervisor at Munson. “Our goal is to make sure patients leave the pharmacy confident about their medications and how they support their health.”

In Munson’s Department of Primary Care, Dr. Marketa Lanier, a clinical pharmacist and part of the primary care team, works directly with patients to manage chronic conditions, optimize medication therapy, and support overall health.

“The most fulfilling part of my job is seeing the positive impact of my work,” said Lanier, who was named the 2024 Defense Health Agency Clinical Pharmacist of the Year. “When a patient comes back and tells me how much better and energetic they feel when their blood sugars are controlled or how a small tool like a medication card has helped them, it reminds me why I love what I do.”

Patients are encouraged to speak with a pharmacist if they have questions about their medications or pharmacy services.

Pharmacy services for TRICARE beneficiaries and readiness support The outpatient pharmacy serves all eligible TRICARE beneficiaries, including TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE for Life. Pharmacy services are designed to support continuity of care and safe medication use, whether patients are managing a short-term illness or a long-term condition.

On Friday, U.S. Senator Roger Marshall visited Irwin Army Community Hospital at Fort Riley in anticipation of a new agreement expected later this month that will expand healthcare access for veterans in the Flint Hills region.

Senator Marshall has worked for more than a year with local, state, and federal leaders to protect Irwin Army Community Hospital after reports that the Defense Health Agency was considering downgrading the hospital to an acute care clinic, threatening emergency, surgical, and maternity care options in the North Central Flint Hills Region.

Senator Marshall said, “Fort Riley’s hospital is not just a critical piece of readiness for our soldiers, it’s also a lifeline for families and veterans across the Flint Hills.

During the Building a Healthy Home Front forum, at the Association of the United States Army’s 2025 annual meeting, Lt. Gen. Mary K. Izaguirre, Surgeon General of the Army, said, “We’re working with our partners at the Defense Health Agency to effectively support that treatment part of the health, bringing virtual care to remote areas…(and) leveraging technology…and humans to provide care.”

“If we can leverage AI to be that entryway, and then triage, then we can preserve those human touchpoints that need that level of care,” she said.

BRAVE has hosted approximately 60,000 virtual therapy sessions since it was launched three years ago. The program is now available at 84 locations across the U.S., Europe and Indo-Pacific region. DHA plans for BRAVE to be available worldwide by the end of this year.

In a release from DHA, the agency said BRAVE has used teleconferencing to reduce patient wait times and provide confidential access to therapy services. The platform’s team of service providers consists of licensed clinical social workers, psychologists and therapists.

BRAVE is managed by the DHA Virtual Medical Center, which offers several other telehealth tools, including the VMC Virtually Integrated Provider Readiness and Remote Clinic, the MHS Patient Portal and MHS Nurse Advice Line. DHA VMC ensures that members of the Army community receive the best possible care through modernized military medicine.

The TRICARE decision and recent revenue update sit against a strong run in the shares, with a 90 day share price return of 76.1% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 189.16%, suggesting momentum has been building despite a weaker 5 year total shareholder return of 30.84%.

If Guardant Health has you rethinking the healthcare theme, this could be a good moment to size up other that are catching investors' attention.

With Guardant Health now trading near US$110 after a sharp run and analysts’ targets clustered around roughly US$120, plus an intrinsic value estimate at a larger discount, the real question is whether there is still a buying opportunity here or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 6.8% Undervalued

The widely followed narrative sets fair value for Guardant Health at about US$118, a touch above the last close near US$110, framing today’s optimism in numbers.

Substantial regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical validation milestones (including Shield's breakthrough device status, NCCN guideline inclusion, and ongoing pilot studies) are paving the way for further guideline adoption, expanded payer coverage, and commercial inflections in Shield/MCED and Reveal volumes, significantly increasing future revenue and earnings visibility.

Want to see how this story translates into the valuation gap? The narrative leans hard on rapid revenue scaling, margin shift and an aggressive future earnings multiple. Curious what combination of growth, profitability and discount rate has to line up for that to hold?

Result: Fair Value of $118.18 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could shift quickly if high R&D and cash burn lead to fresh equity raises, or if payer adoption for Shield and other tests underwhelms.

Another View: High Growth, Higher Expectations

Our DCF model presents a different perspective. On this view, Guardant Health at US$110.17 sits about 37.5% below an estimated fair value of roughly US$176.29, which suggests the shares may be undervalued if those long term cash flow assumptions prove accurate.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, an experienced clinician, combat veteran, educator, and health care leader, recently reflected on the pivotal work of the Military Health System in 2025, which delivered visible gains in readiness-focused partnerships, increased productivity, revamped credentialing and privileging process, and early deployments of artificial intelligence tools to give clinicians more time with patients.

On Jan. 20, 2025, Ferrara was appointed as the principal deputy assistant secretary of war for health affairs and immediately stepped in as the acting assistant secretary for health affairs until the official nominee, Keith Bass, was confirmed by the Senate Jan. 5, 2026.

Bass has now assumed duties as the assistant secretary.

Ferrara is a retired U.S. Navy doctor with 25 years on active duty and remains a practicing physician. Prior to rejoining the DOW, he was the Chief Medical Officer at the CIA. He also served as the deputy director for clinical operations for the National Capital Region, the DOW’s largest health care network. He currently serves as an interventional radiologist at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and is a clinical professor of radiology and radiological sciences at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.

In this interview, Ferrara discussed the critical priorities for the MHS, such as upgrading infrastructure, maintaining clinical readiness, and strengthening the pipeline of talented professionals dedicated to delivering the best possible care for warfighters.

Following are edited excerpts from the interview, which can be viewed in its entirety on www.health.mil:

Question: You often talk about the “3 S’s” for the Military Health System: supporting the warfighter, sustaining our skills, and strengthening our chain. What do they mean?

Ferrara: Those principles underpin our mission: support the warfighter. We provide health care to the people who defend our country, and that's what makes us unique as a health care system. There are many great health care systems in America — but there's only one great American health care system that goes to war. Fundamentally, our focus is to support the warfighter.

Sustaining our skills means our learned skills must be maintained. I liken it to how our aviators have to get flight hours or how the trigger-pullers go to the range. For our health care professionals, it's working in our MTFs (military treatment facilities) where we're taking care of patients and keeping sharp. We have to be great because our warfighters deserve our very best.

On strengthening our chain: We stand on the shoulders of many great people, both in the military and in military medicine — so it's on all of us to make sure that we pass along that wisdom. Our MTFs are a giant force-generation platform. We graduate 16,000 medical technologists with a variety of skill sets every single year. If we were a university, we'd be the biggest one. We have graduate medical education programs. We have nursing training programs across our entire enterprise. We are always training people to be able to take that baton from us and continue to be a world-class health care system.

Question: It's been an action-packed year when you look back at 2025. How would you characterize a few of our greatest successes?

Ferrara: First of all, we perform on the big picture with great success, including increasing our partnerships. I think we've done a lot to bring in more patients, higher-complexity patients, which improves our force-generation and our skill-sustainment platforms. We've brought in more Medicare patients, and we’re really happy to be able to take care of them. Similarly, with the Department of Veterans Affairs, we've strengthened our partnership to take care of America’s veterans.

We've made significant efforts to reduce administrative burden and improve quality of life. I'm very sensitive to the burdens we place on those who care for patients, because that's what they love to do. We now have universal privileging, which is a significant breakthrough, as it eliminates low-value administrative work such as renewing privileges or obtaining transfer briefs. If you're good enough to work at one MTF, you can work across the enterprise. It also helps our mission by increasing agility, capacity, and capability by giving us the ability to utilize our personnel where and when we need them.

We rolled out ambient listening, an artificial intelligence-powered tool to help bring humanity back to health care. There’s the burden of how much note writing providers have to do, where people are taking work home. With this new tool, you can have a nice, captured conversation with your patient, talk to them, and really be focused and centered on the patient. Ambient listening rolled out at four sites this fall and we're looking to distribute that across the enterprise in 2026.

Question: Speaking about AI in a broader context, are there other priorities that you've set for the MHS to incorporate that technology?

Ferrara: We’re in a golden moment for medicine in terms of all the technology occurring, and AI is a big element of that. AI can also accelerate personalized medicine with the molecular and genetic techniques that we have. For drug discovery and development, AI can enable better therapies for patients.

Clinicians can use AI to make more rapid diagnoses and more rapid treatments, and technologies to empower and enable those frontline medics and corpsmen to be able to do prolonged field care. We’re leaning into our forward-deployable technology platforms, using tools enabling medics and corpsmen right at the point of injury to begin documenting the service member’s medical record. To support clinical decision-making, technology can provide access immediately to guide care for those service members, so we can maximize survivability in the war fight.

Question: You spent a significant amount of time this year going to the deck plate and visiting MTFs around the world. What are your biggest takeaways from those visits, and have you had the chance to incorporate any of the feedback that you've learned when you've been on the ground?

Ferrara: It's always really energizing and restorative for me to get out to the field and see where the work is done. I try to meet as many staff as I can, whether I'm in the operational unit or at an MTF. One of the things I share with them is why it's so important for me to go to the field. Here at the Pentagon, we’re making a lot of decisions, but we have such a large and complex health care system … sometimes the nature of the information gets heavily filtered by the time it gets to me.

When I go to those places, I can learn what it's like to be there. I don't think people at our MTFs or operational units are a mere row in an Excel spreadsheet. There's a lot more to it than that. These are people who are taking care of patients. It's really helpful for me to hear their stories, and I learn a lot from them. Whether it’s simple or about policy, I come back with a punch list of things to help fix.

Question: Can you talk a little bit about what happened at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center earlier in January 2025, one of your first experiences as acting assistant secretary?

Ferrara: Walter Reed, the President's hospital, experienced facility challenges including flooding. Like many of our facilities, they have aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance. I compliment their staff for moving heaven and earth to ensure they always took care of their patients. I went out there and walked the spaces, and then was able to go right to Congress and say, “here are the infrastructure problems, and we need support.” In the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, they gave us $2 billion specifically because of those efforts. We can apply it to help close some of the gaps at our facilities with the greatest challenges for infrastructure. I think we came out of it really well, and that's where that kind of advocacy on the Hill can be invaluable.

Question: What are some of the biggest resource-related challenges and successes for the MHS right now?

Ferrara: I'm a people-oriented leader — I believe having not only the right number of people but also the right skill types and in the right places — because health care is a very personal craft that we do.

We faced challenges early in the year with our civilian teammates as we sought to preserve many positions, but we were very successful because we were able to show how valuable everyone on our team is.

In the last several months of the fiscal year, we implemented policies and increased revenue collections by about $700 million. That's really exciting, because we can take those resources and we can use them to hire people, work on infrastructure, and focus on things that we need.

The National Defense Authorization Act (Fiscal Year 2026) was passed, and we're getting a top-line increase as a department. I'm looking forward to more financial resources that we can then deploy to improve health care for our warfighters and beneficiaries.

Question: What’s the value of welcoming TRICARE For Life beneficiaries back into certain MTFs for patients and for providers?

Ferrara: First and foremost, we're a military family. The opportunity to welcome our TRICARE For Life patients, our seniors, back into the MTFs where they want to get their care is the right thing to do, because it's bringing people in who want to get care from us. They trust us. They've been with us for most of their life.

It also provides high-quality, outstanding care for patients. They get their medications, imaging, and specialist visits, and they have a great patient experience. It's great for skill sustainment when health care professionals are seeing more complex patients, continuing to hone their skills and keep them sharp.

Question: How do you see strengthening the partnership the MHS has with the Department of Veterans Affairs?

Ferrara: The VA can have more demand than they can supply, and we often have more supply; we have excess supply. It’s a great opportunity to meet both of our missions across the country. Veterans may have more complex medical issues than our young, active duty personnel who are often healthy. It provides a robust clinical mix for us and is culturally aligned. Veterans enjoy receiving care at our MTFs. It provides another source of revenue, and it's good for the taxpayer. It’s a great opportunity and unique in government, where we can have wins across the board.

One example of how this has been successful is in El Paso (William Beaumont Army Medical Center). The VA and the hospital have partnered, referring 12,000 surgical patients a year to us. This can generate high value for our combat readiness mission in neurosurgery, orthopedics, and general surgery.

A federal grand jury has indicted Oklahoma chiropractor and medical supply company owner Mark Loftis, 38, for allegedly orchestrating a $30 million durable medical equipment (DME) fraud involving orthotic braces billed to Medicare, TRICARE and CHAMPVA. Prosecutors say Loftis, through Back Pain Home Supplies LLC — which did business as EZ Medical Supply — paid kickbacks to marketers and telehealth providers for patient referrals and signed orders, then submitted claims for unnecessary or improperly provided braces, resulting in roughly $8 million in payments. Loftis is also accused of misusing more than $133,000 in COVID-19 Provider Relief Fund money for personal expenses and to further the scheme.

Loftis is charged with health care fraud, kickback conspiracy and theft of government funds; if convicted, he faces a maximum of 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy and kickback count and 10 years on each of the theft of government property counts.

Gut microbes tied to auto-brewery syndrome

A study in Nature Microbiology links auto-brewery syndrome — a rare condition where patients appear intoxicated without drinking — to gut microbes that ferment carbohydrates into alcohol. Researchers report that certain intestinal organisms can produce enough ethanol to raise blood alcohol levels and cause symptoms including dizziness, confusion and impaired coordination. The work may help clinicians better recognize and diagnose the condition and adds to growing evidence that gut microbiota play a key role in metabolic and neurologic health.

Sign this petition to help retired National Guard members keep affordable health insurance and maintain the benefits they rightfully deserve.","I've proudly served in the Air National Guard for 24 years, dedicating a significant portion of my life to protecting our nation. Throughout this time, I've relied on Tricare Reserve Select for health insurance, benefiting from its discounted rate. At present, I pay $286.66 monthly for family coverage, a manageable amount that allows my family to have access to quality healthcare. However, the prospect of retirement presents me with a financial dilemma. Upon retirement, the cost of maintaining the same level of health insurance coverage skyrockets to nearly $1,600 a month. This sudden and substantial increase is unaffordable for many individuals like myself who wish to retire after decades of service.

National Guard members, like all service members, commit years of their lives to ensure the safety and security of our country. We are expected to be ever-ready, to serve at a moment’s notice, and to make sacrifices that often take us away from our families. While serving, we’re afforded the benefit of discounted healthcare premiums, a much-needed support that acknowledges the unique challenges of military life. However, upon retirement, this benefit is stripped away, leaving many to face overwhelming costs just to maintain the same standards of care.

It's time to recognize the lifelong contributions of National Guard members by ensuring they can maintain access to affordable healthcare upon retirement. The sudden spike in health insurance premiums is not only unfair but incompatible with the nature of our service. Our service doesn't end the day we retire; many of us carry physical, emotional, and professional ties to our duty that continue for the rest of our lives.

To that end, we are calling for legislation that allows retired National Guard members to retain their Tricare at the current discounted rates they receive during active service. This change would reflect a fair acknowledgment of the dedication and sacrifices made by those who protect our nation.

Congress and military policymakers have the power to correct this imbalance. By allowing retired National Guard members continued access to discounted Tricare rates, we are honoring their service and ensuring they and their families continue to receive essential healthcare coverage.

We urge lawmakers to act swiftly in addressing this disparity and amending the current policies that penalize our retired service members. With your support, we can bring about meaningful change for those who have greatly served our nation.

MMR/V Surveillance in the Military Health System

A surveillance report evaluated measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMR/V) among service members and other beneficiaries of the U.S. Military Health System (MHS) from 2019 through 2024. Investigators queried the Defense Medical Surveillance System to identify both confirmed and possible MMR/V cases during the six-year period.

Across all MHS beneficiaries, the total counts included 8 confirmed and 71 possible measles cases, 18 confirmed and 193 possible mumps cases, 13 confirmed and 265 possible rubella cases, and 251 confirmed and 4,554 possible varicella cases. Over the surveillance window, the report described decreasing numbers of confirmed and possible cases for all four infections.

Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Varicella Case Patterns

Varicella accounted for the largest number of reported infections in this dataset, including both confirmed and possible cases. Measles case counts were low overall, and the authors reported that no measles cases were observed among U.S. service members during the surveillance period.

The report also described vaccination status among service members with MMR/V. Most service member cases were reported as either partially vaccinated, or having vaccination records that were not available in the queried data. The authors noted that MMR/V cases decreased over time and highlighted continued vaccination against MMR/V as a factor in limiting morbidity among U.S. service members, pointing to lower case counts in service members, who are required to be vaccinated, compared with non-service members.

There is nothing that says you have to use the VA. But it does work out cheaper cost wise if you get the care you need. I have Tricare select currently and continue to pay the monthly premium for my dependents. I use it when I want a second opinion or just don't feel like messing with the VA. When you turn 65 it becomes tricare for life with Medicare part B. You should get the part B even though it currently runs $200ish a month now. If, for some reason, the VA can not or is unable to react to your condition, Medicare and tricare will cover everything. The reason to get Medicare part B is that if you need it later and don't get it at 65 there are huge penalties for it.

As a retiree over 65, with Medicare and Tricare for Life along with complete VA care as 100 P&T. It is the best of both worlds. There are some medical services that can get done quicker through Medicare and Tricare for Life.

I have had several ER visits and yet to have had a copay when I chose Medicare and TriCare as my medical insurance. I also have a separate Primary care under VA and Civilian care.

Open season ended over a month ago & I have been incredibly stressed out since I learned that I have zero health insurance.
Have you requested to enroll in Tricare after the open season without the required QLE (qualifying life event)?
Would you gamble & go to all these appointments without health insurance?
I feel like I am in an impossible situation due to our own stupid mistake & I could use any assurance from those who may be more familiar with VA/Tricare insurance.","My husband (veteran) and I have been married for over three years but I had had my own health insurance for the majority of that time. Since my work insurance lapsed about 4 months ago, I assumed I was covered under Tricare (we went to the VA office & made me his dependent shortly after our marriage).

Long story short, I recently found out I am pregnant & when I made my OB/GYN appointments I learned that I was actually never enrolled in Tricare. Open season ended over a month ago & I have been incredibly stressed out since I learned that I have zero health insurance.

We submitted a ""request to enroll outside of the enrollment period"" but I have been told it can take up to 45 days to receive an answer. In the meantime, I cannot avoid getting ultrasounds and going to the doctor. If we pay up front & Tricare agrees to enroll late, then they will cover these bills retroactively (and likely reimburse us), which would be amazing. However, in the event they deny our request, we will be back at square one, sans insurance, and left with bills we cannot afford.

In short, I am seeking advice or just stories from anyone who has been in a similar boat.

Lawmakers in Congress have introduced new legislation aimed at fixing a complex system that has many times prevented Airmen serving on Air National Guard and Reserve duty status from getting the same benefits as their Active-duty counterparts.

The bipartisan Duty-Status Reform Act—sponsored by Reps Gil Cisneros (D-Calif.) and Jack Bergman (R-Mich)—would streamline the number of Guard and Reserve duty statuses from 30 to just four main categories, a move that former Air National Guard Director Lt. Gen. Michael A. Loh said could be the “game-changer” needed to fix an overly complicated management system that often shortchanges Guard and Reserve members of benefits such as Tricare.

“To finally have the congressional sponsorship of duty-status reform is absolutely awesome,” Loh, now retired, told Air & Space Forces Magazine. “It’s absolutely necessary for our Guard and Reserve.”

Loh has been long-time advocate for streamlining the dozens of duty-statuses that Guard and Reserve members are placed on for taskings ranging from drill weekends to disaster-relief missions. On top of that are mobilizations to support real-world missions like Operation Midnight Hammer, the bombing raid on Iran’s nuclear sites, and Operation Absolute Resolve, the recent mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

“This gets hugely complicated,” Loh said, adding that there have been past attempts to push duty-status reform legislation through Congress, but efforts have never gotten this far.

The 30 separate duty statuses in place currently are the “result of patch fixes done by Congress spanning from World War II to the Global War on Terror,” according to a fact sheet on the legislation.

“The current framework is confusing, difficult to administer, and results in unnecessary administrative burdens,” the document states. “Most importantly, it fails to provide equitable benefits and does not align with the needs of our Guard and Reserve units.”

The four proposed duty status categories in the act are:

Category I: Contingency Duty that involves missions such as military operations and national emergencies such as natural disasters. This also covers post-deployment activities.

Category II: Training and Support activities that include required training, administrative assignments and other support missions.

Category III: Reserve Component Duty Blocks of time that involve partial-day duty and are dedicated to readiness training and support to prepare individuals and units to be ready for future use and mobilization. This category would include training periods, flight training, administrative activities, and support activities such as funeral honors support.

Category IV: Remote Assignments that involve online learning and individually assigned duties that are completed virtually.

“Efforts to simplify the complex duty status system began over two decades ago. We owe it to our service members to deliver this much-needed change and ensure they are receiving equitable pay and benefits,” Cisneros, a Navy veteran and former Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, said in a news release on the effort. “This was my number one priority returning to Congress. Having worked on this issue during my time at the Pentagon, I learned about the complexity of the current duty status system and how it hurts our readiness and quality of life for service members.”

To Loh, the Guard and Reserve members suffer the “biggest pain point” when they have to change from one status to another on back-to-back assignments such as ordering a Reservist to transition from training to support a real-world operation.

“They changed from one status to another, so it would kick them off in Tricare,” Loh said. “They could be deployed, doing this over in Europe, the Middle East, or somewhere in the Pacific, and the next thing you they’re getting calls from their family saying ‘Hey, I just got a medical bill, and they said we didn’t have Tricare.”

Bergman said the proposed legislation is a “common sense win” for Guard and Reserve members.

“It cuts through decades of red tape to make sure those who serve get consistent benefits, clear orders, and the support they’ve earned—whether they’re responding to disasters at home or missions abroad,” Bergman, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general and former commander of Marine Forces Reserve, said in the release.

The bill is endorsed by a number of service associations that support the Guard and Reserve.

Retired Army Maj. Gen. Francis McGinn, president of the National Guard Association, praised the proposed legislation as a “long overdue step forward for our force and the nation.”

Miliary Officers Association of America Director Jimmy Santos, who has served in the Air Force, the Air National Guard, and now the Air Force Reserve, pointed out that the reform act also “simplifies the Pentagon’s access to the Reserve Forces, helping maintain mission readiness and enhancing force posture.”

Loh made a similar point by saying he has spent “painstaking hours” trying to explain the different duty statuses of the Guard and Reserve to Active-duty commanders to ensure they have the right mix personnel for a particular mission.

“It would be so confusing, they didn’t understand,” Loh said.

To Loh, making it easier to access the Guard and Reserve is critical to maintaining force readiness. “The way you increase readiness is you make a much more simplistic system on how you access approximately 40 percent of the force because we need a Guard member that’s ready to go and that doesn’t have to think about what type of status they’re on or what benefits their family members going to get,” Loh said. “We need them to focus on the mission.

January 8, 2026— Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, today announced its Shield blood test for colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is now covered for active-duty service members and their families, including in Florida, through TRICARE, the U.S. military’s health insurance coverage, with no copay for average-risk individuals ages 45 and older.

Shield is the first and only blood test approved by the FDA as a primary screening option for CRC, offering U.S. military troops in Florida a more pleasant and convenient option for screening by overcoming barriers associated with other screening methods. According to the Department of Defense, there are approximately 1.3 million active-duty service members in the U.S. Those above the age of 45 – along with their families of screening-eligible age – will now have access to Shield, the latest innovation in CRC screening.

“Continuing to expand coverage for Shield across the U.S. from our nation’s veterans to our active-duty service members will help provide greater access to Shield’s life-saving screening benefit from just a blood draw,” said AmirAli Talasaz, Guardant Health co-CEO. “TRICARE has a long history of bringing the most impactful technologies at the forefront of science to support our troops in being proactive about their healthcare. We’re proud to see Shield selected as a primary screening option for colorectal cancer to empower those who serve to catch cancer early when it’s more treatable.”

TRICARE coverage for Shield is a game-changer for the 60,442 active-duty service members living in Florida and their families who now have access to a more convenient way to get screened.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in Florida. The American Cancer Society estimated that 12,330 Floridians would be diagnosed with CRC in 2025 alone, and 3,970 would die from the disease. The five-year survival rate for CRC is 91% if caught early. Shield is covered by Medicare and the Veterans Affairs Community Care Network, and is commercially available across the U.S.

Senator Marshall has worked for more than a year with local, state, and federal leaders to protect Irwin Army Community Hospital’s mission and ensure it remains fully equipped to serve both soldiers and Kansas veterans.

“Fort Riley’s hospital is not just a critical piece of readiness for our soldiers — it’s also a lifeline for families and veterans across the Flint Hills,” said Senator Marshall. “For months, I’ve pushed back on any effort to downgrade services here and fought to bring more resources to this hospital. This upcoming agreement will help ensure veterans can access the care they’ve earned, close to home, while strengthening Fort Riley’s medical mission.”

Senator Marshall’s visit comes after months of advocacy and coordination with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), following reports that the hospital could be downgraded to an acute care clinic — threatening emergency, surgical, and maternity care options in the North Central Flint Hills Region.

During a Fort Riley visit last summer, DHA leadership emphasized their commitment to strengthening IACH’s future and keeping the hospital at full capacity.

“My goal is to figure out how I can make IACH even more successful,” said Acting DHA Director Dr. Stephen Ferrara during the visit. “To me, the definition of success for a hospital is a busy hospital doing high volume, high complexity care.”

Background:

Irwin Army Community Hospital provides emergency services, surgical care, and delivery services critical to the Fort Riley community and the broader region. One proposed solution to strengthen staffing and sustain hospital services is an agreement between Fort Riley and the VA to allow more than 17,000 veterans in the North Central Flint Hills Region to access care at Fort Riley.

Senator Marshall’s Advocacy for Fort Riley and Kansas Veterans:

January 10, 2025: Senator Marshall sent a letter to the Defense Health Agency demanding answers after reports that Irwin Army Community Hospital could be downgraded to an acute care clinic.

April 7, 2025: Senator Marshall raised concerns directly with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and received assurances regarding Fort Riley’s hospital mission.

May 9, 2025: Senator Marshall met with Fort Riley’s Commanding General, who emphasized the hospital was the installation’s top concern.

May 14, 2025: Senator Marshall spoke with Acting DHA Director Dr. Stephen Ferrara, resulting in DHA agreeing to conduct an on-site assessment.

June 4, 2025: DHA staff conducted a pre-visit assessment and concluded that the North Central Flint Hills region has fewer care options than expected.

June 30, 2025: DHA and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs visited Fort Riley and provided preliminary guidance supporting full emergency, surgical, and maternity services. DHA also acknowledged staffing shortages and discussed potential partnerships with VA to expand access and strengthen services.

July 7, 2025: Senator Marshall spoke with VA Secretary Doug Collins to advance an agreement connecting Fort Riley with VA services in Kansas.

July 9, 2025: Senator Marshall joined Senator Moran and Representative Schmidt in a meeting with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to reinforce Kansas’s need for a fully operational hospital at Fort Riley.

Lassiter’s work “exemplifies nursing leadership through her transformative impact on professional practice, advocacy, and mentorship,” wrote Cheryl Ann Kraft, DHA capability portfolio manager, in her nomination of Lassiter.
Moved by the care he received from nurses, his family established the program to honor the skill and kindness nurses bring to patients every day.
“The DAISY Award is a special, internationally recognized honor,” said Cmdr.
The award also honored her mentorship of junior officers and more than 300 interagency staff members, fostering connections and professional development across teams.","Lt. Cmdr. Keyonica Lassiter, a Defense Health Agency employee with the U.S. Public Health Service, received the DAISY Award for Extraordinary Nurse Leaders Dec. 11 at Defense Health Headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia. The award recognizes those who pair clinical excellence with compassion and strong leadership.

In her role as chief of the DHA’s health delivery capabilities branch within the capability requirements management division, Lassiter leads interagency teams managing 75 projects across the Military Health System to improve access, equity, and readiness for service members, veterans, and their families.

Lassiter’s work “exemplifies nursing leadership through her transformative impact on professional practice, advocacy, and mentorship,” wrote Cheryl Ann Kraft, DHA capability portfolio manager, in her nomination of Lassiter. “Her ability to amplify nursing voices in high-level decision-making ensures frontline perspectives shape solutions across the Department of War.”

The DAISY Award — which stands for Diseases Attacking the Immune System — was established in 1999 by the family of J. Patrick Barnes after he died from complications of an autoimmune disease. Moved by the care he received from nurses, his family established the program to honor the skill and kindness nurses bring to patients every day. In 2025, more than 5,800 health care facilities and schools of nursing in all 50 states and 38 countries and territories take part.

“The DAISY Award is a special, internationally recognized honor,” said Cmdr. Carissa Haney, special assistant to the chief nurse officer, USPHS. “It is given to extraordinary nurses for the compassionate contributions they make every day, going above and beyond expectations in science and sensitivity.”

She noted that within the USPHS, the award is highly competitive, with only three nurses selected for recognition from the 30 to 50 nominees received each quarter. “She did not win this lightly,” said Haney. “It really is a testament to her work.”

Lassiter’s nomination highlighted her focus on workforce well-being and growth, aligning her leadership with the U.S. surgeon general’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and Well-Being. The award also honored her mentorship of junior officers and more than 300 interagency staff members, fostering connections and professional development across teams.

“She champions opportunities for nurses through national training programs, guiding DHA development of nursing training requirements and capability-building initiatives,” said Kraft. “Her work in behavioral health, HIV/AIDS care, and trauma-informed practices ensures dignity and meaning in clinical practice.”

Lassiter revived development opportunities for her staff by securing funding, travel, and continuing education credits for events such as the 2025 Defense Health Information Technology Symposium, the 2025 Military Health System Research Symposium, and the 4th Annual AI for Defense Summit.

DHA leaders said the award reflects both Lassiter’s accomplishments and the example she sets. “Keyonica is a fantastic asset to DHA,” said Michael Swayze, DHA chief of the capability requirements management division.

Capt. Danilo Garcia-Duenas, deputy assistant director of operations in DHA's Office of Operations, Plans, Education and Training said, “This is a very prestigious award at this level for the USPHS, and we are so grateful for having her on our staff and being able to recognize her in this way.”

As part of the recognition, Lassiter received a certificate, a DAISY pin, and a stone sculpture called “The Healer’s Touch.”

She expressed gratitude for the renowned recognition: “Thank you to the DAISY Foundation. Thank you for encouraging me.”

Recognizing Swayze’s guidance, Lassiter said, “You have been so supportive from the day that I walked in.” She highlighted the opportunity to urge other USPHS officers to consider assignments with the DHA.

“To anybody listening in the USPHS: Please come here,” she said. “DHA looks out for their people. I’m so thankful for the work I’ve been able to be a part of. It’s been tough, but I’m excited.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9472825.jpg,N,0.0,2026-01-10 03:56:43.332603

BRAVE is managed by the DHA Virtual Medical Center, which offers several other telehealth tools, including the VMC Virtually Integrated Provider Readiness and Remote Clinic, the MHS Patient Portal and MHS Nurse Advice Line.

Mark Loftis, 38, of Cushing, Oklahoma, was the owner of a medical supply company called Back Pain Home Supplies LLC, which did business as EZ Medical Supply. As alleged, Loftis paid illegal kickbacks to marketers in exchange for the referral of Medicare patients, and to marketers and telemedicine companies in exchange for signed doctors’ orders that could be used to support claims to health care benefit programs. The telemedicine providers did not engage in meaningful evaluation of the patients before signing the orders. Loftis allegedly caused Back Pain to bill Medicare, TRICARE and CHAMPVA for DME that was medically unnecessary, obtained through the payment of illegal kickbacks, and not provided as billed. In total, Back Pain submitted about $30 million in false and fraudulent claims, for which the three health care programs paid about $8 million.

Loftis converted the money he received from the Provider Relief Fund (PRF) for his own use and the use of others, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. PRF funds were appropriated to help healthcare providers financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to provide care to patients suffering from COVID-19 and compensate providers for the cost of that care. As alleged, Loftis received more than $133,000 in PRF funds and then falsely attested to a series of conditions to retain the funds, including that he would use the funds for health care expenses and to replace revenue lost due to the pandemic. In reality, Loftis used a portion of the funds to further the DME fraud scheme and for a variety of personal expenses.

Loftis is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and to offer, pay, solicit, and receive kickbacks, and two counts of theft of government property. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on the health care and wire fraud conspiracy count, five years in prison on the conspiracy and kickback count, and 10 years in prison on each of the theft of government property counts. A federal judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.
