About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.

In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.

Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.“There’s no longer improvement,” Heggins said, as he began to cry. “My son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.”

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.

The DHA previously said the new contracts would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues.Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.

“This situation has become untenable,” said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.

Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.

Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.

“There are times where I’m like, what am I going to do?” he said.

A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a “small percentage” of providers’ records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.

The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.

The company said it has been “working around the clock” to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.

“We have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,” the spokesperson said. “We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.

“All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned,” a TriWest spokesperson said in a statement.

TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA officials said it will take one to two weeks to determine if the technical fixes resolved the east region issues.

The agency said the contractors have met the contractual requirements to pay 98% of processed claims within 30 days and all claims within 90 days to date.

The DHA officials, citing the contractors, said no east region provider has left the network due to claims issues but that a few have left in the west.

Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are “always slightly slower” in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.

“This time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,” the officials said. “Additionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.”

NBC News spoke to more than half a dozen providers across the country who said they are still waiting to be reimbursed. Faced with a sudden cash flow crisis, many have had to make difficult and heartbreaking decisions.

‘Forced into an impossible situation’

In San Diego, Stephens took out a $75,000 loan at the beginning of February, but it only got her clinic through two payrolls. By the end of February, she had to pause services for all of her clinic’s 350 Tricare patients — some whom she said are in “desperate shape” — as well as lay off seven employees.

“It’s been nothing short of devastating. I feel a reaction in my whole body right now,” she said through tears. “We’ve been forced into an impossible situation. We can’t continue to treat them without being paid and they can’t find other providers.”

A Florida clinic that provides psychiatry and therapy services to about 300 people also recently decided it would have to stop treating Tricare patients after it racked up more than $100,000 in unpaid claims since Jan. 1, office manager Beth Matricia said.

“We’re going to have to charge them out of pocket because if we keep going this way, we’re going to have to close down,” said Matricia, who manages MAPS Integrated Wellness in the military community of Fernandina Beach.Matricia said she and other staff members fear the fallout will further affect the mental health of service members, who will likely not be able to afford the full cost of up to $150 per session.

“You’re talking about people who are suicidal,” she said. “If you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It’s very hard to transfer therapists. It’s really hard to open up again.”

Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“It might spiral someone down to a deep depression,” Wise said.

In Clarksville, Tennessee, Jenne Nesbitt-Decker, owner and chief financial officer of Mariposa Behavioral Health Services, a small clinic that treats children and teens who have autism, said she has had to cut the number of available appointments in half to make up for the lack of payments and the loss of one provider who quit.

If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.

There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association’s acting director of government relations.

“That exacerbates an already difficult problem,” she said. “What implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families? That’s really troubling.”

The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.

His son’s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.

While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.

“If my insurance won’t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,” he said.

Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife’s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.

“It would be incredibly difficult,” he said. “I hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250227-us-army-ch-1107-a3ddc7.jpg",N

""While every body is different, the number of push-ups you can do is often a good indicator of someone's muscular strength and endurance,"" Regis Pagett, founder and owner of R Personal Fitness in New York City, told Fox News Digital.

Based on data from Mayo Clinic, below is a breakdown of how many push-ups men and women should be able to complete based on age.

People in their 30s should be able to do at least 19 (women) and 21 (men).

People in their 40s should be able to do at least 14 (women) and 16 (men).

People in their 50s should be able to do at least 10 (women) and 12 (men).

People in their 60s (both genders) should be able to do at least 10 push-ups.

Weight-bearing exercises like push-ups can help increase bone density, which is particularly important as people age, according to Pagett.

""This is a major benefit of exercises with high resistance,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Strength in the upper body and core are two things that translate to everyday life, and the ability to push yourself off of the floor regularly is one that many people take for granted.""

Push-ups mainly work the pectoral muscles (chest), with the triceps being secondary in the motion, with the core (abdominals) supplying the strength to hold the body straight through the motion, according to Pagett.

A previous Harvard study showed that the ability for men to do 40 or more push-ups at 50 years old decreases the chance of cardiovascular disease by 96% compared to men who could do 10 or less, Pagett noted.

""The study also found that every push-up done after 10 had a decreased chance of cardiovascular disease,"" he added.

For those looking to work up to doing push-ups, Pagett recommends starting by doing them on the knees.

The entity known as DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is touting its cost-cutting measures across the federal workforce. But as NPR and others have documented, the Department of Government Efficiency's math does not always add up. Now DOGE says it's busy at work at both the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs. At this point, it's not entirely clear what that means. So for more, we begin with NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Hey there.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.

SUMMERS: Tom, tell us what you're hearing from the Pentagon.

BOWMAN: Well, the Pentagon put out a memo on Monday saying that the firings would start that day. They are looking to cut tens of thousands of probationary employees and using that money to pay for priorities such as more drones, ships and submarines. But, Juana, we're not getting a lot of detail from the Pentagon about where those cuts will come from. I'm getting calls from contacts in the Army, Air Force and Defense Health Agency about job cuts that have already taken place. One Air Force officer told his subordinates - get this - he's learning more from Facebook than his own command.

SUMMERS: Huh.

BOWMAN: Officials say cuts will start with so-called low performers and also those jobs the Pentagon says that are, quote, ""not in the public interest."" An Army veteran who worked at the Defense Health Agency said she got cut with a notice saying she was a low performer. But get this - six months ago she got a stellar performance review she shared with me. It says she exceeded all objectives and her work was truly transformative. I spoke with a Capitol Hill aide who said they're trying to get details about how decisions are made in the scope of these firings.

SUMMERS: This sounds pretty confusing, I got to say. Is that how people inside the Defense Department tell you they're feeling too?

BOWMAN: Oh, it's very confusing. I'm getting calls from some contacts inside the government and as well as neighbors asking me what I've heard. There's some information is being put out on social media accounts run by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials. But again, no great detail, just kind of this broad brush with terms like, quote, ""streamline operations,"" ""prioritize critical missions."" And this vagueness, confusion - it is also a lack of coordination. It's all having an impact on operations. I was talking with a retired officer in Europe who works for the Pentagon on training missions with other countries. They have two budget analysts who left, and they can't replace them because there's also a civilian hiring freeze.

SUMMERS: Thank you so much, Tom.

At this point, I want to bring in NPR's Quil Lawrence for more on the confusion these moves are creating. And Quil, you cover Veterans Affairs. And I know that you reported this week that the Office of Personnel Management has frozen the VA out of its own hiring software.

QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Yeah. It's a program called USA Staffing, and OPM sort of runs HR for many federal agencies. We heard from VAs and sources in at least seven states that VA couldn't send out hire letters because they were frozen out of their own HR software. That's for medical staff like doctors and nurses who are supposed to be exempt from the hiring freeze. And VA says it's coming up with a work-around. But it seems like two parts of the government pitted against each other, where DOGE and OPM are making these firings, and the VA is scrambling to undo or work around what they do.

Twice, for example, now, they fired staff from VA Suicide Crisis Hotline, who are not exempt from the hiring freeze. But then, VA scrambled to rehire them because they are mission critical. It's a suicide hotline. They announced a sudden cut of 875 contracts - that was over a week ago - and then they pulled that back, and now they're floating a different list of contracts that are being cut. And staff I'm talking with say that this is not inspiring confidence for these crucial hires they need. Doctors and nurses are in demand, and they're worried people will think twice about picking a job at VA.

SUMMERS: You also reported this week on an internal VA memo that they plan to downsize and layoff - I think it was something like 70- to 80,000 staff. I mean, here's my question. Can they do that without affecting veterans' care or benefits?

LAWRENCE: VA Secretary Doug Collins says that they can. He says they're going to carefully figure out how to get back to 2019 staff levels without affecting health care or benefits decisions. Collin says, in the past, the VA just kept on adding staff and funds, and his approach is to stress more about efficiency. And the VA, it's huge, but, you know, it takes care of about 9 million veterans, and their mission is that they have to be wherever the vets are. If they're here in New York City or they're in Nome, Alaska, they have to go to them.

And, I mean, VA staff did grow about 80,000 since 2019. And that's mostly because they were added to deal with something called the PACT Act. So Congress passed the PACT Act to expand VA care and include veterans who got exposed to burn pits in Iraq or Agent Orange in Vietnam, radiation. And they brought millions of vets into VA care, and VA went on a hiring spree to take care of them. It's not going to be easy to cut them, especially at this pace.

SUMMERS: Right.

LAWRENCE: And veterans say, you know, they already paid for this care by sucking dust - toxic dust in Iraq or Agent Orange in Vietnam.

SUMMERS: That's NPR's Quil Lawrence and Tom Bowman. Thanks to both of you.

BOWMAN: You're welcome.

LAWRENCE: Thank you.

Trump puts new limits on Musk’s authority amid DOGE backlash

Staffing decisions within federal agencies will be left up to the Trump administration's Cabinet secretaries and not Elon Musk, President Donald Trump said yesterday after a meeting that included some of the secretaries and his billionaire adviser. The new message marks a rare public curtailing of Musk's authority as he helps reshape the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk had stepped on some Cabinet secretaries' toes, and other Republicans have bristled at the speed and intensity of the cuts.

""It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people,"" Trump said on Truth Social. ""We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet,'"" he added later in the social media post.

The instructions given to Cabinet members is that they should work alongside DOGE on spending and workforce reductions, Trump said. Final job cuts will be at the discretion of the department leaders. But if sufficient cuts aren’t made, Trump indicated that Musk would step in.

The sweeping cuts carried out by DOGE in the first weeks of Trump’s second term, which has included firing thousands of employees and moving to shutter entire agencies, have led to lawsuits, voter anxiety and heightened concerns from congressional Republicans. Some Republicans have called for greater transparency into DOGE’s work. This week, Musk met with some Senate Republicans behind closed doors to address concerns.

Still, Trump was sure to praise Musk and DOGE after yesterday’s meeting, saying “they’ve done an amazing job.”

Jobs report expected to show growth, but uncertainty looms

When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly employment report today for the month February, it's expected to show roughly 170,000 new payrolls added last month. That's up from the 143,000 job gains in January. And the unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 4%, analysts said. But as President Donald Trump's agenda takes shape, including a still-evolving tariff agenda and massive job cuts, America's sturdy economy could soon show signs of trouble.

What’s causing disruptions to the military’s health care program

Changes this year to Tricare, the military's health care program which provides benefits to about 9.6 million people, have brought cascading disruptions to millions of service members, their families and network providers nationwide.

On the East Coast alone, about 16,000 health care providers have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, beneficiaries are struggling with long call center wait times and stalled referrals and authorizations, federal officials said.

Reporter Melissa Chan spoke to some of the families and providers affected by the recent changes. Among them are Army Sgt. Bo Heggins of Tennessee, who has had to stop taking his 8-year-old son, who has autism, to occupational therapy appointments. Meanwhile, San Diego-based provider Brenda Stephens had to pause all services for her mental health clinic's 350 Tricare patients and lay off seven employees.

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since the beginning of the year. A DHA spokesperson said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues. Read the full story here.

Staff Pick: F1’s Lando Norris is ready to win it all

I became a Formula 1 fan when I was 11 years old and the McLaren team won the championship. Twenty-six years later, I got to interview Lando Norris for NBC News after a breakthrough 2024 season, in which he led McLaren back to its first constructors’ title since that 1998 season. Norris isn’t a typical interviewee (at least for a reporter who primarily covers politics). His racing talent is extraordinary, but he’s also personable and authentic.

Despite having a breakthrough season winning his first four races this season, Norris fell short of his overarching goal, finishing runner-up to Max Verstappen for the driver’s crown. We chatted about his reflections on 2024, his candid admissions about the mistakes he made, and why he’s ready to come back stronger as the new season begins next week. — Sahil Kapur, NBC senior national political reporter and F1 correspondent
