Despite their vocal objections, Democrats failed to stop six last-minute amendments aimed at restricting the rights of transgender individuals in the U.S. military, all of which passed via voice vote. Seventeen Democrats ultimately sided with Republicans in voting for the amended bill.

Sweeping Anti-Trans Provisions Approved

The controversial amendments included:

Two bans on medically necessary gender-affirming healthcare — including mental health services — for transgender service members and their families.

A ban on transgender women participating in sports at military academies.

A prohibition on the Department of Defence collecting gender identity data, requiring surveys to refer only to sex assigned at birth.

Restrictions preventing trans individuals from using gender-aligned facilities on military installations.

A ban on Pride flag displays at any U.S. military facility.

Four of the six amendments were introduced by Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC), a staunch anti-trans advocate and current gubernatorial candidate.

House Floor Clashes Over Pride Flag and Healthcare

Representative Maxine Dexter (D-OR) attempted to defend the right to display the Pride flag, challenging the reversal of a previous NDAA compromise that gave base commanders discretion on such displays. She called the amendment “cruel and callous” and placed a small Pride flag on the podium as she spoke.

Her gesture sparked immediate backlash from Republican members. A Florida representative objected, backed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who demanded the flag be removed.

“That flag violates our House rules,” said the presiding officer.

“I am not waving it, Mr. Speaker,” Dexter replied, continuing her statement. “This obsession with attacking, dehumanising, and villainising our LGBTQIA community is as sick as it is a waste of time. Trump is using the same tired playbook authoritarian regimes have used throughout history.”

Heated Exchanges Over Gender-Affirming Care

Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA) also took the floor to oppose Mace’s amendment banning TRICARE coverage for gender-affirming procedures. When Jacobs highlighted procedures such as breast augmentation and filler treatments as medically recognised forms of gender-affirming care, Mace shouted across the chamber, “You are absolutely ridiculous! What the hell is your problem?”

Mace later escalated the exchange on social media, implying Jacobs, who is Jewish, needed a “nose job,” a comment widely condemned as antisemitic.

LGBTQ+ Advocates Condemn the Legislation

Congressional Equality Caucus Chair Rep. Mark Takano released a statement after the bill’s passage, condemning Republicans for what he described as injecting “poison-pill riders” into a bill meant to improve the lives of military personnel.

“Republicans’ sacrifice of a strong bipartisan vote for a politicised NDAA to appease the Trump Administration and a small slice of their base cannot undo the sacrifice of the transgender servicemembers, cadets, or military dependents that will be hurt by this bill,” Takano stated. “Congress should be fighting for those who fight for us—but it’s clear the GOP has other priorities.”

The DHN-PR headquarters is located in San Diego, overseeing military hospitals and clinics along the U.S. West Coast and overseas in Guam and Japan.","SAN DIEGO – Capt. Kathleen Cooperman, the new deputy director for Defense Health Network Pacific Rim (DHN-PR), visited the Virtual Medical Operations Center (VMOC) at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) Sept. 3 to learn firsthand how the hub is transforming patient care and operational medical support across the Military Health System.

Cooperman, a native of Arlington, Virginia, comes to the network after serving as commanding officer of U.S. Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Command Okinawa and director of U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, Japan, from July 2023 to August 2025. A graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University with a master’s degree in health administration, and the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California she has served in Navy Medicine’s Medical Service Corps for more than two decades.

NMCSD is one of nine military treatment facilities in the DHN-PR and during her visit, Cooperman received an overview of the VMOC’s current role, which includes providing real-time inpatient virtual care and tele-critical care support to military hospitals and clinics worldwide. By centralizing monitoring and leveraging specialized providers virtually, the VMOC extends critical care expertise to military treatment facilities and operational forces around the globe, improving readiness while delivering safe, high-quality patient care.

“As I learn about DHN Pacific Rim’s operations and capabilities, visits like this are so important,” Cooperman said. “My role is to listen, learn, and help connect the dots so we can integrate and scale capabilities like the VMOC into robust resources with global reach to provide health care expertise and strengthen collaboration across the Military Health System.”

Brian Howard, assistant director for support operations at DHN Pacific Rim, organized the visit to familiarize Cooperman with the VMOC’s role in supporting both military medical treatment facilities and operational missions.

“This center has grown from an idea several years ago into a capability that today supports more than two dozen MTFs,” said Howard. “It’s not about replacing in-person care, it’s about extending the expertise of medical specialists across the Military Health System to save lives.”

Howard explained that the VMOC model allows intensivists and other specialists to provide real-time guidance from San Diego to teams on the ground, from walking providers in an ICU at an overseas hospital through a difficult case to advising corpsmen and medics in the field.

“This is an extender of our medical force,” he said. “We can’t put a critical care specialist everywhere, but through the VMOC we can connect them to patients and providers who need their knowledge and skills—whether it’s at U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, Madigan Army Medical Center, or a corpsman managing a traumatic injury downrange.”

Looking ahead, the VMOC is exploring opportunities to expand services such as EEG monitoring, ad-hoc dialysis, and advanced consultative support, while piloting new approaches to integrate digital health and readiness tools.

“The VMOC is impressive,” said Cooperman. “And to really maximize its potential, to take it to the next level, we need to define and codify the program requirements and organizationally align capabilities as a portfolio of assets to ensure we optimize the MHS as a system. Looking to the future and how we care for the warfighter during the next global conflict to save lives and keep them in the fight, this is the time to invest in resources like the VMOC and drive the readiness portion of the Defense Health Agency’s responsibility to the Indo-Pacific.”

Cooperman’s visit underscored DHA’s commitment to modernizing health care delivery, advancing digital health transformation, and ensuring medically ready forces. The VMOC, aligned with the DHA’s strategic priorities and the Military Health System’s Ready Reliable Care framework, represents one way the MHS is leveraging technology and innovation to deliver on its mission of caring for the joint force and their families—anytime, anywhere, always.

The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.” Safe adoption bolsters readiness For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.
Building the guardrails The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective.
Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.
Critical collaboration Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.","As military medicine embraces artificial intelligence and digital technology, top Department of War health leaders stressed that strong governance is critical to safely drive innovation to adopt these tools that improve patient outcomes and drive increased military readiness.

During the Defense Health Information Technology Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee, in August 2025, Dr. Stephen Ferrara, acting assistant secretary of war for health affairs and Ms. Susan Orsega, deputy assistant secretary of war for health services policy and oversight, provided insight into how governance ensures the Military Health System is digitally enabled, safe, interoperable, and aligned with warfighter mission readiness.

Ferrara underscored governance is what translates technology into real outcomes, saying, “We need to deliver a truly integrated, digitally enabled and globally partnered system of readiness and health care … where a medic in CENTCOM can consult a trauma specialist at Walter Reed in seconds.”

Digital Health AI policies, particularly the use and governance of AI, is an area Dr. Ferrara has asked that Orsega prioritize.

“We've got to be prepared for the ever-changing warfare ecosystem,” Orsega said. “It is imperative to be integrating and to be interoperable in those digital health spaces, so that we have those tools from either the battlefield to the bedside.”

Governance is foundationally essential to keep up with rapidly evolving AI, she said, for “the scale, the challenges, the demand, the clear priorities, and policies to focus ourselves strategically, enhancing the operational efficiencies … and looking at the readiness of the force.”

The MHS has established guardrails to ensure the use of AI and other advanced tools are implemented responsibly through the MHS Digital Policy Council, launched in March 2025. In her recent appointment as the chair, Orsega cited the policy as assurance that technology, data, and AI efforts are aligned and governed across the MHS “by streamlining digital priorities, reducing redundancies, and focusing on health data as a readiness tool.”

“The digital policy council is intended to ensure that we take a look at, not pull down, the redundancies,” she said. “At the same time, we want to ensure that we have horizontal synergy across all the services.”

Orsega provided an example of a large organization’s diagnostic oncology AI tool as an essential lesson learned in the need for oversight. The AI system once promised to revolutionize cancer care, but it often produced unsafe or irrelevant recommendations. “The clinicians could not rely on that piece of the AI tool to make clear decisions,” she said.

The failure, she said, was not the technology itself but the absence of efficient oversight, as the tool needed stronger governance, infrastructure, and the ability to be audited to ensure better outcomes and reliability.

By contrast, she pointed to the Cleveland Clinic’s Digital Health Playbook as a guide that provides clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and processes for using digital tools. The playbook provided guidance, “that carves out and identifies everyone's role … in everything from telehealth procedures to how to access digital platforms,” she said, adding that it “provides a good example for us as we look at harnessing AI.”

Safe adoption bolsters readiness

For Ferrara, digital health and governance is inseparable from readiness.

“We’re focused on a mission that cuts across so many sectors — delivering smarter, integrated, data-driven health care for service members and their families,” said Ferrara. “It’s more than a technical conversation; it’s an operational imperative.”

He highlighted the full deployment of MHS GENESIS, the electronic health record that provides a single health record for service members, veterans, and family members, as a digital foundation to readiness.

“This is the backbone of a connected system that allows service members’ medical records to follow them from basic training to the battlefield, and ultimately home, and soon to the VA in one smooth, uninterrupted flow,” Ferrara explained.

With MHS GENESIS in place, Ferrara said the MHS is investing in AI-powered support for PTSD, suicide risk, and traumatic brain injury. He also emphasized that oversight is critical: “It’s not merely about adopting new technologies, but how we strategically integrate them into our workflows to improve patient outcomes and ultimately bolster the readiness of our fighting force,” he said.

Building the guardrails

The MHS Digital Policy Council brings together senior leaders across the services to evaluate emerging technologies, prevent duplication, and direct investments where they are most effective. Since its inception, the council has identified and started reviewing more than 100 AI projects across the MHS.

Orsega outlined four areas where the council provided this much-needed governance stability:

• Policy and process: Tie AI tools to accountability

• Inclusive expertise: Support of clinicians, scientists, and technologists in the room together

• Audit platforms, data integrity, and infrastructure: Foundation for safe use

• Training: Certify health care professionals can use AI tools responsibly.

Critical collaboration

Ferrara and Orsega underscored that collaboration is imperative to effective governance.

“None of this work can succeed in silos,” Ferrara said. “Our public-private partnerships are essential, not just for developing new tools, but for testing, scaling, and governing them responsibly.”

Orsega added that governance extends beyond the Department of War. NATO’s Committee of Chiefs of Military Medical Services, she noted, is already examining digital transformation, biotech, and decision-support systems in multi-domain operations. Collaboration with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies is equally critical.

She stressed the importance of preparing “for that ever-changing ecosystem, either homeland or abroad, and it's our battle cry to ensure that we have those right tools, so that we have the right policies and processes and standards in place,” noting that if there is an urgent need to use digital tools, “we feel really comfortable and confident that our tools are reliable and that they're laser precise for that decision in that moment.”

Orsega concluded by encouraging attendees of DHITS — comprised of government, military, and industry health care information technology professionals — “to be a part of the solution.”

“We have a unique opportunity to confront the challenges that lie ahead and to take that bold initiative.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9290504/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-15 17:56:08.019100

The 59th Medical Wing hosted a demonstration of SimX’s Virtual Reality Operational Medical Training at Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center, giving leaders and educators a chance to explore how immersive technology could support medical readiness.

The SimX system, known as VALOR (Virtual Advancement of Learning and Operational Readiness), offers a variety of scenarios designed for military medicine. With only a headset and laptop, medics can train individually or in teams in fully immersive environments that simulate battlefield trauma, prolonged casualty care, aeromedical evacuation, chemical or biological incidents, and even K-9 trauma cases.

Unlike traditional training that relies on mannequins or staged events, the VR system allows for quick setup, repetition and customization. Trainers can replicate operational stressors such as noise or low light and adjust the complexity of scenarios in real time.

Col. Tracy Bozung, 59th Medical Wing deputy commander, took part in the demo and said the event offered valuable perspective.

“This system gives our personnel the opportunity to experience operational medical scenarios in a way that is hard to replicate in traditional training,” Bozung said. “By exploring emerging technologies like virtual reality, we can better understand what options may be available to support readiness in the future.”

She added that keeping an open mind to new tools is part of the wing’s approach to innovation.

“The 59th Medical Wing has always been at the forefront of medical readiness and innovation,” Bozung said. “Looking at capabilities such as VR helps ensure we remain prepared for the environments our Airmen may face, whether in combat operations, humanitarian response, or future missions we can’t yet imagine.”

The 59th Medical Wing, the Air Force’s largest medical wing, supports more than 900,000 outpatient visits annually while preparing medical Airmen for global operations.

Lt. Col. Alidan Bangura, chief of the 59th Medical Wing’s Division of Education and Training, said the demo helped broaden the conversation about potential training tools.

“With systems like the SimX platform, our medics can engage in realistic simulations that cover every phase of patient care—starting from point of injury and extending all the way to evacuation,” explained Bangura. “These immersive, high-pressure scenarios are designed to replicate the intense situations encountered in real-life operations. As a result, this training regimen not only reinforces essential individual medical skills but also greatly enhances team coordination. Both elements are vital for achieving mission success and ensuring the safety and well-being of those we serve.”

The demonstration also highlighted how VR could address common training challenges such as scheduling, equipment requirements and access to specialized facilities. The 59th Medical Wing will continue evaluating whether virtual reality could complement existing programs.

The 59th Medical Wing already serves as a hub for military medical education, with partnerships across the San Antonio Military Health System and the Defense Health Agency.

Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.The results of this Market Research may inform acquisition strategy and will contribute to determining the method of procurement.2.0 Background:2.1. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is committed to providing the highest quality healthcare and support to our beneficiaries. DHA operates in a complex environment, generating and managing a vast amount of data across multiple clinical and administrative systems, and supporting business operations, combat support missions, and healthcare delivery. While we have accumulated a significant volume of data, DHA seeks a modern, integrated approach to transform this data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven decision-making, continuous improvement, and enhanced organizational visibility.Historically, this need was addressed through data warehousing concepts. However, we recognize that contemporary data landscapes demand more sophisticated and interconnected solutions that leverage the latest technologies and methodologies. DHA envisions a mature and interconnected data ecosystem that proactively identifies trends, patterns, and opportunities across its three core operational areas:Business Operations: Optimizing headquarters-level healthcare delivery business operations that support the Networks and Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in delivering quality healthcare. This includes improving administrative functions, resource allocation, performance management, workflows, cost containment, and enhancing the user experience for both DHA personnel and the Networks/MTFs they support. The focus is on enabling efficient and effective healthcare delivery at the point of care.Combat Support Mission: Ensuring readiness and providing effective healthcare support to the warfighter. This includes analyzing readiness metrics, identifying areas for improvement in medical training and deployment support, and optimizing resource allocation for contingency operations.Healthcare Delivery: Improving patient outcomes, enhancing the quality of care, and ensuring patient safety. This includes analyzing patient data to identify trends in disease prevalence, optimizing treatment protocols, and reducing healthcare costs.DHA seeks to enable a mature and interconnected data ecosystem that empowers data-driven decision-making and enables continuous improvement across its three core operational domains: Business Operations, Healthcare Delivery, and Combat Support. This is not a static solution, but rather a dynamic and evolving ecosystem that adapts to the changing needs of the DHA mission: providing high-quality healthcare to those who serve and their families. The desire is to have an environment where data becomes a strategic asset, driving tangible improvements in patient care, healthcare delivery efficiency, and combat readiness. We are particularly interested in solutions that deliver the following desired outcomes:Provide a readily accessible, unified view of data, regardless of the source or format (structured or unstructured) to enable comprehensive analysis and informed decision-making.Generate actionable insights to enable proactive identification of trends, patterns, and opportunities.Allow stakeholders at all levels to easily access, understand, and interact with relevant data to inform their decisions.Guarantee the security, privacy, and regulatory compliance of data. The solution must protect sensitive information, maintain data integrity, and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.Facilitate the continuous monitoring and evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs), enabling proactive identification of areas for improvement and tracking of progress towards organizational goals.Readily adapt to evolving data volumes, sources, and business requirements. The solution must be scalable, flexible, and capable of accommodating future growth and change.2.2 This RFI is intended to gather information on industry best practices, innovative technologies, and potential solutions that can enable DHA to achieve its vision for a data-driven organization.
