BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, October 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) has released its long-awaited. The findings endorse applied behavior analysis (ABA) as a medically necessary autism treatment. It recommends that the Department of Defense make ABA a TRICARE basic benefit.

TRICARE’s Autism Care Demonstration (ACD) is a provisional program that authorizes ABA services on a temporary, experimental basis, rather than as a permanent medical benefit.

The report includes five critical recommendations:

• Discontinue the ACD and continue ABA as a basic TRICARE benefit.

• Eliminate mandatory assessments that don’t support individualized treatment planning.

• Reduce administrative barriers that limit access to ABA services.

• Align TRICARE’s ABA coverage with current best clinical practices.

• Establish an independent advisory council to guide the transition and ensure stakeholder input.

“This is an excellent report,” said Lorri Unumb, CEO of the Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP), the leading trade association for organizations providing autism services. “It reflects NASEM’s thoughtful interrogation of research and testimony from the autism community, confirming what we’ve long known: military families affected by autism need and deserve high-quality ABA.”

NASEM heard testimony from a wide range of researchers, practitioners, and others, including:

• Somer Bishop, University of California, San Francisco.

• Kristi Cabiao, Mission Alpha Advocacy.

• Karen Driscoll, child advocate.

• Erick Dubuque, Autism Commission on Quality.

• Thomas W. Frazier, John Carroll University.

• Gina Green, consultant.

• Michelle A. Linn, Alpine Autism Center (CASP member)

• Molli Luke, Behavior Analyst Certification Board.

• Hannah Rue, LEARN Behavioral (CASP member)

• Britt Sims, Integrated Behavior Solutions (CASP member)

• Jocelyn Thompson, LEARN Behavioral (CASP member)

• Dan Unumb, Autism Legal Resource Center.

• Chanti Fritzsching Waters, ABS Kids (CASP member)

• Rebecca Womack, RAW Consulting Solutions

“The Department of Defense has everything it needs to make ABA a permanent benefit for military families, thanks to the hard work of NASEM and the autism community,” said Unumb. “Implementing NASEM’s recommendations is the right thing for families and will strengthen America’s military readiness.”

After all, just as toddlers and teenagers might need a trip to urgent care or the ER at the most inconvenient times — during a PCS or when the military parent is TDY — pets have a way of needing attention when least expected.

While TRICARE doesn’t extend to furry friends, there is a plethora of pet insurance options, many created with military families in mind.

“Military life brings a lot of uncertainty, and pets are an important part of a family’s emotional support system during challenging times,” said Chris Hagesfeld, senior director of operations at Embrace Pet Insurance. “While navigating the complexities of constant change, pet insurance offers stability and the assurance that pet care is always a priority.”

Pet insurance usually offers coverage for things like illnesses, injuries, dental issues, hospitalizations, surgeries and prescription drugs, among other services. Americans spent more than $150 billion on their pets in 2024 alone, according to the American Pet Products Association. At the same time, approximately $4.7 billion went toward pet insurance.

Military families are often among this group — Hagesfeld said that around 25% of Embrace’s policy holders are either active duty or retired military families.

“We value and honor those who serve our country, which is why we’re proud to provide a military discount to our active-duty and veteran policyholders,” he said. “It’s our way of showing gratitude and doing a small part to recognize the sacrifices made by military families and their pets.”

These policies vary in price depending on several factors, including state, animal type, breed, age and more. A “middle of the road” policy for a healthy seven-year-old labrador in Arizona with a military owner, for instance, runs about $65 a month. A young cat, meanwhile, could be as low as $20 per month. Depending on the company and specific policy, owners still might have to pay for things like microchipping, obedience training, pre-existing conditions, DNA testing, breeding fees and cosmetic procedures like tail docking.

If you’re PCSing to an assignment in the United States, your pet is still covered. But make sure to update your new address with your insurance company as soon as possible, as your residency affects not only your rate, but potentially what veterinarian you can see, depending on the company.

Though Embrace (which allows use of any veterinarian) doesn’t cover OCONUS assignments, it does offer exceptions for deployments and short-term vacations. So check with your insurance company to make sure they offer coverage at your new assignment.

Military-connected memberships (like with Navy Mutual, USAA or the Military Benefit Association) often come with pet insurance or wellness plan discounts, so be sure to ask.

Navy Mutual, for example, offers the Wagmo Pet Wellness Plans, which reimburse for essential preventative services like vaccinations, grooming, dental care and check-ups. And don’t forget about extra benefits that may be “purrfect” for your military pet, like Embrace’s Wellness Rewards program that takes care of wellness visits, vaccinations and other preventative treatments. Other policies may offer extras like behavioral therapy for anxious pets.

Most importantly, your fur baby — and your wallet — will be taken care of in case of an emergency.

“The stressors of military life aren’t limited to people,” Hagesfeld said. “They impact pets, too.”",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4746.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-10-03 07:56:30.655669

Once again, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans disappoints me. I’m an Army retiree and Medicare recipient. A few days ago, I wrote to Kiggans asking her to act to restore pharmaceutical benefits that the Defense Health Agency now denies to military retirees over the age of 65.

On Aug. 31, the DHA began denying coverage of certain medications to a single group of Tricare enrollees based solely on their age. Younger retirees continue to enjoy coverage for the exact same prescriptions. This action is discriminatory and illegal, a violation of the law.

I received a prompt boiler-plate response promising me that she’ll keep my “thoughts in mind should any legislation come to the House Floor that aim[s] to reform or improve Tricare.”

Kiggans is content to sit back and let the DHA continue its unfair and illegal treatment of her constituents. It must be too much trouble, or too risky, for her to step up for old military retirees.

There is too much money, particularly out of state, poured into political campaigns. It serves no good purpose as most of it is, at best, deceptive in its attacks against the opposing candidates.

Gubernatorial candidates former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears each represent the policies of their party. Before a vote is cast, determine the issues most important to you and our state.

I want Virginia’s next governor to continue the conservative policies of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Therefore, my vote will be for Earle-Sears.

Red herring

Re “Vote Republican” (Your Views, Sept. 28): The writer deflects our attention using the popular MAGA scare of the rare child upset by the presence of a trans classmate in bathrooms, sports or locker rooms. A red herring if there ever was one.

Voting Republican is what’s brought us higher tariffs (aka sales taxes); attacks on TV comedians; prosecution of political enemies; troops sent into our cities on false pretenses; our health system turned into a clown show run by anti-vaccine boneheads; valuable federal employees fired on the flimsiest of pretenses; people disappeared off the streets by roving gangs of masked thugs; peaceful protestors abused or injured; millions losing health care to fund tax breaks for billionaires; White House and Pentagon reporters muzzled; clemency for nearly 1,600 Jan. 6, 2021, rioters (more than 600 of whom were guilty of assaulting or obstructing law enforcement officers); and our great country embarrassed on the international stage.

Pick more important issues, sir.

Costs of kids

I am writing concerning the economic challenges of raising children in the Virginia’s 1st Congressional District. I am a grandfather who is frustrated by the Republican Party’s lack of empathy regarding the costs associated with child-rearing.

U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman’s continued support for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which he claims makes raising a child more affordable through increased tax credits, is a disservice to his district. These credits do not benefit many of Virginias’ most at-risk families due to their annual gross income.

The cost of an essential item such as infant car seats is often out of reach for hardworking Americans. For example, Consumer Reports recommended infant car seats cost around $250, requiring 39 hours of work at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, or 23 hours at Virginia’s state minimum wage of $12.41 per hour. When contrasted with the significant wealth increase of the richest 400 people in America, who saw their personal wealth grow by $1.2 trillion since the start of the year, it becomes obvious who Wittman views as his constituency.

Wittman’s reliance on repetitive talking points calls for a public forum in the Tidewater area where Wittman can explain how the bill he supports addresses the economic challenges of raising a child.

Susan Collins (R-ME) and U.S. Reps. David Valadao (R-CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) would permit early childhood educators to claim the same federal tax deduction currently available to K-12 teachers.
“As the author of the original tax credit for K-12 teachers, I am delighted to join this effort to expand this benefit to pre-K educators,” Sen. Collins said on Sept. 30.
“This tax credit would help more people by reimbursing early childhood educators for the resources they invest in our children’s future.” Research shows that educators spend an average of $860 annually on supplies for their students.
Yet, under current law, early childhood educators cannot deduct those out-of-pocket expenses, according to a bill summary provided by Sen. Collins’ staff.
“For early childhood teachers, every crayon, book, and learning tool is more than a supply — it’s an investment in a child’s future,” Rep. Fitzpatrick said.","A bipartisan, bicameral bill recently cosponsored by U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and U.S. Reps. David Valadao (R-CA) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) would permit early childhood educators to claim the same federal tax deduction currently available to K-12 teachers.

The Supporting Early-Childhood Educators’ Deductions (SEED) Act of 2025, S. 2791/H.R. 5334, which both U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) and U.S. Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) sponsored on Sept. 11, would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow early childhood educators to take the educator expense deduction.

“As the author of the original tax credit for K-12 teachers, I am delighted to join this effort to expand this benefit to pre-K educators,” Sen. Collins said on Sept. 30. “This tax credit would help more people by reimbursing early childhood educators for the resources they invest in our children’s future.”

Research shows that educators spend an average of $860 annually on supplies for their students. Yet, under current law, early childhood educators cannot deduct those out-of-pocket expenses, according to a bill summary provided by Sen. Collins’ staff.

If enacted, the SEED Act would expand the above-the-line $300 educator expense deduction established for K-12 teachers in 2002 to also include pre-K and early childhood educators and help offset the money teachers personally spend each year on classroom supplies, books, and learning materials, the summary says.

“No teacher should have to choose between paying out of pocket or providing basic classroom needs, and this bipartisan bill expands the deduction so early childhood educators can focus on teaching the next generation rather than worrying about costs,” said Rep. Valadao.

The bill has garnered support from the Center for American Progress, the American Federation of Teachers, Teach For America, the First Five Years Fund, and Trying Together.

“For early childhood teachers, every crayon, book, and learning tool is more than a supply — it’s an investment in a child’s future,” Rep. Fitzpatrick said. “The SEED Act affirms their dedication by extending to pre-K educators the same classroom deduction K–12 teachers already receive, correcting an unfair exclusion, strengthening the workforce, and putting more resources into our children’s hands during their most critical years.”",,N,0.0,2025-10-02 18:56:36.670243

“Prosecution for murder should not have an expiration date,” Sen. Rounds said on Sept. 30 about Kamisha’s Law, S. 2624, which he introduced in July.

The bill is named for Kamisha, a 23-month-old toddler murdered in 1992 in Roberts County, S.D., in a case that went unsolved for more than 30 years until new witness testimony in 2023 led to the prosecution of Jay Adams, Jr.

“In the case of Jay Adams Jr., new evidence was not brought forward until over three decades after Kamisha was murdered,” said Sen. Rounds. “While he was prosecuted under a plea deal, this legislation rights a wrong by eliminating the statute of limitations for second degree murder on federal lands.

“I appreciate Kamisha’s mother Christine and her husband Roger for working with us on this legislation, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to honor Kamisha’s memory and get it across the finish line,” he added.

The bill also would include second-degree murder, as well as murder of federal officials, according to a bill summary provided by Sen. Rounds’ staff.

Congress has previously recognized the seriousness of such crimes, abolishing statutes of limitations for first-degree murder, as well as child sexual abuse and abduction offenses in 2003 and 2006, the summary says.

Department of Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open as usual and provide all normal services.
PenFed Credit Union offers its affected members zero-interest loans covering a paycheck.
Andrews Federal Credit Union has short-term loans, penalty-free early withdrawals from Share Certificates and counseling available to its affected members.
Military exchanges will remain open.","The U.S. government officially shut down Wednesday morning, and until a funding deal is reached in Congress, troops will be working without paychecks.

Many federal websites and social media accounts will also not be updated in the meantime.

As the shutdown has stretched into a second day, here are some common questions and answers.

Who is getting paid, and when? And is anyone getting fired?

Service members will work without pay until a funding deal is arranged. Once the shutdown has ended, backpay will be issued for the missed payments.

Nearly half of civilians working for the Department of Defense — 334,904 — will be furloughed, the Pentagon said, though some may continue working without pay or maintain their duties with pay as usual depending on their agencies.

President Donald Trump is meeting with budget director Russ Vought Thursday to discuss “temporary or permanent” cuts in spending that could see mass layoffs of federal workers who are furloughed.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week that layoffs were “imminent.”

Will my health services be affected?

Military hospitals and clinics will remain open, but the Defense Health Agency’s website will not be updated during the shutdown. As a result, you should contact your local hospital to check if its hours of operations or normal services are altered.

Tricare services are largely unaffected. The service’s website has a table outlining which services and administrative functions are affected, but emergency services, urgent care, surgeries, outpatient care, claims and online services remain unchanged for now.

Department of Veterans Affairs facilities will remain open as usual and provide all normal services. VA benefits, burials and suicide prevention programs will continue normally. However, call centers for the GI Bill, public outreach and career counseling will cease.

The VA’s website has a full outline of which services are and are not impacted by the shutdown.

If you need financial assistance

Furloughed workers can apply for unemployment benefits, but upon receiving back pay, they will be required to pay back any unemployment assistance they received.

Alternatively, service members and their families can seek help from their financial institutions, military aid societies and the Red Cross.

The Air Force Aid Society is not currently accepting applications for assistance directly related to the shutdown as Oct. 1 paychecks were still issued, according to a notice posted on its website. But if the shutdown continues to the point that Oct. 15 paychecks are disrupted, AFAS will issue new guidance. Its normal application process continues as normal.

The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society does not have a special program for those affected by the shutdown, but its offices will be open during normal hours to assist those affected.

Army Emergency Relief says it will provide zero-interest loans in the event the Oct. 15 paycheck is disrupted, equivalent to the amount of one net paycheck up to a maximum of $6,000.

Coast Guard Mutual Assistance is offering an interest-free loan that covers up to one month of Basic Allowance for Housing.

The Air Force, Navy-Marine Corps and Army aid societies encourage households to try seeking assistance first from their financial institutions.

Some financial institutions are offering assistance programs:

Navy Federal Credit Union will allow eligible members to enroll in its Paycheck Assistance Program.

USAA is offering no-interest loans and special insurance payment arrangements.

First Command offers qualifying customers interest-free pay advance loans and penalty-free early CD withdrawals.

PenFed Credit Union offers its affected members zero-interest loans covering a paycheck.

Andrews Federal Credit Union has short-term loans, penalty-free early withdrawals from Share Certificates and counseling available to its affected members.

Major commercial banks are not currently offering financial relief programs. But if the shutdown lasts a long time, it may be worth checking again — during the last shutdown, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase and Citi offered some assistance.

Other functions: DODEA, childcare, permanent change of station moves and more

Schools operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA) would remain open, but sports and extracurricular activities were paused starting Wednesday, according to a note that was emailed to parents from DODEA school leaders on Friday.

Child Development Centers, School Age Care programs and Youth Programs will remain “at a minimum, operational for mission essential purposes,” according to Military OneSource, but local installations should be contacted for specifics.

Permanent change of station moves will be impacted. Moves to an excepted activity will continue, according to the Pentagon, but moves from an excepted activity will only continue if it is determined to be mission-essential. Moves associated with recruitment and training will continue.

Military exchanges will remain open.

Military grocery stores should remain open because Defense Working Capital Fund activities, which include the Defense Commissary Agency, have previously been permitted to operate until their cash reserves ran out. But those funds would dry up if the shutdown extended for months.

Military OneSource is one of the few resources with a still-updating website.

How long will the shutdown last?

No one knows. The last shutdown, which took place during President Donald Trump’s first administration, was the longest and lasted 35 days. Most other shutdowns lasted just a few days, though some have stretched into multiple weeks.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/r2jlh6-9345136.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/9345136.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-02 16:56:46.697913

The Pentagon released new guidance in a May 29 memo but did not announce it publicly. The Associated Press obtained the memo last week.

While the policy does not change flu requirements for active-duty service members, the Pentagon will no longer compensate members of the National Guard and reserve components of each branch who choose to get the flu shot unless they are activated for 30 consecutive days, a Pentagon official told USNI News.

Requirements for civilians will be determined based on occupational risk, the official said. All healthcare workers will still need to get the flu vaccine.

“The strength of our military is built on the readiness of America’s brave men and women in uniform,” reads the May 29 memo. “To ensure that readiness, the Department invests in force health protection to combat threats from a variety of infectious diseases, including seasonal influenza, or the ‘flu.’ This guidance provides common-sense revisions to the Department’s current flu immunization requirements to continue to support a medically ready force while exercising stewardship of taxpayer dollars.”

The flu vaccine is available at no cost to military health system beneficiaries and can be found at military treatment facilities or clinics that have them in stock, a Defense Health Agency official told USNI News.

Active-duty service members will be given priority at military health system facilities. The flu shots are also available at pharmacies in the TRICARE network or at a TRICARE-authorized provider, the official said.

For the Navy, U.S. Navy ships, operational assets and training commands will be given priority for the flu shot, according to a service memo released on Sept. 26.

Time 2 Minute Read

Categories: Regulatory

Defense contractors received some clarity into the shutdown plans for the Department of Defense/War (Department) when the Department released a memo outlining its contingency plans during this lapse in funding.

Initially, the Department noted that of its 741,477 civilian employees, approximately 400,000 would be exempted from the shutdown because they are funded by something other than annual appropriations or are necessary to protect life or property. Similarly, not all contracts will be curtailed, depending on the circumstances. Some notes from the memo:

Contracts awarded prior to a lapse in funding may continue to be performed so long as there are obligated funds left on the contract unless the contract requires access to government facilities, “active administration” by Department personnel, or use of government resources that would cause the Department to incur additional obligations.

New contracts, exercise of options, issuance of task orders, and contract extensions are prohibited unless they support an excepted function.

New contracts and extensions may be issued if supporting an excepted function. The Department notes that this is “where delay in contracting would create an imminent risk to the safety of human life or the protection of property, including endangering national security.”

In the memo, the Department provides some examples of activities and functions that would continue to function in the event of a shutdown. Those include:

national security including military and contingency operations, intelligence operations, repair of equipment to support excepted activities, and military support to enforce treaties;

medical/dental care including inpatient care, acute and emergency outpatient care, private care under TRICARE, and veterinary services supporting excepted activities;

acquisition and logistics support including contract administration (such as payment) for contracts funded with prior year funds, activities required to support the Feed and Forage Act (such as clothing, storage, food, etc.);

legislative and public affairs support including Armed Forces Network and legislative affairs activities supporting excepted activities;

education and training in support of excepted activities; and

financial management activities including controlling funds and obligations incurred supporting excepted activities.

The list provided by the Department is much longer and is worth reviewing, particularly for contractors with prime contracts or subcontracts with the Department.

Infants were identified and linked with sponsors and birth mothers using data from the Military Health System Data Repository and Defense Manpower Data Center, which were also used to derive demographic, military, and medical characteristics. Birth and infant health outcomes were ascertained using diagnosis and procedure codes from medical encounter files, which encompassed all care covered by TRICARE (i.e., across military and civilian facilities). Population characteristics were reported using descriptive statistics, overall and by birth mother beneficiary type: sponsor, dependent spouse, or other. Trends in selected adverse outcomes were also described (i.e., cesarean delivery, preterm birth [<37 weeks' gestation], low birthweight [<2500 g], and birth defects).

Results: There were 632,565 live births identified from 2016 to 2021; birth mother beneficiary type was most frequently dependent spouse (78.0%, n = 493,183), followed by sponsor (17.3%, n = 109,293) and other (4.8%, n = 30,089). Overall, mean maternal age at delivery was 28.4 years; the majority of infants had sponsors who were married (89.3%, n = 564,999), non-Hispanic White (60.7%, n = 384,148), on active duty status (73.1%, n = 462,107), and of any enlisted rank (79.6%, n = 503,848). Most infants' sponsors deployed at least once before their birth (57.0%, n = 360,312), with a smaller proportion deployed during pregnancy (7.5%, n = 47,306). Births were more likely to occur at civilian versus military hospitals, and the proportion of births at civilian hospitals increased over the study period, from 61.6% in 2016 to 69.5% in 2021. Among all infants, 28.2% (n = 178,589) were delivered by cesarean, 7.3% (n = 45,940) were preterm, 5.2% (n = 32,605) were low birthweight, and 3.4% (n = 21,222) were diagnosed with a major structural birth defect in the first year of life; all of these outcomes were more likely to occur among civilian versus military hospital births.",https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image-v2.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-02 11:56:38.179133

“These forums are about you, your concerns, your ideas, and your experiences as part of the Fort Hood community,” he stated in his opening remarks.
The town hall also offered an opportunity for residents to submit questions both before and during the livestream.
In addition to the Virtual Town Hall, garrison leaders regularly engage through “walking town halls,” which allow them to connect directly with residents in on-post neighborhoods.
A follow-up Virtual Town Hall is anticipated for January 2026, with the Q&A session from the September event to be made available online.","The U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Hood command team, alongside various leaders from different directorates and organizations, hosted a Virtual Town Hall on September 25. It marked the first installation-wide forum of its kind in five years, offering an opportunity for community members to engage with garrison leaders through a live broadcast on Facebook.

The event was moderated by U.S. Army Garrison-Fort Hood Commander Col. Mark R. McClellan, who highlighted that the feedback and concerns of the community were a primary motivator for organizing the town hall. “These forums are about you, your concerns, your ideas, and your experiences as part of the Fort Hood community,” he stated in his opening remarks. McClellan emphasized the garrison’s mission to provide the necessary services and programs to ensure both the readiness of the III Armored Corps and the well-being of families and community members.

McClellan underscored the importance of having subject-matter experts available during the town hall to effectively address a range of pressing issues raised by participants. Throughout the session, approximately 20 questions were addressed, covering topics such as housing maintenance, the use of unmanned aircraft, TRICARE coverage for college-aged dependents, and pharmacy prescriptions. Notably, Cavalry Family Housing garnered significant attention, receiving the bulk of inquiries.

Chris Albus, project director of Cavalry Family Housing, responded to several questions regarding maintenance requests and community events. He informed participants that updates and activities could be found on the Cavalry Family Housing Facebook page as well as through other official Fort Hood platforms.

The town hall also offered an opportunity for residents to submit questions both before and during the livestream. Midway through the hour-long session, McClellan reassured attendees that every concern would be documented and addressed. He committed to ensuring that all inquiries would receive a direct response within seven business days, enhancing the garrison’s ongoing efforts to remain responsive and accountable to community needs.

In addition to the Virtual Town Hall, garrison leaders regularly engage through “walking town halls,” which allow them to connect directly with residents in on-post neighborhoods. Albus expressed the importance of listening to community feedback, stating, “Everyone in Cavalry Family Housing wants our residents to have the best possible experience living on post.”

McClellan encouraged residents to provide additional feedback through the Interactive Customer Evaluation (ICE) system, which is reviewed weekly by the garrison command team. This feedback mechanism allows community members to inform garrison leadership of their concerns and suggestions. Buccellato, the deputy to the garrison commander, added that the command team takes every submitted ICE comment into account during their weekly reviews.

The garrison commander reiterated the importance of these forums and indicated a commitment to regular public engagements. A follow-up Virtual Town Hall is anticipated for January 2026, with the Q&A session from the September event to be made available online. This ongoing dialogue between garrison leadership and the community aims to foster a strong, connected environment at Fort Hood.",https://news.ssbcrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fort-Hood-Hosts-First-Virtual-Town-Hall-in-Five-Years.jpg,N,0.0,2025-10-02 04:56:33.123569

What is a government shutdown and how will it affect the Coast Guard?

A shutdown happens when Congress fails to pass appropriations or a continuing resolution to fund federal agencies and program. Once the funding lapses, in this case on Sept. 30, agencies must cease operations financed by those appropriations, except for functions that are legally required to continue.

The Coast Guard generally will continue operations authorized by law that are necessary for the safety of human life, protection of property, or national security. This includes emerging contingency operations like hurricane preparedness and response. The Coast Guard will also continue to focus on asserting presence and securing America’s borders.

How will I be affected?

It depends on which of the following categories you fall into:

Excepted employees include all military members, plus anyone else whose work is considered essential to safeguarding life or property, or otherwise mandated by law. If you’re an excepted employee you will continue working during the funding lapse.

Furloughed (non-excepted) employees are those whose functions are considered non-essential and whose pay is tied to appropriations. Furloughed employees will be placed in a non-duty, non-pay status and must stop working during the shutdown.

Exempt employees are not affected by the lapse in appropriations because they are paid out of special fees or multi-year accounts.

Contractors should check their status with their Contracting Officer Representatives.

What happens to pay?

Excepted employees work during the shutdown but may not receive pay until the government reopens. Furloughed employees do not work or get paid during the shutdown. But thanks to the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (GEFTA), both furloughed and excepted employees are guaranteed back pay once funding is restored. The timing of this pay depends on how quickly Congress acts to restore funding. Your benefits, such as health and retirement, continue during the shutdown period, although payroll deductions will stop until pay is restored.

Military Members' Pay: All Coast Guard military personnel have received a full paycheck covering the current pay period (ending Sept. 30). If a shutdown extends beyond Oct. 13, members will miss the mid-October paycheck. If a shutdown extends past Oct. 13, members will be paid about two days after the shutdown ends.

Below is a hypothetical example:

If a shutdown were to occur from 01-21 October, military members would receive their missed mid-October paycheck on or about Oct. 23. They would also receive their full paychecks at end of the month in October (on time).

Note this is different than past shutdowns which occurred after a short-term Continuing Resolution. In these past situations, the Coast Guard was able to set-aside a portion of available funding to ensure we could cover at least one paycheck after a shutdown. In the current situation, the potential shutdown would occur at the very beginning of the fiscal year (Oct. 1); thus, there is no funding available to set aside for military pay.

Civilian Members' Pay: All civilian employees have received a full paycheck from Pay Period 18 (on or about Sept. 29). All civilians paid out of single-year appropriations (the vast majority of our civilian workforce) will receive approximately 70% of their Pay Period 19 paycheck on or about Oct. 16. Similar to the military workforce, there is a roughly two-day delay to receive back-pay once a shutdown concludes. Please note that exempt civilian employees funded from the Coast Guard Yard working capital fund and un-expired multi/no-year appropriations will be paid on time during a lapse.

Back-Pay: By law, all military and civilian personnel are guaranteed to receive back-pay once a potential lapse in appropriations concludes.

Military Retiree Pay: All retired military personnel (including Coast Guard) will receive pay on time during a government shutdown. This is because military personnel are paid out of a trust fund.

Will I work during a shutdown?

Military personnel are statutorily exempt and shall report to duty – as directed by their commanding officers, officers-in-charge, and supervisors – to support missions that are legally authorized to continue during an appropriations lapse.

Civilian personnel positions are categorized as exempt, non-exempt, or excepted. Exempt and excepted employees shall report to work as usual. Non-exempt employees will be furloughed. Your immediate supervisor should already have notified you of your status; if you are not sure, please contact your immediate supervisor.

What kind of duties am I expected to conduct during a shutdown?

During a lapse in appropriations, the Coast Guard may only conduct activities that are vital to national defense and safety of life and property.

For guidance on support systems services, see ALCOAST 411/25 (CAC required) from the Deputy Commandant for Systems (DCS)

For guidance on personnel support services, see ALCOAST 412/25 (CAC required) from the Deputy Commandant for Personnel (DCP)

Operational commanders should review ALCOAST 413/25 (CAC required) from the Deputy Commandant for Operations (DCO)

Do reservists have to drill during a shutdown?

Reserve ADT/IDT in support of excepted functions, including training to maintain proficiency, shall be in accordance with ALCOAST 413/25 (CAC required for access).

How does a shutdown impact the Coast Guard Auxiliary?

Auxiliary activity may only be performed if it is specifically ordered by a Coast Guard command in direct support of an exempt activity. Exempt activities are primarily limited to urgent Search and Rescue (SAR), Aids to Navigation (ATON) outages, and national security threats.

Will military medical and dental be available during a shutdown?

Yes, uniformed staff at regional healthcare practices will be available to provide services to eligible beneficiaries. Coast Guard clinics will continue to operate during the lapse. Additionally, all TRICARE services and coverage will be available for all eligible beneficiaries during the lapse in appropriation.

Where can I get support during a shutdown?

Employee assistance and military work life services remain available to the workforce and their families 24/7/365. The Military OneSource services are the gateway to trusted information, resources and confidential help for active-duty members and their families through Military OneSource or by calling (800) 342-9647. The Federal Occupational Health (FOH) Employee Assistance Program offers confidential support and resources for the well-being of civilian employees and their families through the https://www.foh4you.com site or by calling (800) 222-0364. Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocate Program Specialists will be available.

Will Coast Guard Child Development Centers remain open?

Yes, Child Development Centers will remain open to all enrolled.

Will galleys, commissaries, or exchanges be open during the shutdown?

Yes, the Coast Guard Exchange System will remain open. In addition, galleys will be open during a shutdown.

Am I expected to pay my bills during a shutdown?

During a lapse, Coast Guard members must continue to meet all civil obligations, including insurance, rent/mortgage, child care, and child support, regardless of the government’s ability to process payroll. If you have set up direct financial allotments through the Coast Guard payroll system, please remember that no funds will be transferred during a furlough. Remember to review your automatic payments and make any necessary adjustments. Creditors are not obligated to provide relief, so communicate with them quickly if you anticipate any temporary financial constraints.

Will retirees get paid?

Military Retirees and Survivor Benefits Plan (SBP) beneficiaries are not impacted by a lapse in appropriations and will continue to receive disbursements.

Will military members receive SGLI, Tricare, and medical Benefits?

All medical benefits and insurance premiums remain current. These will be processed and paid once payroll resumes after the shutdown. Both you and your dependents will continue to have access to your primary medical providers.

Will I get reimbursed for travel during the shutdown?

Members with orders for official travel will be reimbursed after the shutdown ends. To be paid as quickly as possible, submit your claims through ETS within three days of travel.

If you incur fees due to a class/orders cancellation (i.e., service fees/cancellation fees), you will be reimbursed after the shutdown ends. The Coast Guard and DHS will work with the Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) bank, to prevent members from incurring delinquency and interest charges for travel if the lapse approaches 30 days. Commands shall handle account delinquency situations on a case-by-case basis. Travelers who have submitted a timely travel voucher but have not been reimbursed due to furlough, should not be subject to adverse action by the chain of command for account delinquency.

Will I get reimbursed for pre-shutdown travel?

Travel conducted prior to a lapse in appropriations will be reimbursed once the financial system re-opens after the shutdown.

Will military members be able to attend training during the shutdown?

Coast Guard Active Duty and Reserve members shall execute orders to Class ""A"" and Class ""C"" Schools during a lapse in appropriations unless otherwise advised by Education & Training Quota Management Command (ETQC). Active duty and Reserve members currently in attendance or in receipt of orders to Class “A” School or any enlisted or officer accession training shall continue training as planned.

Civilian employees in receipt of Class “C” school orders shall not execute those orders. Units shall send a cancellation notice to ETQC. Civilian employees currently in attendance at Class “C” school are responsible for contacting their supervisor to determine their status (i.e., exempt/non-exempt/excepted).

Auxiliarists will not be permitted to attend Class “C” school training on funded orders during a lapse. Auxiliarists may, however, attend Class “C” school training on no cost orders.

How does a shutdown affect tuition assistance?

Tuition Assistance (TA) applications will continue to be accepted during a lapse in appropriations. However, members should not assume TA is authorized until they receive their approved TA application from the ETQC. Students already approved and enrolled in courses will continue to receive TA.

Am I able to attend conferences?

Attendance at conferences during a lapse in appropriations is prohibited. This includes conferences that have already been approved by DHS prior to the lapse. Regardless of furlough status, no Coast Guard personnel may attend conferences during the lapse in appropriations either as an attendee or presenter. This prohibition includes no-cost local travel. Units requiring clarity on virtual attendance via teleconference shall obtain clearance from the Servicing Legal Offices and RMO/RA then send that request to CG-81 and CG-LGL for concurrence.

Can I fundraise for myself during the shutdown?

Federal employees may not engage in fundraising in an official capacity or in the federal workplace, except in limited circumstances (see 5 CFR 2635.702 and 5 CFR 2635.808).

Coast Guard employees have previously sought financial assistance through electronic “crowdsourcing” campaigns through platforms such as GoFundMe. Such campaigns raise a variety of ethics concerns and require careful planning to avoid violating ethics rules, employees are urged to always check with their Servicing Legal Office prior to launching a crowdsourcing campaign. Generally, federal employees or those related to federal employees may not use a crowdsourcing campaign to raise funds simply because they are in a non-pay status.

Federal employees are urged to check with their servicing legal office before engaging in fundraising or other functions that might violate a federal ethics rule.

What kind of outside support can I receive during a shutdown?

In general, employees/members can accept opportunities and other benefits provided by sources that are closely affiliated with the Coast Guard, such as the Chief Petty Officers’ Association (CPOA), local Spouses Clubs, and Auxiliary Flotillas. These sources may not discriminate amongst Coast Guard employees by official responsibility or on a basis that favors those of a higher rank or rate of pay.

Acceptable forms of support include:

Restaurants offering free meals to local Coast Guard members

Food bank offering groceries to all furloughed federal employees

Cash grants from charitable organizations to all veterans impacted by a government shutdown

Gift cards (cash equivalent and store) offered to all members of a Coast Guard unit

Unacceptable forms of support include:

Gift cards (cash equivalent and store) offered to all members of a Coast Guard unit by the owner of an inspected vessel

Offer of cash to just one or two persons at a unit from a local member of the community

Free meals offered to a unit’s command cadre

Any command or member with questions of what support or gifts can be accepted should call their servicing legal office.

While U.S. military operations will continue during a shutdown, U.S. servicemembers will miss at least one paycheck if a budget deal isn’t in place by Oct. 15.
A shutdown also will force the furlough of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, including those in public affairs and community outreach personnel, financial management personnel and acquisition personnel.
For the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the department estimates that 97 percent of its employee will continue to work during a shutdown.
Here is an overview of how VA services, other DoD operations and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are affected.","Here’s what the current shutdown means for veterans, servicemembers, their families and national security.

With Congress locked in a budget battle and unable to reach a compromise, the U.S. government went into a partial shutdown at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 1. While some critical government functions will continue to operate, others will be paused.

Those U.S. citizens who collect Social Security – including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers – won’t see an interruption in their monthly payments during the shutdown. Food assistance programs will continue until they run out of funds.

While U.S. military operations will continue during a shutdown, U.S. servicemembers will miss at least one paycheck if a budget deal isn’t in place by Oct. 15. A shutdown also will force the furlough of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) civilians, including those in public affairs and community outreach personnel, financial management personnel and acquisition personnel.

For the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the department estimates that 97 percent of its employee will continue to work during a shutdown. VA benefits will continue to be processed and delivered, including compensation, pension, education and housing benefits. However, VA benefits regional offices are closed.

VA medical centers, outpatient clinics and Vet Centers remain open.

Here is an overview of how VA services, other DoD operations and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security are affected.

U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs

Programs not impacted

· Burials will continue at VA national cemeteries. Applications for headstones, markers, and burial benefits processing will continue.

· The Board of Veterans’ Appeals will continue decisions on veterans’ cases.

· Call Centers: VA’s primary call center (1-800-MyVA411) and the Veterans Crisis Line (Dial 988, Press 1) will remain open 24/7. The VA Benefit Hotline (1-800-827-1000) will be available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET.

· Suicide prevention programs, homelessness services, and caregiver support will continue.

Impacted programs

· VA will cease providing transition program assistance and career counseling.

· Call Centers: VA’s GI Bill (1-888-GIBILL-1) and National Cemetery Applicant Assistance (1-800-697-6947) hotlines will be closed.

· VA benefits regional offices will be closed.

· Public Affairs and outreach to Veterans will cease, including social media, VetResources emails, and responses to press inquiries.

· No grounds maintenance or placement of permanent headstones at VA cemeteries.

· Applications for pre-need burial at VA cemeteries will not be processed.

· No printing of new Presidential Memorial Certificates.

· No outreach to state, county, tribal, municipal, faith-based, and community-based partners by VA Central Office.

U.S. Department of Defense

· Operations. Subordinate leaders in the DoD have the authority to evaluate and determine whether activities are “excepted” for supporting high priority efforts and for the safety of human life and protection of property. As of September 2025, the department considers the following among its highest priorities: Operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East Operations, Golden Dome for America, Depot Maintenance, Shipbuilding and Critical Munitions.

· Servicemember Impact. Though not getting paid, active-duty servicemembers, including reserve component personnel on federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties. National Guard servicemembers performing duties under Title 32 will be terminated unless such duties are in support of excepted activities defined by the department. Reserve servicemembers performing Active Guard Reserve (AGR) duty will continue to carry out AGR authorized duties for the period of their AGR tour. Reserve servicemembers will not perform inactive duty resulting in the obligation of funds, except in support of military operations necessary for national security, disaster response or fulfilling pre-deployment requirements. And Temporary Duty Travel (TDY) scheduled to begin after the shutdown may be cancelled if not in support of an excepted activity, such as returning to one’s official duty station. Those on PCS orders attending training and educational activities may continue to attend classes only if the instructor is military or is a contractor paid with prior year funds. PCS orders for duty station changes may be impacted if not funded with prior year funds.

· Quality of Life Impact: On the medical side, inpatient care, acute and emergency outpatient care in DoD medical facilities will continue during a shutdown. Elective surgeries and other procedures may be postponed or canceled. Private health care through TRICARE will not be affected. Services and counseling for victims of sexual assault, religious, suicide, substance abuse, counterdrug activities and operations of mortuary affairs will still be provided during a shutdown. On the education side, schools that are operated by the Department of Defense Education Activity will remain open, but sports and extracurricular activities will result in a pause during a shutdown. Mess hall operations, physical training and “childcare activities required for readiness” would continue in a shutdown. Meanwhile, the operation of childcare centers is still to be determined. During past shutdowns, childcare centers depended on the level of base staffing and demand. Thus, a shutdown would affect childcare on a case-by-case basis.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

· Impact to operations. DHS secures U.S. borders and critical infrastructures, while protecting the U.S. from hybrid threats. A shutdown would disrupt DHS’s ability to work effectively, leaving Americans less safe. Without proper pay, both members of the U.S. Coast Guard and border agents may have less productivity due to financial uncertainty, further decreasing DHS’s ability.

· U.S. Coast Guard: The 40,000 active-duty members of the U.S. Coast Guard will continue to work and will only be compensated for their unpaid work if an appropriation is passed. Members of the Coast Guard are unable to file for interim support that would supplement their income. During the longest government shutdown (2019), members needed severe assistance for the costs of shelter, food, utilities, clothing and health expenses.",https://www.legion.org/assets/dist/images/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-10-01 14:57:21.901226

The meeting comes amid continued momentum in security ties, even as trade relations between the two countries face occasional friction.

Earlier in September, Kwatra also met U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby at the Pentagon, where the two reviewed defense cooperation initiatives and reaffirmed their commitment to advancing strategic collaboration.

Egg- and non-egg-based influenza vaccines showed equivalent protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza‑like illness and related hospitalizations among healthy adults in the military health system. However, recombinant influenza vaccine achieved higher seroconversion rates across all influenza subtypes.

METHODOLOGY:

Researchers conducted a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine and a recombinant influenza vaccine with that of an egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine among military health system beneficiaries over four influenza seasons from 2018 to 2022.

A total of 15,432 participants (32.1% women; 79% younger than 45 years) across ten US sites were randomly assigned to a control group that received the egg-based inactivated vaccine (n = 5148) or to test groups that received the cell culture-based inactivated vaccine (n = 5130) or the recombinant vaccine (n = 5154).

Participants completed weekly text or email surveys beginning 2 weeks after vaccination, reporting any influenza-like illness symptoms over the past 7 days; a nasal swab and a blood sample were collected if influenza-like illness was reported.

The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza, detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from study-collected swabs or positive clinical tests at least 14 days post-vaccination.

A secondary aim of the study was to compare the immunogenicity of the cell culture-based and recombinant vaccines with that of the egg-based vaccine in a subset of 1087 participants, with samples taken before vaccination and 21-35 days post-vaccination.

TAKEAWAY:

Influenza occurred in 1.7% of cell culture-based vaccine recipients, 1.5% of recombinant vaccine recipients, and 1.3% of egg-based vaccine recipients; most laboratory-confirmed cases were due to subtype influenza A.

No significant difference in vaccine effectiveness was seen between the cell culture-based and egg-based vaccines (relative vaccine effectiveness [rVE], -26.53%; 95% CI, -73.13% to 7.53%) or between the recombinant and egg-based vaccines (rVE, -14.36%; 95% CI, -57.59% to 17.01%).

Recombinant vaccine recipients achieved higher seroconversion rates than egg-based recipients across all subtypes, whereas cell culture-based vaccine recipients achieved higher seroconversion rates than egg-based recipients only for virus subtype A/H3N2.

When egg-based vaccines were compared with either cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines, no significant differences in rVE were observed for influenza subtypes, influenza-like illness, or related hospitalizations.

IN PRACTICE:

“This study did not detect significant differential effectiveness of newer non-egg-based influenza vaccines compared to egg-based products in preventing influenza illness in a population of predominantly healthy, working-age adults with low influenza incidence,” the authors wrote.

SOURCE:

This study was led by Rhonda E. Colombo, MD, MHS, from the Infectious Disease Clinical Research Program, Department of Preventive Medicine and Biostatistics, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland. It was published online on September 18, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

LIMITATIONS:

This study was limited by the small number of influenza cases, and the wide CIs around rVE point estimates indicated that a higher infection rate might have uncovered clinically meaningful differences. The open-label design may have introduced bias, and the largely young, healthy sample limited generalizability to older adults or those with comorbidities.

DISCLOSURES:

This study received federal funding from multiple sources, including the Defense Health Program, the US Department of Defense, the Defense Health Agency Immunization Healthcare Division, among others. Some authors disclosed receiving research funding or consulting fees from, being employed by, or serving as speakers for various pharmaceutical companies.

Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton is Ohio’s largest single-site employer with more than 38,000 military, civilian and contractor employees.

It boasts an annual economic impact of $4.2 billion.

According to a contingency plan from the Pentagon, all active-duty troops across the board are required to keep working but civilian employees will face furloughs unless they are deemed mission critical.

Pay will be affected starting with the Oct. 13 payday.

Backpay is guaranteed, but it will not process until the shutdown ends or another exemption passes.

During the shutdown, many of the on-base functions will continue like emergency services, hospital care, TRICARE coverage, child care and already funded contract work.

In the past, the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force was closed temporarily during a government shutdown.

Wright-Patterson is also home to several major units for the Air Force including the 88th Air Base Wing, Air Force Materiel Command, Air Force Research Laboratory, AFIT, NASIC and others.

The units not only employ active duty, but many civilian personnel.

Across the DOD, it’s estimated that 2 million troops will be impacted, including the National Guard.

Already the parents of an 18-month-old daughter, the Navy petty officer second class and his wife had been through it all before.
Mono-mono twins occur in approximately 1% of identical twin pregnancies and less than 0.1% of all pregnancies.
But now 10 months old, the twins are thriving, despite doctors warning Michaela and Elijah they would likely have developmental issues.
“We got super lucky.” Being in the Navy added to their luck from a financial perspective as well.","Michaela and Elijah Dominguez weren’t expecting any surprises when, on a whim, they decided to get a 3D ultrasound 20 weeks into Michaela’s second pregnancy. Already the parents of an 18-month-old daughter, the Navy petty officer second class and his wife had been through it all before.

“I’m laying on the table, and my toddler’s holding my hand,” said Michaela. “And the tech is like, ‘I think I have mirror image on, because I’m seeing two.’ And my husband is looking at the screen like, ‘Oh my gosh, there are literally two heads.’”

The couple’s shock at discovering the twin pregnancy changed to fear once doctors discovered the Dominguez family was in the incredibly rare position of expecting monoamniotic-monochorionic (mono-mono) twins.

Mono-mono twins occur in approximately 1% of identical twin pregnancies and less than 0.1% of all pregnancies. They share both an amniotic sac and placenta, which leads to much higher risk than a typical pregnancy. Their umbilical cords can become entangled, leading to potentially fatal cord compression. The twins can also develop twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where blood is unevenly distributed between the twins and causes an imbalance in amniotic fluid, also a possibly fatal condition.

30% of mono-mono twins do not survive.

“The cord entanglement was so bad it looked like Celtic knots,” Michaela said. “I was going to the doctor every single day, with every appointment being an ultrasound appointment.”

Elijah had recently transferred to a new administrative position at Fleet Readiness Center Southeast in Jacksonville, Fla., and was initially concerned about how the stress of Michaela’s high-risk pregnancy would affect his work.

“But the assistant officer in charge pulled me aside and said, ‘Hey, Dominguez, I know that you’re new here … but we’re here for you, anything you need,’” Elijah said.

Michaela’s doctors already planned to deliver the twin girls by 34 weeks, so when they began to develop twin-twin transfusion syndrome at 32 weeks, Michaela had a scheduled cesarean section. Both twins spent 38 days in the NICU.

“They had a lot of growing to do,” said Michaela.

But now 10 months old, the twins are thriving, despite doctors warning Michaela and Elijah they would likely have developmental issues. “They’re crawling!” she said. “They’re pulling up on things!”

“They’re babbling,” Elijah added with a laugh.

“They’re doing everything they’re supposed to do,” said Michaela. “We got super lucky.”

Being in the Navy added to their luck from a financial perspective as well. The medical expenses would have been astronomical — almost $250,000 before insurance. But TRICARE coverage knocked the cost down to approximately $300 per twin.

Now living in San Antonio where Elijah is a Navy recruiter, the Dominguez family of five is healthy, happy and grateful for the support they received at Fleet Readiness Center Southeast.

“They were always checking up on both of us,” Michaela said. “There was never a moment where I felt bad about all these doctor appointments. They always made it a point to make all of us comfortable.”",https://militaryfamilies.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Photo-1-scaled.jpeg,N,0.0,2025-10-01 11:56:55.451644

Music is a powerful tool and can have a major impact on brain function. Music therapy can help children with autism improve connections in their brain and it is a great complementary intervention that works well in conjunction with other therapies like occupational or physical.

Music therapy and learning to play an instrument are not the same things. And while they may have some overlapping benefits, the overall goals and techniques used are not the same.

If you are looking to build your child’s vocal skills or have them learn to play an instrument you would need to find a musical instructor, not a music therapist.

He and Trump repeatedly criticized the former Biden administration’s military policies and prioritization of diversity and inclusion efforts.
In another memo, Hegseth directs department watchdogs to use artificial intelligence as they seek to “expedite” oversight investigations.
Notably, in their remarks on Tuesday, both Hegseth and Trump underscored a need for immediate actions without specifying exact timelines for the initiatives.
During his 72-minute speech, the president also suggested that Hegseth “will soon be announcing major reforms to streamline military acquisitions and expedite” foreign military sales.","The Trump administration’s sweeping U.S. military shakeup is expected to gain momentum in the months to come — with more leadership changes, major acquisition updates and possible personnel cuts in the Pentagon’s pipeline, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suggested during an unusual gathering of military brass Tuesday.

At the “key leaders all-call” meeting with hundreds of top generals and admirals summoned from around the world at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Hegseth and President Donald Trump unveiled a broad docket of new and forthcoming directives meant to reflect their overarching vision for “woke”-ending reforms.

“We will not be politically correct when it comes to defending American freedom. We will be a fighting and winning machine. We want to fight, we want to win, and we want to fight as little as possible,” Trump said.

Theories swirled about the intent behind this mass gathering after Hegseth hastily ordered it last week.

In the portion that was publicly livestreamed, Hegseth outlined his plans for policy shifts — via 10 directives — around physical fitness and grooming standards, mandatory training, oversight processes, records retention rules and more.

Details on implementation were sparse, but some of those moves include mandating all combat arms positions to use the “highest male standard” in their physical fitness requirements; overhauling the inspector general process; launching a new department-wide review of physical standards; and banning beards except for people with temporary waivers, among others.

He and Trump repeatedly criticized the former Biden administration’s military policies and prioritization of diversity and inclusion efforts.

“I have fired a number of senior officers since taking over — the previous chairman, other members of the Joint Chiefs, combatant commanders and other commanders,” Hegseth noted. “It’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create or even benefited from that culture.”

More than 60,000 civilians voluntarily left their jobs within the department so far this year, through the Trump administration’s Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority offerings and other options. And as Hegseth noted, in the last few months the administration fired top military leaders, including Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Charles “CQ” Brown, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti, U.S. Cyber Command commander Gen. Timothy Haugh, and Defense Intelligence Agency director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, among others.

“More leadership changes will be made — of that, I’m certain. Not because we want to, but because we must. Once again, this is life and death. The sooner we have the right people, the sooner we can advance the right policies. Personnel is policy,” Hegseth said on Tuesday.

“If the words I’m speaking today are making your heart sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” he told the crowd of senior officers.

Shortly after addressing the service members, the Pentagon chief signed several associated memorandums that outline the administration’s new proposals — including one that calls for a “cultural refresh” among the civilian workforce. In that issuance, Hegseth directed the department’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness “to immediately issue specific guidance” that will simultaneously encourage rewards for top performers and demystify the employee removal process. In another memo, Hegseth directs department watchdogs to use artificial intelligence as they seek to “expedite” oversight investigations.

Notably, in their remarks on Tuesday, both Hegseth and Trump underscored a need for immediate actions without specifying exact timelines for the initiatives.

“Enemies gather, threats grow. There is no time for games. We must be prepared. If we’re going to prevent and avoid war, we must prepare now. We are the ‘strength’ part of ‘peace through strength,’ and either we’re ready to win or we are not,” Hegseth said. “You see, this urgent moment, of course, requires more troops, more munitions, more drones, more Patriots, more submarines, more B-21 bombers. It requires more innovation, more AI in everything and, ahead of the curve, more cyber effects, more counter-UAS, more space, more speed.”

The secretary emphasized that the “War Department is tackling and prioritizing all of these things.” On that, Hegseth said he’ll give a speech next month “that will showcase the speed innovation and generational acquisition reforms we are undertaking urgently, and likewise, the nature of the threats we face in our hemisphere and in deterring China.”

Officially changing the name of the Department of Defense requires an act of Congress, but earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order rebranding DOD as the Department of War.

During his 72-minute speech, the president also suggested that Hegseth “will soon be announcing major reforms to streamline military acquisitions and expedite” foreign military sales.

“Together over the next few years, we’re going to make our military stronger, tougher, faster, fiercer and more powerful than it has ever been before,” Trump told the audience.",https://defensescoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2025/09/Hegseth.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-30 18:56:28.852396

Those experiencing financial difficulties should contact their chain of command, who can provide more information on the financial aid organizations below.

Compensation:

The Military Leaders Economic Security Toolkit, located on the Military OneSource website, offers information and support. The site is updated regularly to reflect challenges and policy changes related to economic security.

Unemployment Benefits:

Furloughed employees are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits, but excepted employees working on a full-time basis are generally not eligible. Employees who wish to file should do so with the Unemployment Office for the state where the employee worked (i.e., last official duty station prior to furlough). Please be advised that when employees receive retroactive pay they will be required to pay back any unemployment benefits received in accordance with State law. For more information, see OPM guidance and the U.S. Department of Labor’s Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees.

Personal Financial Readiness:

The Military and Family Readiness Center personal financial readiness program sustains and improves financial literacy and readiness by offering information, education, training and free personal financial counseling to Airmen, Guardians and their families. The DAF has also increased the number of Personal Financial Managers available to assist and enhance financial readiness and money management skills for members and their families.

The Air Force Aid Society continues to support emergent needs such as basic living expenses (e.g., food, rent/mortgage, utilities), vehicle expenses (e.g., payments, repairs, insurance) and childcare costs. Airmen and Guardians can submit requests through local Military and Family Readiness Centers and Airman and Family Readiness Centers.

If Airmen, Guardians or their families are not near an aid organization, they may seek financial assistance from the Red Cross.

Several banking institutions, such as USAA, Navy Federal Credit Union and Marine Federal Credit Union, have been known to advance military pay to their customers during government shutdowns. Contact your bank to inquire about their policies for situations like these.

Food Insecurity:

First sergeants and Military and Family Readiness Centers assist Airmen, Guardians and their families in need of food security-related grants and loans with referrals to programs such as U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Federal Subsistence Supplemental Allowance program and the Air Force Aid Society.

The FY22 National Defense Authorization Act established a Basic Needs Allowance. The BNA Program provides supplemental income for military members and dependents whose gross household income falls below 200% of federal poverty guidelines.

TRICARE:

In response to the ongoing possibility of a government shutdown, the Defense Health Agency has authorized its TRICARE contractors to continue delivering health care to the 9.4 million beneficiaries of TRICARE. TRICARE beneficiaries seeking medical care from private providers should feel no significant effects. Care at military hospitals and clinics would remain largely unaffected. The TRICARE website includes current information about the impact of the shutdown on TRICARE health plans and military hospitals and clinics.

Overseas and Remote Commissaries:

Check status of local commissaries to determine the status of your local store. During a shutdown some non-appropriated fund services may continue to operate. Check with your local installation’s website to determine which services will remain open in your area. If able, plan ahead and minimize its impact on day-to-day routine.

“Government shutdowns are bad for national security and bad for Hampton Roads. That’s why I voted to keep the government open. The responsible, short-term measure House Republicans passed is designed to keep the government running while negotiations continue on year-long spending bills. Unfortunately, Democrats are demanding an additional $1.5 trillion in spending in exchange for just 30 days of government funding. This is unacceptable.

I firmly believe we must keep the government operational and working for Virginia’s Second District and our country while we work to resolve the broader spending issues. A government shutdown will disrupt critical programs that protect our national security, withhold pay from hardworking federal employees, and delay the ability of government agencies to serve the American people. House Republicans voted for clean CRs 13 times under President Biden. It’s time for Democrats to do the same—and to stop playing politics.

While this CR is only a short-term solution, it allows the full-year appropriations process to move forward and ensures federal agencies can continue serving our constituents without disruption. This spending bill is the most responsible and commonsense solution available to preserve this historically bipartisan process.

To ensure our servicemembers aren’t caught in the middle of this, I introduced the Pay Our Troops Act. This critical piece of legislation is designed to guarantee that our military personnel, including our Coast Guard, will continue to receive their paychecks during a shutdown, and I am hopeful it will be voted on soon.

Rohan Kulkarni, executive research leader for business consultancy HFS Research, told Healthcare Brew Omnicare’s bankruptcy filing didn’t come as a surprise given the size of the penalties the company was ordered to pay.
The bankruptcy likely won’t do much financial damage to CVS, Kulkarni said, as Omnicare makes up only a small portion of the overall company.
In its bankruptcy petition, Omnicare listed assets of between $100 million to $500 million and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.
Omnicare’s bankruptcy comes after a slew of changes to the retail pharmacy market, including competitor Walgreens selling to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in August.","“Bankruptcy” is becoming an all-too-familiar word in the pharmacy world.

CVS subsidiary Omnicare, which provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 22. The move comes a couple months after a judge ordered Omnicare to pay roughly $949 million in penalties for allegedly overcharging Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare (the federal insurer for the military) for prescription drugs.

It also comes a few months after pharmacy chain Rite Aid filed its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition.

David Azzolina, Omnicare’s president, said in a press release announcing the bankruptcy filing that the penalty was “extreme” and potentially “unconstitutional.”

“Omnicare has been engaged in a civil lawsuit alleging technical violations of pharmacy law based on practices the government knew about and approved,” Azzolina said. “There were no allegations of harm to any Omnicare patients nor did the government allege that any patient got anything other than the medicine they needed when they needed it.”

Diving deeper. Rohan Kulkarni, executive research leader for business consultancy HFS Research, told Healthcare Brew Omnicare’s bankruptcy filing didn’t come as a surprise given the size of the penalties the company was ordered to pay.

The bankruptcy likely won’t do much financial damage to CVS, Kulkarni said, as Omnicare makes up only a small portion of the overall company. CVS doesn’t report financial results for Omnicare separately from its other subsidiaries, so the exact percentage is unclear, but based on the market’s reactions to both the lawsuit judgement and the bankruptcy news, Kulkarni estimated Omnicare makes up 3% to 4% of CVS’s total business.

After the judgement was announced, the stock dipped less than 1%, and after the bankruptcy news, the stock increased by about 1%.

However, the move could result in some reputational damage for the company, Kulkarni added.

“Over a period of time, CVS’s decision-making [and] CVS’s performance have indicated that they’re probably not really good at managing and operating a vertically integrated healthcare enterprise,” he said. “We’ve seen their challenges with Aetna. We’ve seen their challenges with some of their other lines of businesses.”

And while CVS executives said in the press release they’re considering selling Omnicare, Kulkarni said they’ll likely only do so when “the dust is settled” since the company’s value would be too low immediately following the bankruptcy news.

Kulkarni also said he expects some layoffs at Omnicare, “or some form of business process reengineering, some leadership shown the door.”

A look at the finances. In its bankruptcy petition, Omnicare listed assets of between $100 million to $500 million and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.

Omnicare executives said in the release that the company has secured $110 million to fund its operations through the bankruptcy process.

“Omnicare remains fully focused on meeting the pharmacy needs of its customers and long-term care residents,” the release stated.

Slavin told Healthcare Brew the company has no additional comment beyond the press release.

Omnicare’s bankruptcy comes after a slew of changes to the retail pharmacy market, including competitor Walgreens selling to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in August.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/9f16e326d7a0ef0914d972a9bd5cac77aac66368-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,0.0,2025-09-30 16:56:24.892453

Many people wear a pink ribbon or pink clothes to raise breast cancer awareness. Let’s put another spin on bringing awareness to breast cancer prevention — eat pink! Let's explore how eating colorful, antioxidant-rich foods can support breast cancer prevention.

We're talking about foods rich in pink, red, and purple colors that are high in antioxidants, fiber, and phytonutrients — not cotton candy or bubble gum.

There is no sure way to prevent breast cancer. Many factors influence potential breast cancer risk over a lifetime. Some factors, such as getting older and family history, are things women can’t change. But we can lower the risk of breast cancer by taking care of our health.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers several recommendations for women to reduce their breast cancer risk:

Maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, and breastfeeding can help reduce the risk of breast cancer.

Limiting alcohol consumption and being aware of the risks associated with hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives are also important.

Understanding family history and discussing risk factors with a health care provider are crucial for determining appropriate breast cancer screening schedules.

Research on diet and prevention

Can diet specifically prevent breast cancer? No, but it is an important factor that we can control related to prevention. Healthy nutrition can make a difference in maintaining a healthy weight and decreasing the overall risk of cancer.

A meta-analysis of 48 research studies published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found no specific link for healthy eating styles to prevent breast cancer. However, the study found a diet high in vegetables, citrus fruit, mushrooms, and low-fat, calcium-rich dairy products was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer. A diet higher in meat, red or processed meats, simple sugars, and eggs seems to be associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.

Post-diagnosis survival benefits

A separate study published in the scientific journal Nutrients found a diet pattern of high fiber, vegetables, fruit, nuts and olive oil might improve survival after diagnosis of breast cancer. This study found women can lower their breast cancer risk by living a healthy life, managing their weight, and eating well. When people don't move much, and eat too many unhealthy foods, their lifestyle often leads to obesity. Being obese can cause inflammation in body tissues, making it easier for breast cancer to develop and spread. This research study found obesity increases the risk of breast cancer after menopause and is also linked to the cancer’s return and a higher chance of death.

Power foods for prevention

Changing our diet is one of the factors we have control over; it can positively affect health and reduce the risk of cancer. Whether you're shopping at the commissary, eating at the dining facility, or meal prepping for the week, these colorful foods can easily fit into your busy military life.

Here’s a short list of foods that support “eat pink for breast cancer prevention” and the ways they can help prevent cancer:

Berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries): Packed with antioxidants and vitamins

Beets: Contain nitrates that may improve blood flow and lower blood pressure

Pomegranates: Rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds

Red/purple grapes: Contain resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant

Acai berries: Packed with antioxidants, available as a frozen packet, mixed with other fruit

Purple cabbage: A cruciferous vegetable with potential cancer-fighting properties

Red onions: Another source of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds

Pink grapefruit: Contains lycopene and other beneficial compounds; check for interactions with medications

Salmon: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which may have protective health effects

Lentils (pink/red varieties): Good source of fiber and protein

Pink power plates

Engage friends and family with pink power plates by adding a splash of color to your meals. Swap out regular baked potatoes or french fries by baking or roasting purple sweet potatoes. Roasted, sliced beets are great additions to salads. Pomegranate seeds or berries can also be added to salads for color and variety. Sockeye salmon makes an easy, protein-rich entrée. Other ideas include making red cabbage slaw or a pink smoothie bowl with berries and dragon fruit. Eating the colors of the rainbow is a great way to get a variety of fruits and vegetables throughout the day!

Thinking pink is one way to help with overall health and wellness goals and breast cancer prevention. It is also important to prioritize screenings like mammograms, clinical breast exams, and, if applicable, genetic counseling for those at higher risk of breast cancer. TRICARE beneficiaries can find more information about breast cancer screenings and treatment options through the TRICARE website and the Defense Health Agency Virtual Education Center.

Talk to your primary care provider for more information about breast cancer prevention. For personalized nutrition advice, reach out to a registered dietitian at your military hospital or clinic or your local Armed Forces Wellness Center for assistance.
