A bariatric surgery revision is a procedure done to fix issues related to a previous weight-loss surgery.
Tricare will only cover weight-loss surgery if you meet certain requirements, such as: Age: You must be at least 18 years old to get coverage.
Tricare may also cover surgery revision if your first procedure caused complications or didn’t lead to enough weight loss.
To get coverage for weight-loss surgery, start by talking to your primary care team.","Losing weight isn’t easy, and for some people, diet and exercise just aren’t enough. That’s where options like bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can help. These procedures change how the stomach and digestive system work to help people lose weight. However, they can cost several thousand dollars.

If you’re a Tricare beneficiary, you may have a number of options when it comes to weight management. Tricare helps cover certain weight-loss medications, such as Wegovy (semaglutide) and Zepbound (tirzepatide), if you meet certain requirements. And if you’re wondering whether Tricare covers weight-loss surgery, the answer is yes. But some procedures are excluded, and you must meet certain requirements.

Which weight-loss surgeries does Tricare cover?

Tricare covers several types of bariatric surgery. These procedures can be done through traditional, or open, surgery or a less invasive method called laparoscopy. But to qualify for coverage, you must meet certain requirements.

Weight-loss surgeries covered by Tricare include:

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB)

Gastroplasty

Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG)

Adjustable gastric banding

Sleeve gastrectomy

Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD)

Stand-alone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy

Your out-of-pocket costs for bariatric surgery will depend on your specific Tricare plan and whether you use in-network healthcare professionals.

Does TRICARE cover bariatric surgery revision?

Yes, Tricare covers bariatric surgery revision in certain situations. A bariatric surgery revision is a procedure done to fix issues related to a previous weight-loss surgery.

If you develop complications, like a blockage, from your original procedure, Tricare may cover a surgery revision. Tricare also covers adjustments to bands that leak or slip and can’t be fixed without another surgery.

Tricare may also cover a repeat surgery if your first procedure didn’t work well enough, but only under specific conditions. You must have failed to lose at least 50% of your excess weight or get within 10% of your ideal weight 2 years after surgery. But to qualify, you must have followed all the original requirements, including keeping up with your nutrition and exercise plans. The repeat procedure must also be on Tricare’s approved list of procedures.

What are Tricare’s coverage requirements for weight-loss surgery?

Tricare will only cover weight-loss surgery if you meet certain requirements, such as:

Age: You must be at least 18 years old to get coverage. If you’re under 18, you must provide medical proof that your bones have stopped growing.

Unsuccessful weight-loss attempts: You must show that you’ve tried nonsurgical treatments without success. Tricare doesn’t pay for weight-loss programs like WW (formerly known as Weight Watchers) or Jenny Craig. But participating in these programs can count as proof of previous weight-loss attempts if you’re also working with a healthcare professional. Taking weight-loss medications only, even under a healthcare professional’s care, doesn’t count.

Body mass index (BMI): You must have a BMI of 40 or higher. If your BMI is between 35 and 39.9, you must also have at least one serious obesity-related health condition, such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, or a heart problem.

Which weight-loss procedures does Tricare not cover?

Before you book an appointment with a healthcare professional, it’s good to know which weight-loss options Tricare won’t cover. Tricare won’t pay for office visits solely for obesity treatment. Nutrition and diet counseling are not covered either, even if they’re part of a weight-loss plan.

Certain nonsurgical procedures, like gastric balloon treatments, which involve a balloon being placed in the stomach to make a person feel full, are not covered. Gastric wrapping is also excluded. Open gastric banding, a traditional surgery that involves making a large incision and placing a band around the stomach, isn’t covered either. But Tricare does cover gastric banding done laparoscopically.

Tricare won’t cover any unlisted or experimental weight-loss procedures.

How can I get Tricare to cover weight-loss surgery?

If you have Tricare and are looking for help with weight loss, here’s five things you can do to get started:

Talk to your primary care team. Start by booking a visit with your primary care team. You can discuss your weight-related concerns and decide if a referral (depending on your Tricare coverage) to a bariatric surgeon makes sense. Make sure your care team is in your plan’s network to avoid surprise out-of-pocket costs.

Work with a bariatric surgeon. Generally, a bariatric surgeon will review your medical history, determine if you’re a good candidate for surgery, and discuss your options. They’ll gather documentation of your unsuccessful weight-loss attempts and proof that weight-loss surgery is medically necessary.

Complete any required evaluations. You may need to meet with a dietitian, mental health professional, or other specialists as part of the medical necessity documentation process. These evaluations help make sure surgery is the right choice for you.

Request prior authorization. Your surgeon’s office will submit paperwork to Tricare asking for prior authorization. This will include all supporting documents, like medical records, evaluation results, and a letter of medical necessity explaining why the surgery is needed. Having thorough documentation increases your chances of approval.

Wait for a decision. After your paperwork is submitted, Tricare will review your case. This process can take some time. If approved for coverage, your care team will help you schedule the surgery and walk you through the next steps. If your request is denied, your surgeon’s office can help you understand why and file an appeal, if needed.

Frequently asked questions

The bottom line

Tricare covers several weight-loss surgeries. These include gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and adjustable gastric banding. To qualify, you must meet certain requirements, like having documentation of unsuccessfully trying other weight-loss methods and a qualifying body mass index (BMI). Tricare may also cover surgery revision if your first procedure caused complications or didn’t lead to enough weight loss.

Tricare won’t cover certain procedures like gastric balloons or experimental surgeries. To get coverage for weight-loss surgery, start by talking to your primary care team.

He encouraged the audience to write down their leadership philosophies, use coaches, and take initiative by completing tasks early and with excellence.
Military health professionals need a broad skillset, acknowledged Woodson, which includes cross-cultural communication to address global and operational challenges.
“Developing a health care workforce relevant for the future is a complex, but essential enterprise undertaken,” Woodson stated.
“The theme was the future of military medicine: integrated, innovative, and ready.","The evolving transformation of health care and military medicine were the main focal points of plenary speeches given by Dr. Scott Steele, president of main campus at the Cleveland Clinic, Uniformed Services University President Dr. Jonathan Woodson, and Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara on the closing day of the 2025 Military Health System Conference in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 1.

Steele, a physician with experience in military and civilian health care, emphasized how the MHS can improve patient outcomes through regionalization, specialization, and collaboration.

During his talk, he reflected on his leadership journey, stressing the importance of embracing challenges, effective time management, and aligning professional and personal goals through work-life integration. He encouraged the audience to write down their leadership philosophies, use coaches, and take initiative by completing tasks early and with excellence.

Steele told the audience to “embrace the problems, feel those problems, learn from those problems—because you're going to need to rely on that kind of thought process of how you work through it in order to embrace the challenges that are going to happen in the future.”

Steele concluded by urging that military and civilian healthcare leaders to rethink traditional models, prioritize quality over volume, and remain committed to delivering the highest standards of care, regardless of setting.

Developing the Military Healthcare Workforce for the Future

Woodson emphasized that as the healthcare landscape goes through a rapid transformation, the MHS needs to develop a workforce capable of meeting emerging needs in his session titled, “Developing the Healthcare Workforce for the Future: A Focus on the Military Medical Workforce.”

He noted factors shaping the future of health care include demographic shifts, evolving public interest in healthcare careers, advancements in technology, and the transition toward value-based and community oriented care.

Military health professionals need a broad skillset, acknowledged Woodson, which includes cross-cultural communication to address global and operational challenges.

“We're in charge of our destiny, and it really is a promising future as long as we think differently and act differently going forward,” he said.

Woodson recommended investing in robust and adaptable training programs, leveraging technology, fostering a culture of collaboration, prioritizing recruitment and retention, adapting regulatory practices, and promoting research and innovation.

He said technological tools such as artificial intelligence show promise in optimizing workforce deployment, and AI applications, including virtual reality training and telehealth services—particularly for veterans—offer innovative solutions to enhance efficiency, education, and access to care.

“Developing a health care workforce relevant for the future is a complex, but essential enterprise undertaken,” Woodson stated. “The evolving healthcare landscape demands a proactive, adaptive, and collaborative approach that embraces technological advancement, fosters professionalism, and prioritizes the well-being of the workforce.”

“We need to recognize the essential nature of our mission,” he stressed. “It is a no-fail mission. The important message is that looking backward is not going to make us win in the future. We must redesign, develop a new mindset in how we are going to proceed forward … the health and readiness of our nation, both at home and abroad, is in your hands.”

MHS Conference Vital to ‘Grow as an Organization’

“I think based on the success of this week's MHS conference, it helps us to know this is an absolute must-have,” said Ferrara. “We’ve got to keep this going.”

“There was just an incredible opportunity to exchange ideas, to network, to meet other people, and really to grow as an organization, as a team,” he added.

Ferrara said the conference was “moving and inspiring, and helped bring us back to the center of what the nature of our mission is all about.”

He also noted the quality of breakout sessions at the conference, adding, “We had everything from workforce well-being, interoperability, operational medicine, modernization, and others.”

Ferrara closed by sharing his confidence in the MHS.

“The theme was the future of military medicine: integrated, innovative, and ready. I hope everybody is leaving here as excited and inspired as I am,” he said. “Every time I get to interact with the people that we have, the MHS, I know that we are in great shape.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2505/9014934/1000w_q95.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-05 16:56:22.245459

Related: Tricare Patients Fear Losing Preferred Health Care Providers Amid Contract Transition Story Continues","Patients who use Tricare Prime in the West Region will not need to get preauthorization for most specialty care from their Tricare contract manager until June 30, extending a previous deadline, the Defense Health Agency announced last week.

Defense officials said April 30 that they have extended the referral approval waiver through the end of June to ensure that patients continue having access to care following the change in Tricare contract managers Jan. 1.

The extension marks the second time that DHA has suspended the requirement for Tricare patients to get preauthorization for specialty care from TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the region's contract manager, as a result of problems patients have had getting appointments and care.

The decision to extend the approval waiver was made following an assessment of the ""current state of referrals,"" according to Richard Hart, the division chief for health plan design at the Defense Health Agency.

""This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care,"" Hart said in a statement.

Since the new Tricare contract went into effect on Jan. 1, hundreds of family members and providers have reported problems with claims processing, appointments, access to care and payments.

Kimberly Yazell, a patient in Missouri, is among the dozens who have written to Military.com about delays in care and spending hours on the phone trying to reach TriWest to solve problems accessing treatment.

Yazell said a planned surgery was delayed because providers were dropped from the network following the TriWest changeover and she was told she had to start the approval process over to get care.

""It's all very disorganized,"" Yazell said. ""My doctor's office randomly got an authorization, so I thought, ‘OK, this is positive. I'm going to have my surgery’ ... but my primary-care doctor is no longer in-network, so what happens after?""

Dozens of providers also reported delays in payments or not receiving reimbursement for claims.

Candice Mullendore, an occupational therapist in Papillion, Nebraska, said her office has had nearly 3,000 appointments for Tricare patients since the beginning of the year but has experienced significant issues with collecting the $900,000 owed to her providers.

""Military families deserve uninterrupted access to critical health care services, and providers cannot sustain operations under these conditions indefinitely,"" Mullendore said in an email.

The approval extension is just one of several deadline extensions granted to Tricare beneficiaries in the West Region since the start of the new contract. The Defense Health Agency has repeatedly extended the deadline for patients to update their payment information to TriWest and also to receive care from a non-network provider without incurring point-of-service fees.

According to the Defense Health Agency, under the extension, patients still must go to their primary-care manager to receive a referral for specialty care, even if their primary-care provider is not in TriWest's network.

As part of the announcement on the preauthorization waiver extension, the Defense Department also said it has extended the point-of-service fee waiver for non-network providers until Sept. 30.

The waiver extension does not apply to certain types of care or patients at some military hospitals and clinics, according to the Defense Health Agency.

The waiver does not apply to inpatient care; applied behavior analysis or other services under Tricare's Autism Care Demonstration; laboratory developed tests; or service under the Extended Care Health Option program.

It also does not apply to beneficiaries whose primary-care managers are located at the following military treatment facilities in:

California: Army Health Clinic Presidio of Monterey; Naval Health Clinic Lemoore; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms; and Naval Medical Center San Diego.

Colorado: Air Force Academy; Buckley Space Force Base; Evans Army Community Hospital, Fort Carson; Peterson Space Force Base; and Schriever Space Force Base.

Nebraska: Offutt Air Force Base.

Nevada: Nellis Air Force Base.

Texas: Brooke Army Medical Center.

Washington: Madigan Army Medical Center, Naval Hospital Bremerton; and Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor.

Defense Health Agency officials reminded patients that their specialty-care provider must be a Tricare authorized provider.

Patients can ask the providers directly whether they are authorized for Tricare, according to the Defense Department.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates.

Gilead to Pay $202 Million to Settle DOJ Claims Over Speaker Program Kickbacks

Gilead Sciences, Inc. has agreed to pay $202 million to resolve allegations brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) that it violated the False Claims Act (FCA) and Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) by using sham speaker programs to induce health care providers to prescribe its human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medications. The settlement, announced by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, resolves claims that from 2011 to 2017, Gilead paid health care professionals to attend and speak at events that were often more than social gatherings, with little or no educational content. The government alleged that these events, frequently held at high-end restaurants and venues, were used to reward high-prescribing physicians, and encourage further prescriptions of Gilead’s HIV drugs, including Truvada, Descovy, and Biktarvy.

According to the DOJ, Gilead’s speaker programs were a vehicle for providing improper remuneration, in violation of the AKS, and resulted in the submission of false claims to federal health care programs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. The resolution underscores the DOJ’s continued scrutiny of speaker programs, particularly when meals, entertainment, or honoraria are untethered from substantive scientific exchange.

Jury Renders $136 Million Verdict Against Omnicare and CVS Health for FCA Violations

A federal jury, in the Southern District of New York, returned a verdict against Omnicare, Inc. and its parent company, CVS Health Corporation, finding them liable for violations of the FCA. Following a four-week trial, the jury found that the nation’s “largest long-term care pharmacy,” Omnicare, fraudulently billed Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE for more than three million false claims — equivalent to $135,592,814 in damages. The alleged misconduct related to Omnicare “dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions’ to disabled and elderly people in assisted and long-term care facilities.” The government alleged that Omnicare “rolled over” prescriptions — automatically refilling medications at set intervals — long after prescribers had stopped treating certain patients or after prescriptions had expired, resulting in thousands of claims to Medicare Part D and Medicaid for drugs that lacked a lawful basis. The jury also found CVS Health Corporation liable for contributing to the submission of these false claims.

Pursuant to the FCA, the government is entitled to three times the assessed damages plus statutory penalties, amounting to over $400 million. According to the DOJ, the verdict is “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case.”

DOJ Files Sweeping Complaint Alleging FCA and AKS Violations Against Nations’ Largest Health Insurance Companies

On May 1, the United States filed a complaint against the nation’s largest health insurance companies, including Aetna Inc. and affiliates, Elevance Health, Inc., and Humana Inc., as well as three insurance broker organizations, namely eHealth, Inc., GoHealth, Inc., and SelectQuote Inc. The 213-page complaint was filed in the District of Massachusetts and alleges a far-reaching scheme where the insurers funneled “hundreds of millions of dollars” of off-book payments to the broker-defendants. The DOJ claims that the illegal kickbacks were disguised as “marketing,” “co-op,” or “sponsorship” payments, and were meant to induce the broker-defendants to steer beneficiaries toward the paying insurer’s Part C Medicare Advantage plan, “box out” competitors, and reduce enrollment of younger Medicare patients with disabilities. The complaint seeks treble damages under the FCA and civil penalties for each false or fraudulent claim.

Second Circuit Affirms Health Clinic Manager’s Reindictment and Sentence in Kickback and Tax Fraud Case

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment in the case of United States v. Aleksandr Pikus, upholding his 108-month sentence for conspiracy to receive and pay health care kickbacks and conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Pikus, who was originally indicted in 2016 for his role in a multi-million-dollar health care fraud and kickback scheme involving Medicare and Medicaid, argued on appeal that the charges should have been dismissed with prejudice due to violations of the Speedy Trial Act. The Second Circuit, however, found no abuse of discretion in the district court’s decision to dismiss the original indictment without prejudice, and allow the government to reindict Pikus on the same charges.

The court emphasized the seriousness of the offenses, which involved fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid and the “concealment of illegal kickbacks through shell companies and false tax returns.” The appellate court also noted that, while there were procedural delays and administrative failures, there was no evidence of “bad faith or a pattern of neglect” sufficient to warrant dismissal with prejudice.

The following day, the Associated Press cited an internal memo that indicates that 80,000 jobs - roughly 15% of the VA’s workforce - are slated for elimination. More than 25% of VA employees are veterans.

On March 6, VA Secretary Doug Collins asserted that the plan is a “pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care, benefits, and services to veterans.” He promised to “accomplish this without making cuts to health care or benefits to veterans and VA beneficiaries.” His remarks were published in The Hill.

Recently, Russell Lernie and Suzanne Gordon, two senior policy analysts with the nonpartisan Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute, disputed Collins’ depiction of VA healthcare. “That's just not true,” they wrote in Military.com. “VHA [Veterans Health Administration]

care is, on average, less costly, less wasteful and of higher quality and value than private-sector alternatives. Strengthening -- not decimating -- in-house VHA staffing and infrastructure represents the more fiscally responsible use of taxpayer dollars. It's also what the majority of the 9 million veterans it serves want.”

As I pondered the potential impact of the VA’s plan, I recalled how in Trump’s first term, cutbacks and outsourcing hurt our military health system. Is the VA next?

A Cautionary Tale

During the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, military medicine devised and swiftly deployed a stunning series of innovations that cut the death rate from severe battlefield wounds in half, to the lowest level in the history of warfare. It is one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of American Medicine.

Unfortunately, when the conflicts wound down, this success did not protect the MHS.

Critics alleged that stateside military treatment facilities (MTFs) cost too much, deliver care of uneven quality, and do not attract enough complex cases to maintain the skills of military doctors and nurses between deployments. They urged the Department of Defense (DoD) to outsource more care to the private sector. Three months after Trump took office in 2017, I published a commentary in Health Affairs Forefront that cited strong evidence of the MHS’s quality, efficiency and value. Instead of rethinking their assumptions, DoD advocates of outsourcing plowed ahead.

Shortly thereafter, the Pentagon directed military retirees and the families of servicemembers, two large groups of beneficiaries who had long valued care in the MHS, to go elsewhere for treatment. As visits and admissions to military treatment facilities declined, the DoD downsized or closed a number of military clinics and hospitals and reduced military health manpower by thousands of positions. As purchased care costs climbed, additional money was pulled from military hospitals and staff. This left once-busy MTFs like Walter Reed National Military Medical Center half empty and understaffed.

As the impact of outsourcing mounted, the Joint Chiefs of Staff worried that it was degrading the MHS’s ability to meet its wartime mission. In a Dec 6, 2023 memo to DoD leadership entitled, “Stabilizing and Improving the Military Health System,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks ordered a change in course. “Realignment of medical personnel, coupled with a challenging health care economy and ambitious private sector care capacity assumptions, led to chronically understaffed [hospitals and clinics] that at times cannot deliver timely care to beneficiaries or ensure sufficient workload to maintain and sustain clinical skills"" She wrote. ""As a result, beneficiaries are routinely referred to the private sector for services that [the MHS] should be able to deliver, with the Military Departments increasingly turning to the private sector for clinical skills sustainment opportunities for uniformed medical personnel. This has resulted in increasing overall health care costs for the Department and missing readiness opportunities for the Force.”

To rebuild the MHS, DEPSEC Hicks directed that actions be taken to “reattract beneficiaries” to MTFs and increase staffing to “…support the National Defense Strategy, increase clinical readiness, mitigate risks to [military] requirements, and reduce long-term cost growth in private sector care.” Unfortunately, when patients are turned away, it is difficult to win them back from doctors who are incentivized to retain them.

In Light Of The DoD’s Experience, Why Would The VA Head Down The Same Path?

VA healthcare has formidable strengths. Thirteen years ago, I wrote: “Early on, it embraced many of the attributes that characterize our nation’s top-performing private healthcare systems: It was an early adopter of an interoperable electronic health record; it has strong affiliations with the nation's top medical schools; it regularly measures and applies quality data, and it has a salaried medical staff that is well-aligned with the agency's mission.”

The VA generally delivers care that is safer and less costly than private-sector healthcare. That’s because private-sector doctors tend to over-test and over-treat to boost clinical revenue. In their commentary, Lernie and Hall observed that the “The private sector performs more ‘guideline discordant,’ ‘questionable’ and ‘low-value’ tests than the VHA, which then lead to more unnecessary services downstream, higher health-care costs and potential harm to the patient.” This happens, they explained, because “With lax oversight, private-sector, fee-for-service incentives drive overtreatment and profit-seeking that isn’t permitted in the VHA.”

Pushing more vets into private-sector care, which already costs the VA $36 billion per year, doesn’t make much sense. What supporters of outsourcing government healthcare fail to understand is that private healthcare in the U.S. is not a “system,” it’s a thicket. Navigating it is a challenge, even for well-connected physicians seeking care for themselves or their families. In recent years, many independent practices have been bought by venture capitalists whose focus is on maximizing profits, not high-quality care.

Cutbacks And Outsoucing Won’t Help Veterans Or the VA

I’m sure Secretary Collins wants the best for veterans. At the Tucson VA last week, he described the planned 15% reduction as a “goal, not a guarantee,"" according to the Arizona Daily Star. Hopefully, veterans advocacy groups and their allies in Congress can convince the Trump administration to rethink its plans. It will not only help vets—a powerful constituency that holds a special place in the hearts of most Americans—it will help American healthcare. Each year, large numbers of medical and nursing students, resident physicians and other health professionals-in-training get valuable clinical training in VA Medical Centers.

The VA’s motto is ""To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors.’’ May it always be so.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/681639744fae6e9cd152a748/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,0.0,2025-05-05 12:56:37.789546

Each year, the team accounts for anomalies that may arise during the procurement season to meet the program deadline, said Alexander Quiñones, Pharmaceutical Manufacturer/Distributor division chief.

Working closely with the DLA Distribution Center in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, more than 3 million doses of the vaccine were distributed to military members globally.

This Department of Defense flu vaccine program oversees the precise support needed for the Defense Health Agency to supply enough vaccine dosages to protect the health of warfighters and DOD beneficiaries.

“This season’s program included three separate contracts totaling $42.4 million,” Quiñones said, “these contracts also resulted in 3.09 million flu vaccine doses, including 31,030 additional doses under contract to date.”

The Medical and Distribution team swiftly adapts to any last-minute changes that may arise throughout the season.

“Due to logistical timing, the [military] services need to submit their flu vaccine requirements before the season starts,” said Yu Chen, pharmaceutical manufacturer/distributor division contracting officer. “Therefore, real-time adjustments are needed for additional doses as more orders come in. However, material planners, [tailored vendor logistics specialists], cold chain team and contracting team work very closely together toward success and keeping the warfighter protected from the flu.”

This year, the team also overcame distribution issues posed by severe weather conditions across the United States.

“No matter what obstacles are thrown at us, our distribution plan accounts for them,” said Dana Dallas, Medical Cold Chain Program manager. “For example, this season we needed to work around distribution obstacles caused by snowstorms and hurricanes. We were still able to get on top of them, pivot and help DHA meet all metrics and requirements for the flu program.”

Throughout the season, the team is regularly in touch with several stakeholders, including vendors and partner government agencies.

“Our team continuously monitors communications with stakeholders to ensure battle rhythm and precise support,” Quiñones said.

,,2025-05-05 11:05:48+00:00,www.army.mil,It's time to get 'Tick Smart' about Lyme disease | Article - Army.mil,Not Available,,,,,https://www.army.mil/article/285207/its_time_to_get_tick_smart_about_lyme_disease,"May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, and spring is one of the most important times of year to become “tick smart” by learning about the risks ticks pose and how to avoid tick bites.
Lyme disease Lyme disease is by far the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting approximately 476,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Of course, Lyme disease isn’t the only tick-borne disease out there – not even the only one you need to worry about from a blacklegged tick bite.
Lyme disease is endemic to the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and upper midwestern U.S., where the blacklegged tick is abundant.
The more time you spend outside in tick habitat, the greater your risk of a tick bite and potentially developing a tick-borne disease.","As winter’s chill dissipates and spring’s rain gives way to summer’s warmth, we shed our layers and venture outdoors to enjoy the weather. Spending time outside is a known mood booster, and the increased physical activity of outdoor recreation is good for overall health and wellness. However, hidden dangers can lurk among the blossoms – ticks come out of hiding in the springtime too.

May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, and spring is one of the most important times of year to become “tick smart” by learning about the risks ticks pose and how to avoid tick bites. Ticks are tiny and can be hard to notice — even after they bite — because of chemicals in their saliva that make them invisible to our body’s defenses. And while not every tick is infected with a disease-causing pathogen, one unlucky bite can infect a person with one or even multiple disease agents.

Lyme disease

Lyme disease is by far the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting approximately 476,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The ticks that transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are called blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks, and their tiny nymphs (smaller than a sesame seed) come out in force during May. More than 25% of blacklegged ticks can be infected with the Lyme pathogen.

Blacklegged ticks can be hard to find and remove quickly because of their small size. During the warmer season, we tend to wear fewer clothes, making us more susceptible to bites and subsequent infections. It generally takes around 48 hours for a tick to transmit the Lyme disease pathogen, so time is of the essence once one of these bloodsuckers latches on.

For the military community, one weapon in the fight against ticks and Lyme disease is a program known as MilTICK, which stands for the Military Tick Identification/Infection Confirmation Kit program. Service members and their families, as well as retirees, civilians, contractors and others can submit human-biting ticks to the MilTICK program for free and receive an emailed report describing the tick species, how long the tick was attached, and whether or not the tick tested positive for any pathogens.

This program has been in place since 1995 and is run by the Defense Health Agency - Public Health at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Most military clinics have tick kits on site, and individuals or clinics can request tick kits by reaching out to the MilTICK program staff. The kits never expire and are great to have on hand, just in case a tick bite occurs.

The MilTICK program uses the data generated to better understand tick-borne disease risks to the military community. In 2024, over 3,000 ticks were tested, and 167 ticks were found positive for one or more human pathogens. It might come as no surprise that May is the month where the most Lyme disease agent is detected, although MilTICK has found the Lyme agent in human-biting ticks submitted during every month of the year. The peaks correspond to the spring and fall, when the numbers of nymph and adult ticks peak, respectively.

Of course, Lyme disease isn’t the only tick-borne disease out there – not even the only one you need to worry about from a blacklegged tick bite. Blacklegged ticks also transmit a relapsing fever illness, a bacterial disease called anaplasmosis, a parasitic disease similar to malaria called babesiosis, and Powassan virus, which can cause encephalitis and even death. MilTICK tests for all of these, and fortunately, these pathogens are much rarer than the Lyme disease pathogen – for example, only one confirmed positive tick for Powassan virus has been found since MilTICK started testing for it in 2020.

Other tick species become active in the springtime too, especially the human-biting lone star tick and the American dog tick. Lone star ticks make up the bulk of ticks received by MilTICK since they are the most common tick in the southeastern U.S., where many military installations are located. Lone star ticks can transmit a disease called ehrlichiosis and have also been associated with a red meat allergy known as alpha gal syndrome.

Your risk of tick-borne disease depends on where you live and how you spend your time. Lyme disease is endemic to the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and upper midwestern U.S., where the blacklegged tick is abundant. Move further south and you are in lone star tick country, where your risk of ehrlichiosis is much higher than your risk of Lyme disease. To learn more about the risks at your installation, you can visit the CAC-enabled MilTICK data dashboard and see exactly what kinds of ticks are being submitted from the area where you live.

The more time you spend outside in tick habitat, the greater your risk of a tick bite and potentially developing a tick-borne disease. Treating clothes with tick-killing sprays such as permethrin, using bug spray on exposed skin, and covering up with long pants and socks even during warmer months will all help prevent tick bites. If you do get bitten, sending the tick for testing through MilTICK can help provide peace of mind if the tick is negative. If the tick is positive, the MilTICK report can help your doctor diagnose and treat any symptoms that may develop.

Taking walks in the woods, playing sports outside with friends, and stopping to smell the flowers are all wonderful ways to enjoy the outdoors this May. Staying aware and being tick smart can help keep you safe all year.

Select vs prime is more of a your preference thing. Network and coverage is all the same. It just ultimately cost you less on Prime with PCM/managed care vs Select where you can pretty much do what you want with covered items without dealing with a PCM.

Prime vs USFHP...this comes down to which has the better network in the area you live, or if establishments you prefer to use are in one network but not the other. Otherwise, coverages, costs, etc are the same.

Personally as AD retired I am on Prime. I'm about 200mi from the nearest MTF so everything is 100% regular local stuff, PCM and all, and nothing military related. It's worked out great.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.
These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

Visit TRICARE West Region Transition.","Do you live in the West Region? Do you have TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has extended the West Region referral approval waiver through June 30. TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest Healthcare Alliance to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care.”

However, certain military hospitals and clinics have returned to normal referral processing. This phased approach is enabling TriWest to improve its referral processing system. If your PCM is located at one these facilities, TriWest will process your referral. Keep reading to learn more.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

In the mail within 3-5 days

To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

Inpatient care

Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

Laboratory developed tests

Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

In conclusion, Amwell’s earnings call reflected a positive sentiment with strong software revenue growth and improved financial metrics.","American Well Corporation ((AMWL)) has held its Q1 earnings call. Read on for the main highlights of the call.

During the recent earnings call, American Well Corporation, also known as Amwell, conveyed a generally positive sentiment despite some challenges. The company reported strong software revenue growth and an improved adjusted EBITDA, driven by strategic deployments such as the Military Health System. While there were some hurdles like delayed deployments and lower visit volumes, the overall outlook remains optimistic with promising prospects for future growth and positive cash flow.

Strong Software Revenue Growth

Amwell’s software revenue experienced a significant increase, growing over 30% from the first quarter of the previous year. This growth was largely attributed to strategic client deployments, including the implementation of the Military Health System, which has been a key driver of this success.

Improved Adjusted EBITDA

The company reported an improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth consecutive quarter. The loss narrowed to $12.2 million, a substantial improvement from the $45.6 million loss reported in the first quarter of 2024, showcasing the company’s efforts in enhancing its financial performance.

Partnership with Military Health System

Amwell’s platform is now operational for scheduled visits across the global Military Health System. This deployment has been met with high satisfaction rates from both patients and providers, exceeding 90%, highlighting the effectiveness and acceptance of Amwell’s solutions.

Positive Cash Flow Prospects

The company is on a path to achieving positive cash flow from operations by 2026. This goal is supported by cost reduction measures and an improved revenue mix, which are expected to drive financial stability and growth.

Delayed Deployment Due to Leadership Transition

The deployment of automated and Digital Behavioral Health programs has been delayed to the third quarter, pending final confirmation from the new Director of the Defense Health Agency. This leadership transition has temporarily impacted the company’s deployment timeline.

Lower Visit Volumes

Amwell completed approximately 1.3 million visits in the first quarter, marking a 23% decrease from the previous year. This decline is attributed to a normalization in visit volumes following the pandemic-induced surge.

Economic Uncertainty and Tariff Concerns

The company is facing challenges related to macroeconomic factors, including tariffs and economic uncertainty. These issues are affecting sales timelines as health systems reassess their IT budgets, adding a layer of complexity to Amwell’s sales strategy.

Forward-Looking Guidance

In its forward-looking guidance, Amwell provided several key metrics and expectations. The company reported total revenue of $66.8 million for the quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase, with software revenue growing by 30%. Amwell aims to achieve positive cash flow from operations by 2026, driven by a strategic shift towards a higher mix of subscription software revenues. The company reiterated its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $250 million to $260 million and maintained its adjusted EBITDA guidance, indicating a significant year-over-year improvement.

In conclusion, Amwell’s earnings call reflected a positive sentiment with strong software revenue growth and improved financial metrics. Despite facing some challenges, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects, focusing on strategic deployments and cost reductions to drive growth and achieve positive cash flow.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_1264051801-750x406.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-03 06:56:24.935213
