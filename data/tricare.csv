The counties affected are Allegany and Garrett.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/notices/weather).

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.

Beneficiaries are advised to visit Express Scripts’ Weather Notices page for updates (https://militaryrx.express-scripts.com/find-pharmacy).

ICYMI: Murray Sounds Alarm on Chronic Staffing Shortages at Naval Hospital Bremerton, Presses for Answers from Defense Health Agency

***WATCH: Senator Murray’s questioning***

Washington, D.C. — Today, at a Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing on the President’s fiscal year 2026 budget request for the Department of the Navy, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, questioned Secretary of the Navy John C. Phelan and Acting Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James W. Kilby about the Trump administration’s litmus tests to hire for civilian roles, staffing cuts at Naval Hospital Bremerton, and frigate production.

[CIVILIAN STAFFING]

Senator Murray began her questioning by addressing how OPM has encouraged federal workers across the country to leave their jobs, including civilian workers that support key installations and operations, stating: “Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, located in my home state of Washington, is one of the largest shipyards in the country, and the only shipyard on the entire west coast that can dry dock Nimitz Class aircraft carriers. It’s a huge asset to the Navy and the overall Indo-Pacific strategy. Right now, PSNS is undergoing important renovations to address seismic vulnerabilities and prepare for the new Ford Class aircraft carriers. This administration, however, is actively encouraging our shipbuilders to leave their jobs and putting up absurd barriers to hiring new civilian workers. Almost 2,000 naval shipyard workers have already taken the deferred resignation under the threat of looming mass layoffs. And Trump’s Office of Personnel Management is insisting on approving civilians one-by-one, which is creating massive slowdowns and ballooning waitlists to hire the workers that we need at every base in this country. And on top of that, on May 29th, OPM added a requirement for new civilian nonpartisan hires to write about how they would ‘advance the President’s Executive Orders and policy priorities’ as part of the application process.”

“Secretary Phelan, how does a welder’s fluency in, or support of Trump’s Executive Orders relate to their qualifications as a welder?” asked Senator Murray.

Secretary Phelan answered, “I did visit Puget Sound and saw a lot of the impressive work that was done there. As to your question on—I believe what you're referring to is the civilian loyalty oath—and my understanding is the Department of the Navy continues to use the same appointment affidavit it's been using since 2002 for civilian hires. And we are waiting for guidance from the Department of Defense as it relates to any revisions.”

Senator Murray pressed, “Well will you push back on OPM’s political purity tests, and object to them individually approving civilian hires?”

“I will have to wait to see what it is they recommend before I can tell you that,” Secretary Phelan responded.

“Well from my position, a nonpartisan government hire should not need to articulate which Trump policy they like best just to get hired. And a welder should not need to share their favorite Trump Executive Order. This is putting us behind. So, I just think this is something that we all need to take notice of. And I hope, as you get your guidance, that you push back on that,” said Senator Murray.

[NAVAL HOSPITAL BREMERTON]

Senator Murray continued her questioning by turning to the issue of staffing cuts at Naval Hospital Bremerton (NHB) completely eliminating on-base health care for servicemembers and their family at Naval Base Kitsap: “Naval Base Kitsap, also in my state, is the third largest Navy base in the United States. It’s home to 15,000 servicemembers, nearly 18,000 family members and retirees. But since 2022, the Defense Health Agency has repeatedly ordered the base’s hospital to cut critical staff and medical care—which has been devastating for our servicemembers and their families’ access to health care. Right now, in fact, Naval Hospital Bremerton’s Internal Medicine department has no—zero—physicians for over 2,000 patients. Instead of hiring anyone, DHA is forcing patients to travel over an hour, on a good day, each way, to Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Mr. Secretary, this is just unacceptable.”

Senator Murray asked, “Can you fill me in on what the Navy is doing to fill those vacancies at Bremerton?”

“As you know, I've been visiting a number of different installations of ours, and from some of the conditions of the barracks to some of the conditions in the medical facilities, et cetera, we have issues at most of them. On that specific one I'm going to have to get back to you and get some more detail on it. Which, I will do,” Secretary Phelan responded.

“Admiral, do you have anything to add?” Senator Murray asked Admiral Kilby.

Admiral Kilby replied, “I agree with your assessment ma'am, there are challenges with DHA across the board, for the Navy. And we're working, like all the other services, to make sure we're providing the best health care we can for our servicemembers and our families.”

“This is a readiness issue. It's a retention issue. It's personal for these families. So please, if you could get back to me about what steps we are going to take to fix this,” said Senator Murray.

[NAVAL STATION EVERETT FRIGATES]

Senator Murray then asked about years of delays on frigate production, stating: “Finally, let me ask you about Naval Station Everett. It was designated as the home station for the new class of Frigates in 2022. However, the design delays have postponed production for the last three years. I understand you and the Department leadership are considering several options for the future of the Constellation-class frigate—and I’d emphasize this committee needs the budget details to put this bill together. So, if you can make sure we have that and talk for a minute about what you see as the implications for Everett under the different scenarios the Department might propose for the frigate program.”

Secretary Phelan replied, “Let me take that one from the record and come back to you.”

“I would appreciate the response to that. Thank you very much,” concluded Senator Murray.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet.
Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.
Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams.
Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage: Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts?","What’s on your to-do list this summer? Maybe you’re planning to spend time at the pool, go to a barbecue, or take a vacation. But don’t take a vacation from your health this summer.

“Now can be a great time for you and your family to catch up on preventive health care and take care of other health needs,” said Jeannine Pickrell, M.S., RN, director for Population Health and Disease Management, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.

Here are four suggested ways you can use your TRICARE benefits this summer.

1. Get preventive care

Getting regular preventive care plays a key role in maintaining good health. That’s because preventive services catch problems before you show symptoms. Examples of preventive services include cancer screenings, immunizations, and Health Promotion and Disease Prevention exams.

Which preventive services do you need? Talk to your primary care manager or provider or check out TRICARE’s list of covered preventive services to learn more. Your age, sex, family history, and other risk factors play a role in which services are recommended for you.

You’ll have no out-of-pocket costs for TRICARE covered preventive services if you see a TRICARE network provider, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Sheet. (Active duty service members need pre-authorization to see civilian providers.) TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select cover one HP&DP exam annually. Learn more about getting preventive care with your TRICARE plan.

2. Get ready for back to school

Summer is a great time to take care of health checkups for your kids. Your child’s school likely requires students to get an annual health exam and be up to date on vaccines.

TRICARE covers physicals required for school enrollment. Check with your child’s school for their health policy. Depending on these requirements, you may need to schedule more than one office visit for your child, so don’t wait until the last minute to make an appointment.

TRICARE doesn’t cover annual sports physicals, which are separate from school physicals.

Even if your child’s school doesn’t require a physical, kids can still get preventive checkups. Annual HP&DP exams are available to TRICARE enrollees ages 6 and older. TRICARE also covers well-child exams from birth through age 5.

3. Take care of your eyes

Routine eye exams are designed to monitor your eyesight and catch any eye diseases early.

Your TRICARE health plan may cover routine eye exams. Your vision coverage depends on who you are, your plan, and your age.

Check out these pages for more information about eye exams and vision coverage:

Eye Exams for Active Duty Service Members

Eye Exams for Active Duty Family Members

Eye Exams for National Guard and Reserve Members and Their Families

Eye Exams for Retirees, Their Families, and All Others

Do you need additional vision coverage, like coverage for glasses or contacts? You may be eligible for vision coverage through the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. If you aren’t enrolled in a FEDVIP vision plan, you can enroll following a FEDVIP qualifying life event or during Federal Benefits Open Season each fall. (Keep in mind that FEDVIP QLEs are different from TRICARE QLEs.) Go to BENEFEDS.gov to learn more about FEDVIP eligibility and coverage.

4. Focus on your mental health

Your mental health is an important part of your overall health and well-being. You don’t need to be in crisis to seek help. Early intervention is key to addressing mental health concerns. Early signs of possible problems may include:

Eating or sleeping too much or too little

Pulling away from people and usual activities

Having low or no energy

Having trouble concentrating

Feeling numb or like nothing matters

Experiencing unexplained aches and pains

Feeling hopeless or helpless

Smoking or drinking more than usual

TRICARE covers a range of mental health services. Services are available whether you’re seeking support for the short or long term. You can start by:

Talking to your PCM — depending on your health plan and the type of care you get, you may need a referral or pre-authorization for mental health care.

Brian Carpenter had been convicted by a jury in 2023 of participating in a scheme to fraudulently bill a health care program for U.S. service members and their families. In December 2024, Carpenter was sentenced to 45 months in federal prison and ordered to pay — along with co-defendant Jerry Lee Hawrylak of Lake Worth — $7,096,231 in restitution for their role in fraudulently billing TRICARE approximately $8.5 million. Carpenter filed an appeal in the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on Friday found the trial court should not have excused a juror on the first day of trial. The court ordered the pre-trial conditions of release to be re-imposed pending a new trial. Read more online here.

COUNTY EXTENDS BURN BAN — Wise County Commissioners extended the county’s 90-day, weather-based burn ban Monday as the July Fourth holiday approaches. The renewal of the conditional burn ban was recommended by Wise County Fire Marshal Jeff Doughty. Controlled burns and activities that generate sparks, like outdoor welding or popping fireworks, are allowed unless weather conditions present elevated or high-risk fire danger. Burning is also prohibited under Red Flag days, which are designated by the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth. In either of those cases, the county’s burn ban would be active and outdoor burning would be prohibited. Doughty explained that fireworks can legally be sold in the county for a two-week period starting today. Barring a burn ban activation, it is legal to shoot fireworks in unincorporated areas of the county. Read more online here.

DECATUR EXPANDS TAX EXEMPTION — The City of Decatur expanded its age 65 and older/disabled homestead exemption to $30,000 Monday night. On average, the property tax relief for qualifying seniors is expected to increase from $139.53 to $167.43 — saving around $27 for the upcoming tax year. The city’s property tax revenue is projected to drop by $17,000 from the expanded exemption, bringing the total levy loss to around $104,000. The move will inform upcoming budget considerations as the city council works toward adopting a new budget in September. The council also finalized who will serve on its budget committee for the second time in as many meetings Monday — approving Mayor Pro Tem Melinda Reeves’s appointment to the budget team. On June 9, the council approved placing Debra Jackson, Mayor Mike McQuiston and Will Carpenter on the committee by a 5-2 vote. Jackson was one of the dissenting votes, and she later resigned from the position, prompting new action for council appointments Monday.

BRIDGEPORT ISD ADOPTS BUDGET — The Bridgeport School Board adopted the district’s fiscal year 2025-2026 budget Monday, which will operate in a deficit for another consecutive year. Total revenues for the operating budget come in at $22,401,227 while expenditures total $23,639,464 for a net decrease of just over $1.2 million. While the district will operate in the red again, total fund balance stays healthy at $8,666,257, which represents 4.4 months of operating expenses. The Financial Integrity Rating System of Texas requires school districts to maintain at least 2.5 months, or 75 days, or operating expenses in fund balance. Trustees will likely amend the budget in August after legislative changes are finalized, as well as adopt a compensation plan and set the tax rate.

The paper won second place awards in online news coverage, column writing and sports photography; and third place awards in advertising and general excellence.

The alert came a day after the U.S. announced it bombed multiple nuclear sites in Iran, with President Trump warning of further strikes if Iran retaliates. The U.S. carried out the strikes a little over a week after Israel launched a broad attack on Iran, its top regional rival.

The State Department alert noted that the Middle East conflict has caused travel disruptions and “periodic” airspace closures across the region and also warned of “the potential for demonstrations against U.S. citizens and interests abroad.”

The State Department is urging citizens to check travel advisories and security alerts before traveling abroad.

Understanding Your TRICARE Plan

To maximize your TRICARE benefits, it's essential to understand your plan and its associated costs. TRICARE offers several plans, each with its unique features and benefits.

Choosing the Right TRICARE Plan for Your Needs

When selecting a TRICARE plan, consider the following factors:

Your health needs: If you have ongoing medical conditions or require frequent medical care, TRICARE Prime may be the best option. If you're generally healthy and only require occasional medical care, TRICARE Select may be more suitable.

Your budget: TRICARE Prime typically has lower out-of-pocket costs, but requires a yearly enrollment fee. TRICARE Select has higher out-of-pocket costs, but offers more flexibility in choosing providers.

Your location: If you live in a remote area, TRICARE Select may be a better option, as it allows you to see any TRICARE-authorized provider.

Understanding the Differences Between TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, and TRICARE For Life

Here's a brief overview of each plan:

Plan Description Eligibility TRICARE Prime A managed care plan that requires enrollment and a primary care manager (PCM) Active duty service members, retirees, and their families TRICARE Select A fee-for-service plan that allows you to see any TRICARE-authorized provider Active duty service members, retirees, and their families TRICARE For Life A Medicare wraparound coverage plan for TRICARE beneficiaries with Medicare Parts A and B Medicare-eligible TRICARE beneficiaries

Tips for Navigating the TRICARE Claims Process

To ensure smooth claims processing, follow these tips:

Keep accurate records of your medical appointments and expenses

Verify your provider is TRICARE-authorized

Submit claims promptly, as there's a one-year filing deadline

Use the TRICARE Online Patient Portal to track your claims and manage your account

Accessing Specialized Care

TRICARE offers access to specialized care, including specialty care services like cardiology, oncology, and mental health.

How to Access Specialty Care Through TRICARE

To access specialty care, follow these steps:

Consult with your primary care manager (PCM) or healthcare provider to determine the best course of treatment.

Obtain a referral from your PCM or healthcare provider to see a specialist.

Verify the specialist is TRICARE-authorized and participating in the TRICARE network.

Schedule an appointment with the specialist.

Understanding the Process for Referrals and Authorizations

TRICARE requires referrals and authorizations for certain services, including specialty care. Here's what you need to know:

Your PCM or healthcare provider will typically initiate the referral process.

TRICARE will review the referral and determine if the requested service is medically necessary.

If approved, you'll receive an authorization number, which you'll need to provide to the specialist.

Tips for Finding TRICARE-Approved Providers

To find TRICARE-approved providers, use the TRICARE Provider Directory or contact the TRICARE Regional Office in your area. You can also ask your PCM or healthcare provider for recommendations.

Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs

While TRICARE provides comprehensive coverage, you'll still incur out-of-pocket costs, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance.

Strategies for Reducing Copays and Deductibles

To minimize your out-of-pocket costs, consider the following strategies:

Use TRICARE-authorized providers, as they typically have negotiated rates with TRICARE.

Take advantage of preventive care services, which are often covered at no cost to you.

Use the TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery service for maintenance medications.

Consider using a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA) to set aside pre-tax dollars for medical expenses.

Understanding TRICARE's Catastrophic Cap and How to Reach It

TRICARE's catastrophic cap is the maximum amount you'll pay out-of-pocket for covered services in a given year. For 2023, the catastrophic cap is $3,000 for TRICARE Prime families and $4,500 for TRICARE Select families 1.

To reach the catastrophic cap, you'll need to accumulate allowable charges, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. Once you reach the cap, TRICARE will cover 100% of allowable charges for the remainder of the year.

The following equation illustrates how to calculate your out-of-pocket costs:

Out-of-Pocket Costs=Copays+Deductibles+Coinsurance \text{Out-of-Pocket Costs} = \text{Copays} + \text{Deductibles} + \text{Coinsurance} Out-of-Pocket Costs=Copays+Deductibles+Coinsurance

For example, if you have a $500 deductible, $1,000 in copays, and $1,500 in coinsurance, your total out-of-pocket costs would be:

Out-of-Pocket Costs=USD500+USD1,000+USD1,500=USD3,000 \text{Out-of-Pocket Costs} = $500 + $1,000 + $1,500 = $3,000 Out-of-Pocket Costs=U​SD5​00+U​SD1​,000+U​SD1​,500=U​SD3​,000

Tips for Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs for Prescriptions and Other Expenses

To minimize your out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions and other expenses, consider the following tips:

Use the TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery service for maintenance medications, as it often offers discounted rates.

Use generic or formulary medications when possible.

Take advantage of cost-sharing programs, such as the TRICARE Pharmacy Copayment Waiver.

Consider using a mail-order pharmacy or online pharmacy that participates in the TRICARE network.

Conclusion

Maximizing your TRICARE benefits requires understanding your plan, accessing specialized care, and managing out-of-pocket costs. By following the tips and strategies outlined in this article, you'll be able to get the most out of your military healthcare coverage.

A: No, you'll need to use TRICARE-authorized providers to ensure coverage. You can find authorized providers using the TRICARE Provider Directory or by contacting the TRICARE Regional Office in your area.",https://www.numberanalytics.com/images/favicon/favicon.png,N,1.0,2025-06-23 17:56:26.967682

This group establishes unified, high-quality standards for perioperative services across all hospitals and clinics within the Military Health System. By creating the same rules and processes for all operating rooms, the DHA ORESC helps the MHS deliver safe and high-quality care to beneficiaries.

What Is the DHA ORESC?

The DHA ORESC is a team of surgeons, nurses, and anesthesiologists from all nine defense health networks. Their job is to equip ORs with the resourcing and guidance to meet the needs of patients.

“As a nurse nominee, being part of the ORESC ensures that the voices of the nursing staff are heard in key decisions,” said Natalee Day, chief nurse of William Beaumont Army Medical Center – Fort Bliss. “I have the opportunity to advocate for processes that directly impact our team and patient care.”

How the DHA ORESC Works

The DHA ORESC acts as a central decision-making body to standardize processes across the MHS. Members from every DHN share ideas and challenges from their military hospitals and clinics. This teamwork helps create standards that work for most military hospitals and clinics and advance the larger goals of the MHS.

The DHA ORESC also focuses on accountability. U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Robert McGill, orthopaedic arthroplasty surgeon and DHA’s Surgical Clinical Management Team chief serving as the acting DHA ORESC chair said the committee:

• Hears concerns

• Shares successes

• Leads policy decision making

Every DHN receives one vote for decision making. These decisions improve patient safety and quality of care while also enhancing military medical readiness and resource use.

“By centralizing decision making and standardizing processes, the DHA ORESC ensures that every facility within the MHS knows the steps to operate at the highest level of efficiency and safety,” McGill explained.

Why the DHA ORESC is Important

The DHA ORESC’s work has big benefits:

• Safer surgeries: By creating perioperative best practices, the DHA ORESC makes sure all patients get safe, high-quality care.

• Faster decisions: The group’s clear structure helps solve problems quickly while keeping everyone accountable.

• Better use of resources: Consistent processes and good planning help military hospitals and clinics meet patient needs and keep service members ready.

“The ORESC’s initiatives not only improve surgical care, but also strengthen the overall readiness of our military health care system,” said Dr. Adrienne Cummings, deputy chair of the department of anesthesia at Brooke Army Medical Center. “It’s a win for patients, providers, and the mission.”

The DHA ORESC Impact

The DHA ORESC’s work supports the DHA’s goal of quality care to patients and service member readiness. By improving how military hospitals and clinics run, the DHA ORESC helps keep the military health care system strong and dependable.

“The ORESC has been an invaluable platform for sharing challenges and solutions across networks,” said U.S. Navy Capt. James Solomon, pediatric anesthesiologist, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, “We all face similar obstacles and are at different stages in developing our network-level OR committees. By collaborating, we ensure that all networks move in the same direction toward optimizing OR operations.”

What’s Next

The DHA ORESC is committed to making surgeries safer, more efficient, and better for everyone. As the team keeps working together, its goal is for surgical care to be top-notch for both patients and providers.",https://militarymedical.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/8941392.jpg,N,1.0,2025-06-23 11:56:25.609074

Tricare will not cover elective abortions. If it’s a medically necessary procedure to save the mother’s life, yes. But then you face the hardship of somebody who will do it. Some doctors use their personal beliefs and their fear of prosecution dictate what they’ll do.

For the most part tricare covers medically necessary medical procedures.

If you choose to seek an abortion electively, that’s completely on you. Travel if necessary and the costs of the procedure.

You can also google “tricare abortion” and find the tricare website explaining.

Oh well that’s shitty! Sorry that happened to you! Sometimes people interpret things in a way we didn’t intend and then everyone runs with it 😩

So pregnant or not, you have the option of Prime vs Select. I have select, so I’m not sure how it works with prime, but I picked my own OB and birthing hospital (lmao I actually WANTED to give birth at the MTF here and they said nope, deferred to the civilian network byeeeee). I didn’t need any referrals and for the most part, they’ve covered everything — but I’m also high risk due to AMA. There’s also birth doula coverage! And def check out parenting and birthing classes offered through your nearest MTF with a birthing center.

For anyone who is wondering, I don’t think any Tricare plan covers TFMR for abnormalities not compatible with life unless they endanger the mother’s life, or the pregnancy is a result of rape or incest.

CHAMPVA & Medicare Advantage

CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs) can serve as a secondary payer when you’re enrolled in another health plan, such as a Medicare Advantage plan. This means CHAMPVA helps cover out-of-pocket costs like deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance after your primary plan pays.

Most healthcare providers will bill your Medicare Advantage plan first, and CHAMPVA will pick up the remaining balance. However, there are exceptions. If you're also covered by Medicaid, Indian Health Services, or certain crime victim benefits, CHAMPVA may act as your primary payer.

TRICARE For Life & Medicare Advantage

Good news for TRICARE For Life beneficiaries: enrolling in Medicare Advantage does not affect your TRICARE coverage. Medicare Advantage becomes your primary insurer, while TFL acts as a secondary payer for TRICARE-covered services.

However, unlike Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage claims do not automatically crossover to TRICARE. This means you may have to manually file claims with TRICARE For Life for reimbursement, unless your provider or Medicare Advantage Health Plan carrier is willing to submit those claims for you on your behalf.

Dear Rusty: In your answer to the retired U.S. Navy veteran about why he is forced to enroll in Medicare, you focused on military TriCare’s requirement for the member to enroll in Medicare. But you said nothing about regular VA health care. If a non-career veteran is eligible for VA health care, couldn’t that be used in place of Medicare? Signed: Veteran Advocate

Dear Veteran Advocate: Thank you for your feedback. FYI, I have previously explained numerous times that veterans who rely on the VA for 100% of their healthcare can, indeed, disenroll from Medicare Part B (thus saving the monthly Part B premium). I don’t personally recommend it because of my personal experience, but it certainly is possible to do so.

Personally, I use the VA for some of my healthcare needs – usually an annual checkup and optometry services – at my local VA clinic which is only a mile away from where I live. But for any extensive treatment needs (medical tests, etc.) I must travel about 40 miles to the nearest VA hospital facility. For contrast, I have numerous private healthcare services, specialists, and hospitals very near where I live, but to use them under the VA I must get VA preapproval and use only certain VA-approved providers, which is inconvenient for me. Personally, I prefer the freedom to go to any healthcare service provider I choose, without restriction, at any time I need to. So, I use my VA coverage when it is convenient for me but rely also on non-VA, Medicare-approved specialists who I can choose to use (or not) at will. For me, it’s a matter of convenience and the freedom to use whichever healthcare provider I want. That said, I fully understand that some veterans rely exclusively on the VA for their healthcare needs, and I have explained to many who have written to me that they have that option. I have also published several public articles about this as well.

So, please rest assured that we regularly advise our veterans about their healthcare options under Medicare, including the ability to decline Medicare Part B coverage if they have full VA healthcare coverage. FYI, free Medicare Part A (inpatient hospitalization coverage) is mandatory to collect Social Security after age 65, but Medicare Part B coverage is always optional because there is a premium associated with Part B. A veteran can decline Medicare Part B coverage and save that monthly premium, but they would need to contact Social Security to do so. Social Security will want to interview the veteran to ensure they are aware of the potential financial consequences of not having Medicare Part B. And they may need to file form CMS-1763 (Request for Termination) But a non-career veteran can opt out of Medicare Part B if they get all of their healthcare services through the Veterans Administration.",https://jocoreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Social-Security-Ask-Rusty-10-04-18CP-1.jpg,N,0.0,2025-06-22 13:56:15.784746

Which one will be considered primary and secondary?
From what I'm researching, my work insurance will be my primary - but the copays are slightly higher than my Tricare.
My copay for my hospital stay for delivering my baby will be a bit more expensive too.","Background - My husband is in the Reserves and I am on his Tricare Select plan that has been serving as my primary insurance during my pregnancy. Last month I moved into a benefited position at the hospital I work at and decided to enroll in benefits as they will cover 12 weeks of paid maternity leave under short term disability.

Subject and methods: Records of patients assigned female in the medical record were evaluated in this observational, retrospective study, which received a non-research determination by the Brooke Army Medical Center Institutional Review Board (C.2019.156n).
Patient cohorts included those who received an initial healthcare encounter (i.e., index visit) in which physical, sexual, or psychological abuse was documented and those who never received documentation corresponding to abuse during the study period.
Results: The probability of abuse code documentation varied across patient characteristics and medical information.
Such programs could mitigate barriers to patient disclosure of abuse and support patient-centered policies.","Abstract: Aim: This study aims to evaluate the overall incidence of abuse code documentation in the medical records of patients assigned female, and the relationships between abuse code documentation and patient characteristics, healthcare utilization (e.g., overall visits, emergency room visits, opioid prescription receipts), and diagnoses received in the year following documentation.

Results: The probability of abuse code documentation varied across patient characteristics and medical information. Using 1:1 propensity score matching, patients who received abuse code documentation had higher post-index healthcare utilization overall, as well as increased odds of an emergency visit, receipt of a mental health diagnosis, and receipt of an opioid prescription within a year of the index date. Conclusion: These findings highlight the need for system-level interventions to ensure standardized screening and care pathways for those who experience abuse. Such programs could mitigate barriers to patient disclosure of abuse and support patient-centered policies.",https://www.centreforevidence.org/website/img/og--default.png,N,0.0,2025-06-22 04:56:17.306739

I thought id be getting out today but turns out that its going to be longer. At least Mon, but they arent sure. Im here because of some complications that put me at risk of a preterm labor, and the fact they found a shorten cervix. A couple of the issues have been resolved I think, but one is still being monitored. My cervix has shortened more within less than 24 hours.

My question is how much can tricare help pay for this? I run a huge risk of leaving too early because if I cramp and get contractions again I can't take the steroids that helped this time for another weeks or two ( Im sorry I can't remember how long. Im really overwhelmed). I need to know how much I could potentially be paying out of pocket if I stay until Monday or even for as long as they need.
