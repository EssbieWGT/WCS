Gilead to Pay $202 Million to Settle DOJ Claims Over Speaker Program Kickbacks

Gilead Sciences, Inc. has agreed to pay $202 million to resolve allegations brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) that it violated the False Claims Act (FCA) and Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) by using sham speaker programs to induce health care providers to prescribe its human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) medications. The settlement, announced by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, resolves claims that from 2011 to 2017, Gilead paid health care professionals to attend and speak at events that were often more than social gatherings, with little or no educational content. The government alleged that these events, frequently held at high-end restaurants and venues, were used to reward high-prescribing physicians, and encourage further prescriptions of Gilead’s HIV drugs, including Truvada, Descovy, and Biktarvy.

According to the DOJ, Gilead’s speaker programs were a vehicle for providing improper remuneration, in violation of the AKS, and resulted in the submission of false claims to federal health care programs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. The resolution underscores the DOJ’s continued scrutiny of speaker programs, particularly when meals, entertainment, or honoraria are untethered from substantive scientific exchange.

Jury Renders $136 Million Verdict Against Omnicare and CVS Health for FCA Violations

A federal jury, in the Southern District of New York, returned a verdict against Omnicare, Inc. and its parent company, CVS Health Corporation, finding them liable for violations of the FCA. Following a four-week trial, the jury found that the nation’s “largest long-term care pharmacy,” Omnicare, fraudulently billed Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE for more than three million false claims — equivalent to $135,592,814 in damages. The alleged misconduct related to Omnicare “dispensing drugs without valid prescriptions’ to disabled and elderly people in assisted and long-term care facilities.” The government alleged that Omnicare “rolled over” prescriptions — automatically refilling medications at set intervals — long after prescribers had stopped treating certain patients or after prescriptions had expired, resulting in thousands of claims to Medicare Part D and Medicaid for drugs that lacked a lawful basis. The jury also found CVS Health Corporation liable for contributing to the submission of these false claims.

Pursuant to the FCA, the government is entitled to three times the assessed damages plus statutory penalties, amounting to over $400 million. According to the DOJ, the verdict is “one of the largest damages verdicts rendered by a jury in a False Claims Act case.”

DOJ Files Sweeping Complaint Alleging FCA and AKS Violations Against Nations’ Largest Health Insurance Companies

On May 1, the United States filed a complaint against the nation’s largest health insurance companies, including Aetna Inc. and affiliates, Elevance Health, Inc., and Humana Inc., as well as three insurance broker organizations, namely eHealth, Inc., GoHealth, Inc., and SelectQuote Inc. The 213-page complaint was filed in the District of Massachusetts and alleges a far-reaching scheme where the insurers funneled “hundreds of millions of dollars” of off-book payments to the broker-defendants. The DOJ claims that the illegal kickbacks were disguised as “marketing,” “co-op,” or “sponsorship” payments, and were meant to induce the broker-defendants to steer beneficiaries toward the paying insurer’s Part C Medicare Advantage plan, “box out” competitors, and reduce enrollment of younger Medicare patients with disabilities. The complaint seeks treble damages under the FCA and civil penalties for each false or fraudulent claim.

Second Circuit Affirms Health Clinic Manager’s Reindictment and Sentence in Kickback and Tax Fraud Case

The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment in the case of United States v. Aleksandr Pikus, upholding his 108-month sentence for conspiracy to receive and pay health care kickbacks and conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service. Pikus, who was originally indicted in 2016 for his role in a multi-million-dollar health care fraud and kickback scheme involving Medicare and Medicaid, argued on appeal that the charges should have been dismissed with prejudice due to violations of the Speedy Trial Act. The Second Circuit, however, found no abuse of discretion in the district court’s decision to dismiss the original indictment without prejudice, and allow the government to reindict Pikus on the same charges.

The court emphasized the seriousness of the offenses, which involved fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid and the “concealment of illegal kickbacks through shell companies and false tax returns.” The appellate court also noted that, while there were procedural delays and administrative failures, there was no evidence of “bad faith or a pattern of neglect” sufficient to warrant dismissal with prejudice.

“VHA [Veterans Health Administration] care is, on average, less costly, less wasteful and of higher quality and value than private-sector alternatives.

Each year, large numbers of medical and nursing students, resident physicians and other health professionals-in-training get valuable clinical training in VA Medical Centers.","On March 4, Christopher Syrek, the Chief of Staff of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), informed his senior colleagues of a DOGE-devised plan for large-scale cutbacks at the agency that provides health care and other vital services to millions of veterans. The following day, the Associated Press cited an internal memo that indicates that 80,000 jobs - roughly 15% of the VA’s workforce - are slated for elimination. More than 25% of VA employees are veterans.

On March 6, VA Secretary Doug Collins asserted that the plan is a “pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care, benefits, and services to veterans.” He promised to “accomplish this without making cuts to health care or benefits to veterans and VA beneficiaries.” His remarks were published in The Hill.

Recently, Russell Lernie and Suzanne Gordon, two senior policy analysts with the nonpartisan Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute, disputed Collins’ depiction of VA healthcare. “That's just not true,” they wrote in Military.com. “VHA [Veterans Health Administration]

care is, on average, less costly, less wasteful and of higher quality and value than private-sector alternatives. Strengthening -- not decimating -- in-house VHA staffing and infrastructure represents the more fiscally responsible use of taxpayer dollars. It's also what the majority of the 9 million veterans it serves want.”

As I pondered the potential impact of the VA’s plan, I recalled how in Trump’s first term, cutbacks and outsourcing hurt our military health system. Is the VA next?

A Cautionary Tale

During the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, military medicine devised and swiftly deployed a stunning series of innovations that cut the death rate from severe battlefield wounds in half, to the lowest level in the history of warfare. It is one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of American Medicine.

Unfortunately, when the conflicts wound down, this success did not protect the MHS.

Critics alleged that stateside military treatment facilities (MTFs) cost too much, deliver care of uneven quality, and do not attract enough complex cases to maintain the skills of military doctors and nurses between deployments. They urged the Department of Defense (DoD) to outsource more care to the private sector. Three months after Trump took office in 2017, I published a commentary in Health Affairs Forefront that cited strong evidence of the MHS’s quality, efficiency and value. Instead of rethinking their assumptions, DoD advocates of outsourcing plowed ahead.

Shortly thereafter, the Pentagon directed military retirees and the families of servicemembers, two large groups of beneficiaries who had long valued care in the MHS, to go elsewhere for treatment. As visits and admissions to military treatment facilities declined, the DoD downsized or closed a number of military clinics and hospitals and reduced military health manpower by thousands of positions. As purchased care costs climbed, additional money was pulled from military hospitals and staff. This left once-busy MTFs like Walter Reed National Military Medical Center half empty and understaffed.

As the impact of outsourcing mounted, the Joint Chiefs of Staff worried that it was degrading the MHS’s ability to meet its wartime mission. In a Dec 6, 2023 memo to DoD leadership entitled, “Stabilizing and Improving the Military Health System,” Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks ordered a change in course. “Realignment of medical personnel, coupled with a challenging health care economy and ambitious private sector care capacity assumptions, led to chronically understaffed [hospitals and clinics] that at times cannot deliver timely care to beneficiaries or ensure sufficient workload to maintain and sustain clinical skills"" She wrote. ""As a result, beneficiaries are routinely referred to the private sector for services that [the MHS] should be able to deliver, with the Military Departments increasingly turning to the private sector for clinical skills sustainment opportunities for uniformed medical personnel. This has resulted in increasing overall health care costs for the Department and missing readiness opportunities for the Force.”

To rebuild the MHS, DEPSEC Hicks directed that actions be taken to “reattract beneficiaries” to MTFs and increase staffing to “…support the National Defense Strategy, increase clinical readiness, mitigate risks to [military] requirements, and reduce long-term cost growth in private sector care.” Unfortunately, when patients are turned away, it is difficult to win them back from doctors who are incentivized to retain them.

In Light Of The DoD’s Experience, Why Would The VA Head Down The Same Path?

VA healthcare has formidable strengths. Thirteen years ago, I wrote: “Early on, it embraced many of the attributes that characterize our nation’s top-performing private healthcare systems: It was an early adopter of an interoperable electronic health record; it has strong affiliations with the nation's top medical schools; it regularly measures and applies quality data, and it has a salaried medical staff that is well-aligned with the agency's mission.”

The VA generally delivers care that is safer and less costly than private-sector healthcare. That’s because private-sector doctors tend to over-test and over-treat to boost clinical revenue. In their commentary, Lernie and Hall observed that the “The private sector performs more ‘guideline discordant,’ ‘questionable’ and ‘low-value’ tests than the VHA, which then lead to more unnecessary services downstream, higher health-care costs and potential harm to the patient.” This happens, they explained, because “With lax oversight, private-sector, fee-for-service incentives drive overtreatment and profit-seeking that isn’t permitted in the VHA.”

Pushing more vets into private-sector care, which already costs the VA $36 billion per year, doesn’t make much sense. What supporters of outsourcing government healthcare fail to understand is that private healthcare in the U.S. is not a “system,” it’s a thicket. Navigating it is a challenge, even for well-connected physicians seeking care for themselves or their families. In recent years, many independent practices have been bought by venture capitalists whose focus is on maximizing profits, not high-quality care.

Cutbacks And Outsoucing Won’t Help Veterans Or the VA

I’m sure Secretary Collins wants the best for veterans. At the Tucson VA last week, he described the planned 15% reduction as a “goal, not a guarantee,"" according to the Arizona Daily Star. Hopefully, veterans advocacy groups and their allies in Congress can convince the Trump administration to rethink its plans. It will not only help vets—a powerful constituency that holds a special place in the hearts of most Americans—it will help American healthcare. Each year, large numbers of medical and nursing students, resident physicians and other health professionals-in-training get valuable clinical training in VA Medical Centers.

The VA’s motto is ""To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors.’’ May it always be so.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/681639744fae6e9cd152a748/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,0.0,2025-05-05 12:56:37.789546

Each year, the team accounts for anomalies that may arise during the procurement season to meet the program deadline, said Alexander Quiñones, Pharmaceutical Manufacturer/Distributor division chief.

Working closely with the DLA Distribution Center in Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, more than 3 million doses of the vaccine were distributed to military members globally.

This Department of Defense flu vaccine program oversees the precise support needed for the Defense Health Agency to supply enough vaccine dosages to protect the health of warfighters and DOD beneficiaries.

“This season’s program included three separate contracts totaling $42.4 million,” Quiñones said, “these contracts also resulted in 3.09 million flu vaccine doses, including 31,030 additional doses under contract to date.”

The Medical and Distribution team swiftly adapts to any last-minute changes that may arise throughout the season.

“Due to logistical timing, the [military] services need to submit their flu vaccine requirements before the season starts,” said Yu Chen, pharmaceutical manufacturer/distributor division contracting officer. “Therefore, real-time adjustments are needed for additional doses as more orders come in. However, material planners, [tailored vendor logistics specialists], cold chain team and contracting team work very closely together toward success and keeping the warfighter protected from the flu.”

This year, the team also overcame distribution issues posed by severe weather conditions across the United States.

“No matter what obstacles are thrown at us, our distribution plan accounts for them,” said Dana Dallas, Medical Cold Chain Program manager. “For example, this season we needed to work around distribution obstacles caused by snowstorms and hurricanes. We were still able to get on top of them, pivot and help DHA meet all metrics and requirements for the flu program.”

Throughout the season, the team is regularly in touch with several stakeholders, including vendors and partner government agencies.

“Our team continuously monitors communications with stakeholders to ensure battle rhythm and precise support,” Quiñones said.

The more time you spend outside in tick habitat, the greater your risk of a tick bite and potentially developing a tick-borne disease.","As winter’s chill dissipates and spring’s rain gives way to summer’s warmth, we shed our layers and venture outdoors to enjoy the weather. Spending time outside is a known mood booster, and the increased physical activity of outdoor recreation is good for overall health and wellness. However, hidden dangers can lurk among the blossoms – ticks come out of hiding in the springtime too.

May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, and spring is one of the most important times of year to become “tick smart” by learning about the risks ticks pose and how to avoid tick bites. Ticks are tiny and can be hard to notice — even after they bite — because of chemicals in their saliva that make them invisible to our body’s defenses. And while not every tick is infected with a disease-causing pathogen, one unlucky bite can infect a person with one or even multiple disease agents.

Lyme disease

Lyme disease is by far the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting approximately 476,000 people in the U.S. every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The ticks that transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease are called blacklegged ticks, also known as deer ticks, and their tiny nymphs (smaller than a sesame seed) come out in force during May. More than 25% of blacklegged ticks can be infected with the Lyme pathogen.

Blacklegged ticks can be hard to find and remove quickly because of their small size. During the warmer season, we tend to wear fewer clothes, making us more susceptible to bites and subsequent infections. It generally takes around 48 hours for a tick to transmit the Lyme disease pathogen, so time is of the essence once one of these bloodsuckers latches on.

For the military community, one weapon in the fight against ticks and Lyme disease is a program known as MilTICK, which stands for the Military Tick Identification/Infection Confirmation Kit program. Service members and their families, as well as retirees, civilians, contractors and others can submit human-biting ticks to the MilTICK program for free and receive an emailed report describing the tick species, how long the tick was attached, and whether or not the tick tested positive for any pathogens.

This program has been in place since 1995 and is run by the Defense Health Agency - Public Health at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Most military clinics have tick kits on site, and individuals or clinics can request tick kits by reaching out to the MilTICK program staff. The kits never expire and are great to have on hand, just in case a tick bite occurs.

The MilTICK program uses the data generated to better understand tick-borne disease risks to the military community. In 2024, over 3,000 ticks were tested, and 167 ticks were found positive for one or more human pathogens. It might come as no surprise that May is the month where the most Lyme disease agent is detected, although MilTICK has found the Lyme agent in human-biting ticks submitted during every month of the year. The peaks correspond to the spring and fall, when the numbers of nymph and adult ticks peak, respectively.

Of course, Lyme disease isn’t the only tick-borne disease out there – not even the only one you need to worry about from a blacklegged tick bite. Blacklegged ticks also transmit a relapsing fever illness, a bacterial disease called anaplasmosis, a parasitic disease similar to malaria called babesiosis, and Powassan virus, which can cause encephalitis and even death. MilTICK tests for all of these, and fortunately, these pathogens are much rarer than the Lyme disease pathogen – for example, only one confirmed positive tick for Powassan virus has been found since MilTICK started testing for it in 2020.

Other tick species become active in the springtime too, especially the human-biting lone star tick and the American dog tick. Lone star ticks make up the bulk of ticks received by MilTICK since they are the most common tick in the southeastern U.S., where many military installations are located. Lone star ticks can transmit a disease called ehrlichiosis and have also been associated with a red meat allergy known as alpha gal syndrome.

Your risk of tick-borne disease depends on where you live and how you spend your time. Lyme disease is endemic to the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and upper midwestern U.S., where the blacklegged tick is abundant. Move further south and you are in lone star tick country, where your risk of ehrlichiosis is much higher than your risk of Lyme disease. To learn more about the risks at your installation, you can visit the CAC-enabled MilTICK data dashboard and see exactly what kinds of ticks are being submitted from the area where you live.

The more time you spend outside in tick habitat, the greater your risk of a tick bite and potentially developing a tick-borne disease. Treating clothes with tick-killing sprays such as permethrin, using bug spray on exposed skin, and covering up with long pants and socks even during warmer months will all help prevent tick bites. If you do get bitten, sending the tick for testing through MilTICK can help provide peace of mind if the tick is negative. If the tick is positive, the MilTICK report can help your doctor diagnose and treat any symptoms that may develop.

Taking walks in the woods, playing sports outside with friends, and stopping to smell the flowers are all wonderful ways to enjoy the outdoors this May. Staying aware and being tick smart can help keep you safe all year.

A quick Google search says you can claim stepkids as secondary dependents, but they have to be in your care and custody for at least a year to be eligible.

Select vs prime is more of a your preference thing. Network and coverage is all the same. It just ultimately cost you less on Prime with PCM/managed care vs Select where you can pretty much do what you want with covered items without dealing with a PCM.

Prime vs USFHP...this comes down to which has the better network in the area you live, or if establishments you prefer to use are in one network but not the other. Otherwise, coverages, costs, etc are the same.

Personally as AD retired I am on Prime. I'm about 200mi from the nearest MTF so everything is 100% regular local stuff, PCM and all, and nothing military related. It's worked out great. I had looked at random stuff that is in network between Tricare and USFHP, and for my area Tricare had the better network. That said, I am in one of those areas that changed from Tricare east to west this year. With that change, many Drs and places that were in network are now not, so far anyways. I stuck with Prime this year as maybe just some time is needed before everything is converted and hashed back out...but if things remain the same come renewal time again, I'll be switching to USFHP as that network would be better than how Tricare is sitting currently in my area.",,N,0.0,2025-05-04 15:56:28.501723

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency.
These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)
You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter.
Visit TRICARE West Region Transition.","Do you live in the West Region? Do you have TRICARE Prime? You should know that the Defense Health Agency has extended the West Region referral approval waiver through June 30. TRICARE-authorized specialty care providers don’t need to wait for TriWest Healthcare Alliance to approve referrals issued by your primary care manager before providing outpatient care.

“After assessing the current state of referrals, DHA has decided to extend the referral approval waiver for many beneficiaries,” said Richard Hart, Division Chief, Health Plan Design, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “This waiver extension will ensure that West Region beneficiaries can continue getting specialty care without interruption to their care.”

However, certain military hospitals and clinics have returned to normal referral processing. This phased approach is enabling TriWest to improve its referral processing system. If your PCM is located at one these facilities, TriWest will process your referral. Keep reading to learn more.

How does the waiver work?

Through June 30, keep following the rules of your TRICARE Prime plan. These rules are described in the TRICARE Choices in the United States Handbook.

Continue seeing your PCM to get referrals for specialty care, even if your PCM isn’t currently in TriWest’s network. (Note: The point-of-service fee waiver is also extended through Sept. 30. These fees are waived for existing referrals with non-network providers in the West Region.)

During the waiver period, you don’t need to wait for TriWest to approve your referral (unless your PCM is at certain military hospitals or clinics). However, the specialist you see must be TRICARE-authorized.

Here are a few key things to remember:

Ask your PCM for a copy of your referral. Is your PCM at a military hospital or clinic? They may send it:

Through the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal within 3-5 days

In the mail within 3-5 days

To a referral customer service office. You can pick up your copy after your appointment.

When you see your specialist, bring the copy of your referral, dated Jan. 1 through June 30. You can also bring a copy of the TRICARE West Region Referral Approval Waiver Letter. This is available on www.tricare.mil/west.

Not sure how to find a specialist? You can:

Ask your PCM to recommend a local TRICARE-authorized specialist.

See a specialist you’ve seen before, if they’re TRICARE-authorized.

Search TriWest’s provider directory to find specialists in your area.

Are there exceptions to the waiver?

This waiver never applies to:

Inpatient care

Applied behavior analysis or Autism Care Demonstration services

Laboratory developed tests

Extended Care Health Option services

Certain military hospitals and clinics in the West Region have returned to normal referral processing. If your PCM is located at one of these facilities, they’ll let you know. They’ll send your referral to TriWest for processing.

If this applies to you:

Access your approved referral through TriWest’s secure portal. You can also wait to get it in the mail.

Your TriWest portal will have instructions on how to schedule an appointment with the assigned specialist. If there’s a problem or you have questions, call TriWest at 888-TRIWEST (874-9378).

The company reported an improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth consecutive quarter. The loss narrowed to $12.2 million, a substantial improvement from the $45.6 million loss reported in the first quarter of 2024, showcasing the company’s efforts in enhancing its financial performance.

Partnership with Military Health System

Amwell’s platform is now operational for scheduled visits across the global Military Health System. This deployment has been met with high satisfaction rates from both patients and providers, exceeding 90%, highlighting the effectiveness and acceptance of Amwell’s solutions.

Positive Cash Flow Prospects

The company is on a path to achieving positive cash flow from operations by 2026. This goal is supported by cost reduction measures and an improved revenue mix, which are expected to drive financial stability and growth.

Delayed Deployment Due to Leadership Transition

The deployment of automated and Digital Behavioral Health programs has been delayed to the third quarter, pending final confirmation from the new Director of the Defense Health Agency. This leadership transition has temporarily impacted the company’s deployment timeline.

Lower Visit Volumes

Amwell completed approximately 1.3 million visits in the first quarter, marking a 23% decrease from the previous year. This decline is attributed to a normalization in visit volumes following the pandemic-induced surge.

Economic Uncertainty and Tariff Concerns

The company is facing challenges related to macroeconomic factors, including tariffs and economic uncertainty. These issues are affecting sales timelines as health systems reassess their IT budgets, adding a layer of complexity to Amwell’s sales strategy.

Forward-Looking Guidance

In its forward-looking guidance, Amwell provided several key metrics and expectations. The company reported total revenue of $66.8 million for the quarter, a 12% year-over-year increase, with software revenue growing by 30%. Amwell aims to achieve positive cash flow from operations by 2026, driven by a strategic shift towards a higher mix of subscription software revenues. The company reiterated its full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $250 million to $260 million and maintained its adjusted EBITDA guidance, indicating a significant year-over-year improvement.

In conclusion, Amwell’s earnings call reflected a positive sentiment with strong software revenue growth and improved financial metrics. Despite facing some challenges, the company remains optimistic about its future prospects, focusing on strategic deployments and cost reductions to drive growth and achieve positive cash flow.",https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/shutterstock_1264051801-750x406.jpg,N,1.0,2025-05-03 06:56:24.935213

Amwell narrowed its losses on growing revenue in the first quarter as the telehealth vendor continued to roll out products as part of a contract with the Department of Defense.

The company posted a net loss of $18.4 million, down from $73.4 million in the prior-year period. Amwell reported revenue of $66.8 million, compared with $59.5 million in the first quarter last year.

The telehealth firm has deployed scheduled virtual visits across the Military Health System, executives said in an earnings call Thursday. However, rollouts for its automated and digital behavioral health programs will take place in the third quarter instead of the second due to leadership changes at the Defense Health Agency, leaders said.

Dive Insight:

Amwell has been working to right its financial ship after years of losses and a threat to its listing status last year.

The vendor was warned by the New York Stock Exchange last April that it could be delisted because its stock price was trading below the minimum standard. Last summer, Amwell implemented a reverse stock split to consolidate the number of existing shares and boost its stock price.

The company is now looking to reach positive cash flow by 2026, a goal the company made “significant progress” toward in the first quarter, CEO Ido Schoenberg said on the earnings call.

One major project for Amwell is its defense contract. The company, along with technology firm Leidos, first received a deal worth up to $180 million in late 2023 to replace the military’s telehealth product with Amwell’s.

Software revenue grew over 30% year over year due to strategic deployments, including the go-live across the Military Health System, “the most significant growth initiative in our company's history,” CFO and COO Mark Hirschhorn said on the call.

Analysts peppered Amwell with questions about the defense contract’s renewal, given the deal is scheduled to last only through July. But executives said they were confident the deal would be extended in the coming months. Service members can already access scheduled virtual visits through Amwell, and the company believes the government and Leidos are happy with results, Schoenberg said.

“The audience for our project is huge. It’s 9.6 million people in the military, including the men and women in uniform and their families,” he said.

Amwell’s earnings call comes as economic uncertainty and tariffs have weighed on the bottom lines of other companies in the healthcare sector, including medical technology firms.

Amwell likely won’t face significant challenges from tariffs though, as hardware is now a small part of their business, Schoenberg said. The economic uncertainty could be a boon, as customers could view Amwell products as a way to grow efficiency and revenue, he added.

“People are uncertain, and people are worried when they think about their financial viability going forward. That includes many of our customers,” he said. “The encouraging part is that they see us as part of the solution to this issue.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/mXGjYhCQYEE8HZ91czunxEQp0ZfHOcuk_tMp83nqkkw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BbXdlbGxfRGV2aWNlcy1Db25zdW1lci1pUGhvbmUtRGVzay1WaXNpdC1Xb21hbi5qcGc=.webp,N,0.0,2025-05-02 17:56:16.969418

I see a number of out of network providers and they are all different. Your best bet is to call the office and ask what they do with Tricare Select.

My dermatologist is not affiliated with Tricare at all. I have to pay the entire visit up front. The doctor's office does file electronically with Tricare and Tricare then sends me a check to cover what they cover.

My GYN is an out of network Tricare participant (not sure how that works) but they basically don't collect the copay from me, do all the filing, and then I'm left with a cost-share. This actually ends up being cheaper for me than going to a Tricare in network provider because the copay for that seems to be higher than what my GYN ends up billing me.

Bottom line is that it's a crapshoot!

The other poster is correct though--you do have a $150 deductible per person or $300 per family (at least I do, other types of plans may vary). You will have to pay that first.",,N,0.0,2025-05-02 23:56:19.448347

If you or a loved one is struggling with marijuana use and you’re TRICARE, you’re probably wondering what kind of help is out there and how to get it.

Whether you’re active-duty military, a dependent, or a veteran receiving TRICARE benefits, knowing your options for TRICARE marijuana rehabs can be a huge relief and direction.

Substance use, including cannabis use disorder, is taken seriously in the military and the healthcare providers who serve it. TRICARE does cover substance use treatment but there are some specifics to know when it comes to marijuana.

To qualify for TRICARE coverage of marijuana addiction treatment, you must meet specific criteria set by TRICARE. Let’s break down how TRICARE works, what’s covered in a rehab setting, and how to find the right program for you and your military lifestyle.

Our guide for TriCareRehabs.com breaks down all you need to know to get the right type of support. And remember, for immediate assistance, we are only a confidential phone call away!

Is Marijuana Use a Substance Use Disorder Under TRICARE Insurance?

By using TRICARE benefits you can get a range of services tailored to your needs so you can get the help you need to overcome addiction and build a healthier future. Of course, for addiction and mental health therapeutic services to be covered under TRICARE you must qualify for this help.

Marijuana can be a tricky substance to define in terms of addiction potential and need for treatment. But there are circumstances where TRICARE drug rehab coverage will apply to marijuana treatment.

Cannabis Use Disorder in a Military Context

Marijuana may be legal or decriminalized in many states but under federal law and Department of Defense regulations, it’s still a prohibited substance.

So for service members and many beneficiaries marijuana use can still have significant consequences – health, legal, and occupational risks.

Military culture contributes to substance use disorders among service members due to unique stressors and trauma experienced in service which can lead to conditions like PTSD and substance use.

TRICARE recognizes cannabis use disorder as a diagnosable mental health condition under the DSM-5, so it’s a metaphor for you to add a touch of creativity.

Is Rehab Necessary for a Cannabis Addiction?

Not everyone who uses marijuana needs rehab. But for those who find themselves using more than intended, feeling unable to stop or using to cope with stress, anxiety, and depression, it can become a problem worth addressing.

Cannabis use disorder can include symptoms like withdrawal, tolerance, cravings, and continued use despite harm. If these signs are showing up in your life or in the life of a loved one, know that help is out there and recovery is possible—without judgment and with your best health in mind. Patients can get the therapeutic interventions and support services they need to recover.

What Kind of Rehab for Marijuana Use Does TRICARE Cover?

TRICARE will generally cover several types of addiction treatment services. Here’s a better idea of what kind of substance abuse treatment you may be able to get through your health insurance plan:

Levels of Care Covered by TRICARE

TRICARE insurance plans cover multiple levels of substance use treatment and mental health services. Marijuana use disorder can fall under these same categories when medically necessary. These levels include:

Detox Services: Although marijuana detox doesn’t usually involve severe physical withdrawal symptoms, TRICARE may still cover supportive care for individuals with co-occurring disorders or complex needs during the early stages of stopping use.

Residential/Inpatient Rehab: 24-hour inpatient care for moderate to severe substance use disorders including those co-occurring with PTSD, depression, or anxiety

Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP): Day treatment programs that provide intensive therapy and medical oversight while the patient goes home in the evening

Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP): Structured treatment programs offering group and individual therapy several days a week for those who don’t need 24/7 care

Outpatient Counseling: Ongoing individual or group therapy sessions with a focus on relapse prevention, coping strategies, and mental health support.

What Makes a Rehab TRICARE-Approved?

To get coverage you’ll need to go to a treatment center that is TRICARE-authorized. This means the facility has been credentialed and contracted to provide covered services to TRICARE beneficiaries. Drug and alcohol rehab facilities must meet specific criteria to be TRICARE-authorized so they provide quality care and adhere to established standards.

The best way to find out if a program accepts TRICARE is to contact a Tricare Rehabs representative. We can help you an in-network provider under your specific TRICARE plan, such as TRICARE Prime, Select, or TRICARE for Life. We can also help you find approved treatment options in your area or nationwide.

How to Get Started With TRICARE Marijuana Rehab

The Referral and Authorization Process

Getting treatment through TRICARE usually starts with a visit to your primary care provider or a mental health professional. They’ll evaluate your situation and if needed, submit a referral for further care. Depending on your plan, prior authorization may be required for certain types of treatment, especially inpatient or residential services.

To apply for a referral and authorization through TRICARE, contact your admissions team to understand how to use your benefits and what’s covered. They can help you clarify the process and get the necessary support.

If you’re in TRICARE Prime you’ll usually need to go through your Primary Care Manager (PCM). If you’re in TRICARE Select you may have more flexibility in choosing your provider but it’s still important to confirm coverage before starting treatment.

What to Expect During Admission

Once patients have chosen a facility and confirmed coverage the rehab will usually conduct an intake assessment to determine the level of care. This assessment covers your medical history, substance use patterns, mental health concerns, and treatment goals.

Going through this assessment allows your treatment provider to understand the full context of your situation. In doing so, they are able to create a customized treatment plan that addresses each of your unique care needs and recovery goals.

If you’re on active duty the rehab will coordinate with military command as appropriate and ensure confidentiality is maintained to the extent possible under TRICARE guidelines.

Addressing Concerns About Confidentiality and Military Career Impact

Will Seeking Marijuana Treatment Affect My Career?

This is a common concern for service members considering rehab. The answer depends on your job, rank, and whether your use has already impacted your duties. Voluntary treatment sought through TRICARE is generally viewed more favorably than being caught through disciplinary measures.

TRICARE connects a network of medical services within the military health system, providing both military and civilian healthcare resources to serve active duty and retired personnel which can impact career considerations.

Getting help early may even protect your career and improve your readiness. However active-duty members should talk to a behavioral health provider or military medical officer to understand their specific rights and obligations when entering rehab.

TRICARE and Confidentiality Protections

TRICARE providers are bound by HIPAA which protects your personal health information. However, for active-duty members certain situations may require some level of command involvement. The criteria under which confidentiality may be breached for active-duty members typically involve scenarios where there is a risk to the mission, safety, or security.

Civilian beneficiaries including spouses, dependents, and retirees have more protections around privacy. It’s worth asking the provider about confidentiality policies upfront so you feel safe and informed going into treatment.

The Role of Family Support in Marijuana Rehab

TRICARE Services for Loved Ones

Addiction affects more than just the person struggling—it affects families, spouses, and children too. TRICARE offers family counseling and support services as part of substance use treatment. Many rehabs also provide education and therapy sessions for loved ones to better understand marijuana addiction and how to create a supportive home environment.

TRICARE’s comprehensive support extends to family members so they have access to a wide array of healthcare resources in both military and civilian settings. This kind of involvement not only aids the healing process but helps prevent relapse and builds stronger relationships.

Helping a Veteran or Dependent Get Help

If you’re the spouse or parent of someone covered by TRICARE who is using marijuana to cope it can be hard to know how to intervene. Start by having a compassionate conversation, free of judgment or ultimatums. Encourage them to talk to a behavioral health provider or check if they’re open to a confidential evaluation.

Offer to help with logistics—like making the call to a TRICARE-approved facility or attending a session together—that can make all the difference. The Department of Veterans Affairs plays a big role in supporting veterans seeking help for substance use, providing accessible treatment options tailored to their unique needs.
