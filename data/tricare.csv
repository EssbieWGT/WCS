The companies were ordered to pay about $949 million in a settlement.

The case was initially filed in 2015 (the same year CVS acquired Omnicare) by a whistleblower: an Omnicare pharmacist who worked primarily in New Mexico. The whistleblower filed her suit under the False Claims Act (FCA) and state equivalents. These are laws that allow private individuals to file suit in the name of the U.S. (or states) and allege that healthcare programs like TRICARE, Medicare, or Medicaid are being defrauded. Whistleblowers are eligible to share in 15-30 percent of any ultimate recovery.

The crux of the allegations in this case is that Omnicare dispensed drugs to individuals in various long-term residential facilities that were not supported by valid prescriptions under state law and charged Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE for those drugs. The allegations touch patients in more than 3,000 facilities. Allegedly, the prescriptions were automatically assigned new prescription numbers, refills were automatically authorized, and prescriptions were periodically refilled in bulk without confirming that the prescriptions were still medically necessary or authorized by a physician.

CVS, as Omnicare’s parent company, was accused of “causing” the false claims to be submitted, as it was aware of deficiencies in Omnicare’s practices, but failed to correct them.

The federal government and 29 states joined the case in 2019, and it went to trial this Spring, in New York. After the trial, the jury unanimously found about $135 million in damages and held both companies, Omnicare and CVS, liable for the conduct. This was one of the largest-ever jury verdicts under the FCA.

In July, the Judge trebled (tripled) damages, which is required under the law, upping the damages figure to nearly $500 million. In the same ruling, the Judge also imposed penalties, which the law allows to attach to every false claim. The penalty amount was roughly another $500 million, with CVS Omnicare being held to have liabilities of $949 million. Additional motions are pending, including requests by Omnicare to toss the jury’s verdict and by CVS to be removed from the case. After those are decided, an appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals is possible.

Estimate Reviewed By David Newman Chief, Defense, International Affairs, and Veterans’ Affairs Cost Estimates Unit Kathleen FitzGerald Chief, Public and Private Mandates Unit","Bill Summary

H.R. 3838 would specify authorizations of appropriations totaling $884.3 billion for 2026. The bill also includes provisions that would affect the costs of defense programs that would be funded with discretionary appropriations in 2026 and future years. Those provisions mainly would affect force structure, compensation and benefits, and multiyear procurement of weapons systems. For 2026, those costs are included in the authorizations specified in the bill for that year. CBO expects that some costs after 2026 will be covered by specified authorizations in future National Defense Authorization Acts.

Estimated Federal Cost

The estimated budgetary effects of H.R. 3838 are shown in Table 1. Of the $884.3 billion authorized for 2026, nearly all—$882.9 billion—would be for activities within budget function 050 (national defense). The other $1.4 billion would fall within budget functions 270 (energy), 400 (transportation), and 700 (veterans benefits and services).

Basis of Estimate

For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 3838 will be enacted near the start of fiscal year 2026 and that the authorized amounts will be appropriated in 2026. CBO estimates that appropriation of the specified amounts would increase outlays by $868.1 billion over the 2026-2035 period; those outlays were estimated using historical spending patterns for similar programs.

Spending Subject to Appropriation

H.R. 3838 would specifically authorize appropriations of $884.3 billion for 2026. Almost all of that amount—$882.9 billion—would be for defense programs; $1.4 billion would be for nondefense programs (see Table 2).

The amount authorized for defense programs in 2026 would be $9.6 billion (or 1 percent) less than the $892.6 billion in discretionary funding that was appropriated for defense in 2025. That 2025 appropriation includes $11.8 billion in funding that was designated as an emergency requirement—mostly for shipbuilding and expenses related to natural disasters. Excluding that emergency-designated funding, the amount authorized for 2026 would be $2.1 billion more than the amounts appropriated in 2025. (Those appropriated amounts also exclude the estimated $153.4 billion in mandatory budget authority that was provided for defense activities by Public Law 119-21, the 2025 reconciliation legislation enacted on July 4, 2025; those mandatory amounts are available for obligation through 2029.)

H.R. 3838 would increase authorizations for all major categories of defense spending except procurement. Authorizations would increase for the following categories:

military personnel by $11.5 billion (or 6 percent),

operation and maintenance and revolving funds by $0.5 billion (or less than 1 percent),

research and development by $1.7 billion (or 1 percent), military construction and family housing by $1.4 billion (or 8 percent), and

atomic energy activities by $0.8 billion (or 3 percent).

Authorizations would decrease for procurement by $13.7 billion (or 8 percent).

For nondefense programs, the bill would specifically authorize $1.4 billion in 2026. That amount includes $1.1 billion for the Maritime Administration, $163 million for a Department of Veterans Affairs medical-facility demonstration fund, $77 million for the Armed Forces Retirement Home, and $13 million for the Naval Petroleum Reserves.

Estimated Costs for Selected Provisions for 2026 through 2030

H.R. 3838 includes provisions that would affect the costs of various defense programs in future years. The estimated effects of some of those provisions are shown in Table 3 and described below. Spending for affected programs and activities would be subject to the appropriation of the estimated amounts. The net costs of those defense-related provisions are not added to the total specified authorizations described above because CBO expects those activities would be funded from the amounts specifically authorized in this bill for 2026 and that, over the 2027–2030 period, the costs associated with those activities would be specifically authorized in future defense authorization acts.

Military End Strength. The bill would affect the force structure of the various military services by setting end-strength levels for 2026. Assuming those authorized end-strength levels continue after 2026, those changes would affect spending in future years.

For 2026, title IV would authorize end-strength levels for active-duty personnel and personnel in the selected reserve of 1,302,800 and 773,400, respectively. Of those reservists, 91,554 would serve full time on active duty in support of the reserves. In total, when compared with levels authorized under current law for 2025, active-duty end strength would increase by 26,100, and the selected-reserve end strength would increase by 100. The number of selected reservists who would serve in full-time support positions would decrease by 627. The specified end-strength levels for each component of the armed forces are detailed below along with CBO’s estimate of how those changes would affect costs of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Those costs for personnel include components of military compensation such as basic pay, allowances, bonuses, and health care, as well as operating costs for training and maintenance.

Active Duty. Section 401 would increase the authorized number of active-duty personnel by 26,100. End strength would increase by 12,300 for the Navy, by 11,700 for the Army, by 1,500 for the Air Force, and by 600 for the Space Force. The end strength authorized for the Marine Corps would remain the same. CBO estimates that the increase in active-duty personnel would increase costs to DoD by $22.5 billion over the 2026-2030 period.

Selected Reserve. Under section 411, the authorized end strengths for the six reserve components in DoD would decrease by a net of 1,400. Authorized end strength would decrease by 3,800 for the Army Reserve, by 2,000 for the Air National Guard, and by 200 for the Navy Reserve. End strength would increase for the Army National Guard by 3,000, for the Marine Corps Reserve by 1,100, and by 500 for the Air Force Reserve. CBO estimates that the net decrease would reduce DoD’s costs by $0.4 billion over the 2026‑2030 period.

In addition, section 411 would raise the authorized end strength for the Coast Guard Reserve by 1,500. CBO estimates that change would increase DHS’s costs by $0.4 billion over the 2026-2030 period.

Full-Time Selected Reserve. Section 412 would reduce by 627 the number of reservists who serve full time on active duty in support of the reserves in 2026 compared with currently authorized end-strength levels for 2025. That decline in full-time reservists would decrease DoD’s costs by $0.6 billion over the 2026-2030 period, CBO estimates.

Reserve Technicians.Section 413 would decrease the end strength for dual-status military technicians by 1,815. Those personnel are federal civilian employees who are required to maintain membership in the selected reserve as a condition of their employment. CBO estimates that spending on salaries for dual-status positions would decrease by $1.2 billion over the 2026-2030 period. (Changing the number of dual-status technicians would not change the number of reservists set by sections 411 and 412, discussed above. Thus, the only budgetary effects would be the decrease in civilian compensation.)

Defense Compensation and Benefits.H.R 3838 would affect compensation and benefits for uniformed personnel and civilian employees of DoD. That compensation includes bonuses and certain allowances.

Expiring Bonuses and Allowances. Section 611 would extend for one year DoD’s authority to enter into agreements to pay certain bonuses and allowances to military personnel. The authority to enter into such agreements currently expires after December 31, 2025. Some bonuses are paid in lump sums; others are paid in annual or monthly installments over several years of military service. Using information from DoD’s budget request for fiscal year 2026, CBO estimates that extending that authority through December 31, 2026, would cost $13.1 billion over the 2026‑2030 period.

Basic Needs Allowance. Section 621 would require DoD to exclude the basic allowance for housing from the calculation of gross household income used to determine eligibility for and the amount of the basic needs allowance, a monthly payment to service members whose gross incomes are less than 200 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The amount of the basic needs allowance is the difference between a service member’s monthly gross income and the monthly income level at 200 percent of poverty guidelines for the location in the United States where the member lives and the size of the member’s household.

On the basis of information from the department about service members’ pay and family sizes, CBO estimates that under current law, DoD will spend roughly $10 million on the basic needs allowance, paying about $300 a month, on average, to 3,000 families whose gross incomes—including the housing allowance—are less than the 200 percent threshold. If the housing allowance were excluded from the calculation of gross income, 52,000 families would receive an average of $760 each month, CBO estimates. Accounting for the time needed to implement the new policy, CBO anticipates that DoD would begin making payments using calculations required by the bill in April 2026 (halfway through the fiscal year). The authority to pay the basic needs allowance expires after December 31, 2027.

Thus, implementing section 621 would increase costs for the basic needs allowance by $230 million in 2026 and $805 million over the 2026-2030 period, CBO estimates.

Military Health System. Title 7 would increase costs paid from discretionary appropriations for the Military Health System by requiring DoD to cover costs associated with assisted reproductive technology (ART), eliminating out-of-pocket costs for reserve members enrolled in the TRICARE dental program, adding requirements to annual health assessments, and increasing reimbursements to children’s hospitals.

Assisted Reproductive Technology. Section 703 would require DoD to provide assisted reproductive technology to active-duty service members, members of the selected reserve, and their dependents as part of the regular TRICARE health benefit, beginning in fiscal year 2028. CBO anticipates that DoD would provide three services under the provision: in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and gamete retrieval and storage. CBO estimates that implementing section 703 would cost about $1.8 billion over the 2028-2030 period. Those costs include the cost of births that would result from IVF and IUI procedures. Costs would be less in the first year because childbirths will lag the implementation of the policy. The total estimated costs were reduced to account for the approximately $50 million that DoD currently spends each year on limited ART services offered to TRICARE beneficiaries as part of its medical training programs. The total estimated cost includes the following components:

CBO estimates that IVF procedures would cost about $300 million per year. To estimate the cost of covering IVF, CBO used data from Massachusetts, which requires private health insurance to cover those procedures, to project usage rates for the approximately 900,000 married service members and unmarried female members.Based on that information and on pricing made publicly available by various private clinics, CBO estimates that DoD would cover about 25,000 IVF cycles per year at a cost of $12,000 per cycle.

CBO estimates that IUI services would cost about $30 million per year. Using publicly available data from various private clinics and literature on IUI prevalence, CBO estimates that DoD would cover about 50,000 IUI procedures per year at an average price of $600 per procedure. Because ART is generally not covered by health insurance, the less expensive and less invasive intrauterine insemination procedures are a more common option; thus, IUI procedures are four times more common than IVF. However, if both IUI and IVF were made available with low out-of-pocket costs, CBO expects that TRICARE beneficiaries would instead use IUI at twice the rate of IVF as the general population. The estimate also includes the likelihood that some people will undergo IUI before attempting IVF.

CBO estimates that additional childbirths associated with covering ART would cost about $250 million per year. Based on a literature review, information from DoD, and data from Massachusetts compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CBO estimates that about a third of IVF cycles and about a tenth of IUI cycles would result in a successful childbirth, or about 15,000 births per year. However, CBO assumes that half of those births will occur under current law, either because beneficiaries will pay for ART services themselves or will eventually have a child without ART. Because pregnancies involving IVF and IUI have a higher probability of preterm deliveries and multiple births, CBO estimates that the average cost of each birth would be about $30,000—roughly double the cost of a typical childbirth.

CBO estimates that gamete retrieval and storage would cost about $70 million per year. Under the proposal, DoD may cover gamete retrieval and storage, even in the absence of conditions that cause infertility, for TRICARE beneficiaries who wish to delay or preserve their ability to start a family because of the demands and hazards of military service. There is significant uncertainty about whether DoD would extend that benefit and how many people would use it. Using information on gamete preservation in cancer patients, with adjustments to account for the likelihood that TRICARE beneficiaries would probably use the service at a much lower rate, CBO estimates that about 10,000 men and 3,000 women would undergo gamete retrieval each year. Using publicly available information on pricing for those procedures, CBO estimates that services for men would cost about $500 for retrieval and $125 annually for storage; the cost for women would be about $15,000 for retrieval (multiple cycles are often needed) and about $500 annually for storage.

The estimated costs associated with section 703 are subject to considerable uncertainty. It is difficult to anticipate the rules DoD would set for the use of ART services, and to predict the number of beneficiaries that would ultimately use those services. As a result, the costs of section 703 could be significantly more or less than CBO estimated.

Dental Benefits for Selected Reserve.Section 701 would eliminate all out-of-pocket costs for members of the selected reserve who choose to participate in the TRICARE dental program. CBO estimates that implementing that section would cost about $1.2 billion over the 2026‑2030 period. Under current law, reserve members who participate in the dental program must pay a portion of the insurance premium, as well as any copayments or coinsurance. Based on take-up rates for other reserve health benefits and national statistics on dental care, CBO estimates those changes would increase participation in the TRICARE dental program from less than 100,000 currently to about 425,000 members, and that each enrollee would cost DoD about $600 per year. (Currently, DoD’s share of dental costs average about $225 per enrolled member.)

Health Assessments. Section 702 would require a sports physical, electrocardiogram, metabolic panel, thyroid test, and brain peptide test as part of the annual health assessment for service members. That health assessment currently consists of a detailed questionnaire; additional testing is performed only when deemed necessary by the reviewing physician. CBO estimates that adding those new requirements would increase costs to DoD by about $1.0 billion over the 2026-2030 period. CBO estimates that implementing this section would increase the cost of each assessment by about $120, on average, the maximum allowable charges under TRICARE for those additional tests and exams. Based on the current number of service members, CBO estimates that about two million periodic health assessments are performed each year.

Payments to Children’s Hospitals. Section 723 would increase by 30 percent the reimbursements for outpatient services to children’s hospitals that serve many dependents of active-duty service members. Based on hospital reimbursement data from DoD, CBO estimates that seven hospitals per year would qualify for the additional payments, and that those hospitals currently receive about $175 million per year in outpatient reimbursements. Higher payments would be made the year following an eligibility determination, which CBO anticipates would occur in 2026. Therefore, increasing those reimbursements by 30 percent would cost about $50 million per year beginning in 2027 and total $200 billion through 2030.

Multiyear Procurement and Block Buy Contracts. H.R. 3838 would authorize DoD to enter into multiyear procurement contracts and block buy contracts to purchase certain helicopters and ships. Multiyear procurement is a special contracting method that permits the government to enter into contracts covering acquisitions for more than one year, even though the total funds required for all years are not appropriated at the time the contracts are awarded. Contracts that would cost more than $500 million must be specifically authorized in both an authorization act and an appropriation act. Lawmakers sometimes authorize contracts that would cost less than that threshold. Block buy contracts are also used to procure items over a period of more than one year, but are not subject to the same statutory restrictions as multiyear procurement contracts and do not require authorization in an appropriation act.

Black Hawk Helicopters. Section 111 would authorize the Army to enter multiyear contracts beginning in fiscal year 2027 to procure UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. The UH-60 is a medium‑lift helicopter that is used to transport military personnel and supplies. CBO estimates that under such contracts the service would procure 96 aircraft over the 2027‑2030 period at a cost of $3.3 billion. If the Army enters into a multiyear contract for 2027‑2031, then the service would require additional appropriations after 2030 to fulfill its contract obligations.

Aircraft Carriers.Section 121 would authorize the Navy to enter block buy contracts for not more than two Ford-class aircraft carriers: CVN-82 and CVN-83. Carriers are the largest ships in the fleet, and each carries an air wing of about 60 aircraft. CBO estimates that under such contracts, the Navy would buy one carrier at a cost of $8.9 billion over the 2026-2030 period. Additional funding would be required to complete the contract after 2030. The Navy estimates that CVN‑81, the most recently ordered carrier, will cost $15.2 billion by the time of its expected delivery date in 2032. The Ford-class program experienced schedule delays and cost growth in recent years. CBO expects that the cost of each aircraft carrier procured under the contracts authorized by section 121 would be similar to or slightly greater than CVN‑81.

Columbia-Class Submarines.Section 122 would authorize the Navy to enter a block buy contract beginning in fiscal year 2026 for not more than five Columbia-class submarines. Strategic ballistic missile submarines (SSBN), which carry Trident ballistic missiles, are one component of the United States’ nuclear triad. CBO estimates that under such a contract, the Navy would order one submarine per year at a cost of $40.3 billion over the 2026-2030 period. Additional funding would be required to complete the contract after 2030. The Navy estimates that SSBN-827, which was ordered in 2024, will cost $10.7 billion in total. The program experienced schedule delays and cost growth in recent years. CBO expects that the unit costs of the five submarines procured under the authority in section 122 would be similar to the most recently ordered submarine.

Barges.Section 125 would authorize the Navy to enter multiyear contracts beginning in fiscal year 2026 to procure Yard, Repair, Berthing, and Messing barges, which are vessels that provide temporary berthing and dining facilities for sailors when the ships to which they are assigned undergo maintenance. CBO expects that under such contracts, the Navy would buy five vessels over the 2026‑2030 period at a total cost of $180 million.

Construction Contracts. Section 2807 would authorize the DoD to enter into multiyear procurement contracts in fiscal year 2026 for the construction of military unaccompanied housing and child development centers. The authority would be limited to projects that use standardized and repeatable designs, demonstrate cost savings relative to single-year contracts, and are included in the current future years defense program. Based on DoD’s plans and the cost of similar facilities, CBO estimates the department would enter into contracts for 10 facilities in 2026 at a cost of $750 million over the 2026-2030 period.

Direct Spending and Revenues

Several provisions in H.R. 3838, described below, would affect direct spending and revenues. CBO estimates the effects of those provisions would not be significant over the 2026-2035 period because they would affect very few people, would have offsetting effects, or would involve transactions of very small amounts.

Section 512 would authorize the Marine Corps to activate certain Selected Reserve personnel for up to 545 days, an increase of 180 days from the limit in current law. Some of those Reservists could begin receiving retired pay earlier as a result.

Sections 211, 515, 818, 820, 856, 871, 876, 904, 1103, 1104, 1233, 1234, 1301, 1603, 1615, and 1842 would allow agencies to accept and spend, without further appropriation, amounts received from nonfederal entities for various purposes. Those collections are classified as offsetting receipts (or reductions in direct spending). Because CBO does not expect those agencies to spend all the funds they receive, the net effect of those sections would be an insignificant reduction in direct spending.

Sections 331 and 333 would affect DoD’s authority to use working capital funds for capital investment and minor construction projects at military depots. Through working capital funds, DoD is authorized to incur obligations in advance of appropriations. That type of authority, called contract authority, is classified as direct spending. Based on information from DoD about the current use of such contract authority, CBO estimates that the increase in direct spending from those provisions would be insignificant.

Section 534 would require the Selective Service System to automatically register for the military draft every male U.S. citizen and permanent resident between the ages of 18 and 26. Failure to register under current law constitutes grounds for civil and criminal penalties and can delay the ability of some lawful permanent residents to naturalize—that is, to become American citizens—which in turn can delay the receipt of some federal benefits. Because lawful permanent residents would be registered automatically under section 534, their ability to naturalize would not be delayed for failure to register. CBO expects any resulting increase in direct spending for federal benefits and reductions in revenues from penalties would be insignificant.

Sections 591 and 592 would authorize awards of the Medal of Honor that will not occur under current law. Recipients who are living receive monthly pensions that are paid from mandatory appropriations, and surviving spouses of deceased recipients could receive expanded health benefits or increased survivor benefits.

Section 651 would allow more people to use commissary stores on military bases. Newly eligible patrons using credit or debit cards would be required to pay a fee to offset the card transaction costs paid by the Department of the Treasury from mandatory appropriations.

Sections 705, 706, 707, 746, and 747 would change the cost of providing health benefits to service members, military retirees, and their dependents. Health benefits for military retirees who are eligible for Medicare or who are from the other uniformed services (the Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public Health Service) are paid from mandatory appropriations.

Section 804 would authorize DoD to indemnify contractors for the loss of work in process if they are unable to obtain insurance for such losses because of the classified nature of the contracts. If indemnification claims exceed available appropriations, any additional payments would be made from the Judgment Fund.

Sections 552, 553, 831, 855, 1205, and 1722 affect the number of people who would be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including fines, for prohibited conduct. Such penalties are recorded as revenues, and some of those penalties can be spent without further appropriation.

Section 1047 would authorize DoD to transfer ownership of five T-37B aircraft to the Arizona Aviation Historical Group. Some of those aircraft, or parts thereof, could be sold as excess defense articles under current law.

Section 1081 would expand DoD’s authority to seize unmanned aircraft that threaten military facilities. Proceeds from the sale of such assets are recorded as revenues, deposited into the Assets Forfeiture Fund, and later spent without further appropriation.

Section 1211 would extend through December 31, 2028, the President’s authority to transfer obsolete or surplus defense articles in the War Reserve Stockpile for Allies to Israel. Those transfers could affect the Foreign Military Sales program. The Foreign Military Sales trust fund can receive and expend amounts without further appropriation.

Section 1514 would revise federal acquisition regulations, which could affect direct spending by some federal agencies that are allowed to use fees, receipts from the sale of goods, and other collections to cover operating costs.

Section 2842 would authorize the Government Services Administration to convey 435 acres at the former Curtis Bay Depot in Maryland to a state development corporation. CBO anticipates that the sales price would likely be reduced to account for expected cleanup costs that would otherwise have been borne by the government.

Section 3532 would increase outlays from currently available balances for grant programs at the Department of Transportation. Changes in outlays from appropriations that are available under current law are classified as direct spending. CBO anticipates that any increase in the costs of such grants would be insignificant.

Uncertainty

Most estimates for this bill are affected by some level of uncertainty, but several provisions in particular are difficult to estimate.

The costs associated with providing assisted reproductive technology under section 703 could be significantly more or less than CBO estimated. The costs would depend on the number of people who use the services and the prices that DoD pays.

The costs associated with multiyear procurement and block buy contracts under sections 111, 121, 122, 125, and 2807 could be significantly more or less than CBO estimated. The total cost of such contracts would depend on unit costs, quantity, and procurement schedules. In addition, the department has not estimated any potential savings that could be realized from using those contracts for the specified programs, and CBO did not include an assumption of savings in its estimate.

Pay-As-You-Go Considerations

The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates that enacting the bill would change direct spending and revenues by between -$500,000 and $500,000 over the 2025-2035 period.

Increase in Long-Term Net Direct Spending and Deficits

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3838 would not significantly increase net direct spending in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 3838 would not significantly increase on‑budget deficits in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2036.

Mandates

H.R. 3838 would impose intergovernmental and private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). CBO estimates that the total cost of those mandates would not exceed the thresholds established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($103 million and $206 million in 2025, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation).

Mandate that Applies to Intergovernmental and Private Entities

Title IV would increase the costs of complying with existing intergovernmental and private-sector mandates under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by increasing the number of active-duty service members relative to current law. The SCRA requires public and private entities to grant service members and some reservists while on active duty with various protections for business and tax transactions, consumer contracts, and court procedures.

The SCRA, for example, allows service members to maintain a single state of residence for paying state and local personal income taxes and to request deferrals for certain state and local fees. It also requires creditors to charge no more than 6 percent interest on a service member’s loan obligations if the loan originated before the service member began active duty, and it allows courts to temporarily stay certain civil proceedings, such as evictions, foreclosures, and repossessions. SCRA prohibits lenders from using a service member’s personal assets to satisfy a trade or business liability during a period of military service. It also allows service members to terminate residential and auto leases and some consumer contracts under certain conditions.

Under the bill, the number of active-duty service members covered by SCRA would increase by 26,100, about 2 percent more than current authorization levels. The cost of the mandate would depend on various factors like how many service members use the SCRA, the frequency and duration of their deployment, and the market rates for car loans and mortgages. CBO estimates that the incremental cost of compliance for public and private entities would result in several millions of dollars in lost revenue each year.

Mandate for Intergovernmental Entities

Section 708 would establish a pilot program to offer enrollees of TRICARE supplemental insurance coverage for otherwise non-covered expenses. Coverage would be sold by not more than two insurance companies, and for the coverage offered, the programmatic requirements of the pilot program would supersede state laws on the licensing of insurance companies and solvency requirements, a preemption of state laws. The bill would require companies participating in the program to be licensed in every state. CBO estimates that the preemption of state laws would not result in an increase in expenditures or losses in revenue.

The company also provided updates on its clinical programs and corporate developments.

Financial Highlights

For the second quarter of 2025, BiomX reported a net loss of $6.0 million, compared to an income of $4.5 million in the same period of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the fair value of warrants issued as part of the company’s March 2024 financing. Research and development expenses were $5.0 million, down from $6.9 million in the second quarter of 2024, driven by reduced salary expenses, lower rent expenses, and increased grant funding. General and administrative expenses also decreased to $2.4 million from $2.8 million in the same period last year.

Business and Operational Highlights

BiomX achieved significant milestones in its clinical programs. The Phase 2 trial of BX211 for diabetic foot osteomyelitis showed a >40% reduction in wound size compared to placebo, with planning underway for a potential registrational study. Additionally, the Phase 2b trial of BX004 in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) commenced patient dosing, with topline results expected in Q1 2026. New data published in Nature Communications highlighted a ~500-fold bacterial reduction with BX004 versus placebo, with no detectable emergence of resistance.

Strategic Initiatives and Corporate Developments

BiomX is planning a potential registrational study for BX211, pending feedback from the FDA. The company is also in discussions with the U.S. Defense Health Agency regarding the next steps for the BX211 program. Additionally, BiomX expects to receive FDA feedback on the use of real-world evidence for BX004 in the second half of 2025, which could streamline the approval pathway.

Management's Perspective

Jonathan Solomon, Chief Executive Officer of BiomX, commented on the company's progress, stating, ""Positive Phase 2 results for BX211 in diabetic foot osteomyelitis demonstrated sustained, statistically significant improvements in wound size reduction, with over 40% reduction in ulcer size compared to placebo, and a favorable safety profile. In parallel, new peer-reviewed data for BX004 reported approximately 500-fold further bacterial reduction versus placebo and no detectable emergence of resistance, critical evidence supports the strength of our candidate BX004.""

Future Outlook

BiomX is positioned for multiple value-driving catalysts over the next 12 months, with the Phase 2b trial of BX004 underway and FDA feedback on the real-world evidence plan expected later this year. The company also plans to report topline results from the Phase 2b study in Q1 2026.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-13 11:56:42.204628

SAN ANTONIO, Aug. 12, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Advanced Surgical Retractor Systems, Inc. (ASR Systems) announced today that its flagship product, the TITAN CSR® retractor, was identified as the top-performing retractor system in a Department of Defense–funded study evaluating surgical retraction platforms for forward-deployed surgical teams.

The findings were presented at the Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS) 2025, the DoD's premier scientific meeting on military medicine. The study, ""Comparison of Self-Retaining Retractor Systems for Use in Forward-Deployed Surgical Teams,"" evaluated multiple commercially available systems — including the TITAN CSR® retractor, Bookwalter®, Alexis™, and Balfour — based on exposure quality, ease of use, portability, and suitability for damage control surgery in austere environments.

Statistically significant results from the study demonstrated that the TITAN CSR® retractor:

Provided the greatest surgical exposure of any retractor tested, measured by the visualized surface area of the abdominal cavity. Surgeons rated the TITAN CSR® retractor's exposure performance 4.9 out of 5.0 — nearly a perfect score and a critical advantage for life-saving operations where every centimeter of visibility matters.

Assembled and deployed faster than the Bookwalter®, a complex system requiring a table attachment and multiple components. Combat hospitals often lack the standard operating room beds with side rails needed to mount the Bookwalter®, meaning it is frequently not even an option for military surgeons. The TITAN CSR® retractor eliminates this limitation, and in high-acuity trauma cases, reducing setup time can help achieve control of hemorrhage faster and save valuable minutes in the operating room.

Received the highest overall perception of use among all systems tested, based on surgeon and surgical team ratings of setup simplicity, adaptability to different procedures, stability during use, and overall effectiveness in achieving optimal exposure.

The study was led by Dr. Mylea Echazarreta Cristner, who received the Young Investigator Award at MHSRS 2025 for this work.

""The TITAN CSR® retractor has been rigorously evaluated by the Department of Defense, with the study's significant findings showing it delivers the greatest surgical exposure, fastest setup, and highest overall surgeon satisfaction among systems tested,"" said Dr. Ramon Cestero, trauma surgeon, military veteran, and inventor of the TITAN CSR® retractor. ""It is in active use at military facilities as well as Level 1 trauma centers across the U.S. and Canada, where civilian surgeons have reported the same benefits in their own high-acuity cases — speed, exposure, and simplicity that directly impact patient outcomes.""

About the TITAN CSR® Retractor

Designed for austere, damage control, and trauma surgery, the TITAN CSR® retractor is a lightweight, post-free, self-retaining retractor that allows rapid setup and exceptional exposure without requiring a surgical table. It is actively used at multiple Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs), by special operations surgical teams, and at deployed Role 2 military hospitals around the world, including:

Brooke Army Medical Center

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center

Naval Medical Center San Diego (Balboa)

Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune

Naval Medical Center Portsmouth

Michaud Expeditionary Medical Facility, Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti (CLDJ)

Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) surgical teams

Importantly, the same design and performance advantages that make the TITAN CSR® retractor ideal for military use translate directly to civilian trauma centers and operating rooms. Many of the most significant advancements in civilian trauma surgery — from tourniquets to damage control laparotomy — originated in the military before becoming standard of care in civilian practice. The TITAN CSR® retractor follows that tradition, providing rapid setup, superior exposure, and unmatched versatility for multiple surgical specialties performing abdominal surgery in hospitals worldwide.

Key Features of the TITAN CSR® Retractor:

Post-Free™ Design – No table attachment required

Rapid Setup – Assembles in under 2 minutes

Portability – Compact and rugged for field or hospital use

Versatility – Used in trauma, general, and multiple other surgical specialties performing abdominal surgery

Reusable – Fully autoclavable, reducing long-term costs

However, this perspective overlooks critical issues with PBM practices and the broader implications for Louisianans, especially veterans.

Maness’ claim that banning PBM-owned pharmacies would harm veterans and rural residents is misleading. In truth, PBMs often exploit these populations by funneling them into mail-order systems that lack transparency and accountability. TRICARE, the federally funded health plan for service members and veterans, contracts with a Fortune 15 corporation whose PBM pushes beneficiaries to fill their prescriptions through its privately contracted PBM mail-order pharmacy. Veterans and service members may use the military base pharmacy, but there are only three military bases in the state.

Under the TRICARE PBM’s plan, basic generic medications like Atorvastatin, which costs an average of $8.47 for a 90-day supply without insurance, costs more than $500 through TRICARE’s PBM-owned mail-order pharmacy. In addition, TRICARE’s PBM offers Louisiana independent pharmacies contracts with reimbursements so unsustainably low that very few local pharmacies can afford to join the TRICARE network. How does lack of access to a local pharmacy benefit veterans and rural residents?

Big box and national chain pharmacies rarely set up shop in rural areas, and patients cannot have a relationship with a mail-order pharmacy or its call center.

When a family member passes away, it can feel overwhelming to deal with paperwork on top of the emotional burden. This article provides a few steps you should take in the weeks following your family member’s death. Taking these steps can help ensure your coverage continues without interruption.

“After losing a family member, your health coverage may not be the first thing on your mind,” said Zelly Zim, senior analyst, TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “But it’s important to understand how your loved one’s death may affect your TRICARE coverage, so you’re prepared for your family’s future.”

A death in the family is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. This means that surviving family members have 90 days to make eligible health plan changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet. Here’s what else you need to know.

Reporting the death

If your sponsor dies

You only have to report the death to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. For medical and dental care, the Defense Manpower Data Center gets information from the Social Security Administration or the sponsor’s service.

It may take some time for DMDC to get the information. If you prefer, you may notify DMDC of the death by:

Visiting a local Uniformed Services ID card office with a copy of the death certificate

Faxing a copy of the death certificate to 800-336-4416

Mailing a copy of the death certificate to:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

If your sponsor was retired, there are other steps you need to take depending on their service.

If another family member dies

If a family member who wasn’t the sponsor dies, contact the DMDC/DEERS Support Office to learn the necessary steps to report their death. Depending on your situation, your health plan options may also change from family to individual.

Coverage following the death

TRICARE continues to provide coverage for surviving family members. Plans and costs depend on:

If you're a spouse or a child:

Spouses can keep TRICARE unless they remarry. If a spouse decides to remarry, their TRICARE coverage will end unless they marry another active duty or retired service member.

Children can keep TRICARE up to normal age limits. After that, if they qualify for TRICARE Young Adult, they can purchase TYA coverage if their sponsor had TRICARE at the time of their death.

The sponsor's military status when they died:

Active duty: Children and spouses are considered transitional survivors for the first three years after the sponsor dies. Transitional survivors are eligible for special programs like the Extended Care Health Option. Spouses are covered as active duty family members (unless they remarry) for these three years. Then, they’re covered as retired family members. Children remain covered as ADFMs until they age out or lose TRICARE eligibility for other reasons.

Retired: Your health plan options and costs won’t change. Surviving spouses remain eligible unless they remarry. Children remain covered until they age out or lose eligibility for other reasons.

National Guard or Reserve member: Your sponsor’s status at the time of their death determines your TRICARE benefits. Visit Survivors of National Guard and Reserve Members to read more about your specific situation. (Note: Beginning Oct. 1, 2025, you can buy or continue coverage for up to three years from the date of the sponsor’s death. This is if your sponsor had TRICARE coverage at the time of their death.)

Filing claims

If you need to file a claim on behalf of the deceased, check out Filing Claims for forms and instructions.

For TRICARE For Life beneficiaries, you need to submit the TRICARE For Life Executor/Executrix of Estate Notification with the claim.

For beneficiaries with all other plans, submit an Authorization for Disclosure of Medical or Dental Information (DD Form 2870) with the claim.

“If I were on a civilian plan, she’d be covered until age 26,” she said.
For 2025, the monthly premium for TRICARE Young Adult Select – the plan chosen by most families with young adult dependents – is $337.
This bill would extend TRICARE coverage for young adult dependents to age 26 at no extra cost, aligning military healthcare with civilian standards and alleviating a significant financial burden for those who have served.
How would extending regular TRICARE coverage to age 26 help your family?","Currently, TRICARE coverage for dependent children ends at age 21. If they are enrolled as a full-time student at an approved institution of higher learning, they will remain covered until age 23. After that, military families face a difficult choice: pay steep monthly premiums for the TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program or risk leaving their young adults uninsured.

For one Air Force spouse, this means paying $337 monthly for TRICARE Select, a plan that still requires co-pays and prescription costs. “If I were on a civilian plan, she’d be covered until age 26,” she said. “After serving 22 years in the Air Force, I would expect a little bit more.”

Skyrocketing Premiums

Since 2015, TYA premiums have surged by 250%. For 2025, the monthly premium for TRICARE Young Adult Select – the plan chosen by most families with young adult dependents – is $337. Families who opt for TRICARE Young Adult Prime face premiums of $727 per month. These expenses hit hardest during transitional years when young adults are still finding their footing.

Elesha, an Air Force veteran, describes the increase in costs as “outrageous.” This situation is especially challenging for her as her two sons graduate and begin their careers. Her eldest son entered an extended internship program that does not offer health insurance after graduating from college in May 2024. While her family pays $365 annually for TRICARE Select, her son’s TYA Select premium is $4,044 a year, an increase of 1,007%. “Next year, both my sons will need coverage. That’s over $8,000 annually, just to keep them insured while they launch their careers.”

The Civilian Standard

The Affordable Care Act requires plans that offer dependent coverage to make this coverage available at no additional cost until the adult child reaches the age of 26. Thousands of military families would benefit if TRICARE adopted similar standards, gaining three to five more years of affordable coverage while young adults finish school, complete internships, or search for meaningful employment.

For Brandy, whose son is graduating from college this year, the disparity is evident: “The young adult plan is way more expensive than he can afford at this time. Most other insurance plans cover a young adult up to the age of 26. Why doesn’t TRICARE? A graduate needs time to enter the workforce and find a job that provides adequate health care,” she said.

The Legislative Solution

Lawmakers are beginning to take action. Senators Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Representatives Pat Ryan (D-NY) and Jen Kiggans (R-VA) have reintroduced a bipartisan bill called the Health Care Fairness for Military Families Act. This bill would extend TRICARE coverage for young adult dependents to age 26 at no extra cost, aligning military healthcare with civilian standards and alleviating a significant financial burden for those who have served. This change would provide stability during a critical life stage, whether it involves finishing a degree, completing an internship, or starting a first job.

Bottom Line

Military families should not be penalized for their service. Aligning TRICARE’s dependent coverage with civilian standards is a common-sense, bipartisan solution that would provide young adult dependents (and their parents) with the healthcare security and peace of mind they deserve. The National Military Family Association (NMFA) will continue to advocate for this change on Capitol Hill, but we need your voice to make it happen.

Tricare agrees we are ineligible. Yet Medicare says Tricare has to update ineligibility with the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center. Otherwise Medicare keeps sending EOB to Tricare.

I call Tricare, they say we are ineligible and offer a letter of ineligibility. They don’t know anything about updating the BC&RC. They transfer me to DMDC to see if DEERS needs updated.

DMDC says we are ineligible for Tricare and nothing they can do to help. Also never heard of the BC&RC.

So I call Medicare again, and they say only Tricare can make this change in the system.

I call BC&RC out of desperation to offer to update them…they say Tricare never should’ve attached to Medicare and they don’t know how to get it taken off except for Tricare to do it.

Why this matters…I’m eligible for CHAMPVA IF ineligible for Tricare. But with the Medicare system saying I have OHI of Tricare, that deems me ineligible for CHAMPVA.

Weight loss drugs will no longer be covered for TRICARE For Life (TFL) beneficiaries as of Aug. 31 – a policy change that has left many beneficiaries with questions regarding their care.

Answers to some of the more common questions can be found below. This page will be updated as more information becomes available, or should the new rule be revised. Keep up with the latest on this issue and others via MOAA’s news page.

Q. Will I lose coverage for my medication?

A. TFL beneficiaries who have been prescribed a GLP-1 medication for weight loss – such as Zepbound, Wegovy, or Saxenda – will no longer have that medication covered as of Aug. 31. They must pay 100% of the cost of the weight loss drug as of that date, even if they have an approved prior authorization.

TFL beneficiaries who have been prescribed a GLP-1 medication for Type 2 diabetes – such as Ozempic, Mounjaro, or Victoza – will maintain their coverage.

Q. Why has my coverage changed?

A. The change is part of the Defense Health Agency’s implementation of “regulatory controls on weight loss medication coverage,” according to an Aug. 5 TRICARE.mil article. Direct-care recipients and some other, smaller, coverage pools also saw their coverage removed as a result of the implementation.

You are not impacted by this change if you are enrolled in any of the following plans:

TRICARE Prime

TRICARE Select

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

Continued Health Care Benefit Program

Q. Who should I contact with follow-up questions about my coverage, diagnosis, or prescription?

A. Your provider may be able to offer alternative treatment options. Questions about specific medicines or prescriptions can be directed to Express Scripts.

Q. What is MOAA doing about this change to my coverage?

A. MOAA is researching legislative and regulatory history on TRICARE’s weight loss medication restrictions as a first step in developing a response.

Q. How much will my weight loss drug cost if I have to pay for it out of pocket?

A. Costs vary widely based on a variety of factors, to include dosage size, drug type, where the drug is being purchased, and whether the user is eligible for any savings plans or other insurance products. MOAA cannot recommend a specific provider or retail outlet, but the manufacturers of GL-1 weight loss medications do provide some pricing information.

What You Need to Know: The White House has released a sweeping AI action plan outlining more than 90 policy actions, prioritizing responsible deployment of AI in health care. CMA and AMA are calling for the plan to incorporate stronger physician leadership, robust privacy protections, and safeguards to prevent bias and patient harm.

The White House recently unveiled its artificial intelligence (AI) action plan identifying more than 90 recommended changes in federal policy that the administration will pursue in the coming weeks and months. The plan is built on three pillars: accelerating innovation, building AI infrastructure, and leading in international diplomacy and security.

The administration emphasized its commitment to the responsible development and deployment of augmented intelligence – often called artificial intelligence – to improve health outcomes.

Key elements of the administration’s plan, include commitments to:

Build public and professional trust through transparent, ethical oversight.

Accelerate national standards for safety, performance, and interoperability – with strong physician representation.

Create a coordinated federal regulatory approach to close gaps and reduce duplication.

Invest in workforce education and upskilling to support safe adoption.

Promote “secure-by-design” AI systems to protect health infrastructure.

The American Medical Association (AMA) is urging the Trump administration to devote more attention to several key areas, including:

Ensuring meaningful physician leadership in shaping AI policy, regulation and implementation.

Strengthening patient privacy protections – especially in open-data and open-source environments.

Establishing clear liability frameworks to address physician concerns and appropriately assign accountability for AI errors and performance issues.

Addressing equity and bias to prevent patient harm and avoid worsening health disparities.

Adopting a whole-of-government approach, including states, to ensure balanced and consistent regulatory oversight.

The California Medical Association (CMA) is committed to ensuring that AI enhances, rather than undermines, the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship, and recently a CMA-sponsored landmark bill to ensure human oversight and patient safety are core components for the use of AI in health care settings was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. As AI-enabled tools become more common in both clinical care and administrative functions, it is critical that they are designed, developed and deployed in ways that are ethical, equitable, transparent and evidence-based.

CMA has also raised concerns that AI – whether in the form of diagnostic algorithms, health plan decision-making tools, or patient-facing chatbots – must not interfere with physician medical judgment or limit patient access to care. Strong policy safeguards are essential to ensure that these technologies support, not replace, clinical expertise, and that their use is clearly communicated to both physicians and patients.

CMA will be closely tracking how the administration’s AI policy agenda unfolds and will continue to advocate for strong safeguards that protect patients, uphold physician judgment and advance equitable care.",https://www.cmadocs.org/Portals/CMA/Images/Newsroom%20Icons/federal-issues.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-12 14:56:16.924551

On the symposium’s first day, the OPMED Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management team took home the award for Outstanding Program Management (Team) in recognition of their Freeze-Dried Plasma development program.
“Our focus has always been to enhance Warfighter readiness and to provide a solution for military medical providers that works across the spectrum of conflict.

MHSRS is a DoD-sponsored event that brings together leading experts from across the military and medical development industry to discuss the current and future states of military medicine, and to showcase the latest devices and technologies designed to preserve and protect the lives of America’s Warfighters.

During the event, OPMED experts showcased the medical solutions they are developing through partnerships and agreements with DoD and private sector organizations. The team’s current programs are designed to fill capability gaps across the spectrum of combat casualty care – from point of injury and evacuation to hospitalization – with an emphasis on Large-Scale Combat Operations in remote, austere environments.

“Future conflicts will present complex and evolving challenges unique to modern warfare,” said U.S. Army Col. Owen L. Roberts, program manager for OPMED. “We are driving rapid capability development to deliver critical solutions directly to frontline medics. Our mission is clear: field life-saving technologies that protect service members on the battlefield and return them to duty without delay.”

During the symposium, OPMED took center stage as a key element of the Defense Health Agency’s overall medical development and acquisition strategy. On the symposium’s first day, the OPMED Warfighter Protection and Acute Care project management team took home the award for Outstanding Program Management (Team) in recognition of their Freeze-Dried Plasma development program.

“I’m incredibly honored to be part of the team that has brought FDP to force-enabling reality. Blood products are a critical and urgent need across the Department of Defense and the service branches, and FDP is a game-changer to fill capability gaps at the front line,” said Andy Atkinson, the FDP product manager with WPAC. “Our focus has always been to enhance Warfighter readiness and to provide a solution for military medical providers that works across the spectrum of conflict.

“FDP, because it is so user-friendly, portable, cost-effective, and shelf stable, is form-fitted for use by both conventional and special forces literally anywhere in the world,” he added. “This award is a huge indicator that what we and our commercial partners are developing and acquiring is both urgently needed and in line with what our Joint Force partners need to save lives during future conflicts. I could not be any more proud of this team and our efforts.”

Additionally, OPMED team members, along with representatives from several military service branches, participated in the DHA-hosted “Spurring Innovation to Deliver Joint Force Medical Solutions” breakout session on day two of the conference. Panel discussions centered on the challenges facing military medicine, the DHA approach to acquisition of medical products, and the opportunities to use novel acquisition pathways to expedite product delivery to Warfighters. During the symposium’s exhibit hours, team members met with hundreds of current and potential partners to highlight the strength of OPMED’s core programs and show their persistent focus on meeting the needs of the U.S. Joint Force, according to Roberts.

“The accelerating pace of warfighting technology leaves no room for complacency,” he said. “Getting lifesaving capabilities to the front lines is critical to preserving Joint Force lethality and staying ahead of modern threats. As the DoD’s Joint medical capability developer, OPMED stands ready to deliver exactly what the Joint Force needs to fight and win – anywhere, against any adversary.”

When a family member passes away, it can feel overwhelming to deal with paperwork on top of the emotional burden. This article provides a few steps you should take in the weeks following your family member’s death. Taking these steps can help ensure your coverage continues without interruption.

“After losing a family member, your health coverage may not be the first thing on your mind,” said Zelly Zim, senior analyst, TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “But it’s important to understand how your loved one’s death may affect your TRICARE coverage, so you’re prepared for your family’s future.”

A death in the family is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. This means that surviving family members have 90 days to make eligible health plan changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet. Here’s what else you need to know.

Reporting the death

If your sponsor dies

You only have to report the death to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. For medical and dental care, the Defense Manpower Data Center gets information from the Social Security Administration or the sponsor’s service.

It may take some time for DMDC to get the information. If you prefer, you may notify DMDC of the death by:

Visiting a local Uniformed Services ID card office with a copy of the death certificate

Faxing a copy of the death certificate to 800-336-4416

Mailing a copy of the death certificate to:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

If your sponsor was retired, there are other steps you need to take depending on their service.

If another family member dies

If a family member who wasn’t the sponsor dies, contact the DMDC/DEERS Support Office to learn the necessary steps to report their death. Depending on your situation, your health plan options may also change from family to individual.

Coverage following the death

TRICARE continues to provide coverage for surviving family members. Plans and costs depend on:

If you're a spouse or a child:

Spouses can keep TRICARE unless they remarry. If a spouse decides to remarry, their TRICARE coverage will end unless they marry another active duty or retired service member.

Children can keep TRICARE up to normal age limits. After that, if they qualify for TRICARE Young Adult, they can purchase TYA coverage if their sponsor had TRICARE at the time of their death.

The sponsor's military status when they died:

Active duty: Children and spouses are considered transitional survivors for the first three years after the sponsor dies. Transitional survivors are eligible for special programs like the Extended Care Health Option. Spouses are covered as active duty family members (unless they remarry) for these three years. Then, they’re covered as retired family members. Children remain covered as ADFMs until they age out or lose TRICARE eligibility for other reasons.

Retired: Your health plan options and costs won’t change. Surviving spouses remain eligible unless they remarry. Children remain covered until they age out or lose eligibility for other reasons.

National Guard or Reserve member: Your sponsor’s status at the time of their death determines your TRICARE benefits. Visit Survivors of National Guard and Reserve Members to read more about your specific situation. (Note: Beginning Oct. 1, 2025, you can buy or continue coverage for up to three years from the date of the sponsor’s death. This is if your sponsor had TRICARE coverage at the time of their death.)

Filing claims

If you need to file a claim on behalf of the deceased, check out Filing Claims for forms and instructions.

It’s called the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Overview.” The training is in accordance with the requirements of Section 725 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so.

Additionally, veterans may have been exposed to depleted uranium from vehicles or being wounded by a fragment containing depleted uranium.","The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to work closely together to address military-related toxic material/environmental exposures from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through the VA’s 2014 Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry. In June 2025, the Defense Health Agency added new training requirements for healthcare providers on toxic exposures and burn pits.

On Aug. 1, 2024, the VA launched a redesigned registry after extensive feedback showing veterans found it too challenging to enroll in the program. The new registry helps inform effort to improve benefits as part of the PACT Act of 2022, also known as the “Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act.”

The VA and the DOD also expanded PACT Act benefits and VA health care for service members and veterans who served in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, as well as related operations in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and the Vietnam War.

Key updates to the registry include:

• Automatic enrollment of more than 4.7 million veterans and service members who meet the expanded eligibility criteria based on DOD manpower and deployment records

• Information from all military-exposure databases

• Removal of a 144-question survey required to participate in the registry

• Establishment of an easy opt-out process for enrollees

New Training Required

The new DHA training is for healthcare providers at all military hospitals and clinics. It’s called the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Overview.” The training is in accordance with the requirements of Section 725 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.

Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so. It also requires providers to review the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry DoD Health Care Provider Clinical Toolbox.”

Provider Training Updates

The updated training includes expanded information about:

• AHOBPR eligibility criteria and the new auto-enrollment process

• Clinical content such as recommended diagnostic codes and how to manage patient encounters related to airborne hazards and open burn pit exposures

• Information about the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, and new information on the Military Health Systems’ Periodic Occupational and Environmental Monitoring Summary. Both the web-based ILER and the monitoring summaries of POEMS track and manage exposure data.

For medical personnel seeking more information on deployment-related environmental exposures, continuing education-eligible training is offered by the VA’s War Related Illness and Injury Study Center.

The resource contains:

• Background information on airborne hazards and the registry

• Guidance for conducting a medical evaluation associated with environmental exposure concerns

• Resources for providers to review and share with service members and other healthcare providers to improve health outcomes for those exposed

Educational materials regarding military exposures are regularly updated, so providers should plan to check in for any changes in guidance.

Related Illnesses

In addition to burn pits, oil well fires, smoke, sand, dust, the mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air (particulate matter), and regional pollution from the climate and environment, the VA links nine infectious diseases to military service in Southwest Asia.

The key to the team’s success is summed up in one word: delivery.

OPMED PMO, part of the Defense Health Agency, is the go-to element within the Department of Defense for developing, acquiring, and delivering world-class treatment solutions for the U.S. joint force while leveraging its reputation as the heart of modernized frontline medical support.

Recently, OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care team members made good on years of effort in blood product development, delivering to meet the unique needs of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. WRNMMC, the nation’s flagship military medical center, is also known as “the President’s Hospital,” thanks to its longstanding tradition of caring for members of the Executive Branch.

Working with industry partner Octapharma and several DOD partners – including the Armed Services Blood Program; Medical Readiness Command, Europe; U.S. European and Africa Commands; Andrews Medical Support Squadron at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland; and the Armed Services Blood Bank Center – WPAC coordinated and facilitated the procurement and delivery of freeze-dried plasma (FDP) for inclusion in Walter Reed’s medical supply.

FDP is a lifesaving treatment option for blood replacement therapies in operational and tactical environments. Octapharma and WPAC collaborated to obtain Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization approval for the FDP known as octaplasLG Powder in August 2024. The EUA authorizes military procurement, storage, and use of octaplasLG Powder when no other FDA-approved treatments, like fresh frozen plasma, are available, or when the use of traditional plasma is not practical in a compressed time continuum during some military operations, according to Kendra Lawrence, Ph.D., WPAC’s project manager.

“The FDP program is our highest priority and is delivering a transformative medical solution to meet the needs of our military end users: the medical providers on the front lines,” said Lawrence. “To be able to collaborate with the Armed Services Blood Program and Armed Services Blood Bank Center to provide this critical capability at the highest levels of the U.S. government is a testament to the importance of FDP in critical care situations when no other alternative is available.”

Last month, the WPAC team, along with representatives from Octapharma, provided training to key WRNMMC medical staff on the reconstitution and safe use of FDP during emergency treatment. Lawrence said the training event was well received, and the medical staff has indicated a need for continued training for both current and new personnel.

WPAC has a wide portfolio, and its product managers develop, test, field, and sustain innovative medical solutions to address high-priority capability gaps for DOD medical providers in clinical and deployed environments. FDP is a notable recent success with broad applicability in both military and civilian health care, according to Andy Atkinson, the FDP product manager with WPAC.

“FDP is a shelf-stable blood product that was developed with the military end user in mind – it is specifically designed to be used during an emergency involving agents of military combat,” said Atkinson. “Our goal was to develop and acquire a capability that fills a critical gap in combat casualty care for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and special forces communities.

“Providing this treatment to the expert providers at ‘the President’s Hospital’ is a unique and very important step in the project’s development, and we are honored to have helped play a role,” he added.

Walter Reed General Hospital opened in 1909 and tended to numerous U.S. presidents and injured service members in Washington, D.C. In 2011, the Army hospital was merged with the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to form the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In addition to providing medical evaluation and treatment to presidents, members of Congress, and other high-ranking officials, Walter Reed provides health care for our nation’s fighting forces, retirees, and their families.

If you have a young adult in your family who no longer qualifies for coverage under active-duty service members due to age, you may want to consider encouraging them to enroll in TRICARE Young Adult. It can cover a multitude of treatment options, which can save thousands in the long run.

Under the Affordable Care Act, all insurance companies are mandated to cover both substance use issues and mental health concerns the same way they treat medical issues. These core issues are considered one of the ten essential health benefits that cannot be denied.

That being said, active duty family members who have aged out may still have to cover some costs with TRICARE-authorized providers. But you can get help managing prescription drugs, residential treatment plans, and more.

Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs with Your TRICARE Plan

You want the best treatment centers for a young adult: ones that are knowledgeable about the unique needs and experiences of those who are underage or just past the cusp of adulthood. The problem for many families is that they must figure out how to manage out-of-pocket costs.

What will you be responsible for when it comes to residential treatment options and TRICARE coverage?

If you choose a TRICARE network provider, it’s possible that the cost of your young adult’s treatment may be covered in full. While they require a pre-authorization for many hospitalization services, family members can rest easier knowing that an approved facility is safe and financially feasible.

On the other hand, you may choose an out-of-network provider for a lot of different reasons. If this is the case, then you may have more cost-sharing responsibilities in the form of copayments for care or money paid toward your deductible.

Payment options may be available at the treatment centers you select, so be sure to ask about any of the anticipated costs during your placement.",https://tricarerehabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TRICARE-Young-Adult-Addiction-Treatment-TRICARE-REHABS.webp,N,0.0,2025-08-12 14:56:29.280242

The rules for certain weight loss medications provided under TRICARE plans are changing, and some patients may find their previous authorizations are no longer valid at the end of August 2025.

A TRICARE press release on these changes asks, “Are you a TRICARE beneficiary taking a drug for weight loss”, including GLP-1 medications, “like Zepbound or Wegovy? Do you have questions about what’s covered—and why?”

According to TRICARE officials, more patients are taking such medications than ever at press time, and coverage for these treatments is dependent on the patient’s status, medical condition, and other factors.

TRICARE announced the Defense Health Agency “is implementing regulatory controls on weight loss medication coverage” with new rules going into effect at the end of August 2025 that change authorization for GLP-1 treatment.

“If you have TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select, these medications are still covered in certain circumstances. Otherwise, if you have an approved prior authorization for weight loss drugs, it’s no longer valid. You’ll need to see your provider to discuss your options.”

If you have been prescribed these medications or are considering them, it’s important to check your TRICARE coverage to see whether you’ll be approved for these prescriptions after August 31, 2025.

If you aren’t covered going forward, ask your care provider about alternatives, which may include medication, counseling, and lifestyle changes depending on circumstances.

TRICARE claims those affected will receive notice by U.S. mail, but if you have not been notified, contact TRICARE immediately.

Which Medications Are Affected

According to the TRICARE official site, plans cover weight loss medications, including Saxenda, Wegovy, Zepbound, Qsymia, Phentermine or Contrave, for weight loss if the patient is enrolled in TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Those who qualify for these benefits from a premium-based plan may also be prescribed the medications listed above. Those TRICARE premium-based plans include:

TRICARE Young Adult

TRICARE Reserve Select

TRICARE Retired Reserve

Continued Health Care Benefit Program

TRICARE also covers Trulicity, Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza to treat Type 2 Diabetes. According to the official site, coverage requires prior authorization.

“Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Victoza require medical necessity forms for a formulary copayment and coverage at a military pharmacy,” and there are certain exclusions, including those who have TRICARE For Life or direct care only access.

TRICARE makes an exception for GLP-1s used to treat diabetes. These drugs “continue to be covered for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when medically necessary and when prior authorization requirements are met.” No changes have been made to the cost-sharing features of this healthcare coverage.

What To Know About TRICARE Weight Loss Drug Coverage

TRICARE covers weight loss medications when the patient meets the right conditions, including medical necessity.

We help all insurance holders, whether you have TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Young Adult, or TRICARE Retired Reserve.","Finding Alcohol and Drug Treatment With TRICARE Reserve Select

If you are looking for help, whether for yourself or a loved one, you likely know that mental health services and substance abuse treatments can be difficult to find and access without excessive costs, no matter which of the major insurance providers you have.

But as a member of the Armed Forces or an Armed Forces family, one of the perks of a military career is access to TRICARE insurance coverage. But does TRICARE Reserve Select cover addiction treatment?

Fortunately, the ACA mandates that all insurance companies cover substance abuse help as one of their essential health benefits, and TRICARE is no different. It covers medically necessary treatment for all alcohol and drug use, from inpatient to outpatient care. In-network providers not only have a lower cost, but are required for TRICARE holders in many instances.

At TricareRehabs.com, we can help you find the perfect placement for your mental health and substance use issues while getting the most out of your insurance coverage. Here’s what you need to know about finding services for Reserve Select clients.

TRICARE Reserve Select Rehab Coverage and Treatment Options

Facing substance abuse on your own is challenging at best. Most people who struggle with addiction will require professional help at some level. What does your TRICARE insurance plan cover when you find yourself in need of inpatient and outpatient treatment centers?

The good news is that addiction treatment is covered by TRICARE as long as it is psychologically or medically necessary. If a medical professional can prove that you are in need of treatment centers to get sober, then it is likely that TRICARE Reserve Select coverage will help.

This is part and parcel of the changes made to insurance plans with the Affordable Care Act in 2010. All insurance companies were mandated to cover the essential health benefits, including substance abuse and mental health services. TRICARE is no exception to this executive order.

When you’re ready to seek help for your addiction, what can you expect to be covered by TRICARE insurance?

Drug and Alcohol Detox Covered by TRICARE Reserve Select Insurance

The first stage of treatment for substance abuse usually requires a residential treatment program with a specific detox option. During these early stages of recovery, you could require medical help to stabilize your condition. One of the best options is medication-assisted treatment.

This is typically best administered when you can be under around-the-clock care by a team within the relative safety of a medical program. When you seek treatment, the hospital or your primary care doctor might refer you to this intensive level of care before offering you inpatient and outpatient rehab.

Inpatient Rehab as a Step Down from Detox

Detox programs naturally transition to inpatient rehab care, where you have 24/7 access to counselors and other staff members who help you learn to navigate life without drugs. It’s not as intensive as your detox program, but it can still be quite expensive if not covered by TRICARE.

As long as you continue to make progress and need this level of care, TRICARE Reserve Select typically covers residential treatment facilities for your care. Only once you are stabilized will they help transition you to an outpatient program that suits your needs.

Outpatient Treatment at a TRICARE Rehab

After transitioning from residential treatment centers, outpatient is usually the next logical step. Your TRICARE insurance will likely pay for two types of outpatient treatment for your substance abuse or mental health condition: partial hospitalization programs and intensive outpatient programs.

Partial Hospitalization Programs for More Intensive Help

Partial hospitalization programs are the first step down from inpatient rehab. You’ll spend the majority of the day in treatment centers while returning to sleep in your own bed at night. TRICARE covers this for a brief period of time, depending on how much progress you make and medical necessity.

PHP programs give you an opportunity to practice new skills while still making the best use of all of the evidence-based treatments you found in inpatient care.

Intensive Outpatient Programs to Transition Out of Rehab

Once withdrawal symptoms are under control and inpatient treatment is no longer required, intensive outpatient rehab is often the next best thing. You’ll spend a few hours each day attending treatment in the form of one-on-one therapy and group therapy sessions.

Then, you’re free to leave to return to work or spend time with loved ones. You can start building your bridge back to your everyday life piece by piece. This is the first step toward traditional outpatient care with individual therapy several days each week, coupled with community-based resources like Twelve Step meetings.

Where to Find Treatment Providers with TRICARE Reserve Health Insurance

The good news is that an addiction treatment plan is possible for those with a TRICARE insurance plan, including Reserve Select. With this type of plan, clients receive the freedom to choose where they want to receive help. While some plans limit you to in-network providers, TRICARE Reserve Select allows you to go anywhere.

An in-network provider might warrant comprehensive coverage for inpatient and outpatient rehab care. An out-of-network provider may be covered in part but have more out-of-pocket costs associated with them in the long run. The choice is yours to find treatment options that work for you and your family.

When you need substance abuse treatments, it helps to know that TRICARE covers drug and alcohol addiction as well as the skills you need to function in everyday life. They will help you locate all of the resources you need for evidence-based therapies to help you take steps toward sobriety.

“We take this action to ensure that VA provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families,” the notice said.
Opponents argue the ban would affect the reproductive health care of veterans by possibly delaying needed care, particularly those living in states with abortion bans.
In 2024, over 50,000 women veterans enrolled in the VA medical health care, a 20% increase, the largest in enrollment on record, according to VA News.
Under the section listing proposed reforms to the Veterans Health Administration, the document reads: “Rescind all departmental clinical policy directives that are contrary to principles of conservative governance, starting with abortion services and gender reassignment surgery.","The United States Department of Veterans Affairs is proposing a ban on all abortion services for veterans who receive care through the VA health care system, including in cases of rape or incest.

According to a notice published in the Federal Register on Aug. 4, the proposal would remove abortion and abortion counseling from the list of services covered under both the VA’s medical benefits and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

“We take this action to ensure that VA provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families,” the notice said.

Opponents argue the ban would affect the reproductive health care of veterans by possibly delaying needed care, particularly those living in states with abortion bans. In 2024, over 50,000 women veterans enrolled in the VA medical health care, a 20% increase, the largest in enrollment on record, according to VA News.

“If someone is in the VA system, that’s where they’re getting their care, and something goes wrong with their pregnancy, if they’re not even allowed to be counseled about their options, that is literally malpractice,” said Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, an obstetrician-gynecologist and CEO of the nonprofit, and nonpartisan reproductive health organization Power to Decide.

“I work and see patients in Baltimore, Maryland. I see a lot of patients who rely on TRICARE and who have been in and out of the VA system. And those people are often, you know, many of them want to get pregnant. Many of them do get pregnant and then face complications during their pregnancy, and they deserve to have the best standard of care, including counseling about all their options whenever there is a case of something that could go wrong,” McDonald-Mosley said.

According to a 2023 study from the nonprofit National Partnership for Women and Families, over 400,000 veterans live in states with abortion bans.

Reporting from Military.com concluded that 88 abortions were provided by the VA in 2023, 64 of which were necessary due to the health of the pregnant person.

The proposal claims the VA will continue to allow abortions in cases where a pregnant person’s life is in danger. But, Jackii Wang, senior legislative analyst at National Women’s Law Center, told the American Independent that exceptions to abortion bans can be complicated and can put a patient’s life at risk.

“We have seen plenty of cases of women dying because their care was delayed for too long. I think the bottom line here is that it’s a really cruel decision from an administration that purports to support veterans and those who served,” Wang said. “We believe that everyone deserves access to abortion care, but if we’re talking about veterans in particular who’ve served this country, it’s a huge slap in the face to everything that they have done.”

The proposed measure from the VA would undo an interim final ruling issued by former President Joe Biden’s administration in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that reversed Roe v. Wade.

The Biden-era ruling allowed the VA to provide abortion services to veterans if “determined needed by a health care professional, when the life or the health of the pregnant veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term or the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.”

Rescinding Biden’s rule was also a directive in Project 2025, a document published by the conservative Heritage Foundation and co-authored by anti-abortion organizations, such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and members of Trump’s first and second administrations.

Under the section listing proposed reforms to the Veterans Health Administration, the document reads:

“Rescind all departmental clinical policy directives that are contrary to principles of conservative governance, starting with abortion services and gender reassignment surgery. Neither aligns with service-connected conditions that would warrant VA’s providing this type of clinical care, and both follow the Left’s pernicious trend of abusing the role of government to further its own agenda.”

Lindsay Church, the executive director and co-founder of Minority Veterans of America, said their membership, mostly made up of women and people of reproductive age, feels the proposal directly impacts them. Church pointed out that survivors of sexual assault in the military are upset over the lack of an exception in the policy for rape survivors.

“That’s deeply insulting, considering the unique circumstances in which our community lives, which is that we live at the intersections of the Department of Defense, military-industrial complex,” Church said. “That means that many of us are survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the military, and this is deeply personal, because some survivors in the Department of Defense even receive care at the Department of Veterans Affairs.”

According to an annual report from the U.S. Department of Defense, there were 8,195 reports of sexual assault in 2024

“This is not just a theoretical anti-abortion move; this is directly impacting people’s lives, and given that so much of our community, the largest states for veterans are places like Texas and Florida, places with really regressive abortion policies,” Church said.

“If you are sexually assaulted in the state of Texas, and you try to access care at the Department of Veterans Affairs, you would have to go to New Mexico to access that care,” they said. “That seems unjust given the unique circumstances of our community. Not even having a basic, very basic, and very, even regressive exceptions policy is insulting to the people who have worn the uniform to fight for people’s rights.”

Church’s partner, a civilian, became pregnant in 2022, after the Dobbs decision. At around six weeks into the pregnancy, the couple, who were living in Virginia at the time, learned that the fetus had a fetal abnormality. At 16 weeks, the couple were told that the fetus was not producing amniotic fluid, a fatal diagnosis.

“We pursued compassionate termination, because there was just not a great hope for them. We accessed care at a Richmond reproductive health clinic where we were called ‘baby killers,’” Church said, adding that under the Biden-era policy, their wife would have had the abortion care through the Civilian Health and Medical Program, which would not be allowed under the Trump administration’s proposal.

This suggests that the stock price has the potential to continue declining, with sellers dominating the market and bearish momentum likely to persist.

American Well Corp (AMWL), a leading telehealth solutions provider, reported its second-quarter 2025 results on August 5, 2025. The company exceeded analyst expectations with GAAP revenue of $70.9 million, up 11.7% compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven primarily by a significant increase in software subscription revenue [1].

The company also reported a notable improvement in adjusted EBITDA loss, which narrowed to $(4.7 million) in Q2 2025, marking an 86.6% year-over-year improvement compared to Q2 2024 [1]. Gross margin expanded to 56.1% in Q2 2025, reflecting the company's focus on high-margin revenue streams [1].

American Well's full-year revenue guidance for FY2025 was revised downward to a range of $245 million to $250 million, reflecting the divestiture of its psychiatric care segment [1]. Despite this adjustment, the company maintained a strong focus on strategic execution, securing new client wins such as Florida Blue and extending its contract with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) [1].

However, the company noted persistent risks, including ongoing declines in visit volumes and the importance of the DHA contract for long-term stability [1]. For Q3 2025, American Well expects revenue to be between $53 million and $56 million, with adjusted EBITDA loss (non-GAAP) anticipated to widen sequentially [1].

Investors should keep an eye on the pace of platform adoption, the outcome of government contract renewals, and continued improvement in profit metrics as American Well navigates the rapidly evolving telehealth sector [1].

August 12, 2025 | The pharma industry excels at collaborating with startup companies and scaling up the production of drugs and biologics, but they may be missing the big-picture perspective of the U.S. government as well as some of the cutting-edge research happening within academia. It’s a problematic norm that needs addressing if artificial intelligence (AI) is to benefit drug discovery and diagnostics as well as healthcare delivery in terms of safety, equity, and effectiveness, according to Shruthi Bharadwaj, Ph.D., program leader at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, an R&D center funded largely by the Department of Defense (DOD).

To that end, Bharadwaj will take to the stage at the upcoming Discovery on Target (DOT) conference in Boston to moderate a discussion about how to balance innovation, regulation, and real-world impact of AI in the life sciences and healthcare. At the table there will be representatives from industry, academia, and the federal government to discover and explore all the potential synergies, she says.

Joining her on the panel will be Nimita Limaye, Ph.D., research vice president for life sciences R&D strategy and technology at International Data Corporation (IDC); Sherri Cherry, MBA, deputy chief information officer at the Defense Health Agency (part of the Veterans Health Administration); Raquel Mura, PharmD, founder of RGM Life Sciences Consulting and former vice president and head of R&D North America at Sanofi; and William Streilein, Ph.D., principal staff with the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Fostering Change

Bharadwaj, who has a pharmaceutical biology background, recently joined MIT after working for two major pharmaceutical companies—first Novartis and later Sanofi—to head a team focused on leveraging AI for drug discovery. The Lincoln Laboratory has frequently convened multi-stakeholder groups to foster needed change in the way AI is viewed and deployed for the common good, she notes.

Her focus currently is an initiative seeking to understand how AI can be leveraged to predict the characteristics of drug molecules, which may in the future help the Food and Drug Administration better assess the safety and effectiveness of candidate medicines, she says. The work is supported by an unnamed but non-DOD government agency.

Outside of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Bharadwaj wears a few different hats. These include serving as an advisor to the Cancer Fund, an early-stage impact venture capital (VC) firm, by helping to evaluate startup proposals “for my own personal happiness,” she says.

Additionally, Bharadwaj is an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Technology Innovation Studio (Cambridge, Massachusetts) that brings together business leaders, scientists and researchers, serial entrepreneurs, angel/VC investors, industry experts, corporate innovation teams, and policy experts to pursue fresh approaches to problems. And for Nucleate, a student-led organization helping startups spin out of academia, she provides guidance on the development of pitch decks and connects researchers with potential sponsors or VCs.

Military Health

The Defense Health Agency, for its part, is keyed in on how AI might benefit the healthcare of veterans, Bharadwaj says, for example the diagnosis of mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide ideation, and depression. The possibilities include AI-assisted vocal analysis, predictive analytics to identify at-risk individuals, and the analysis of physiological data from wearables as well as text and language patterns.

Cherry is a strong advocate for women’s health, which may not yet have a use case for AI but is what connected her to Bharadwaj. What sparked their initial conversation was Bharadwaj’s interest in ensuring women are considered when creating strategies for increasing the overall effectiveness of the military, since 20% of service members are female.

Equity is clearly a challenge in the miliary, Bharadwaj says. The MIT Lincoln Laboratory is now working with a company to address some of these situations.

The inequities are many and extend to military uniforms that are designed for the height and size of men, she adds. Women generally don’t share the same general body build and proportions, meaning their comfort and morale as well as their safety and effectiveness in the field may be negatively affected.

AI-guided Pipeline

Many pharma companies are “pushing forward with AI or at least leveraging AI to some extent,” says Bharadwaj, which certainly includes both of her former employers. “Sanofi has been all in with AI for the last three years now,” aided by the 2023 hiring of venture capitalist and cardiology-trained Houman Ashrafian as its new head of R&D.

Since then, Sanofi’s strategic vision has focused more on being “an immunoscience company that’s powered by AI,” Bharadwaj continues. “The entire drug discovery pipeline is guided by AI, so Sanofi decides what the next drug candidate should be in oncology or dermatology based on AI recommendations; it’s pretty awesome actually.”

The recommendations are being made by predictive tools, which are inherently different than the large language models many people are familiar with by now, she adds. These are machine learning algorithms designed to analyze information such as chemical structures, biological activity, and clinical trial data to predict outcomes like drug properties, bioactivity, and toxicity. At Sanofi, Aily Labs has been a significant partner in building this sort of AI capability.

Novartis has moved at a swifter pace of adoption, having launched a first-of-its-kind AI Innovation Lab through a collaboration with Microsoft back in 2019 when Bharadwaj was part of the digital team. The initiative integrated AI and data science across the company’s operations from R&D to commercialization.

Connecting the Dots

The perspective of MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s William Streilein, who previously served as the chief AI and data officer for the DOD, could be particularly valuable to the overall conversation at the DOT conference. “He understands the U.S. government like no other... when it comes especially to AI and the implementation of AI and understanding how the government may see AI in the future,” says Bharadwaj.

The Department of Defense, while less focused on the life sciences, is immersed in AI and Streilein will be at liberty to share some of the particulars. As has already been publicly disclosed, it has been involved in efforts to establish new data centers to support AI applications.

One of Bharadwaj’s near-term intentions is to spotlight some of the “amazing work that MIT scientists have done but is not necessarily published or known to everyone... and connect them to pharma and perhaps the U.S. government,” she says. She wants also to help ensure that industry stays focused on the shared goal to “benefit humankind,” in part by better understanding the role of regulators and how to scale up research-level discoveries and not get distracted by the minutiae of drug making.",,N,0.0,2025-08-12 03:56:10.160129

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas, and New York are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions. However, they’ve been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation’s three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn’t named, the law exempts any pharmacy that “exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state.” Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that’s because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa’s law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech.

There’s no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can’t be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, “Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It’s important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.”

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we’re still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as “crony capitalism,” but it’s not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don’t understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that’s not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.",https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/77/5e5b54f0-aa46-4ed1-aeb2-ebff01d2f8ee.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 13:56:23.077776

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.","As a cancer patient covered by my husband’s TRICARE health insurance, I read Rob Maness’ July 11 guest column opposing pharmacy benefit manager reform with disappointment. His argument misses the reality for families like mine.

He claims that Louisiana's proposed ban on PBMs from owning pharmacies would create barriers for veterans to access prescriptions. But PBMs already create barriers by dictating ultra-low reimbursement rates to local independent pharmacies, preventing them from participating in TRICARE. That means patients like me and my husband, a retired veteran, are forced to use PBM mail-order services whether we want to or not. Mail order might sound convenient, but it often leads to delays, lost medications and zero personal care. I’ve experienced this danger firsthand.

Maness tries to scare us by saying reform will close pharmacies and displace veterans. What’s more likely is that locally operated pharmacies and non-PBM chains will expand when unfair competition from powerful, vertically integrated PBMs is removed. When PBMs own pharmacies, they set reimbursement rates to favor themselves while underpaying competitors, driving them out of business. Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would end this conflict of interest, keeping locally operated pharmacies open and thriving.

Here in Louisiana, independents have always served rural and underserved communities where big chains refuse to go. They provide personalized care, deliver medications and work hard to ensure no one goes without. The idea that only PBM chains can serve patients is false and insulting to the small-business pharmacists working daily to keep Louisianans healthy.

PBMs use their ownership of pharmacies to manipulate the system. They underpay locally operated pharmacies, force veterans into their mail-order programs and overcharge TRICARE while pocketing the difference. That isn’t about access and quality care. It’s about greed.

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.

MHSRS, a four-day event which takes place annually at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Conference Center, provided personnel with multiple forums to demonstrate the impact NMR&D research has on the DoD warfighter.

Over 100 NMR&D personnel attended MHSRS this year, including military, civilian and contractor research, medical and support personnel. Attendees participated in a range of conference activities, speaking at 26 breakout sessions, presenting 95 research posters across three poster sessions and engaging with stakeholders and potential collaborators throughout the Military Health System.

“This year’s MHSRS was an outstanding demonstration of how the talented scientists of Navy Medicine Research and Development work together to field medical solutions in support of Joint Force health and readiness,” said Capt. Franca Jones, commander, Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC). “This year’s symposium highlighted extensive collaborations between commands in NMR&D, other service laboratories, and industry and academia.”

“MHSRS is really an opportunity to help our junior researchers understand our military medical research environment,” said Capt. William Howard, commanding officer of Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU)-Dayton. “We also use it as an opportunity for our seasoned researchers to remain calibrated and find opportunities. We try to maximize our participation for the benefit of our command as well as for military research in general.”

During the opening plenary session, two NMR&D commands were recognized. Justin Handy, from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) in Groton, CT, received the Outstanding Research Accomplishment for a Military Team award on behalf of the Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team. The team was recognized for their work to improve submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching, which fosters readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention within the Submarine Force.

Dr. Doug Jones, Dr. Timothy Dunn, and John Marciano, from the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, CA, received the Warfighter Medicine Research Public Communication Award for their work raising public awareness of their DOD-sponsored medical research in the area of arctic performance.

“Dr. Jones, Dr. Dunn, and their team of top scientists work diligently in the background to help our sailors and soldiers do their jobs in the harshest of environments.” Said Dr. Ken Earhart, NHRC scientific director. “It’s exciting and immensely rewarding when the world takes notice, recognizing their individual achievements, showcasing the real-world impact of their important research, and offering inspiration to others to pursue careers in STEM.”

Three NMR&D poster presentations were recognized during the final awards ceremony, out of over 1400 posters from throughout the three poster sessions. Dr. Sabrina Snyder, from NAMRU San Antonio, was awarded first place for her poster on the survival analysis of a dental self-healing composite, and Dr. Kayla Septer, from NMRC, was awarded second place, for her poster on the antigenic characterization of currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Crouch, from NHRC, was given an honorable mention for Poster Session 2 for his presentation on using anomaly seasonality decomposition and artificial neural network modeling to predict febrile respiratory illness among U.S. military recruitment populations.

Dr. Elliot Dirr, of NAMRU-Dayton, was also recognized during this ceremony, getting third place in the Young Investigators competition, for his presentation on how the partial pressure of oxygen and nitrogen impacts the development of noise-induced hearing loss.

“This year we had two oral presentations, nine posters and two session chairs, and we’re especially proud of Dr. Elliott Dirr for his win in the young investigators category,” said Howard. “Our command cultivates the mindset of starting all research endeavors with the needs of the warfighter, and I know that is reflected in our contributions to military medical research.”

With over 3500 registrants this year, MHSRS presents a unique opportunity for researchers and leadership to meet with future collaborators in the Military Health System.

NMR&D is led by NMRC, and is comprised of NSMRL, NHRC, and NAMRU Dayton, San Antonio, INDO PACIFIC, EURAFCENT, and SOUTH.

MHSRS is the DoD’s premier scientific meeting that focuses specifically on the unique medical needs of service members. This annual educational symposium brings together healthcare professionals, researchers, and DoD leaders for four days of critical learning, intensive idea sharing and relationship building.

NMR&D, a global collective of eight commands, conducts research in support of Navy, Marine Corps and joint U.S. warfighter health, readiness and lethality, across a broad spectrum of activity from basic science in the laboratory to field studies in austere and remote areas of the world to investigations in operational environments. NMR&D studies infectious diseases, biological warfare detection and defense, combat casualty care, environmental health concerns, directed energy health effects, aerospace and undersea medicine, medical modeling, simulation, operational mission support, epidemiology and behavioral sciences.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9249732/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 10:56:12.781301

web posted August 11, 2025

We don't get to pick and choose who gets to enjoy constitutional rights and who doesn't. They apply to all of us — even the large healthcare companies everyone seems intent on crusading against these days. Sometimes it comes down to freedom of choice versus monopolies, and restricting certain healthcare related businesses while granting monopolies to others isn't fixing the problems, but creating new ones.

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas and New York, are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions.

However, they've been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation's three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn't named, the law exempts any pharmacy that ""exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state."" Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that's because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa's law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech.

There's no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can't be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, ""Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It's important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.""

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we're still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as ""crony capitalism,"" but it's not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don't understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that's not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.
