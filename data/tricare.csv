Veterans make up about 30% of the federal workforce but comprise nearly half of the Defense Department’s civilian workforce.","WASHINGTON — Civilians working for the Navy and the Defense Department’s health and logistics agencies were the first to lose their jobs as the Pentagon began firing workers this week.

The Navy, the Defense Health Agency and the Defense Logistics Agency confirmed civilian job terminations are underway at those organizations, though information on those firings was limited Friday. The firings are part of a Defense Department-wide effort to reduce the civilian workforce by up to 8%, beginning with 5,400 probationary workers. Those layoffs began Monday, according to a memo released by the Pentagon that was dated the same day.

The Navy does not have the number of civilian personnel fired “readily available for public release,” said Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, the Navy’s assistant chief of information, media operations, production and plans. “The process is in progress. We will look to provide additional information when able.”

The Defense Health Agency also was unable to say how many probationary workers had been fired, though an official with the agency said, “To date, DHA dismissals are restricted to headquarters positions that are administrative in nature.”

The Defense Logistics Agency confirmed Thursday that fewer than 100 civilian personnel of its workforce of 25,000 were dismissed Monday from their jobs.

The civilian workers fired were probationary, officials confirmed. The federal government considers workers to be probationary if they have been on the job for less than one to two years. Probationary workers lack the employment protections of more seasoned workers.

“DLA released probationary employees consistent with the Department of Defense’s broader efforts to ensure resources are aligned with the department’s strategic objectives,” the agency said in a statement.

The Defense Logistics Agency provides logistics support to the military and foreign nations. It is the Defense Department’s largest combat support agency. The agency declined to identify the divisions where the dismissed employees worked or whether more terminations are expected.

Workers fired Monday were “the first step” in the Defense Department’s effort to “appropriately align its personnel resources with its critical war-fighting functions,” read the March 3 memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Their employment, he said, was not in the public interest.

“The department will continue taking steps to implement [President Donald Trump’s] direction to restore accountability to the American public, reduce the size of the federal government’s workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition, and faithfully and responsibly manage taxpayer dollars,” the memo reads.

The firings were planned to start last week. Multiple Pentagon officials were unable to provide a reason for the delay.

The firings will come in waves until officials dismiss the 5,400 workers required by Hegseth, a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Thursday. The official was unable to say how many layoffs had already occurred or what departments were impacted.

On the same day that the firings began, Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., a Navy veteran, sent a letter to Hegseth urging him to mitigate workforce reductions at the Defense Department. Kiggans expressed concern about how cutting civilian staff with prior military service could impact national security.

“At a time when we are seeing global instability and rising threats from adversaries like China and Russia, it is vital that we protect our skilled workforce and focus on maintaining a robust and capable Department of Defense,” she wrote.

Kiggans urged Hegseth to ensure veterans are not disproportionately affected by layoffs.

“Their unique skills and dedication are critical to maintaining the strength of our military,” she wrote.

Veterans make up about 30% of the federal workforce but comprise nearly half of the Defense Department’s civilian workforce. There are more than 950,000 civilian employees across the Defense Department, according to its civilian careers website.

Democratic lawmakers warned last week the Defense Department is preparing to fire more than 70,000 civilians across its workforce. That would be within the 5% to 8% proposed cut outlined two weeks ago by Hegseth.

“This will inevitably impact defense readiness,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. “There’s a domino effect that will extend across the military. People get demoralized and disillusioned. Costs go well beyond dollars and cents.”

Other lawmakers are focused on minimizing impacts to areas of the Defense Department that they consider to be critical, including shipyards, logistics, equipment maintenance, aircraft repair and information security.

In early February, more than a month before Hegseth announced sweeping layoffs, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, wrote a letter to the acting Navy secretary asking for exemptions to the service’s public shipyard workforce in the event of layoffs.

“Our shipyards cannot afford to reduce their workforces. In fact, [Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine] needs to hire 550 workers annually just to meet Navy demand for the foreseeable future,” the senators wrote.

The Navy has four public shipyards — Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Virginia, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Washington, and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility in Hawaii — that serve as maintenance depots for nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers.

The four shipyards have a combined civilian workforce of more than 30,000 people. But lawmakers have argued the backlog of ships in maintenance in the past decade is, in part, due to a need for more workers.

The Navy wrote last week in a letter to the lawmakers that it was working with the Defense Department to identify critical functions and positions at naval shipyards for exemption. The letter was signed Feb. 28 by acting Navy Secretary Terence Emmert.

“The [Navy] is committed to carry out workforce shaping in a manner that preserves lethality and readiness, while advancing the administration’s imperatives of reduction and cost savings,” according to the letter.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:17:18.757503

In February they delivered more than 4,200 scheduled virtual visits.

“People engage in our care system not so that they can get an appointment, but so that they can have their needs met,” said Lt. Col. Evan Trivette, chief of Family Medicine and commander for Primary Care Services. “With the My Military Health, we aim to provide the right level and mode of care at the right time.”

Patients can now access medical care from anywhere, providing they have internet access, reducing the need for in-person visits and minimizing disruptions to their daily routines.

“We're able to take care of a lot of issues right when the Soldier needs it, opposed to waiting for them to come in for an actual appointment,” said Capt. Timothy Karnuth, physician assistant 82nd Airborne Division “What that means is that we have a shorter wait for an appointment, and open appointments to see the people who actually need to come in for physical exams or for musculoskeletal conditions.”

Scheduled virtual visits increase the provider scheduling flexibility and leverages new technology.

“As a provider, I find the system easy to navigate to create provider generated visits,” said Dr. Omici Uwagbai, Family Medicine Physician, Robinson Health Clinic. Just a few clicks of the mouse and I can send patients a link for a virtual visit.”

The virtual healthcare platform enables seamless communication between healthcare providers, ensuring that patients receive comprehensive and coordinated care. It’s a tool for patients to be more active in their healthcare and it’s not locked into a 20-minute face-to-face appointments. Patients can schedule a virtual appointment at any time and attend the scheduled virtual video appointment by phone, tablet or computer.

Efficiency is how one patient described My Military Health after a recent appointment.

“I had some labs drawn,” said patient and retired Col. Roy Vernon. “I needed to talk about those labs as opposed to making an appointment with my provider. I got on to the MHS Genesis Patient Portal and asked questions. “I got a phone call from the nurse who went into detail on every point, and she let me know, nothing to be concerned about. So instead of me having to make an appointment, sit down with a provider and take time out of my day, I was able to do it all from my truck, and I think that's efficiency.”

So far, the medical facility has noticed a 75% reduction in wait times through virtual appointments, increased access to care for remote or deployed personnel and an improved patient satisfaction rating of 25%.

Womack will continue to expand their virtual healthcare capabilities, exploring new technologies and innovative approaches to enhance care delivery and improve patient outcomes. For more information about My Military Health visit https://tricare.mil/mymilitaryhealth",,N,,2025-03-07 13:17:52.856623

Teens who sleep less may have higher blood pressure

Teenagers who sleep less than 7.7 hours per night may face a significantly higher risk of developing high blood pressure, according to preliminary research presented at the American Heart Association’s 2025 scientific sessions. The study found that teens with insomnia and insufficient sleep were five times more likely to develop stage 2 hypertension compared to well-rested peers. However, those who reported insomnia but slept at least 7.7 hours did not show increased risk. Researchers emphasize the importance of sleep monitoring in adolescents to prevent long-term cardiovascular issues.

Patient Safety Awareness Week DHA facilities will raise awareness about patient safety throughout March.","MARCH 7, 2025 – Do you get health care at a military hospital or clinic? When you need care, patient safety should never be a concern. You deserve to know how well your military hospital or clinic protects you and your family from preventable harm.

Military hospitals consistently earn top safety ratings. It’s easy to view these scores yourself.

Last year, 15 military hospitals earned “A” grades from the Leapfrog Group. This means that 75% of participating Defense Health Agency hospitals earned top grades. This is far above the national average of 32%.

Some DHA hospitals didn’t see enough patients to qualify for Leapfrog grades last year. But DHA has strict safety standards at all military hospitals and clinics.

“Our military hospitals rank among the nation’s safest,” said Heidi King, chief of DHA’s Patient Safety Program. “Our healthcare teams work every day to protect patients from preventable harm and deliver excellent care.”

What is Leapfrog?

The Leapfrog Group is a national, independent organization focused on healthcare quality. Leapfrog uses up to 30 safety measures to grade hospitals. These measures include:

Infection prevention

Staffing

Errors

Injuries

Home care instructions

These military hospitals earned “A” grades in fall 2024.

81st Medical Group, Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi

673rd Medical Group, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska

Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center, Fort Belvoir, Virginia

Blanchfield Army Community Hospital, Fort Campbell, Kentucky

Naval Medical Center San Diego, San Diego, California

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland

William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Fort Bliss, Texas

Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina

Wright-Patterson Medical Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio

DHA started working with Leapfrog to check hospital quality five years ago. It became the first federal health system to participate in the safety grade program. DHA expanded the program after success at Walter Reed.

How does the DHA work to keep you safe?

DHA has several programs to keep you safe. These programs include:

Ready Reliable Care Safety Communication Bundle: Since 2022, all military hospitals have used the same safety communication tools. This means staff across military hospitals all follow the same safety steps. This bundle also makes it easier for staff to report concerns.

Joint Patient Safety Reporting: DHA wants to know about all patient safety events. This includes “near misses.” Reporting these concerns helps staff review and address them quickly.

These programs and others work together to create safer care for you at military hospitals and clinics.

Want to check your military hospital’s safety record?

There are several ways to learn about your military hospital’s safety? Visit Health.mil’s Quality, Patient Safety, and Access Information page to see:

Remember: Your engagement is key to building relationships with your providers. It also leads to safer care.

Patient Safety Awareness Week

DHA facilities will raise awareness about patient safety throughout March. The official Patient Safety Awareness Week is March 9–15.

This year’s theme is “Patient Safety is a Team Sport.” This theme highlights how patients are essential members of the care team. It also showcases and recognizes military hospitals and clinics for their commitment to patient safety.

Building relationships with your providers helps foster safer care. Be sure to tell your provider if you have any safety concerns while getting care.

Patient safety is key to improving health and building readiness. DHA is committed to excellent patient care. This means you can trust that military hospitals and clinics are always working to improve.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:18:05.488714

Army Medicine, represented by Lt. Gen. R. Scott Dingle, U.S. Army Surgeon General and Commanding General, United States Army Medical Command, spoke at the AUSA Military Family Forum III: Quality of Life – Healthcare and Spouse Employment.

The moderator of the healthcare section of the panel was Dr. Brian C. Lein, Assistant Director, Healthcare Administration, Defense Health Agency. Panelists included Lt. Gen. Telita Crosland, Director, Defense Health Agency; Brig. Gen. Mary V. Krueger, Special Assistant to the Director of the Army Staff and 24th Chief, US Army Medical Corps; and Jessica R. Slaughter, Health Systems Specialist, TRICARE Benefits, Exceptional Family Member Program, Prevention, Resilience, and Readiness Directorate, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, G-9, United States Army

Dingle thanked AUSA for setting up the family forums and those who worked as ambassadors and advocates for the military family as well. “The impact that you have made and going to make is tremendous” as you work tirelessly on behalf of Army Families, he said.

Dingle paraphrased the late Gen. Raymond Odierno and said the strength of the nation is the Army, the strength of the Army is the Soldier, and the strength of the Soldier is the Family. Dingle said that 7 years ago there were many unanswered questions for the Army Family, and they faced many challenges. Over the past 7 years, “the Army senior leadership has built a synergistic team between AUSA, between our Families, Soldiers, and those who are supporting our Families,” he said.

Today, the team that is “answering the call to address the many challenges” our families face, Dingle said.

Topics the panel discussed include the importance of graduate medical education, access to care, Tricare, staffing, Shortage of nursing, keeping Families healthy, and the role of Guard and Reserve as part of the health care system.

Additional discussion covered the Exceptional Family Member Program—a program that works with other military and civilian agencies to provide comprehensive and coordinated community support, housing, educational, medical, and personnel services to Families with special needs.

The goal is to take care of the family so the Soldier can take care of the mission.

The settlements resolve allegations that health care providers received kickbacks in return for their referrals to a laboratory in Anderson, South Carolina.
What People Are Saying Acting U.S. Attorney Brook B. Andrews for the District of South Carolina, said: ""Integrity must be the standard in our health care system.
Our commitment is to safeguard taxpayer-funded health care and the patients who rely on it, and we will rigorously pursue any allegations of False Claims Act violations.""","A number of doctors and medical practices have agreed to pay $1.9 million to settle allegations of fraudulent claims to Medicare and TRICARE, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday.

Newsweek has contacted Curis Healthcare Inc and Alliance Immediate and Primary Care of Chicago out of hours via email for comment.

Why It Matters

Medicare and Medicaid have come into the spotlight in recent weeks as President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) investigates the health programs' spending to uncover ""fraud, waste and abuse"" in the systems.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from 2024 found that $100 billion had been discovered in ""improper payments"" in 2023 across the Medicare and Medicaid programs. However, the claims that the federal health programs are full of ""waste"" and ""fraud"" have been disputed by others.

What To Know

The U.S. Department of Justice shared that those involved have agreed to pay a total of $1,913,808 to resolve alleged ""False Claims Act violations arising from their involvement in laboratory kickback schemes.""

Those involved include the doctors Gerald Congdon, M.D., of Pawleys Island, South Carolina, Gbenga Aluko, M.D., of Charlotte, North Carolina, Anup Banerjee, M.D., of Gastonia, North Carolina, and their medical practices, and Omar Hussain, of South Miami, Florida.

It also includes the health care providers Curis Healthcare Inc, of Chicago, Illinois, and Saeed Medical Group Ltd, which is doing business as Alliance Immediate and Primary Care, of Chicago, Illinois.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce referrals of items or services covered by Medicare, TRICARE, the federal health program for those in the U.S. military, and other federally funded health care programs.

The statute is designed to ensure that medical providers' judgments are not driven by improper financial incentives and instead focused solely on the best interests of their patients.

The settlements resolve allegations that health care providers received kickbacks in return for their referrals to a laboratory in Anderson, South Carolina. A marketer, along with his company, is also involved in the allegations.

The kickbacks allegedly resulted in the submission of ""false or fraudulent laboratory testing claims to Medicare and TRICARE in violation of the False Claims Act,"" the Department of Justice stated.

The Details

A press release from the Office of Public Affairs listed the following as resolved:

Dr. Gerald Congdon, Coastal Urgent Care LLC, and Coastal Wellness Center LLC. Dr. Congdon and his medical practices in Pawleys Island and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, agreed to pay $400,000 to resolve allegations that from May 2016 to November 2021, they received thousands of dollars in remuneration disguised as purported office space rental and phlebotomy payments from the South Carolina laboratory in return for ordering testing.

Dr. Gbenga Aluko and Eagle Medical Center PC. Dr. Aluko and his medical practice in Charlotte, North Carolina, agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve allegations that from May 2016 to November 2021, they received thousands of dollars in remuneration disguised as purported office space rental, phlebotomy, and toxicology payments from the South Carolina laboratory in return for ordering testing.

Dr. Anup Banerjee and Gastonia Medical Specialty Clinic P.A. Dr. Banerjee and his medical practice in Gastonia, North Carolina, agreed to pay $206,000 to resolve allegations that from April 2017 to November 2021, they received thousands of dollars in remuneration disguised as purported office space rental and phlebotomy payments from the South Carolina laboratory in return for ordering testing.

Omar Hussain and Curis Healthcare Inc. Hussain and his marketing company agreed to pay $817,808 to resolve allegations that from April 2020 to August 2021, Hussain and his company received commissions from the South Carolina laboratory as independent contractors based on the volume and value of the Medicare and TRICARE referrals for laboratory testing that they arranged for and recommended.

Saeed Medical Group Ltd., Omar Hussain, and Curis Healthcare Inc. Saeed Medical Group and Hussain and his marketing company agreed to pay $240,000 to resolve allegations that from April 2020 to August 2021, Saeed Medical Group received thousands of dollars in remuneration in the form of cash payments from Hussain and his company in return for ordering testing from the South Carolina laboratory.

The department noted that the claims resolved by the settlements are only allegations, and there has been no determination of liability.

Newsweek phoned Coastal Urgent Care, the practice of Gerald Congdon, Eagle Medical Center, the practice of Gbenga Aluko, Gastonia Medical Specialty Clinic, the practice of Anup Banerjee, and Keralty Hospital Miami, the practice of Omar Hussain, for comment but was unable to get through to an operator.

What People Are Saying

Acting U.S. Attorney Brook B. Andrews for the District of South Carolina, said: ""Integrity must be the standard in our health care system. Kickback schemes divert funds and focus away from patients and their medical needs.""

Special Agent in Charge Steve Jensen of the FBI Columbia Field Office, said: ""The public puts immense trust in medical professionals, and disdain for the rule of law damages that trust and erodes their credibility. These settlements should serve as a reminder that the FBI and its partners are committed to holding medical practitioners accountable for kickbacks.""

Special Agent in Charge Kelly Blackmon of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), said: ""Kickback schemes undermine medical decision-making and jeopardize the integrity of federally funded health care programs. Our commitment is to safeguard taxpayer-funded health care and the patients who rely on it, and we will rigorously pursue any allegations of False Claims Act violations.""

Special Agent in Charge Christopher Dillard of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) mid-Atlantic Field Office, said: ""The trust of the American taxpayer and the well-being of our service members are undermined when laboratories and physicians engage in collusive financial relationships. DCIS will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to bring to justice medical providers who illegally enrich themselves by prioritizing kickbacks over patient care.""

What's Next

The Department of Justice emphasized that the pursuit of uncovering fraud in Medicare and TRICARE illustrates the government's goal of ""combating health care fraud,"" and added that ""one of the most powerful tools"" in this effort was the False Claims Act.

It seems likely that the government will continue to push the effort to uncover ""fraud"" in federal health programs, something which DOGE's Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency has pledged to do.",,N,,2025-03-07 13:18:26.102833

Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims.
TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.
“What implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families?","Changes this year to Tricare, the military’s health care program, have brought cascading disruptions to millions of service members, their families and network providers nationwide.

About 16,000 health care providers on the East Coast alone have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, federal officials said, beneficiaries are struggling with a host of issues, including long wait times at call centers and stalled referrals and authorizations.

The disruptions to a network that provides benefits to about 9.6 million people have left military members scrambling to secure medical, behavioral and mental health services for themselves and their loved ones, as advocates worry about lasting repercussions.

In Tennessee, Army Sgt. Bo Heggins has relied on Tricare for years to cover occupational therapy for his 8-year-old son who has autism. Up to eight hours with a provider each week had helped his son learn life and conversational skills. The progress was visible, and Heggins, 35, had hope that his son could grow to live a happy, independent life.

Then, in mid-February, when Heggins and his wife tried to schedule another routine appointment, they learned the provider was one of many who had not been paid by Tricare, which threatened future coverage. In all the confusion, his son has not had a session since and has begun to regress.“There’s no longer improvement,” Heggins said, as he began to cry. “My son is my heart. And I want him to be the best person he can be.”

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since Jan. 1, after a new contractor began managing benefits on the West Coast and in six Eastern states that were reallocated to the west region.

The DHA previously said the new contracts would “improve health care delivery, quality, and access” for U.S. beneficiaries.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA spokesperson Brenda Campbell said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues.Among the most severe: Several thousand health care providers have not been paid since December 2024 because of a data issue, officials said. Some say they are owed more than $100,000.

“This situation has become untenable,” said Brenda Stephens, who submitted $180,000 in claims for services that her mental health clinic in San Diego provided to military members this year.

Another mental health provider in San Diego said he has only had about $1,000 to spend in monthly income, received through cash-paying patients, since January.

Rodger Questin, 50, a clinical psychologist, said his private practice has accrued about $50,000 in unpaid Tricare claims. He has had to dip into his savings and said he has not bought a single item this year that he did not need.

“There are times where I’m like, what am I going to do?” he said.

A spokesperson for Humana Military, the regional contractor for the east region, said the company learned in early January that a “small percentage” of providers’ records in the claims administration system had outdated or incorrect data, which prevented the claims from being processed.

The issue affected fewer than 16,750 providers. The Humana spokesperson said that figure was less than 1% of the total number of providers in and out of the network.

The company said it has been “working around the clock” to clear the backlog of unpaid claims.

“We have identified the root cause of this issue and have fixed the majority of the issues caused by the incorrect data,” the spokesperson said. “We take our commitment to TRICARE East Region beneficiaries and providers very seriously, and apologize for the inconvenience and frustration this problem has caused.”

TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the new contractor for the west region, did not say how many providers there have also not been paid.

“All major health care transitions of this size and scale bring challenges, and we are working tirelessly seven days a week to implement solutions because there is nothing more important than ensuring military families get the care they earned,” a TriWest spokesperson said in a statement.

TriWest said it has processed 1.6 million claims since January and issued more than 351,000 Tricare referrals and authorizations for care.

In a statement to NBC News, DHA officials said it will take one to two weeks to determine if the technical fixes resolved the east region issues.

The agency said the contractors have met the contractual requirements to pay 98% of processed claims within 30 days and all claims within 90 days to date.

The DHA officials, citing the contractors, said no east region provider has left the network due to claims issues but that a few have left in the west.

Regarding payment issues on the West Coast, DHA officials said claim payments are “always slightly slower” in the first month of every calendar year to make sure Tricare rates have been properly applied. Contractors, they said, also verify that numbers and provider information in each claim are correct before money is paid.

“This time frame has now passed and claims are now flowing much faster,” the officials said. “Additionally, TriWest is actively contacting the few providers who have left the network to ask them to rejoin the network.”

NBC News spoke to more than half a dozen providers across the country who said they are still waiting to be reimbursed. Faced with a sudden cash flow crisis, many have had to make difficult and heartbreaking decisions.

‘Forced into an impossible situation’

In San Diego, Stephens took out a $75,000 loan at the beginning of February, but it only got her clinic through two payrolls. By the end of February, she had to pause services for all of her clinic’s 350 Tricare patients — some whom she said are in “desperate shape” — as well as lay off seven employees.

“It’s been nothing short of devastating. I feel a reaction in my whole body right now,” she said through tears. “We’ve been forced into an impossible situation. We can’t continue to treat them without being paid and they can’t find other providers.”

A Florida clinic that provides psychiatry and therapy services to about 300 people also recently decided it would have to stop treating Tricare patients after it racked up more than $100,000 in unpaid claims since Jan. 1, office manager Beth Matricia said.

“We’re going to have to charge them out of pocket because if we keep going this way, we’re going to have to close down,” said Matricia, who manages MAPS Integrated Wellness in the military community of Fernandina Beach.Matricia said she and other staff members fear the fallout will further affect the mental health of service members, who will likely not be able to afford the full cost of up to $150 per session.

“You’re talking about people who are suicidal,” she said. “If you stop their care, they can choose to end their life. It’s very hard to transfer therapists. It’s really hard to open up again.”

Ross Wise, a registered nurse who works with a psychiatrist at MAPS, said some of their patients are children struggling at school and adults dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder.

“It might spiral someone down to a deep depression,” Wise said.

In Clarksville, Tennessee, Jenne Nesbitt-Decker, owner and chief financial officer of Mariposa Behavioral Health Services, a small clinic that treats children and teens who have autism, said she has had to cut the number of available appointments in half to make up for the lack of payments and the loss of one provider who quit.

If she still has not been paid by April 1, Nesbitt-Decker, who has four children and a mortgage, said she will have to stop serving Tricare patients, which she has done since 2007.

There is a growing concern that if providers continue to leave Tricare, it will worsen an existing health care worker shortage, said Eileen Huck, the National Military Family Association’s acting director of government relations.

“That exacerbates an already difficult problem,” she said. “What implications does that have for health care access for service members and their families? That’s really troubling.”

The monthslong upheaval has left Heggins, the service member whose young son has autism, to make his own agonizing choice.

His son’s provider told NBC News that if Tricare does not resolve the reimbursement issue in two weeks, her clinic will send out a 45-day notice to current Tricare clients to terminate services. Her office has already stopped accepting new Tricare patients.

While Heggins has served in the military for 16 years and had plans to give another four years, he said he is contemplating leaving the Army when his contract is up in June to find better care for his son.

“If my insurance won’t cover what I think is an essential, needed service, I might have to look at getting covered by other insurance,” he said.

Other options, Heggins said, include selling his vehicle and relying on his wife’s car to transport their family of six in order to afford out-of-pocket treatment, or taking out a loan. He sees hardship with any decision.

“It would be incredibly difficult,” he said. “I hope and pray that the Defense Health Agency figures this is out in a timely manner.”",,N,,2025-03-07 09:17:45.244171

""While every body is different, the number of push-ups you can do is often a good indicator of someone's muscular strength and endurance,"" Regis Pagett, founder and owner of R Personal Fitness in New York City, told Fox News Digital.

Based on data from Mayo Clinic, below is a breakdown of how many push-ups men and women should be able to complete based on age.

People in their 30s should be able to do at least 19 (women) and 21 (men).

People in their 40s should be able to do at least 14 (women) and 16 (men).

People in their 50s should be able to do at least 10 (women) and 12 (men).

People in their 60s (both genders) should be able to do at least 10 push-ups.

Weight-bearing exercises like push-ups can help increase bone density, which is particularly important as people age, according to Pagett.

""This is a major benefit of exercises with high resistance,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Strength in the upper body and core are two things that translate to everyday life, and the ability to push yourself off of the floor regularly is one that many people take for granted.""

Push-ups mainly work the pectoral muscles (chest), with the triceps being secondary in the motion, with the core (abdominals) supplying the strength to hold the body straight through the motion, according to Pagett.

A previous Harvard study showed that the ability for men to do 40 or more push-ups at 50 years old decreases the chance of cardiovascular disease by 96% compared to men who could do 10 or less, Pagett noted.

""The study also found that every push-up done after 10 had a decreased chance of cardiovascular disease,"" he added.

The entity known as DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk, is touting its cost-cutting measures across the federal workforce. But as NPR and others have documented, the Department of Government Efficiency's math does not always add up. Now DOGE says it's busy at work at both the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs. At this point, it's not entirely clear what that means. So for more, we begin with NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Hey there.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.

SUMMERS: Tom, tell us what you're hearing from the Pentagon.

BOWMAN: Well, the Pentagon put out a memo on Monday saying that the firings would start that day. They are looking to cut tens of thousands of probationary employees and using that money to pay for priorities such as more drones, ships and submarines. But, Juana, we're not getting a lot of detail from the Pentagon about where those cuts will come from. I'm getting calls from contacts in the Army, Air Force and Defense Health Agency about job cuts that have already taken place. One Air Force officer told his subordinates - get this - he's learning more from Facebook than his own command.

SUMMERS: Huh.

BOWMAN: Officials say cuts will start with so-called low performers and also those jobs the Pentagon says that are, quote, ""not in the public interest."" An Army veteran who worked at the Defense Health Agency said she got cut with a notice saying she was a low performer. But get this - six months ago she got a stellar performance review she shared with me. It says she exceeded all objectives and her work was truly transformative. I spoke with a Capitol Hill aide who said they're trying to get details about how decisions are made in the scope of these firings.

SUMMERS: This sounds pretty confusing, I got to say. Is that how people inside the Defense Department tell you they're feeling too?

BOWMAN: Oh, it's very confusing. I'm getting calls from some contacts inside the government and as well as neighbors asking me what I've heard. There's some information is being put out on social media accounts run by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials. But again, no great detail, just kind of this broad brush with terms like, quote, ""streamline operations,"" ""prioritize critical missions."" And this vagueness, confusion - it is also a lack of coordination. It's all having an impact on operations. I was talking with a retired officer in Europe who works for the Pentagon on training missions with other countries. They have two budget analysts who left, and they can't replace them because there's also a civilian hiring freeze.

SUMMERS: Thank you so much, Tom.

At this point, I want to bring in NPR's Quil Lawrence for more on the confusion these moves are creating. And Quil, you cover Veterans Affairs. And I know that you reported this week that the Office of Personnel Management has frozen the VA out of its own hiring software.

QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Yeah. It's a program called USA Staffing, and OPM sort of runs HR for many federal agencies. We heard from VAs and sources in at least seven states that VA couldn't send out hire letters because they were frozen out of their own HR software. That's for medical staff like doctors and nurses who are supposed to be exempt from the hiring freeze. And VA says it's coming up with a work-around. But it seems like two parts of the government pitted against each other, where DOGE and OPM are making these firings, and the VA is scrambling to undo or work around what they do.

Twice, for example, now, they fired staff from VA Suicide Crisis Hotline, who are not exempt from the hiring freeze. But then, VA scrambled to rehire them because they are mission critical. It's a suicide hotline. They announced a sudden cut of 875 contracts - that was over a week ago - and then they pulled that back, and now they're floating a different list of contracts that are being cut. And staff I'm talking with say that this is not inspiring confidence for these crucial hires they need. Doctors and nurses are in demand, and they're worried people will think twice about picking a job at VA.

SUMMERS: You also reported this week on an internal VA memo that they plan to downsize and layoff - I think it was something like 70- to 80,000 staff. I mean, here's my question. Can they do that without affecting veterans' care or benefits?

LAWRENCE: VA Secretary Doug Collins says that they can. He says they're going to carefully figure out how to get back to 2019 staff levels without affecting health care or benefits decisions. Collin says, in the past, the VA just kept on adding staff and funds, and his approach is to stress more about efficiency. And the VA, it's huge, but, you know, it takes care of about 9 million veterans, and their mission is that they have to be wherever the vets are. If they're here in New York City or they're in Nome, Alaska, they have to go to them.

And, I mean, VA staff did grow about 80,000 since 2019. And that's mostly because they were added to deal with something called the PACT Act. So Congress passed the PACT Act to expand VA care and include veterans who got exposed to burn pits in Iraq or Agent Orange in Vietnam, radiation. And they brought millions of vets into VA care, and VA went on a hiring spree to take care of them. It's not going to be easy to cut them, especially at this pace.

SUMMERS: Right.

LAWRENCE: And veterans say, you know, they already paid for this care by sucking dust - toxic dust in Iraq or Agent Orange in Vietnam.

SUMMERS: That's NPR's Quil Lawrence and Tom Bowman. Thanks to both of you.

BOWMAN: You're welcome.

LAWRENCE: Thank you.

Trump puts new limits on Musk’s authority amid DOGE backlash

Staffing decisions within federal agencies will be left up to the Trump administration's Cabinet secretaries and not Elon Musk, President Donald Trump said yesterday after a meeting that included some of the secretaries and his billionaire adviser. The new message marks a rare public curtailing of Musk's authority as he helps reshape the federal government through the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk had stepped on some Cabinet secretaries' toes, and other Republicans have bristled at the speed and intensity of the cuts.

""It's very important that we cut levels down to where they should be, but it's also important to keep the best and most productive people,"" Trump said on Truth Social. ""We say the 'scalpel' rather than the 'hatchet,'"" he added later in the social media post.

The instructions given to Cabinet members is that they should work alongside DOGE on spending and workforce reductions, Trump said. Final job cuts will be at the discretion of the department leaders. But if sufficient cuts aren’t made, Trump indicated that Musk would step in.

The sweeping cuts carried out by DOGE in the first weeks of Trump’s second term, which has included firing thousands of employees and moving to shutter entire agencies, have led to lawsuits, voter anxiety and heightened concerns from congressional Republicans. Some Republicans have called for greater transparency into DOGE’s work. This week, Musk met with some Senate Republicans behind closed doors to address concerns.

Still, Trump was sure to praise Musk and DOGE after yesterday’s meeting, saying “they’ve done an amazing job.”

Jobs report expected to show growth, but uncertainty looms

When the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its monthly employment report today for the month February, it's expected to show roughly 170,000 new payrolls added last month. That's up from the 143,000 job gains in January. And the unemployment rate is expected to have held steady at 4%, analysts said. But as President Donald Trump's agenda takes shape, including a still-evolving tariff agenda and massive job cuts, America's sturdy economy could soon show signs of trouble.

This week, two unofficial reports showed a job market that was scaling back. Job-cut announcements in February reached their largest one-month level since the depths of the pandemic in mid-2020, the consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said. And private-sector payrolls processor ADP tallied 77,000 net gains in February, far fewer what had been forecast. Read the full story here.

What’s causing disruptions to the military’s health care program

Changes this year to Tricare, the military's health care program which provides benefits to about 9.6 million people, have brought cascading disruptions to millions of service members, their families and network providers nationwide.

On the East Coast alone, about 16,000 health care providers have not been paid for months, forcing many to drop Tricare patients, reduce their hours or consider closing their clinics. On the West Coast, beneficiaries are struggling with long call center wait times and stalled referrals and authorizations, federal officials said.

Reporter Melissa Chan spoke to some of the families and providers affected by the recent changes. Among them are Army Sgt. Bo Heggins of Tennessee, who has had to stop taking his 8-year-old son, who has autism, to occupational therapy appointments. Meanwhile, San Diego-based provider Brenda Stephens had to pause all services for her mental health clinic's 350 Tricare patients and lay off seven employees.

The Defense Health Agency, which oversees Tricare, has acknowledged that several challenges have cropped up nationwide since the beginning of the year. A DHA spokesperson said the agency was working with the contractors to resolve the issues. Read the full story here.

Staff Pick: F1’s Lando Norris is ready to win it all

I became a Formula 1 fan when I was 11 years old and the McLaren team won the championship. Twenty-six years later, I got to interview Lando Norris for NBC News after a breakthrough 2024 season, in which he led McLaren back to its first constructors’ title since that 1998 season. Norris isn’t a typical interviewee (at least for a reporter who primarily covers politics). His racing talent is extraordinary, but he’s also personable and authentic.

Despite having a breakthrough season winning his first four races this season, Norris fell short of his overarching goal, finishing runner-up to Max Verstappen for the driver’s crown. We chatted about his reflections on 2024, his candid admissions about the mistakes he made, and why he’s ready to come back stronger as the new season begins next week. — Sahil Kapur, NBC senior national political reporter and F1 correspondent
