In addition to the increase in retail pharmacy costs, Tricare will introduce new coverage for some procedures, according to the announcement.
During that time frame, patients also may switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select or enroll in the Federal Dental and Vision Insurance program.
“Tricare Prime Atlanta and Tricare Prime Tampa represent an innovative approach to advance access to care, enhance the patient experience, and strive for better health outcomes,” Dr. David Krulak, director of the Tricare Health Plan at the Defense Health Agency, said in a statement when the pilot was announced May 7.","Tricare health beneficiaries who fill prescriptions outside a military health facility will pay more for medications next year, but they will also have expanded access to new treatments for conditions like lung cancer and chronic back pain, under an announcement made by the federal government Tuesday.

In 2026, the rates for 30-day retail prescriptions will remain at $16 for generic drugs, but they will increase to $48 for brand-name medications. Ninety-day mail-order prescriptions will cost $14 for generic drugs and $44 for branded prescriptions. Non-formulary drugs will be $85 for the 30-day retail or 90-day mail-order prescriptions.

Prescriptions filled at military hospitals or clinics will continue to be available at no cost to patients, and active-duty personnel still won’t pay cost-shares or copays at retail pharmacies for covered medications.

The new rates reflect a 12% to 15.8% rise over the current copays, which were set at the start of 2024. The increase is part of a plan initiated in 2018 by Congress and the Defense Department to increase the share patients pay for their medical services through the military health program.

In addition to the increase in retail pharmacy costs, Tricare will introduce new coverage for some procedures, according to the announcement. Those include: radiofrequency ablation for uterine fibroids; cryosurgery for lung cancer or other cancers that have metastasized to the lungs; coronary calcium tests for patients suspected of having heart disease; and basivertebral nerve ablation for patients with chronic back pain.

Tricare also plans to cover the cost of electric devices, known as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or TENS units, to address post-operative pain. Tricare will allow patients who meet the criteria for a likelihood of developing certain types of cancer to have prophylactic surgeries, including mastectomies and hysterectomies.

The military health program also will no longer require some dependents who have lost their hearing to use hearing aids for at least three to six months before being eligible for cochlear implants, according to the announcement.

Tricare will continue to cover monoclonal antibody drugs for early treatment of Alzheimer’s disease — a benefit it began last year. Patients must receive pre-authorization to receive the medication and must undergo testing to determine they have the condition.

Also beginning next year, active-duty family members and retirees and their eligible family members who live in Tampa, Florida, or Atlanta will be able to enroll in a new Tricare Prime option managed by CareSource Military and Veterans.

New Tricare Prime option coming to beneficiaries in 2 metro areas

The pilot, which will run through 2029, provides a new managed care program for military families beyond military treatment facilities or Tricare managed by Humana Government Business, the contractor for the East Region.

Beneficiaries interested in enrolling in the new program will be able to do so during Tricare Open Season, set for Nov. 10 through Dec. 9. During that time frame, patients also may switch between Tricare Prime and Tricare Select or enroll in the Federal Dental and Vision Insurance program. Open season for FEDVIP closes Dec. 8.

More than half of patients (20 821 patients [56%]) received all hip osteoarthritis care (eg, index and follow-up care) in the purchased care system only; 6896 patients (19%) received only direct system care for hip osteoarthritis; the remaining 9522 patients (26%) received hip osteoarthritis care across both systems.

Adjusted probabilities maintained the same order, with White patients having the highest estimated probability of THA at 3 years (18%; 95% CI, 16%-21%), followed by Hispanic patients (17%; 95% CI, 14%-20%), patients with another race and ethnicity (16%; 95% CI, 13%-19%), American Indian and Alaska Native patients (15%; 95% CI, 11%-21%), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (15%; 95% CI, 12%-18%), and Black patients (13%; 95% CI, 11%-16%).","Introduction

Delays in total joint arthroplasty are associated with decreased quality of life and may confer worse postarthroplasty outcomes.1 While the projected demand for total hip arthroplasty (THA) is estimated to increase over the next decades,2,3 access is tempered by variation in orthopedic surgeon location and training programs.4,5 To date, research has identified several patient- and structural-level factors associated with THA receipt across multi-institutional studies, national samples, and Military Health System (MHS), Veterans Health Administration, and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.6-13 However, there is a lack of literature that accounts for nonsurgical guideline-congruent and guideline-incongruent care after osteoarthritis diagnosis (eg, opioid prescriptions, imaging, therapeutic interventions)14-19 and uses time-to-event models to account for longitudinal nuances in hip osteoarthritis care.

Given delayed and inadequate osteoarthritis treatment can negatively impact quality of life and incur financial burden,20 evaluating THA timing within the context of osteoarthritis-related care enables targeted intervention across large health care systems. In the MHS, patients receiving THA tend to be younger and male relative to national databases.21 Moreover, unlike private health care settings, surgeons in military treatment facilities do not contend with payers or receive increased reimbursement based on productivity. Patients enrolled in TRICARE insurance (eg, active duty and retired service members and their eligible family members) do not incur large out-of-pocket costs when receiving a THA within military treatment facilities (eg, direct care system) but may pay more in the civilian network (eg, purchased care system). Therefore, evaluating THA timing in MHS beneficiaries enables evaluation of the context of direct and purchased care systems.

The objective of this study was to evaluate time to THA after hip osteoarthritis diagnosis in patients enrolled in insurance plans in which some or all health care is provided at military treatment facilities, when such services are available at the local facility (eg, TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, direct care only). These plans are like health maintenance organization plans in which patients must receive specialty care referrals (eg, orthopedic surgery, imaging) from their primary care managers. Other plans that are outside of the scope of this study, such as TRICARE Select, are akin to preferred provider organizations and incur higher out-of-pocket costs. It was hypothesized that variation in time to THA would be associated with patient-, care-, and structural-level factors, which would be maintained in sensitivity models evaluating patients receiving care in only the direct vs purchased care systems, separately. Given prior research, it was specifically hypothesized that THA receipt would be less likely in American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic patients and patients with another race and ethnicity compared with White patients; female patients compared with male patients; older patients compared with younger patients; and patients with fewer imaging, orthopedic surgeon, and therapeutic visits compared with those with more visits.

Methods

Study Design, Data Sources, and Record Selection

This retrospective cohort study was determined to be exempt from review and informed consent by the Uniformed Services University institutional review board because this study leveraged secondary research for which consent is not required, per the Revised Common Rule, 45 CFR 46.104(d)(4). This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. Medical record data (eg, encounter records, prescriptions) were extracted from the MHS Information Platform. Records were included of adult patients ages 18 to 89 years, who received an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) M16 diagnosis for hip osteoarthritis (primary, posttraumatic, and unspecified osteoarthritis) between March 1, 2018, and June 30, 2023 (ie, index diagnosis), without prior documented diagnosis from March 1, 2015, to March 29, 2018, to ensure this diagnosis was the first within a 3-year period. There was no requirement that the hip osteoarthritis diagnosis be the primary diagnosis for the encounter.

Patients were excluded if they had an M16 diagnosis within 3 years prior to the index hip osteoarthritis diagnosis (including International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] and ICD-10 diagnosis codes) or THA; did not have race and ethnicity documented in their medical records; were not an active-duty service member, retired service member (eg, served ≥20 years before separation), or family member; were not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, or direct care only plans at index; had a diagnosis corresponding to cancer, infection, or hip fracture between index and censor dates; or lacked documented hip osteoarthritis diagnoses after the week of index diagnosis, as time-to-event analyses required censoring or the terminal event (THA receipt) to occur after the index (ie, week 0) and data were aggregated on the week-level. Therefore, all patients had at least 1 follow-up visit in which hip osteoarthritis was documented at least 1 week and up to 3 years after index. After identifying the index diagnosis, direct and purchased care records up to 3 years before and 3 years after the index diagnosis were extracted up until June 21, 2024. As such, some patients did not have 3 years of postindex records. The Figure provides a flowchart of included and excluded records.

Figure. Flowchart of Patient Selection and Inclusion

Primary Outcome

The primary outcome was time-to-THA receipt within 3 years after the index diagnosis. Receipt of THA was indicated by Current Procedural Terminology code 27130 or ICD-10 Procedure Coding System codes 0SR9*, 0SRA*, 0SRB*, 0SRE*, 0SRR*, or 0SRS*.

Model Covariates

Covariates included patient-, care-, and structural-level factors. Patient-level information included self-reported race and ethnicity recorded in the administrative records (American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, Hispanic, White, and another race and ethnicity [eg, >1 race and ethnicity]), sex (male or female), age, and beneficiary group (active-duty service member, retired service member, family member). Age was retained as a continuous variable in the models and categorized for descriptive purposes into 3 age groups: younger than 55 years, 55 to 69 years, and 70 years or older. Patient-level diagnosis covariates included those documented within 1 year before the index diagnosis. Diagnosis covariate flags (yes or no) included psychiatric diagnoses, pain-related diagnoses per prior literature,22 and obesity diagnoses per prior literature.23 An age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score24 was categorized as 0, 1, or 2 or greater. Tobacco use (yes or no) was defined as nicotine dependence diagnosis or self-reported and clinician-documented tobacco use. Care-related covariates included hip injections and hip imaging visits before index diagnosis using procedure codes described in prior studies25 (eAppendix in Supplement 1). Due to data skewness, 3-year preindex cumulative hip injections and hip imaging receipt were categorized as 0, 1, or 2 or more visits, each. Additional care-related covariates were time-dependent and cumulative, such that values could increase across time and had a maximum value of the 99th percentile due to data skewness. These covariates (99th percentile) included postindex cumulative opioid prescriptions (9 prescriptions) and days in which patients received hip imaging (7 days), orthopedic surgeon visits (6 days), and therapeutic visits (eg, physical therapy, biofeedback injections, other interventional pain therapies; 24 days). Hip injections and opioid prescriptions may have been for other pain-related conditions but could have contributed to hip osteoarthritis management. We used treatment days rather than encounters because some encounters included multiple procedure codes (eg, manual therapy, education, exercise therapy) and clinicians (eg, physical therapist, occupational therapist). At the index week, all postindex cumulative variables were set at 0, then increased by 1 with each care-related event. Lastly, structural-level information included the index care system (direct, purchased), year of index hip osteoarthritis diagnosis, and geographic area of index diagnosis per US Census regions and divisions.26 Divisions are a more specific geographic area and were used unless sample size warranted use of the region. Therefore, geographic area categories were Pacific (division), Mountain (division), Midwest (region), Northeast (region), West South Central (division), East South Central (division), South Atlantic (division), and in US Territories, in another country, or in an unknown location (neither a division nor region).

Statistical Analysis

Records were right-censored on the last recorded visit date if no THA occurred and no visits occurred after the 3-year postindex period or at 3 years after index if no THA occurred and visit records continued after 3 years. Nonparametric bivariate analyses (eg, Kruskal-Wallis tests, nonparametric χ2 tests) with pairwise tests and Benjamini and Hochberg–adjusted P values compared patients who (1) were excluded due not having race and ethnicity recorded in administrative records, as well as due to censoring in the index week (eg, had no other hip osteoarthritis visits after 1-week after the index diagnosis) vs included in the analysis (eTable 1 in Supplement 1), (2) those who did not and did receive a THA within 3 years after the index diagnosis, and (3) those who received hip osteoarthritis care in the purchased care system only, direct system only, or both systems (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Bivariate tables were constructed using the compareGroups27 package in R software versions 4.4.0 to 4.5.1 (R Project for Statistical Computing). We used the survminer package28 in R to create unadjusted survival curves and a censoring table across races and ethnicities (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1).

The primary model was constructed in 2 steps. First, a Cox proportional hazards model (survival model) examined the assumption of proportionality for each covariate using the survival package29 in R. The proportionality assumption assumes the hazard ratio is constant across the observation period and all covariate levels. Covariates not meeting the proportionality assumption were modeled as fixed and time-varying covariates (eg, time × covariate interaction) in subsequent models.

The primary model was a piecewise exponential additive model, a generalized additive model (GAM) with a Poisson distribution, estimated using the pammtools30 and mgcv31 R packages. With GAM, continuous covariates with adequate ranges (eg, age) can be modeled as smooth covariates to model nonlinear associations between covariates and the outcome. Time-varying covariates are modeled as smooth covariates to allow for effects that can change across time (eg, nonproportional hazards). When time-varying covariates are not significant, the corresponding fixed covariates are interpreted alone. If corresponding fixed and time-varying covariates are significant, the fixed covariate indicates the geometric mean baseline hazard and the time-varying covariate is interpreted using visualizations to determine how the hazards change across time.32

Three sensitivity models were evaluated. Two GAMs replicated the primary model separately for patients who received hip osteoarthritis care solely in direct vs purchased care systems. A third GAM extended the direct care–only GAM by including a random effect for military treatment facility of index diagnosis. Due to sample size requirements with multilevel models, sites with at least 25 index diagnoses were included.

GAM results are rendered as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% CIs, which indicate the incidence of THA in a comparator group relative to the incidence in the reference group. For example, if the incidence rate was 10% in a comparison group and 20% in a reference group, the IRR would be 0.5 (10% / 20%). Results of the GAM were tabulated using the sjPlot R package.33 Estimated survival probabilities for fixed, smooth, and time-varying covariates were calculated using the pammtools R package30 based on the a priori reference categories of nonfocal variables as follows: White race and ethnicity, age 60 years, male, active-duty service member, with an age-adjusted CCI score of 1, no psychiatric or obesity diagnosis prior to the index diagnosis, with a pain-related diagnosis, index direct care system, index year 2020, index diagnosis in the South Atlantic geographic area, 0 hip injections or imaging visits prior to the index diagnosis, 1 imaging visit after diagnosis, 0 opioid prescriptions after diagnosis, and 2 therapeutic visits after diagnosis. These probabilities facilitate inferences regarding relative differences. Changes to a priori categories shift probability estimates. The cumulative hazard differences for significant time-varying smoothed covariates were calculated using the pammtools R package.30 Time-varying survival probabilities and cumulative hazard differences were visualized using the ggplot2 R package.34 P values were 2-sided, and statistical significance was set at P ≤ .05. Data were analyzed from July 2024 to August 2025.

Results

Sample Description

Overall, 37 239 patients (median [IQR] age 59 [50-64] years; 21 553 [58%] male) met all inclusion and exclusion criteria (Figure and Table 1). The cohort included 320 American Indian and Alaska Native patients (1%), 1603 Asian and Pacific Islander patients (4%), 8123 Black patients (22%), 2041 Hispanic patients (5%), 23 327 White patients (63%), and 1825 patients with another race and ethnicity (5%). Most patients had an index diagnosis for primary hip osteoarthritis (33 659 patients [90%]), followed by unspecified (2383 patients [6%]), hip dysplasia–related (578 patients [2%]), posttraumatic (389 patients [1%]), other (224 patients [1%]), and secondary (92 patients [<1%]) osteoarthritis. More than half of patients (20 821 patients [56%]) received all hip osteoarthritis care (eg, index and follow-up care) in the purchased care system only; 6896 patients (19%) received only direct system care for hip osteoarthritis; the remaining 9522 patients (26%) received hip osteoarthritis care across both systems. The median (IQR) proportion of hip osteoarthritis care provided in the direct care system was 0% (0%-64%) and the mean (SD) was 29% (40%). Of patients who received a THA, 9048 patients (86%) had a THA on the side matching their index diagnosis; 1113 patients (11%) had a THA on the side matching a postindex diagnosis; and 341 patients (3%) had an unspecified THA and/or hip osteoarthritis side or were unmatched in laterality.

Across the 3-year postindex period and without accounting for censoring, 502 patients (28%) received a THA. Proportions were highest among White patients (7406 patients [32%]), followed by patients with another race and ethnicity (432 patients [24%]), and American Indian and Alaska Native (72 patients [23%]), Black (1827 patients [23%]), Hispanic (438 patients [22%]), and Asian and Pacific Islander (327 patients [20%]) patients. Of patients who received a THA, the unadjusted time to THA was lowest for Hispanic patients (median [IQR], 28 [14-59] weeks), followed by White patients (median [IQR], 29 [14-65] weeks), patients with another race and ethnicity (median [IQR], 31 [14-68]), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (median [IQR], 34 [15-69] weeks), Black patients (median [IQR], 36 [16-77] weeks), and American Indian and Alaska Native patients (median [IQR], 44 [15-81]). Proportions were higher and time to THA lower for male (6533 patients [30%]; median [IQR], 29 [14-65] weeks) relative to female (3969 patients [25%]; median [IQR], 32 [15-70] weeks) patients and for retired service members (6089 patients [33%]; median [IQR], 29 [13-62] weeks) and family members (3526 patients [27%]; median [IQR], 33 [15-71] weeks) compared with active-duty service members (887 patients [16%]; median [IQR], 38 [17-78] weeks). Patients younger than 55 years had the lowest proportions of unadjusted THA receipt (13 325 patients [21%]), followed by patients 70 years and older (6098 patients [28%]) and ages 55 to 69 years (17 816 patients [34%]). However, patients 70 years and older had the shortest time to THA (median [IQR], 27 [13-60] weeks) compared with patients ages 55 to 69 years (median [IQR], 30 [14-66] weeks) and younger than 55 years (median [IQR], 34 [15-74] weeks). Patients receiving a hip osteoarthritis diagnosis in the direct care system had both higher proportion of THA receipt (4120 patients [31%]) and longer time to THA (median [IQR], 34 [16-71] weeks) than in the purchased care system (6382 patients [27%]; median [IQR], 28 [13-64] weeks). Lastly, THA receipt was highest and time to THA shortest in the Mountain area (1166 patients [33%]; median [IQR], 27 [13-62] weeks), whereas THA occurred least often and with the longest duration for patients in US territories, in other countries, or in an unknown location (128 patients [14%]; median [IQR], 45 [23-88] weeks). Unadjusted survival curves and censoring frequencies by race and ethnicity, sex, beneficiary group, age group, system of diagnosis, and geographic area are in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1.

Bivariate analysis indicated patients included vs excluded varied across all tested variables (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). All potential covariates, aside from an obesity diagnosis, were significantly different between patients who did not and did receive a THA (Table 1). In the Cox proportional hazards models, several variables across both primary and sensitivity models were not proportional and therefore were included as time-varying covariates.

Primary Model

Time to THA varied across several patient-, care-, and system-level covariates. Asian and Pacific Islander patients (IRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.66-0.88; P < .001), Black patients (IRR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.74-0.85; P < .001), and Hispanic patients (IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .01) had lower incidence of THA compared with White patients across time (Table 2; eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). There was a significant time-varying effect for Black patients, such that cumulative hazard differences steeply decreased within the first year, with less intense decreases afterward. Adjusted probabilities indicated that an estimated 37% (95% CI, 32%-42%) of White patients received a THA by 3 years after the index diagnosis, followed by Hispanic patients (34%; 95% CI, 29%-40%), patients with another race and ethnicity (33%; 95% CI, 28%-39%), American Indian and Alaska Native patients (32%; 95% CI, 24%-42%), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (30%; 95% CI, 25%-36%), and Black patients (28%; 95% CI, 24%-33%). To examine how a priori levels of nonfocal covariates might affect estimates, probabilities were recalculated to change the assumption of direct care index diagnosis to purchased care. Adjusted probabilities maintained the same order, with White patients having the highest estimated probability of THA at 3 years (18%; 95% CI, 16%-21%), followed by Hispanic patients (17%; 95% CI, 14%-20%), patients with another race and ethnicity (16%; 95% CI, 13%-19%), American Indian and Alaska Native patients (15%; 95% CI, 11%-21%), Asian and Pacific Islander patients (15%; 95% CI, 12%-18%), and Black patients (13%; 95% CI, 11%-16%). Adjusted probabilities across races and ethnicities are depicted in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1.

IRRs and 3-year adjusted probabilities were lower for patients who had (probability, 21%; 95% CI, 27%-35%) vs did not have (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) a psychiatric diagnosis (IRR, 0.79, 0.76-0.83; P < .001), had (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) vs did not have (probability, 49%; 95% CI, 43%-55%) a pain-related diagnosis (IRR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.66-0.72; P < .001), and had (probability, 34%; 95% CI, 30%-40%) vs did not have (probability, 37%, 32%-42%) an obesity diagnosis (IRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96; P < .001) prior to the index diagnosis. Patients with a CCI score of 2 or greater were less likely to undergo THA (probability, 32%; 95% CI, 28%-36%) compared to those with a CCI score of 0 (probability, 35%; 95% CI, 30%-41%) (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74-0.97; P = .02). Patients diagnosed in the purchased care system (probability, 18%; 95% CI, 16%-21%) compared with the direct care system (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) were less likely to undergo THA (IRR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.36-0.40; P < .001), and those diagnosed in later years (eg, 2022: probability, 36%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) were less likely to receive THA than those diagnosed earlier (eg, 2018: probability, 38%; 95% CI, 33%-43%) (IRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99, P = .001). Patients with 1 (probability, 32%; 95% CI, 27%-37%) or more (probability, 29%; 95% CI, 25%-34%) preindex injections were less likely to receive THA than those who received none (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) (1 injection: IRR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90; P < .001; >1 injections: IRR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70-0.81; P < .001). Patients with at least 2 preindex imaging visit days (probability, 34%; 95% CI, 28%-40%) were less likely to receive THA than those with 0 visit days (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69-0.86; P < .001) (Table 2; eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). Probabilities and incidences were higher for retired service members (probability, 49%; 95% CI, 45%-53%) and family members (probability, 50%; 95% CI, 45%-55%) compared with active-duty service members (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) (retired service members: IRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.24-1.56; P < .001; family members: IRR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.30-1.69; P < .001). Male patients were more likely to receive THA (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%) compared with female patients (probability, 32%; 95% CI, 28%-37%) (IRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11-1.31; P < .001). Patients with increasing orthopedic surgeon visit days after the index diagnosis (eg, 0 days: probability, 22%; 95% CI, 19%-26%; vs 2 days: probability, 58%; 95% CI, 52%-64%) were more likely to receive THA (IRR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.64-1.69; P < .001), as were those with more opioid prescriptions (eg, 0 prescriptions: probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%; vs 2 prescriptions: probability, 43%; 95% CI, 38%-49%; IRR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P = .002) or more imaging visit days (eg, 0 days: probability, 30%; 95% CI, 26%-35%; vs 2 days: probability, 45%; 95% CI, 39%-50%; IRR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24-1.28, P < .001) (Table 2; eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). IRRs varied in direction across geographic areas. Compared with patients diagnosed in the South Atlantic area (probability, 37%; 95% CI, 32%-42%), those diagnosed in the Midwest (probability, 46%; 95% CI, 40%-53%) (IRR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.49; P < .001), Mountain (probability, 45%; 95% CI, 39%-51%) (IRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.46; P < .001), and Pacific (probability, 42%, 36%-48%) (IRR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.40; P < .001) areas had higher incidence of THA; whereas, patients diagnosed in a US territory, another country, or an unknown location had lower incidence (probability, 24%; 95% CI, 18%-31%) (IRR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52-0.78; P < .001).

Several smooth and time-varying covariates were also significant, indicating that longitudinal hazards were nonproportional for several covariates (Table 2). Therefore, visualizations are provided in eFigures 2 to 5 in Supplement 1. Lastly, adjusted cumulative probabilities of THA receipt across covariate values at 1, 2, and 3 years after the index diagnosis are reported in eTable 4 in Supplement 1.

Sensitivity Analysis

In the first set of sensitivity GAMs, 6896 patients were included in the direct care–only GAM and 20 821 patients were included in the purchased care–only GAM (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Therefore, 9522 patients who had hip osteoarthritis care across both systems were removed from this analysis. There were 6165 patients included in the sensitivity analysis of patients receiving all hip osteoarthritis care in the direct care system with an index diagnosis at a military treatment facility with at least 25 included patients. Each sensitivity model required different time-varying covariates.

The significant associations found in the primary model were similar to the sensitivity models with some exceptions. Similar to the primary model, Black patients had lower IRRs across all 3 models (direct care: IRR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82; P < .001; purchased care: IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.88; P < .001; direct care with facility random effect: IRR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = .01) than White patients (eTable 3 and eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). Asian and Pacific Islander patients had lower IRR in both the primary and purchased care models (IRR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; P = .02); there was a lack of statistically significant differences in the direct care models. While patients with another race and ethnicity did not significantly vary in time to THA in the primary model compared with White patients, the IRR was lower in the purchased care model (IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97; P = .02). The significantly lower IRRs in the primary analysis for Hispanic patients did not maintain in the sensitivity models. Male patients had higher IRRs in the primary and purchased care models (IRR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.17-1.43; P < .001) compared with female patients, but not in the direct care sensitivity models. The association of having 2 or more preindex imaging visits with lower IRRs compared with none in the primary model was maintained in the purchased care model (IRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93, P = .004) and direct care sensitivity model with the facility-level random effect (IRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.90; P = .02). Patients with CCI scores 2 or greater and fewer opioid prescriptions had lower IRRs in the primary model but lacked significance across the 3 sensitivity models.

IRR varied across geographic areas, with differences in the direction of associations across models. Compared with the South Atlantic area, patients in the Midwest had higher incidence of THA in the purchased care model (IRR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48; P = .001), similar to the primary model, but lower incidence in the direct care model with the facility-level random effect (IRR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-1.70; P = .006). Similarly, patients in the Mountain area had higher incidence of THA in the purchased care model (IRR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.27-1.66; P < .001), like the primary model, but lower incidence in the direct care model (IRR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46-0.80; P < .001).

Discussion

In this cohort study, several patient-, care-, and structural-level factors were associated with time to THA in a sample of patients enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Plus, and direct care–only plans. Similar to prior research, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and Hispanic patients, compared with White patients, and female patients, compared with male patients, were less likely to receive a THA across time.6-8,13 In sensitivity analyses of subsamples receiving all hip osteoarthritis care in the direct vs purchased care systems, Black patients and female patients had lower hazards of THA across time. While older patients and retired service members and family members had higher THA hazards relative to younger patients and active-duty service members, respectively, the discrepancies increased within the first year, then plateaued. Most athletes return to sports within 6 to 12 months of hip arthroplasty,35 but return may be contingent on the physical demands of the sport.36 For active-duty service members, not being able to maintain physical fitness requirements for an extended period may have negative career implications (eg, reduced deployability, medical separation).37 Alternatively, younger patients and active-duty service members may have received an osteoarthritis diagnosis earlier in the disease process, which could be more amenable to nonpharmacological and pharmacological management. Taken together, patient-level variation in time to THA within the MHS is similar to prior studies and warrants further investigation into osteoarthritis diagnosis timing and referral pathways.

Delay in THA may be due to systemic barriers across geographic areas, especially for patients in the purchased care system whose health care is not delivered in a centralized facility. In a 2018 study,38 Black patients had worse presurgical pain and functioning before THA; after surgery, Black patients residing in areas with higher proportions of Medicaid enrollees and people whose incomes were below the federal poverty threshold had worse outcomes than those living in less socioeconomically marginalized areas. However, White patients who resided in areas with high vs low socioeconomic marginalization lacked differences.38 In a Medicare claims evaluation,39 hospital service areas with higher proportions of Black residents tended to have fewer surgeons per capita. Other studies have reported that Black and Hispanic patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty were less likely to receive care from high-volume hospitals, which may result in worse outcomes.40,41 In this study, geographic area was associated with THA receipt, but variation across geographic areas with direct vs purchased care systems highlights the need to evaluate and incorporate orthopedic surgeon locations, structural factors, and beneficiary residences within geospatial modeling to optimize personnel allocation and care access.

Patients who received their index hip osteoarthritis diagnosis in purchased care were less likely to receive a THA across time relative to those diagnosed in direct care. This finding demonstrates challenges with purchased care access, which may be due to reduced reimbursement rates42 or increased care navigation demands. It is unclear whether increasing reimbursement rates or access to care navigators would improve THA timeliness. Prior research indicates that the Medicare Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model may have improved total knee and hip arthroplasty accessibility for Hispanic patients but may have reduced accessibility for Black patients, with no changes in receipt for White patients.43 While increasing direct care recapture is a Department of Defense goal,44 it is unclear whether the direct care system has adequate capacity, per reports by both the Government Accountability Office and Department of Defense Inspector General.45,46 As a result, access to THA, as well as hip osteoarthritis care consistent with the policy-directed Stepped Care Model for Pain,47 may be stymied. Recommendations from these reports highlight the need to fully evaluate health care requirements, accessibility, barriers, and staffing to implement effective strategies across direct and purchased care systems.

Because the MHS is a single-payer system, surgeon allocation and care models could be altered to optimize timely THA access, reduce delay, and enhance value-based care. However, recent estimates indicate total joint arthroplasty volumes at military treatment facilities and among its orthopedic surgeons are generally low, and surgeons with the highest volume are still considered to have a relatively medium volume48 compared with prior research.49 Restructuring the MHS to enable high-volume arthroplasty hospitals and surgeons could improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.40,41,50,51 Future restructuring requires a thorough evaluation of factors preventing high-volume arthroplasty facilities and surgeons, as volume could be attributed to many factors (eg, surgical and imaging personnel, equipment, and room availability; patient transportation; and access to post-THA physical therapy).

Limitations

This study has several limitations. Several factors associated with THA (eg, osteoarthritis symptom severity, hip joint trauma history, morphology, environmental exposures) were not available in these data, and the proportion of patients with posttraumatic hip osteoarthritis index diagnoses was small (1%). To account for symptom severity, analyses included time-dependent health care covariates that could offset THA need (eg, therapeutic visits) or made THA more likely (eg, imaging and orthopedic surgeon visits).52 The aggregated therapeutic visits variable incorporated many care types; specific conclusions regarding which therapies were attributed to THA timing were outside the study scope. Recorded diagnoses may be provisional and may not represent finalized or confirmed diagnoses. Therefore, there were several bivariate differences between patients who were included vs excluded from the sample due to not having a follow-up osteoarthritis visit at least 1 week after the index diagnosis. Evaluating why patients did not continue hip osteoarthritis care was outside the study scope. This study did not include patients whose race and ethnicity were not recorded in their records; bivariate analyses indicated that patients without race and ethnicity in their administrative records were disproportionately family members of TRICARE policy holders. Historically, TRICARE registration is done by the primary policy holder (eg, active-duty or retired service member), and policy holders are not required to report the race and ethnicity of family members. Therefore, findings may not generalize to patients who are family members. While management of hip and other lower-limb conditions could indirectly affect hip osteoarthritis symptoms and this study leveraged hip imaging and injection codes used in previous work, it is not possible to confirm their use was for hip osteoarthritis or the specific injection type. Due to the lack of adequate sample sizes at purchased care hospitals, analyses could not incorporate a random effect for facility in the primary and purchased care models. This study only included patients enrolled in specific TRICARE and direct care–only plans; therefore, generalizability to patients in other health care systems may be limited.

Conclusions

This cohort study identified variation in time to THA among MHS beneficiaries. Consistent with US Government Accountability Office and Department of Defense Inspector General reports, future research could be used to improve THA accessibility and reduce barriers by accounting for structural inputs, such as personnel availability and reimbursement rates within the context of geographic location.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/939703/zoi251101f1_1761061286.41293.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=LRB98x-9ruaDwtBT24qXNIkMHdaTsuzraPvY2pTd4Z19P10I8F9oIgZQmTKAxwR1NE-QELmaBbLxIYcPC4a0XEpSm6BGd0Vqtole0ang13OmI2tSel~AXZwMWVUQOK47Ex5VjE4iCA6e-QQef10-ZOol0m6YhvW-LQfecz7PZAb46orfsaZScV0o6De49eB6D61Vlia2nTP-YStDYGkeqQZvyszyJX0yEYoxW5ra2~HqHjbfBQpoHU2wlmDNfwYH~80R5WI7kZmvobPvjf20iG4haE0G9Ob2wYAxEWp4suoT8pODELpMPc6Zg7eM-VAi3Ed0O7o1TCgiOPxmWLfZpg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,0.0,2025-10-28 16:21:47.937022

The government shutdown is putting loans from the Small Business Administration on hold. SBA estimates that $170 million in loans have been paused each day. That adds up to more than $4.5 billion over the length of the shutdown. SBA paid out more than $45 billion in loans to 85,000 small business in fiscal 2025. That’s a record high for the agency.

The slowdown in federal procurement is taking its toll on another federal contractor. The government shutdown will cost Booz Allen Hamilton $30 million in revenue and $15 million in profit if it lasts through the end of the week. In its quarterly earnings call, Matt Calderone, Booz Allen's executive vice president and CFO, said the disruption in the federal civilian sector is forcing the company to take out $150 million in annualized revenue. He said Booz Allen's civilian revenue is down more than 20% this year. Booz Allen said it will reduce layers and numbers in its senior ranks. Officials didn't provide details of its plans.

The Environmental Protection Agency is pushing new cybersecurity tools to help water systems protect their networks. The EPA last week released a series of guides, plans and checklists to help water facilities incorporate cybersecurity into their planning and operations. They come as cyber attacks targeting water systems have increased in recent years. The EPA and other oversight agencies have urged water and wastewater utilities to adopt basic cyber hygiene practices to defend their systems.

Some shutdown-exempt employees at the Food and Drug Administration are still waiting for missed paychecks. Over 7,000 FDA employees were marked as furloughed in the agency’s payroll and timekeeping system, causing some but not all to receive a missing or partial paycheck last week. FDA employees have been instructed to report any errors to the agency’s HR system and to submit another report if the issue isn’t resolved by this Thursday. Most FDA employees keep working during a government shutdown and are paid on time, using carryover funds.

TRICARE beneficiaries can enroll in or make changes to their health plan for 2026. TRICARE Open Season begins on Nov. 10 and runs through Dec. 9. The Defense Department has also announced several major TRICARE program changes for 2026, like eliminating cost-sharing for all covered contraceptives and begin covering FDA-approved weight loss drugs for treating obesity. TRICARE will also no longer cover puberty blockers or hormone therapy for minors to treat gender dysphoria. In addition, beneficiaries will receive expanded coverage for procedures such as lung cancer treatments and preventive surgeries for patients at high genetic risk of cancer. The program is also updating rules for automatic prescription refill procedures. All changes take effect January 1, 2026.

Service members have reported receiving incorrect pay or no pay at all during the mid-month pay cycle as the shutdown continues. Out of 369 military families that reached out to the National Military Family Association, an advocacy group that represents service members and their families nationwide, 164 reported being underpaid, some by as little as $148 and others by as much as $2,000. Most affected families were underpaid by about $600 to $800. About 55 families said they were not paid at all, while 50 families said they were overpaid, some by $400, while one family said they received three times their regular paycheck. The Defense Department has instructed service members to contact their finance office or notify their commanding officer if there is an issue with their pay.

Nearly 3,000 federal employees have already received $150 dollar grants from the Federal Employee Education and Assistance Fund under its shutdown assistance program. FEEA said these employees are from 49 states and are using the grants for essentials like groceries, gas and other basic necessities. A majority of the recipients are excepted service employees and almost two-thirds work at DoD and DHS, including CBP and TSA. Employees from the IRS and SSA make up another large percentage of the grantees. These FEEA Board of Directors has earmarked up to $1 million for this program.

The shutdown is starting to put a drag on the security clearance process. The Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency is still processing background investigations during the shutdown thanks to its Working Capital Fund. But DCSA is not accepting any new cases from industry, which could potentially put a strain on backlogs when the shutdown ends. DCSA also put a hold on contractor fingerprint submissions. And the agency has paused facility security inspections and cybersecurity assessments.

The funding will support the creation of a portable device designed for epidural steroid injections at forward-deployed military hospitals, with development expected to take 36 months.

Medical technology developer RIVANNA received the Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Program Technology/Therapeutic Development Award from the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program.

Nearly 150,000 US armed forces personnel experience back pain or spinal injuries each year, leading to around 6 million limited-duty days and costing an estimated US$2bn.

Epidural steroid injections – anti-inflammatory treatments administered into the space around the spinal cord – can help manage pain and inflammation but require real-time imaging to guide the needle precisely.

Currently, this imaging is provided through x-ray fluoroscopy, which creates moving images using continuous x-rays.

However, for forward-deployed military hospitals, this technology is often impractical due to cost, size and the need for specialist facilities. These limitations can delay treatment and require costly evacuations to access advanced imaging and trained clinicians.

RIVANNA will collaborate with The Geneva Foundation, which facilitates the Musculoskeletal Injury Rehabilitation Research for Operational Readiness (MIRROR) programme, established by the Defense Health Agency to support treatment and care for musculoskeletal injuries.

Linzie Wagner, senior manager, MIRROR programme, The Geneva Foundation, said: “Partnering with RIVANNA is a pivotal step for advancing innovative solutions in the Military Health System.

“With a combination of operational insight and cutting-edge technology, we are strengthening service members’ and their families’ future of care.

“Our collaboration with RIVANNA allows for the integration of emerging technologies into the MHS, which will enhance clinical decision support, operational readiness, and data interoperability.

“Our partnership is a vital step toward modernising healthcare delivery across military environments.”

The Accuro 3S-MIL variant will be a compact, durable ultrasound guidance system adapted for operational use.

Modifications will include integration with military electronic health records and AI-based imaging optimised for the demographics of service members.

The device will undergo testing with military clinicians and validation studies at military hospitals and medical centres.

RIVANNA also intends to seek FDA 510(k) clearance for the Accuro 3S-MIL as a commercial product.

The developers say the device could reduce the need for medical evacuations and enable faster return to duty for service members with back pain.

They also plan to expand its use for a broader range of neuraxial anaesthesia and pain management procedures in both military and civilian healthcare.",https://nrtimes.co.uk/favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-10-28 05:20:29.748776

Approximately 97% of active-duty servicewomen (ADSW) are of reproductive age (ie, 18-55 years) and face challenges related to accessing contraceptive care compared with the general population, particularly during deployment.1,2 In a 2020 survey, 22% of ADSW reported experiencing delay at least once in accessing birth control, and 6% reported being unable to obtain necessary birth control in the Military Health System (MHS).3 Another study found that one-third of surveyed ADSW lacked access to their desired contraceptive during deployment.4 Additionally, 59% did not discuss their contraceptive options with a practitioner beforehand, and 41% reported difficulty obtaining refills during their last deployment.4 Inadequate access to and supply of contraception throughout periods of military service and deployments can lead to unintended pregnancy, decreased readiness, mission degradation, and other adverse outcomes.1-5

Access to contraception has many health and operational benefits for ADSWs. The most recently reported unintended pregnancy rate among ADSW was estimated to be 72 per 1000 women, compared with 40.6 to 45 per 1000 civilian women in the same year.6-9 Unintended pregnancies can negatively impact military careers and potentially impede military unit readiness.1,3,5 Hormonal contraception can also help manage conditions such as acne, hirsutism, menstrual migraines, menstrual pain, and irregular menstruation.10,11 It also allows for menstrual suppression, which may benefit deployed service members.10,11 Therefore, promoting contraceptive care access can improve ADSW’s physical and mental well-being while facilitating military readiness and optimizing military resources.

To overcome barriers and improve access and education related to contraceptive care, numerous laws, policies, and clinical practice guidelines have been implemented by military health authorities.12 -15 The Defense Health Agency Procedural Instruction (DHA-PI) 6200.02, issued in May 2019, aims to improve access to contraceptive care by addressing barriers and providing comprehensive counseling.16 eFigure 1 in Supplement 1 details the various laws, policies, and clinical practice guidelines before and after the release of DHA-PI 6200.02 that support its aims. DHA-PI 6200.02 was designed to increase access to contraception among ADSWs by (1) ensuring the availability of all US Food and Drug Administration–approved contraceptive methods at military treatment facilities, (2) authorizing up to a 12-month supply of short-acting reversible contraceptives (SARCs) from military pharmacies, (3) enabling the use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) when appropriate, and (4) mandating practitioner education to ensure comprehensive contraceptive counseling and documentation across the MHS. These provisions were intended to reduce logistical barriers (eg, difficulty obtaining refills while deployed), expand method choice, and promote consistency in care delivery.17-19

DHA-PI 6200.02 ensures that ADSW receive an adequate supply of SARCs to support deployment readiness and allows for dispensing up to a 12-month supply through military pharmacies.5 It also includes provisions for menstrual suppression.5 This aims to reduce clinic visits and unintended pregnancies, enhance adherence, and contribute to mission readiness.20,21 The policy also mandates timely access to contraception within 24 hours for ADSW before deployment, promotes counseling on LARC, and addresses storage challenges with SARC.15,22 Additionally, it requires annual evidence-based family planning education, covering contraceptive options, emergency contraception, menstrual suppression, and chronic condition management.16

While the DHA-PI 6200.02 attempts to improve contraceptive care access, education, and counseling, its implementation and associated outcomes have not been evaluated. This study leveraged a pragmatic, retrospective design23,24 to evaluate the implementation of DHA-PI 6200.02 using implementation science constructs such as adoption and fidelity, with a focus on extended contraception supply and related prescribing and dispensing practices within the MHS.

Methods

Data Source and Setting

This retrospective observational cohort study included ADSW enrolled in TRICARE between January 1, 2016, and September 30, 2022. Data were obtained via the MHS Information Platform, which includes enrollment, medication, and encounter data for both direct and purchased care encounters. Direct care refers to services provided within military treatment facilities (MTFs), while purchased care refers to services rendered in the civilian sector and reimbursed by TRICARE. The Defense Eligibility Enrollment Registration System was utilized to identify ADSW who met inclusion criteria. The Pharmacy Data Warehouse provided fill-level data on dispensed medications to TRICARE beneficiaries, including most recent fill date and days’ supply. Inpatient and outpatient encounter data came from the Comprehensive Ambulatory Professional Encounter Record and TRICARE encounter data (institutional and noninstitutional). These sources enabled comparisons between direct care (MTFs) and purchased care (civilian health care networks). Demographic and service characteristics were extracted during the first month of inclusion. Race and ethnicity were self-reported and ascertained through the Defense Eligibility Enrollment Registration System enrollment records; data on race and ethnicity are included here because xx. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline.25 This study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the DHA Institutional Review Board, with a waiver of informed consent granted due to the use of deidentified secondary data.

Study Cohort

Eligible records included ADSW aged 18 to 55 years with sex listed as female in medical records who were enrolled in TRICARE for any length of time during the study period. Continuous enrollment was not required. Individuals were counted in the numerator and denominator if enrolled in the month a contraceptive was dispensed or a procedure performed, and in each subsequent month until disenrollment, pregnancy, or other exclusions. ADSW affiliated with the Coast Guard or with missing key data were excluded. Pregnancy periods, identified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis codes and ending at delivery (Current Procedural Terminology procedure codes), termination (ICD-10), or restart and/or initiation of a SARC, LARC placement, or permanent sterilization, were excluded to avoid misclassifying planned discontinuation as lack of access or policy noncompliance. Additionally, the following exclusion criteria were applied. The first was no receipt of contraception (SARC, LARC, or permanent contraception26) or used diaphragms, external or internal condoms, spermicides, or natural family planning (withdrawal or fertility-based awareness methods) as their only form of contraception. The second criterion was receipt of emergency contraception only, defined as (1) 1 or more ulipristal acetate or levonorgestrel prescription or (2) a single package (prescription quantity <30 pills) of a combined hormonal contraception identified as part of the Yuzpe method with a diagnosis of ICD-10 code Z30.012 (encounter for emergency contraception).

Outcome

As previously described, DHA-PI 6200.02 was designed to improve contraceptive access by addressing known barriers and supporting comprehensive counseling; this study focused specifically on the implementation of the policy’s provisions related to extended contraceptive supply. The primary outcome was the monthly rates of extended contraceptive supply defined as (1) LARC placement or SARC prescriptions with greater than or equal to 168 days’ supply or (2) permanent contraception without reversal. Secondary outcomes included (1) LARC placement or SARC prescriptions with greater than or equal to 364 days to address policy fidelity and (2) percentage of prescribers who provided extended forms of contraceptive supply to assess market penetration. SARC supply was considered to start on the first day of the dispensing month. Supply duration was rounded to indicate months of contraception supply (eg, 84 pills dispensed January 15 equaled 3 months: January [index month] to March). LARC supply was based on type and formulation.

Because claims data reflect utilization and not intent or preference, our measures represent proxies for access and continuity, not direct measures of contraceptive need or decision making. Four subgroups were created on the basis of contraception receipt: SARC, LARC, permanent contraception, and no contraception. The identification and quantification of the included contraceptives are summarized in eMethods 1 in Supplement 1. ADSW could be in more than 1 subgroup during the study period based on the contraception received with the exception of the no contraception group. The no contraception group included ADSW who were not using any contraception (SARC, LARC placement, or permanent contraception) at any point during the study period.

Covariates and Measures of Performance

Product-specific and procedure-specific lookback periods of up to 10 years were used to identify contraceptive use that extended into the study period. This study was designed to evaluate the implementation of DHA-PI 6200.02 using constructs from implementation science. Specifically, we assessed (1) adoption, or the initial uptake of extended contraceptive supply practices among eligible prescribers and patients; (2) fidelity, or the extent to which contraception was provided in accordance with the policy’s intended duration (eg, 12-month SARC supply), (3);market penetration, or the degree to which extended contraceptive supply became embedded across the MHS prescriber base; and (4) sustainability, or the maintenance of these practices over time.

To operationalize these constructs, we defined 5 measures of performance (MOPs). The first, MOP 1 (adoption), was defined as the monthly percentage of eligible ADSW with extended SARC supply (≥168 days) among those with an active SARC prescription. The second, MOP 2 (fidelity), was defined as the monthly percentage of SARC prescriptions dispensed for greater than or equal to 168 days’ supply. The third, MOP 3 (adoption), was defined as the monthly percentage of eligible ADSW with any extended contraceptive supply (SARC, LARC placement, or permanent contraception). The fourth, MOP 4 (market penetration), was defined as the monthly percentage of practitioners who provided any form of extended contraceptive supply (≥168 days SARC, LARC placement, or permanent contraception procedure). The fifth, MOP 5 (adoption), was defined as the monthly percentage of ADSW receiving any contraceptive method who received extended contraceptive supply. All MOP numerator and denominator definitions are detailed in eMethods 2 in Supplement 1.

Statistical Analysis

Cohort demographics and service characteristics were reported according to first-month group eligibility. Interrupted time-series (ITS) analysis using segmented regression, conducted in R statistical software version 4.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing), was used to assess changes in MOPs associated with the policy. ITS is a robust quasi-experimental approach that can assess the longitudinal changes of the DHA-PI 6200.02 while distinguishing associations attributable to DHA-PI 6200.02 from underlying trends. For this study, the ITS analysis included data points from January 1, 2016, to January 31, 2019, as the preintervention period; and from September 1, 2019, to September 30, 2022, as the postintervention period. The implementation month (May 2019) and a 3-month washout period before and after implementation (February 1 to May 13, 2019, and May 14 to August 31, 2019) were excluded to account for potential delays in observed changes following the policy rollout.

Segmented regression models were unadjusted and used to estimate level and trend changes in monthly MOPs. Subgroup analyses compared changes between direct and purchased care settings. Two-sided P < .05 was considered significant.

Results

A total of 429 194 ADSW (mean [SD] age, 24.5 [6.97] years) met inclusion criteria, regardless of contraceptive use (Figure 1). Of these, 148 104 (34.5%) served in the Army, 101 299 (32.6%) in the Navy, 115 288 (26.86%) in the Air Force, and 35 352 (8.24%) in the Marine Corps. Characteristics of ADSW at the time of initiating each form of contraception are presented in Table 1. Because individuals could initiate more than one method, counts are not mutually exclusive. Across the study period, 190 291 ADSW received SARC, 127 388 underwent LARC placement, and 14 168 received permanent contraception. Among those with SARC or LARC use, the majority were aged 18 to 24 years (112 036 [58.9%] for SARC; 73 804 [57.9%] for LARC), whereas permanent contraception was most common among ADSW aged 25 to 34 years (6760 [47.7%]). In the no-contraception group (n = 132 402), most were also aged 18 to 24 years (85 664 [64.7%]). During the study period, there were 1 663 613 direct care prescriptions and 305 233 purchased care prescriptions, provided by 30 734 direct care practitioners and 51 826 purchased care practitioners.

MOP 1: Monthly Percentage of Eligible ADSW With Extended SARC Days Supply

In January 2016, 16.3% (95% CI, 16.0% to 16.7%) of eligible ADSW had an active extended SARC prescription, increasing to 19.7% (95% CI, 17.9% to 21.6%) by the end of follow-up (Figure 2A). Although a positive trend was observed prior to DHA-PI 6200.02, a decrease of 0.77 percentage points (95% CI, –1.34 to –0.20 percentage points; P = .01) occurred immediately after the policy implementation, followed by a significant increase after intervention of 0.07 percentage points per month (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.09 percentage points per month; P < .001). In subgroup analyses, direct care settings showed a positive trend (coefficient, 0.09), while purchased care showed a negative trend (coefficient, –0.19) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).

MOP 2: Monthly Percentage of SARC Prescriptions Dispensed for an Extended Days Supply

Extended SARC prescriptions dispensed increased from 8.2% (95% CI, 7.9% to 8.5%) to 9.3% (95% CI, 7.4% to 11.1%) during the postintervention study period (Figure 2B). The level change after the intervention was –0.34 percentage points (95% CI, –0.83 to 0.15 percentage points; P = .18), and a significant postintervention increase of 0.03 percentage points per month was observed (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.05 percentage points per month; P = .001). Subgroup analyses showed an increased trend in direct care (coefficient, 0.05), compared with a decreased trend in purchased care (coefficient, –0.12) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1).

MOP 3: Monthly Percentage of Eligible ADSW With Any Extended Supply Contraception

At baseline, 21.8% (95% CI, 21.7%-22.0%) of ADSW had extended supply, increasing to 22.1% (95% CI, 21.1% to 23.1%) postintervention (Figure 2C). A preintervention upward trend was observed (coefficient, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.08; P < .001), followed by a change of –0.25 percentage points (95% CI, –0.51 to 0.01 percentage points; P = .06) that was not statistically significant and a significant postintervention decrease (coefficient, –0.14; 95% CI, –0.16 to –0.12; P < .001). This decline occurred in both direct care (–0.14) and purchased care (–0.02) (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). Analysis by method showed LARC placement followed a parabolic decline, while SARC and permanent contraception remained steady (eFigures 3-5 in Supplement 1).

MOP 4: Monthly Percentage of Prescribers Providing Eligible ADSW With Extended Contraceptive Supply

At baseline 36.3% (95% CI, 35.1%-37.5%) of prescribers provided any extended contraceptive supply, increasing to 41.9% (95% CI, 35.8 to 47.9) by the end of the study period (Figure 2D). A small but significant decrease of –2.03 percentage points was observed immediately following the policy (95% CI, –3.95 to –0.11 percentage points; P = .04), with no significant postintervention slope change (coefficient, 0.03; 95% CI, –0.05 to 0.11; P = .41). Subgroup trends in direct (coefficient, 0.02) and purchased (coefficient, 0.05) care settings remained stable.

MOP 5: Monthly Percentage of ADSW With Contraceptive Supply With Extended Supply Contraception

Among ADSW using contraception, extended supply increased from a baseline of 57.3% (95% CI, 57.0% to 57.6%) to 67.7% (95% CI, 66.1% to 69.2%) in the postintervention study period (Figure 2E). The level change at policy implementation was –0.48 percentage points (95% CI, –1.02 to 0.06 percentage points; P = .08), and no significant postintervention trend change was detected (coefficient, 0.008; 95% CI, –0.01 to 0.03; P = .48). No statistically significant trend was observed among direct (coefficient, −0.004) and purchased (coefficient, 0.005) care groups.

All outcome estimates are based on unadjusted segmented regression models using monthly aggregated rates. Full ITS model coefficients and SEs are reported in Table 2.

Discussion

In this cohort study, the percentage of eligible ADSW receiving an extended supply of SARC (MOP 1) and the percentage of extended supply SARC prescriptions dispensed (MOP 2) significantly increased following the implementation of DHA-PI 6200.02. Although sustained trends were observed for SARCs, only positive but not statistically significant trends were seen for extended supply of SARC, LARC placement, or permanent contraception among contraception users (MOP 5) and practitioner uptake of extended supply contraceptive (MOP 4). However, MOP 3, which captured all eligible ADSW with extended supply, showed a significant decrease after DHA-PI 6200.02, indicating a lack of sustainability. Given the positive postintervention slopes in MOP 1 and MOP 5, the negative trend in MOP 3 could be due to declining number of ADSW seeking contraception.

Study findings suggest limited adoption, with all 5 MOPs seeing a decrease in treatment-level change at intervention, ranging from −0.25 to −2.03 percentage points (Table 2). Low fidelity was observed, as most ADSW who received an extended supply of a SARC received a 6-month supply rather than a 12-month supply. The postintervention slope for the number of practitioners offering extended supply (MOP 4) neither reached the counterfactual rate nor achieved statistical significance, suggesting limited market penetration and integration into practice across practitioners. Despite statistically significant changes, the absolute gains in SARC-related MOPs were modest (2%-5%) and below implementation science benchmark of 9%.27,28

Moreover, the observed increases appear to have occurred primarily in direct care settings. In contrast, purchased care, where TRICARE reimbursement and physician practices are more variable, showed smaller or negative changes. These differences may reflect systemic constraints, such as TRICARE’s historical cap on SARC supplies exceeding 3 months in purchased care, contextual factors like practitioner availability, deployment or leave status, and geographic access to MTFs. Although direct and purchased care represent the same beneficiary population, individuals may move between settings based on duty station or life circumstances, introducing additional complexity.

These findings show that while DHA-PI 6200.02 may be associated with increases in the dispensing of SARC extended day supplies, such changes warrant careful interpretation. SARCs offer flexibility and may align with user preferences for perceived control or fewer adverse effects. However, they require consistent access for refills, which can be interrupted by deployments or relocations. Some ADSW may prefer LARCs or permanent methods but opt for SARCs due to limited practitioner access, medical benefit reimbursement challenges, or delayed appointments. These utilization patterns highlight the importance of aligning contraceptive counseling with both medical eligibility and service member preference, within operational constraints.

These results align with the 2018 Health Related Behaviors Survey29 and the 2020 Women’s Health Reproductive Survey,30 which identified persistent barriers to widespread use of highly effective contraceptive methods among female service members. The Health Related Behaviors Survey reported lower-than-expected use of highly effective contraceptive methods and an overall usage rate below the Healthy People 2020 target.31 Similarly, the Women’s Health Reproductive Survey reported that only 28% of ADSW used highly effective methods such as LARC placement or permanent contraception.30

Several factors may explain the lack of significant change observed. Systemic logistical barriers within the MHS—such as inventory management processes and contraceptive availability—may hinder timely access. Variability in practitioner adherence to new policies and a potential lack of necessary training or resources may have contributed to inconsistent policy implementation. Additionally, the frequent relocations and deployments of ADSW and their clinicians complicate sustained access to contraceptive care, disrupting the continuity of care.32 The temporal overlap of DHA-PI 6200.02 implementation and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a sharp decline in contraceptive care appointments with visit volumes remaining below prepandemic levels throughout 2020,33 further complicates interpretation. This trend supports the notable decline in LARC placement and the slight decrease in permanent contraception (eFigures 3 and 5 in Supplement 1), both of which require in-person appointments, unlike SARC, which can be obtained virtually. Our data reflect this decrease; in particular, MOP 4 exhibited a sharp decrease in the number of practitioners prescribing extended supplies in 2020. While the numbers later improved, the trend in 2020 declined—contrasting with the upward trend seen before the pandemic, and making it difficult to isolate policy-related changes from pandemic-driven trends. Moreover, a cross-sectional study utilizing claims data found that the volume of intrauterine device services and prescriptions for the pill, patch, and ring remained below 2019 levels through end of 2022.34 These disruptions may have hindered the implementation of DHA-PI 6200.02.

A broader issue is the recurring gap between policy and practice seen in other military policies.35,36 Effective adoption requires communication, training, and support for both practitioners and ADSW. Misconceptions and information gaps, especially around LARC methods, may shape practitioner behavior and service member choices.37,38 Passing a policy is only the first step; without leadership accountability in its implementation, meaningful change is often limited.39 While clinical guidelines often shape care delivery, the extent to which Department of Defense or DHA policies exert similar influence remains uncertain. To strengthen uptake of DHA-PI 6200.02, the organization could apply implementation science tools such as the AACTT (action, actor, context, target, time) framework and Behavior Change Wheel to define actionable behaviors, identify key actors, and ensure sustainable implementation.40,41

Strengths and Limitations

A key strength of this study is its large sample size and use of a rigorous ITS analysis, allowing for the detection of both immediate and gradual changes in MOPs. The multifaceted assessment of MOPs provides a detailed understanding of the policy’s impact.

However, several limitations should be noted. Before the implementation of DHA-PI 6200.02 in 2017, other policies related to contraception access, including the 2013 and 2016 Selected Practice Recommendations and DHA-Interim Procedures Memorandum, were introduced, and could have contributed to the observed changes in contraceptive prescribing and dispensing.15 ,22 Also, the study cannot determine whether the downward trend observed in MOP 3 (eFigures 3-5 in Supplement 1) was due to DHA-PI 6200.02, system-related barriers, or ADSW preferences.

The policy’s implementation overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced substantial disruptions to in-person health care delivery. These disruptions may have contributed to the decline in LARC and permanent contraception uptake observed in the study, confounding our ability to disentangle the effects of the policy from pandemic-related service limitations. The observed decline in practitioner-level MOPs (MOP 5) in 2020 likely reflects COVID-19–related staffing challenges and appointment cancellations, which affected both physicians availability and patient access.

The cohort was limited to eligible ADSW receiving contraception through TRICARE, potentially underestimating the overall use of contraception among those not reimbursed or covered by TRICARE. We might be overestimating the cohort by including ADSW up to age 55 years; however, we wanted to also focus on contraceptive use for nonreproductive reasons such as use for menstrual suppression or perimenopausal symptoms. Additionally, TRICARE’s restriction on dispensing more than a 3-month supply in non-MTF pharmacies may have affected access and outcomes in purchased care, contributing to the observed differences between direct and purchased care settings. Although both settings serve the same beneficiary population, service members may shift between them due to duty station changes, deployment or leave status, or regional access to civilian practitionerss. These factors, along with variability in physician practices and formulary access, likely influence contraceptive supply patterns and implementation success.

Cadets were excluded because of the different context of their service compared with other branches, which might affect generalizability. Other uniformed service members, like United States Public Health Service and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration members, were not specifically focused on in this study but they may have been captured in the other service category. Moreover, increased operational tempo, including deployments, frequent relocations, and predeployment health assessments, may have shaped patterns in prescribing behavior, yet we were unable to capture or quantify these dynamics directly.

This study also relied on administrative claims data, which are subject to coding limitations, potential misclassification, and a lack of clinical nuance. Our method for calculating days’ supply of oral contraceptives may not fully reflect real-world usage patterns, particularly in cases of menstrual suppression or intermittent use. Moreover, claims data do not capture reasons behind contraceptive selection, which is influenced by individual preferences, practitioner counseling, perceptions of adverse effects, and cultural or structural stigma—factors that could not be directly assessed here.

Finally, although the large dataset enhances generalizability and statistical power, residual confounding and potential type I error remain possible. Although ITS is a robust quasiexperimental method, unmeasured time-varying confounders may still bias estimates. These considerations underscore the need for cautious interpretation of observed associations and reinforce the importance of triangulating findings with qualitative or prospective studies. Future studies should investigate barriers to contraception policy adherence, focus on specific types of contraceptive users, particularly those seeking care outside of TRICARE, and assess how educational interventions for both practitioners and service members affect policy outcomes.

Conclusions

While this cohort study found DHA-PI 6200.02 was associated with statistically significant changes in extended SARC supply, broader policy uptake and sustainability across all contraceptive types remained limited. Key implementation outcomes, such as adoption, fidelity, and market penetration, remained low, although improvements related to SARC supply appeared to be sustained over time. These findings highlight the complexity of policy implementation within the MHS and suggest a need for greater practitioner support, policy assessment, and use of implementation science frameworks to drive meaningful change. Ongoing efforts will be essential to ensure that ADSW receive consistent, high-quality contraceptive care that supports both their health and operational readiness.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/939703/zoi251091f1_1760734561.86346.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=nZ2~PGUVI3t0PbyPwJRGshS~xa7LyRmcLvlb4mMEhMvJ9nU9Asi7FCtCQactRQtJDLNgFcV0VKnnqCKynIQeUB0idWqnot~pzYJckHODcApdv9Q1G6T1IO2c8gj5yrK7RwV-jJLiBeHFOUoerAP7Bs5TFAtyanc9SJOuy45UUgB5IhE1XdhMsod0~I3eB9529aReoLmm8WBC9nU4UWB9EAOQV4ydAG4X-jTnlrav9eQqBuHMz3a6LCJbQvvp9Tm1LpYJFCA-GEMNstTLQ5vlgDSa2IAejHTe3SmYp6Zv6lzKLE-x1XN~T7mb78VEzGNHTAb1BiVrR2x5yZJ-ssxRNQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,0.0,2025-10-27 16:19:51.437459

Stephen is a Missouri UOCAVA voter, resident of the United Kingdom, and member of the Democrats Abroad Global Veterans and Military Families Caucus.

As a Marine veteran and military spouse living overseas, I’ve seen how Washington’s dysfunction doesn’t just stay in Washington. With Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, and the White House, the blame for the government shutdown now disrupting the lives of military families around the world lies squarely on their shoulders.

For many military and retiree families stationed or residing abroad, access to health care is through TRICARE Overseas — a Department of Defense-operated system where some families often must pay out of pocket for care and then wait for the U.S. government to reimburse them. During the current shutdown, that reimbursement process has come to a halt for many. Families are being left to shoulder the full cost of doctor visits, prescriptions, and urgent care, with no clear timeline for when the government will reopen and TRICARE’s contractor will again be authorized to resume reimbursement.

Our government promises our military recruits world-class health care coverage upon entering the service, but under this Administration and the current 119th Congress, they’ve been getting, well, outright scammed. To be clear, TRICARE beneficiaries are Americans who have already served and sacrificed, and are now forced to absorb the financial burden of Washington’s failure.

Instead of governing responsibly, Republicans have once again chosen to inflict serious harm on the country rather than demonstrate basic competence. The bottom line is that military families are fiercely patriotic and understand the need to put country over party when it comes to the well-being of our nation and our service members, and they deserve better. They shouldn’t have to question whether their health care coverage depends on the next manufactured crisis. Members of Congress continue to receive paychecks despite the House of Representatives having no plan for returning to session. While military families check for change under the couch cushions to help pay skyrocketing medical bills, it is outrageous that Republican lawmakers continue to kick the legislative can down the road on reopening the government. It’s time for all elected leaders to put the country over chaos and stop using those who serve or have served as collateral in their political battles.

U.S. citizens living abroad, both civilian and military, are highly encouraged to check your voter registration status and request your ballot for any upcoming elections in your home voting state that you are eligible to vote in.
