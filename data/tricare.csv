(a) Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System. This was part of a 2017 act.

TFL is regulated under the old CHAMPUS rules and specifically prohibits weight control ANYTHING. I am pasting the paragraphs but again, look long enough in the link provided and you will see them. Bottom line is that we are likely to see change if and only if our pretty much worthless congress takes action to amend the regulations.

Regardless of the code justifying it, the DHA has now implemented a separate tier of treatment for us Tricare For Life beneficiaries. Note that there is nothing in the newsletter about how to help get this changed—only, sorry, but those are the rules!

Here is my cut and paste from the applicable CFR:

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the official legal print publication containing the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) is a continuously updated online version of the CFR. It is not an official legal edition of the CFR. Learn more about the eCFR, its status, and the editorial process.

CHAMPUS rules:

§ 199.4 Basic program benefits. (a) General. The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. The Basic Program is similar to private insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources.

(15) Morbid obesity. The TRICARE morbid obesity benefit is limited to those bariatric surgical procedures for which the safety and efficacy has been proven comparable or superior to conventional therapies and is consistent with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States medical community. (See the definition of reliable evidence in § 199.2 of this part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.) (i) Conditions for coverage. (A) Payment for bariatric surgical procedures is determined by the requirements specified in paragraph (g)(15) of this section, and as defined in § 199.2(b) of this part. (B) Covered bariatric surgical procedures are payable only when the patient has completed growth (18 years of age or documentation of completion of bone growth) and has met one of the following selection criteria: (1) The patient has a BMI that is equal to or exceeds 40 kg/m2 and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. (2) The patient has a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m2, has at least one high-risk co-morbid condition associated with morbid obesity, and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. Note: The Director, TMA, shall issue guidelines for review of the specific high-risk co-morbid conditions, exacerbated or caused by obesity based on the Reliable Evidence Standard as defined in § 199.2 of this part. (ii) Treatment of complications. (A) Payment may be extended for repeat bariatric surgery when medically necessary to correct or treat complications from the initial covered bariatric surgery (a takedown). For instance, the surgeon in many cases will do a gastric bypass or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery. (B) Payment is authorized for otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to complications of obesity when such services and supplies are an integral and necessary part of the course of treatment that was aggravated by the obesity.

(iii) Exclusions. CHAMPUS payment may not be extended for weight control services, weight control/loss programs, dietary regimens and supplements, appetite suppressants and other medications; food or food supplements, exercise and exercise programs, or other programs and equipment that are primarily intended to control weight or for the purpose of weight reduction, regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

§ 199.17 TRICARE program. (a) Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System. (1) Purpose. The TRICARE program implements a number of improvements primarily through modernized managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers to deliver an integrated, health care delivery system that provides beneficiaries with access to high quality healthcare. Implementation of these improvements, to include enhanced access, improved health outcomes, increased efficiencies and elimination of waste, in addition to improving and maintaining operational medical force readiness, includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures.

(3) Treatment of obesity. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1097 and sections 706 and 729 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, notwithstanding 10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(10), treatment of obesity is covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select even if it is the sole or major condition treated. Such services must be provided by a TRICARE network provider and be medically necessary and appropriate in the context of the particular patient's treatment.

Q&A: TRICARE For Life Coverage of Weight Loss Medications By TRICARE Communications

FALLS CHURCH, Va. – The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as: Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t? Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it? Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket? “Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.” TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select? A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences. Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions? A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk. TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden? A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change). If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31? A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for: Those with TFL Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus) Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31? A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket. Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered? A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include: Ozempic Trulicity Mounjaro Victoza Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan. Bottom line We know this may be difficult. We encourage you to work closely with your provider. They can help you find safe and effective approaches that support your long-term health and well-being.",,N,,2025-09-10 03:56:35.189816

Early last month, TRICARE announced that it will no longer cover obesity medications for retirees and for others who retain coverage care is restricted to in-network providers only.

For so many living with obesity, these medications are not optional. They are lifelines. They help manage a serious, chronic disease — just like insulin for diabetes or blood pressure medications for hypertension. Without them, many will face worsening health conditions like sleep apnea or heart disease, and the heartbreak of losing the progress they worked so hard to achieve.

This decision is more than unfair — it’s dangerous. It tells service members and their families, who sacrifice every single day, that their health doesn’t matter. It risks national security by making it harder for active-duty members to stay healthy and ready to serve.

Why This Change is Concerning

An estimated 27,000 people lost coverage for their obesity medications.

Those beneficiaries that have coverage must now receive care through in-network providers.

There are few TRICARE providers who are trained in obesity medicine.

Impacted beneficiaries were given less than 30 days to notice of the change, which is not adequate time to switch to a new provider.

People who finally found something that works are being forced to stop suddenly.

Service members’ health and readiness are being put at risk.

Obesity is being singled out, treated as “less than” other chronic diseases.

What You Can Do

We can’t stay silent. Congress needs to hear from the people this decision impacts most — you, your family, your story. Together, our voices can push TRICARE to reverse this harmful policy.

Take action today. Use our Advocacy Action Tool to send a message to your Members of Congress.

1) our clinic director states there is an issue with reimbursing folks who take Tricare insurance because of the Tricare redistricting.
2) our operations director sends out a “new” attestation form about our Tricare credentialing eligibility.","Hi all, long post ahead. TLDR: my old job made a gross mistake regarding Tricare credentialing and it’s costing me thousands, what do I do?

I am a mental healthcare provider licensed in MD. I have been credentialed with Tricare since I became a counselor 5 years ago. At my first job, no issues with credentialing or reimbursement, I had a handful of Tricare clients. I was salaried as well, so might have missed some things on the back end, but it never affected my pay and I never heard anything about needing to attest to my credentialing.

I got Job #2 in 2023, where I was also credentialed with insurances including Tricare. Job 2 took full responsibility of credentialing me, I never thought twice about it, and was informed that all fully-licensed providers were eligible for the same credentialing (slightly different process for provisionally licensed folks, per MD laws). My pay structure at this job was technically w-2, so I did receive PTO and subsidized healthcare, but I was paid a base hourly rate and received commission from my client revenue (insurance reimbursements and copays). The pay was quite a lot better than my first salaried job, so the inconsistency of commissions didn’t bother me.

I never actually saw my first Tricare client at Job 2 until end of January 2025. For whatever reason, I had a full caseload of non-Tricare clients until then. I proceeded to get 3-4 more over the course of the next few months (the last was referred to me in mid-June 2025). Over the course of January 2025-July 2025, I watched these clients’ insurance balances slowly climb- $800, $1,200, $2k, all the way until a couple of these folks were showing $4k+ balances that insurance hadn’t paid out. Because of my pay structure, I was missing A LOT of commission from these clients.

I had begun verbally prodding our clinic director and staff leader about this in our staff meetings back in about March or April, when the balances were hovering closer to $600-$1000 each, knowing that other clinicians at Job 2 were also taking Tricare clients (I learned not as many as me, most folks only had 1 or 2 and I had about 5). At the time the answer we got was, “reimbursement takes a while, we’ll take this to the owner and see what she can find out.”

Fast forward to July 2025, when all the shit hits the fan. 1) our clinic director states there is an issue with reimbursing folks who take Tricare insurance because of the Tricare redistricting. She recommends everyone cancel all Tricare appointments until further notice, and communicate to our clients that they should probably find a new provider. RED FREAKING FLAG. 2) our operations director sends out a “new” attestation form about our Tricare credentialing eligibility. One of the requirements for eligibility stipulated on this form is passing the National Counseling Exam (NCE) prior to 2017. I in fact passed this exam AFTER 2017. I fill out what I can and email our operations director back, asking what this means for my eligibility AND ALL the sessions I had completed up to this point. She says “we’re working to figure that out.”

In August, every staff meeting now has someone asking about Tricare eligibility and reimbursement. Every weekly catchup email has a bullet point about the Tricare debacle and how “we’re still working to figure this out.” It’s now been 7 months of “working to figure this out,” and I am sitting with literal thousands of dollars missing from my pay stubs. Between the lack of answers and then having to cancel 5 regular clients, not knowing if I would get them back, I was losing income fast. NOW the commission-based pay bothered me.

The last detail is, also in August, the clinic director informed us that when the redistricting of Tricare happened in January 2025, it changed their credentialing requirements. I immediately responded to this email asking what the company planned to do about reimbursing providers, seeing as it is their corporate team’s responsibility for accurately credentialing their providers, and the fact that I/we was/were not accurately credentialed is a grave oversight on their part. And the response I got was “that is precisely what we are trying to figure out.”

I applied for and accepted Job #3. I cannot work for a company that continues to be unaccountable for this gross error, whether the fault lies with my clinic director, operations director, owner, or corporate heads. However, not working for Job 2 anymore has made it vastly more difficult to keep them accountable, maintain updated communication, or make sure I’m getting paid correctly. My biggest concern is that I have completed work that I have not been paid for, based on a mistake that wasn’t mine, and I have heard zero promises that I will get paid the commission of thousands of dollars that are owed.

I am angry, but all I’m presenting is the facts. Do I file a complaint with DOL? Do I continue to harass Job 2 via email (I did email all professional correspondence to my personal email so I wouldn’t lose the information or the documentation of advocacy when I left)?

Contact Information: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.","NEW YORK, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

Lastly, seven marketers and their entities agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks disguised as MSO payments to doctors to induce laboratory testing.
These include several True Health, other lab, and marketing firm employees.
“We will continue to pursue those who steal from federal healthcare programs through these types of schemes to pay improper kickbacks to providers.”","After being indicted in 2022, True Health Diagnostics CEO Christopher Grottenthaler and others have agreed to settle the federal allegations that the company made kickback arrangements with marketers and physicians and made fraudulent claims for laboratory testing against federal payers Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE.

In a case that began in California with a whistleblower complaint, prosecutors alleged that Grottenthaler agreed to a kickback scheme in which marketers and True Health employees offered and paid doctors kickbacks disguised as management service organization distributions to boost referrals to the True Health lab. At other times, prosecutors allege that Grottenthaler arranged for True Health to pay kickbacks disguised as consulting fees, processing and handling fees, and waivers of copayments and deductibles to bring in more referrals, many of which were unnecessary lab panels. The settlement resolves these allegations after Grottenthaler pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit illegal remuneration.

The original 125-page complaint, dated 2016, describes how True Health would promise doctors that it would not charge patients copayments or deductibles, helping physicians retain patients while the lab collected insurance payments without charging the patient directly. It also alleges the defendants created a “Speakers Bureau” and advisory panels where they paid physicians in exchange for the physicians referring lab work to them and sent out some lab work to other labs while billing insurance as if they had done the job.

Evidence in the case showed that Grottenthaler continued the alleged scheme even after receiving warnings from colleagues that the marketers the lab worked with “are a powder keg waiting to explode on us” and that “people are gonna go to prison.”

An email exhibit from a physician who worked with an entity acquired by True Health, which was included in the complaint, describes how the lab would not charge patients for lab results, which is illegal. “It is absolutely back to business as usual!!” it reads. “As much as I thought this would happen, a part of me really couldn’t believe they would have the gall to just resume the same behaviors!!”

The complaint also details how Grottenthaler has been connected to healthcare fraud before. As the VP of Finance at Ameritox, the Department of Health and Human Services accused the company of paying kickbacks to encourage physicians to refer drug testing services to the lab, and in 2010, Ameritox paid $16.3 million to settle the case.

Another recently announced settlement resolved allegations against Dr. Hong Davis of Denton, who agreed to pay $124,627 to resolve allegations that she received thousands in payments between 2015 and 2017 from purported MSOs in return for ordering laboratory tests from labs in Rockdale, Texas, and Framingham, Massachusetts. Dr. Elizabeth Seymour agreed to pay $234,215 to resolve allegations that she also received payments from purported MSOs to order lab tests from True Health and other labs.

Lastly, seven marketers and their entities agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks disguised as MSO payments to doctors to induce laboratory testing. These include several True Health, other lab, and marketing firm employees.

“These settlements reflect the firm commitment of the Eastern District of Texas to punish those who use fraudulent means to profit at the expense of federal healthcare programs funded by the hard-working taxpayers of the United States,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jay R. Combs for the Eastern District of Texas. “We will continue to pursue those who steal from federal healthcare programs through these types of schemes to pay improper kickbacks to providers.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iStock-1300036735.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:22.409439

“We play a combat support role at AFHSD, and we are responsible for protecting the Joint Force,” said Navy Capt. Richard Langton, chief of AFHSD. “We carry out our assigned duties through retrospective, near real-time, and prospective health surveillance — in a nutshell, full-spectrum health surveillance.”

AFHSD is a public health component of the DHA and the U.S. military’s central public health entity. The division focuses on global health surveillance, providing operational forces with early warning, health threat assessments, and force-readiness data.

The division is organized into three branches: Epidemiology and Analysis, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance, and Integrated Biosurveillance.

AFHSD is the central repository of medical surveillance data for the armed forces. This is done through technical infrastructure, expertise in database management for the Defense Medical Surveillance System and related applications, and operations, and management of the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

The DMSS houses current and historical data on diseases and medical events. These include hospitalizations, ambulatory visits, reportable medical events, laboratory tests, immunizations, periodic and deployment-related health assessments, and casualty data affecting service members throughout their military careers. It contains billions of data records on service members and other Military Health System beneficiaries.

Leveraging data to manage seasonal respiratory illnesses

The AFHSD uses this wealth of data to analyze and anticipate potential threats.

“AFHSD plays a key role in integrating biosurveillance efforts by collecting data and information in near real-time of the threats from endemic diseases and emerging infectious diseases relevant to the military worldwide,” said Juan I. Ubiera, chief of the IB branch. “IB also conducts forecasting analytics to predict and communicate seasonal respiratory illnesses threats.”

This surveillance information enables weekly trend analysis and situation reports on seasonal respiratory illnesses. It also includes a report on respiratory illness activity on and around selected installations, to assist senior leaders in making decisions regarding resource and personnel distribution.

IB also supports early warnings and monitoring of various syndromes, including respiratory illnesses at military hospitals and clinics, communicated through the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community Based Epidemics, or ESSENCE. This program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, allows public health professionals to analyze events of public health interest, monitor health care data for events that could affect public health, and share data and analyses.

Raising awareness with the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report

The AFHSD disseminates important biosurveillance information through a peer-reviewed journal, the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report.

“The MSMR publishes summaries of notifiable diseases, trends of illnesses of special interest, and field reports describing outbreaks and case occurrences,” said Shauna Stahlman, senior epidemiologist in the E&A branch.

“Launched in 1995, the journal provides evidence-based estimates of the incidence, distribution, impact, and trends of illness and injuries among U.S. military service members and associated populations,” she said.

According to Stahlman, the MSMR publishes “pertinent articles on military public health, epidemiology, surveillance, and disease and injury prevention, continuously evaluating manuscript submissions for scientific accuracy.”

“The journal reports present data, public health information, and original research with direct relevance to the operational fitness of military members or MHS beneficiaries’ health, safety, and well-being,” she added.

Future of biosurveillance

Each branch has specific goals in their continuing efforts to meet the needs of service members and other MHS beneficiaries.

“The E&A branch’s goal is to be flexible, responsive, and predictive to our customers by releasing accurate, timely, and actionable surveillance data, and leveraging partnerships and networks within and outside of DHA public health to better predict and respond to their needs,” said Stahlman.

“In addition, we also aim to reduce the spread of medical misinformation and disinformation, which were identified as potential vulnerabilities for biodefense in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review,” she noted.

The GEIS branch is expanding capabilities for pathogen-agnostic genomic sequencing, a method for detecting unknown pathogens to determine the cause of an illness, and wastewater surveillance, said June Early, deputy chief of the GEIS branch. “The future development, implementation, and expansion of these capabilities will enable a more comprehensive understanding of infectious disease threats.”

“Also, our respiratory infections focus area oversees the coordination of the DOD global influenza vaccine effectiveness analysis,” said Early. “These analyses directly inform selection and composition of the following season’s northern hemisphere influenza vaccine.”

The IB branch is enhancing biosurveillance early warning content and information dissemination on the Health Surveillance Explorer, the DHA’s mapping application that provides near real-time integrated global health surveillance information for force health protection.

“We are increasing syndromic surveillance capabilities through collaborative partnerships with additional states,” said Ubiera. “IB is working with combatant commands and services to provide tailored biosurveillance information. We are also working to expand global biosurveillance capabilities by working with partner nations and allies to exchange information. This is one of the reform initiatives established in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review.”

Capturing the high ground in health surveillance

Military public health surveillance is vital in detecting and mitigating emerging health threats, Langton said.

“We’re very proud of the capabilities we already bring to the fight. But future success requires us to move beyond the current state,” he said. “The task before us is to capture the high ground in health surveillance. We are meeting that head-on by adopting new capabilities and tapping into the unique capabilities of our partners to create synergies that endure and allow us to dominate the health surveillance space.”",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fighting-disease.png,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:29.933357

“Everywhere I go in Hampton Roads, I hear from military families about the challenges they face with healthcare, frequent moves, and the cost of living,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “My focus in this year’s NDAA is to tackle those challenges head-on and make sure our servicemembers and their loved ones get the support they deserve.”

Building on that commitment, Kiggans put forward a package of reforms that directly respond to the concerns she hears most often from military families, from healthcare access to stable housing and community support.

Two of Kiggans’ top priorities this year focus on fixing TRICARE to better serve military families. One proposal would align TRICARE with private-sector health plans by extending dependent coverage until age 26 and eliminating the costly separate premium under the TRICARE Young Adult program. Another would strengthen the TRICARE Pharmacy Benefits Program by ensuring fair reimbursement for local pharmacies, banning hidden fees, mandating independent audits, and protecting patient choice. Together, these reforms would make healthcare more affordable, transparent, and reliable for servicemembers, retirees, and their families.

Kiggans has also advanced amendments to ease the everyday burdens of military life. She is pressing the Department of Defense to evaluate how reducing permanent change of station (PCS) moves and Navy sea/shore rotations could improve family stability, while also reviewing whether PCS reimbursements truly cover out-of-pocket costs. To improve housing and healthcare, she has supported new standards to address mold in military housing, pushed for a digital system that lets TRICARE beneficiaries track access-to-care issues, and required DoD to give families timely notice of coverage changes. In addition, she has secured language to dedicate a portion of Defense Community Infrastructure Pilot (DCIP) funding to projects that directly benefit military families, such as schools, childcare, and community facilities.

“As a Navy veteran, spouse to a veteran, and military Mom, I know firsthand how much our servicemembers and their families sacrifice for our country. Our servicemembers should be focused on the mission, not worrying about whether their families can afford healthcare or live in safe housing. These amendments are about giving them the peace of mind they deserve,” Kiggans added. “Even if Washington politics prevents some of these proposals from moving forward, I want military families to know I will never stop fighting to make their lives easier and ensure they receive the care and respect they deserve.”

“Millions of Americans rely on premium tax credits to keep their health coverage,” said Congressman Kean.“Since 2021, these credits have helped rideshare drivers, working families, and many others afford private insurance on the individual market. If they expire at the end of the year, families in New Jersey and across the country will face higher costs and risk losing critical coverage. This bipartisan effort will extend the credits for another year as Congress continues working together on long-term solutions to lower health care premiums.”

Representing a district that includes Naval Air Station Oceana, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story, and the largest concentration of military families in the nation, Congresswoman Kiggans has made it her mission on the House Armed Services Committee to strengthen the Navy, support shipyard workers, and champion policies that improve military quality of life.

Under the new directive, military clinics and hospitals are prohibited from providing continuing care to transgender adolescent and adult children.
A press release from the families’ attorney explained that the plaintiffs are proceeding under pseudonyms to protect their safety and privacy.
“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” said Sarah Austin, Staff Attorney at GLAD Law.
Lambda Legal and the Legal Defense Fund issued a letter on Tuesday urging U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reverse course on a policy that led to the removal of 381 books from the Nimitz Library of the U.S.","Three military families sued the Department of Defense on Monday after President Trump’s anti-transgender policies barred their transgender adolescent and adult children from accessing essential gender-affirming medical care.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenges the legality of the Trump administration’s decision to ban coverage of any transgender-related medical care under Department of Defense health insurance plans.

Under the new directive, military clinics and hospitals are prohibited from providing continuing care to transgender adolescent and adult children. It also prevents TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, from covering the costs of gender-affirming care for both transgender youth and young adults, regardless of where that care is received.

A press release from the families’ attorney explained that the plaintiffs are proceeding under pseudonyms to protect their safety and privacy. They are represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law), the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), Brown, Goldstein & Levy, LLP, and Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” said Sarah Austin, Staff Attorney at GLAD Law. “When a servicemember is deployed and focused on the mission they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This Administration has backtracked on that core promise and put servicemembers at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

“President Trump has illegally overstepped his authority by abruptly cutting off necessary medical care for military families,” said Shannon Minter, Legal Director at NCLR. “This lawless directive is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring legal requirements and abandoning our servicemembers.”

“President Trump’s Executive Order blocks military hospitals from giving transgender youth the care their doctors deem necessary and their parents have approved,” said Sharif Jacob, partner at Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP. “Today we filed a lawsuit to put an end to his order, and the agency guidance implementing it.”

“This administration is unlawfully targeting military families by denying essential care to their transgender children,” said Liam Brown, an associate with Keker, Van Nest & Peters. “We will not stand by while those who serve are stripped of the ability to care for their families.”

The U.S. Air Force on Thursday said transgender service members who have served between 15 and 18 years would be denied the opportunity to retire early and instead will be separated from the military without benefits.

Trans troops will now have the option of accepting a lump sum payout offered to junior service members or be removed from the service.

A spokesperson for the Air Force told the Associated Press that “although service members with 15 to 18 years of honorable service were permitted to apply for an exception to policy, none of the exceptions to policy were approved.”

Some trans airmen, about a dozen, were “prematurely notified” that they were able to retire early before the decision was reversed, the spokesperson said.

Responding to the news, Human Rights Campaign Chief of Staff Jay Brown said, “This is indefensible. After already denying transgender servicemembers the ability to serve their country, the Trump administration is now stripping them of the retirement benefits they’ve earned after years of honorable service.”

Brown continued, “This has nothing to do with military readiness — it’s cruelty for cruelty’s sake.”

HRC and Lambda Legal are representing plaintiffs in a lawsuit, Shilling v. United States, challenging the Trump-Vance administration’s ban on military service by trans people.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the renaming of the U.S. Naval Ship Harvey Milk, according to a report in Military.com on Tuesday.

Since 2016, the replenishment oiler has borne the name of the late gay rights icon, who served in the Navy during the Korean War, was separated from the service other than honorably to avoid being court martialed for his homosexuality, and then went on to become the the first LGBTQ candidate elected to public office in California.

Per the article, a memorandum from the Office of the Secretary of the Navy outlined the plans to rename the ship, and a defense official said the order to take this “rare step” came from Hegseth with an announcement deliberately planned for Pride month, on June 13.

The memo reviewed by Military.com indicates that the move comes as part of an effort to strengthen “alignment with president and SECDEF objectives and SECNAV priorities of reestablishing the warrior culture.”

Milk was assassinated in 1978 while serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. U.S. House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D), who has represented the city in Congress since 1987, said the decision is “a surrender of a fundamental American value: to honor the legacy of those who worked to build a better country” and “a shameful, vindictive erasure of those who fought to break down barriers for all to chase the American Dream.”

“Our military is the most powerful in the world — but this spiteful move does not strengthen our national security or the ‘warrior’ ethos,” she said.

Renaming a Naval ship is traditionally considered taboo, as well as a harbinger of bad luck.

During the Biden-Harris administration in 2023, however, a cruiser and research ship with names tied to the Confederacy were renamed — though Military.com notes that “the recommendation to rename the two ships came from a commission that was created by Congress to study names with ties to the Confederacy across the entire military.”

CBS on Tuesday reported that along with the Harvey Milk, the Navy is also considering renaming other John Lewis-class oilers including the USNS Thurgood Marshall, USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and USNS Harriet Tubman.

Lambda Legal and the Legal Defense Fund issued a letter on Tuesday urging U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reverse course on a policy that led to the removal of 381 books from the Nimitz Library of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.

Pursuant to President Donald Trump’s executive order 14190, “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” the institution screened 900 titles to identify works promoting “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” removing those that concerned or touched upon “topics pertaining to the experiences of people of color, especially Black people, and/or LGBTQ people,” according to a press release from the civil rights organizations.

These included “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” by Maya Angelou, “Stone Fruit” by Lee Lai, “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas, “Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong” by James W. Loewen, “Gender Queer: A Memoir” by Maia Kobabe, and “Democracy in Black: How Race Still Enslaves the American Soul” by Eddie S. Glaude, Jr.

The groups further noted that “the collection retained other books with messages and themes that privilege certain races and religions over others, including ‘The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan’ by Thomas Dixon, Jr., ‘Mein Kampf’ by Adolf Hitler, and ‘Heart of Darkness’ by Joseph Conrad.

In their letter, Lambda Legal and LDF argued the books must be returned to circulation to preserve the “constitutional rights” of cadets at the institution, warning of the “danger” that comes with “censoring materials based on viewpoints disfavored by the current administration.”

“Such censorship is especially dangerous in an educational setting, where critical inquiry, intellectual diversity, and exposure to a wide array of perspectives are necessary to educate future citizen-leaders,” Lambda Legal Chief Legal Officer Jennifer C. Pizer and LDF Director of Strategic Initiatives Jin Hee Lee said in the press release.",https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2024/06/20240615_gender-affirming_healthcare_sign_at_Baltimore_Pride_Parade_insert_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key-1000x600.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:39.579905

In February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth implemented a rule prohibiting transgender service members from receiving gender-affirming care and barring new enlistments of those with a history of gender dysphoria. A federal court temporarily blocked the rule in April, finding the restrictions unconstitutional. Despite this ruling, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Stephen Ferrara chose in May to enforce the policy.

The three families that are challenging the Pentagon are arguing that the administration’s actions exceed the scope of last year’s law, which bars TRICARE from covering “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization.” The lawsuit also contends that Trump’s executive order and the Pentagon’s enforcement, which restrict care for all dependents, violate a separate statute prohibiting federal regulations from being “arbitrary and capricious.”

According to the lawsuit, two of the children—identified as Diana Doe and Nathan Noe—had been receiving hormone therapy with their parents’ consent, based on guidance from doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. This spring, their doctors informed the families that the medical center could no longer provide the therapy, and TRICARE sent no notice of the coverage change.

The third plaintiff, Parker Poe, a young adult, has been unable to continue treatment after his doctor at an unnamed facility told the family that TRICARE would no longer cover his testosterone or related care.

“President Trump has illegally overstepped his authority by abruptly cutting off necessary medical care for military families,” said Shannon Minter, legal director at the National Center for LGBTQ Rights (NCLR). “This lawless directive is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring legal requirements and abandoning our servicemembers.”",https://abuwjaawap.cloudimg.io/v7/_lgbtqnation-assets_/assets/2020/02/transgender-military-trump-pentagon-study.jpg?auto=format&auto=compress&fit=crop&gravity=smart&w=1200&h=630&force_format=jpeg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:42.401767

Plaintiffs' families now face significant, and in some cases crushing, out-of-pocket costs or the prospect of watching their family member's health deteriorate without the medications that kept them healthy and stable.
Such services were provided by both military medical treatment facilities and military pharmacies, the lawsuit says – and outlined in TRICARE's own policy manual.
The lawsuit says these changes have collectively ""unlawfully modified the scope of medical care provided"" to military families.
""This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,"" GLAD said in a press release announcing the litigation.","A trio of military families is suing the Trump administration in federal court over a recent policy that bars gender-affirming care.

In March, a sub-agency within the Department of Defense (DoD) gave effect to a series of executive orders issued by President Donald Trump by instructing TRICARE, the military's health insurance plan, to stop covering procedures and services associated with ""treatment of gender dysphoria"" for ""individuals under 19 years of age.""

On Monday, in a 32-page complaint, the pseudonymous plaintiffs – Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe – sued the DoD and several named Trump administration officials over the policy.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge ""to hold unlawful and set aside"" the new policies under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the statute governing the behavior of agencies and departments.

Love true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.

The plaintiffs say the new rules issued by the DoD have forced their families – and very likely others in their position – into a financially precarious position and risked their overall health.

""Their prescriptions have been cut off without notice,"" the lawsuit reads. ""Their trusted doctors at military hospitals have been forced to abandon them. Plaintiffs' families now face significant, and in some cases crushing, out-of-pocket costs or the prospect of watching their family member's health deteriorate without the medications that kept them healthy and stable. This is not an abstract policy shift—it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential healthcare that affects the physical and psychological wellbeing of Plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country.""

The plaintiffs say they have relied on TRICARE providing gender-affirming care for ""nearly a decade."" Such services were provided by both military medical treatment facilities and military pharmacies, the lawsuit says – and outlined in TRICARE's own policy manual.

""Consistent with this scientific evidence and accepted medical standards, TRICARE has covered puberty-blocking medications and hormone therapy when indicated for transgender adolescents, and hormone therapy when indicated for transgender adults,"" the filing goes on.

The abrupt about-face to stop providing ""medically necessary medications"" is part of a ""targeted reversal"" to ""strip equal rights from transgender people"" and reflects the 45th and 47th president's ""hostile views toward transgender people,"" the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit says these changes have collectively ""unlawfully modified the scope of medical care provided"" to military families.

And these changes, the complaint explains, fly in the face of generally-accepted medical practice – even where minors are concerned.

""Under accepted protocols, physicians do not prescribe puberty-blocking medications or hormones to adolescent minors unless they have obtained informed consent from a parent and assent from the minor,"" the filing continues. ""Physicians must disclose the known risks and benefits of each medication to obtain informed parental consent and minor assent.""

The lawsuit takes a highly personalized approach by explaining each of the plaintiffs' own struggles with gender dysphoria as a child.

One representative section reads, at length:

As early as elementary school, Nathan felt uncomfortable being seen as a girl. Even before he had language to explain it and before he could tell others, he identified as a boy and did what he could to live that way…

As he grew, Nathan had multiple conversations with his parents about not feeling like or being a girl and wanting to be a boy. Nathan's parents increasingly became aware of the distress Nathan experienced when others did not treat him as a boy. As Nathan approached puberty and his distress over not being recognized and treated as a boy intensified, his parents sought medical advice from a healthcare provider.

The lawsuit was filed in Maryland district court by attorneys with GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) and the National Center for LGBTQ Rights. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman, a Joe Biden appointee.

""This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,"" GLAD said in a press release announcing the litigation. ""When a servicemember is deployed, they deserve to know their family is taken care of.""

In legal terms, the plaintiffs say the DoD ""failed to offer any explanation at all"" in support for the change in policy and similarly did not consider ""all relevant factors"" when making the shift. Short-circuiting the process in this manner amounts to an action considered ""arbitrary and capricious"" under the APA, the lawsuit alleges.

In another challenge, the plaintiffs say any changes to TRICARE coverage require a formal announcement under the notice-and-comment rulemaking standard outlined in the APA – as well as similar rules outlined in two additional statutes relevant to government-provided health insurance. And, as a result, since no such notice was provided here, the government failed to comply with the ""procedures required for all new substantive rules, and thus impermissibly promulgated a new rule in violation of the APA,"" the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit also challenges the Trump administration's effort to stop providing gender-affirming care for certain adults – who are 18 or 19 years old – as a direct violation of an appropriations bill passed by Congress.

""The Executive Branch cannot usurp Congress's legislative authority on its own mandate; any legislative authority wielded by the Executive Branch must have been delegated within the confines of the Constitutional limitations protecting the respective spheres of government,"" the complaint continues. ""The Executive Branch has no constitutional power to enact, amend, or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes.""",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-military-parade.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 15:56:09.752961

If you used the West Region referral approval waiver to see a specialist between Jan. 1 and June 30, 2025 and need to continue seeing that specialist, you’ll need to get a new referral to a network specialist before Oct. 1, 2025.

If you’re still using a valid referral issued by a previous contractor before Jan. 1, 2025, you also need to get a new referral for any care received starting Oct. 1. You can confirm your referral information by logging into the TRICARE West Region Beneficiary Portal. (Note: If your referral expires before Oct. 1, it’s valid through its expiration date.) Otherwise, you may need to pay point-of-service fees.

“If you live in the West Region, it’s important that you take the time now to evaluate your current referrals,” said Jacob Sanchez, referral management subject expert, TRICARE Health Plan, at the Defense Health Agency. “Work with your primary care manager and plan ahead for specialty care you may need starting Oct. 1.”

Referrals issued during referral approval waiver period end Sept. 30

Are you currently getting specialty care under an active referral received via the referral approval waiver process?

Here’s what to know:

• You can continue receiving your care under the waiver through Sept. 30, without paying point-of-service fees, as long as the provider is TRICARE-authorized. Your care under that referral ends Sept. 30.

• If you need care after Sept. 30, you must go back to your primary care manager to get a new referral to your specialist. Contact your PCM to begin this process prior to Sept. 30.

• TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the West Region contractor, requires processing time to approve a new referral.

• Starting Oct. 1, point-of-service fees may apply if you see a non-network specialist. Use the West Region Provider Directory to find a network specialist.

• If you don’t receive a new referral, you may have to pay out-of-pocket costs.

It’s important to note that you don’t need to take any action if you live in the East Region or overseas.

“TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated.
Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?
Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition.
Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions.","The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as:

• Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t?

• Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it?

• Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket?

“Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.”

TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?

A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences.

Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions?

A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk.

TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden?

A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change).

If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31?

A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for:

• Those with TFL

• Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus)

Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31?

A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket.

Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered?

A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include:

• Ozempic

• Trulicity

• Mounjaro

• Victoza

Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan.

“By partnering with Cactus, we’re combining behavioural health science with creative storytelling to break down stigma and open new pathways to care,” says Dishi Umfleet - executive director. “This campaign is about meeting military communities where they are and making support visible, accessible, and judgment-free.”

'Stigma Stand Down' addresses a critical need, as military personnel often face significant barriers to care due to the stigma associated with looking weak or unmanly when seeking help. The core creative visualises this internal struggle with the tagline, ""When you have a gambling problem, it shows up everywhere.""

The visuals, created with a combination of AI and human manipulation, depict how gambling invades ordinary life scenarios like family dinners, a trip to the grocery store, or even attending a little league baseball game, prompting the audience to confront the issue head-on.

“Our work on Stigma Stand Down was informed by two things: our agency’s commitment to promoting mental health, and the Responsible Gaming initiatives we oversee for our three state lottery clients in Colorado, North Carolina and Indiana,” said Cactus founder and CEO, Joe Conrad. “Problem gambling never exists in a vacuum and with the Stigma Stand Down campaign we wanted to send the message that there are a number of steps you can take to address problem gambling or other mental health issues in a non-judgemental, helpful, and confidential way.”

The new campaign aims to provide a judgment-free zone for support, offering resources like TRICARE-covered telehealth and evidence-based tools.

Four Donald Ward “Doc” Evans Jr. “dashed across 100 meters of open area through a withering hail of enemy fire and exploding grenades” to treat and drag wounded soldiers to safety until he died from multiple injuries, according to his Medal of Honor citation. For paying the ultimate sacrifice, Evans was the first Vietnam War medic to receive the medal posthumously. He was 23 and married.

Nearly 20 years later in 1986, Evans Army Community Hospital on Fort Carson, Colorado, honored his sacrifice and gave his name to the original Fort Carson hospital complex built in 1942. Today, EACH honors Evans’ memory by earning superior ratings for its patient- and family-centered healthcare services.

A young medic in Vietnam

Evans enlisted in the Army in 1965 after graduating high school in Covina, California, where he excelled as a cross-country runner. Evans completed his medic training with Company D, 1st Battalion, at the U.S. Army Medical Training Center on Fort Sam Houston, graduating in June 1966 and deploying shortly after.

Excerpts from Evans’ personal journal and photos, provided by the U.S. Army Medical Department, show the challenging conditions the young medic and his platoon faced while serving in Vietnam:

Oct.14, 1966: “When the convoy was lined up, they gave us ammo. I carry morphine, so you know we’re here.”

Nov. 11, 1966: “I’m sitting alongside a Pup tent that’s about as dry as dry during a rain as the ocean. We live half like animals and half like people. During the last 10 days, I’ve slept in the wet.”

Dec. 10-22, 1966: “I got another metal [sic] for my collections. It’s a … Combat Medics Badge. You get it for being in a combat area for more than 30 days or being in hostile fire twice.”

Evans’ day of sacrifice

According to his Medal of Honor citation, during a firefight near the hamlet of Tri Tam, Binh Duong Province, Evans left his position of relative safety with his platoon to answer the calls for medical aid from the wounded men of another platoon which was heavily engaged with the enemy force. The hamlet was located north of the infamous and heavily occupied Iron Triangle.

After bringing the wounded to safety, Evans returned to the forward location to treat more causalities and was struck and seriously injured by hand grenade fragments. He continued to evacuate other wounded soldiers, was severely wounded again, and rejoined his platoon. The citation goes on: “Continuing to refuse medical attention and ignoring advice to remain behind, he managed with his waning strength to move yet another wounded comrade across the dangerous open area to safety.”

“Disregarding his painful wounds and seriously weakened from profuse bleeding, he continued his lifesaving medical aid and was killed while treating another wounded comrade,” according to his citation.

Thanks largely to Evans’ bravery in his rescue efforts that day while severely wounded, only three soldiers died in the firefight; Evans was one of them.

EACH quality honors ‘Doc’ Evans every day

Evans Army Community Hospital’s commitment to keeping Evans’ memory alive has resulted in a significant number of quality awards, including:

“A” Safety Grades for the last four years from the independent watchdog The Leapfrog Group. You can find ratings for keeping patients safe from errors, injuries, accidents, and infections for all military hospitals and clinics in the list of current quality, patient safety, and access information.

A meritorious recognition from the American College of Surgeons’ National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. The NSQI is a variable-based data registry reflecting high standards in surgical care.

A triennial survey by the certification body, The Joint Commission, in February 2025 recognized EACH for a staff culture of engagement in patient safety.

A Greenhealth Partner for Change award in 2025 from the nation’s leading organization dedicated to environmental sustainability in health care.

The Fort Sam Houston Evans Auditorium on Joint Base San Antonio, Texas, honored Evans in June 1972. Many Army medics trained at JBSA receive their graduation certificates at the auditorium.

‘One of the good guys’

During the 1972 dedication, several of Evans’ combat buddies spoke about him. Al Peckham and Bill Comeau called Evans “one of the good guys,” according to ceremony materials in the U.S. Army Medical Department historical collection.

They noted: “These [photos] are the details that Don wanted you to know about, showing the exotic locale where he served so gallantly. Today many of the men ... survived their tour in Vietnam because of Donald's heroic deeds while administering to them that day in January 1967. They never forgot him.”

A typical Arctic Army-issued tent was usually used by four or five soldiers. Poorly suited for Vietnam’s extreme high temperatures, the tents sides were rolled up to allow some cooling.

The tour, which highlighted progress on ship retrofitting for the future embarkation of the U.S. Navy's Expeditionary Medical Unit (EMU) 1 aboard the USNS Cody, included service members and civilians from OPMED; the Expeditionary Missions Program Office within the Naval Sea Systems Command; U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery; Naval Medical Forces Atlantic; and Naval Systems Engineering and Logistics Directorate. All are key stakeholders in the EMU program’s development.

According to MSC experts, the USNS Cody is being developed as a Role 2 facility – equipped to provide medical treatment, advanced trauma management, emergency surgery, and resuscitative care while afloat. The vessel is capable of operating in littoral, or coastal, regions with a hybrid crew of non-military and U.S. Navy medical providers.

I'm on Tricare as an active duty military member. Our system is super bogged down right now and seeing a provider can take upwards of 6 months at times.

I have developed a RAPIDLY (<1 week) changing mole that meets all the criteria for melanoma. I was lucky and already had a dermatology referral in to my military health system, but their earliest available is in 5 weeks. All the literature on melanoma that I can find recommends that you get screened within 1 month of discovering the potential melanoma lesion and I have family history and have several risk factors.

I talk with my healthcare team and they say that I can find a provider out in town, but because I have access to a dermatologist via the military, Tricare won't cover it. Ok, that makes sense. So I start calling every dermatology office within 2 hours of me.

They. Won't. Take. My. Money. I keep explaining my situation to them and regardless of how much I guarantee that I will pay an exorbitant fee to prevent cancer -- as much as they would bill Tricare -- they all refuse and say that because I have Tricare, they cannot book me, even if I pay out of pocket.

Is there some law I am unaware of that is preventing them from providing me medical treatment? Tricare is telling me to call my local dermatology office 1-2 times per day to see if they have any last minute cancellations, which seems like a risky way to play with CANCER.

Any advice or insight is appreciated.",,N,0.0,2025-09-09 11:56:07.657325

U.S. District Judge Henry E. Autrey on Monday sentenced Dr. Asim Muhammad Ali, 54, to 70 months in prison. Ali was also ordered to pay $1,845,916 in restitution for the 2020 case and $3,902 for the 2024 case.

In the 2020 case, Ali participated in a conspiracy to pay kickbacks for urine samples referred for testing to Central Diagnostic Laboratory, one of his companies. He also admitted signing prescriptions for controlled substances to patients suspected of selling or giving away drugs. Prosecutors said Ali pre-signed prescriptions for patients of the Institute for Pain Management LLC without seeing them, rarely reviewing charts or verifying legitimate medical need.

Judge Autrey ordered Ali and his codefendants to repay $950,381 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, $13,993 to Tricare, and $881,542 to Missouri Medicaid.

In the 2024 case, Ali agreed to provide services for Medicare patients of Dr. Mohd Azfar Malik’s company, Psych Care Consultants LLC, but billed under Malik’s name and Medicare number. Medicare was charged for “annual wellness visits,” but Ali did not meet patients in person and instead conducted phone calls asking brief questions. Medicare paid $3,902 for the fraudulent claims.

Ali pleaded guilty in the 2020 case to conspiracy to illegally distribute controlled substances, illegal prescribing, paying illegal kickbacks for referrals, and submitting false claims. In the 2024 case, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to illegally distribute controlled substances and maintaining a drug-involved premises.

Malik pleaded guilty to two counts of making false statements related to health care matters. He admitted submitting fraudulent claims to Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers by billing for services he did not personally perform. He also billed for ketamine infusions administered by Ali despite knowing Ali was under indictment and lacked authorization from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Malik’s actions caused losses of $19,442.

In August, Malik was sentenced to five years of probation, fined $20,000, and ordered to repay $19,442. He also agreed to surrender his DEA registrations allowing him to administer controlled substances.",https://www.kttn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Prison-Sentence.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 06:56:29.554964

Specifically, the law applies only to minors, while the Pentagon is restricting health care for all dependents.
“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” Sarah Austin, staff attorney at GLAD Law, said in a statement.
The restrictions on gender-affirmation health care are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to erase transgender people from public life.
In addition to kicking out transgender troops and denying health care to transgender military kids, the administration has banned books about transgender people from Defense Department schools and ended gender-affirmation care at the Department of Veterans Affairs.","Military families with transgender children are suing the Pentagon over the Trump administration’s efforts to cut off gender-affirming health care to military dependents.

In a lawsuit filed Monday, three families are alleging that the administration’s moves go beyond a law that was passed last year to restrict gender-affirming care for military children and violate a separate law that says federal regulations cannot be “arbitrary and capricious.”

“Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm on plaintiffs,” the lawsuit says.

“Their prescriptions have been cut off without notice,” it continues. “Their trusted doctors at military hospitals have been forced to abandon them. Plaintiffs’ families now face significant and, in some cases, crushing out-of-pocket costs or the prospect of watching their family member’s health deteriorate without the medications that kept them healthy and stable. This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country.”

A Defense Department spokesperson declined to comment on active litigation.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed by two LGBTQ+ advocacy groups on behalf of the families, are anonymous to protect the children’s privacy. But the suit details the families’ struggles to get care.

Two of the children, referred to in the lawsuit as Diana Doe and Nathan Noe, were taking hormones with their parents’ consent on the advice of their doctors at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland. This spring, they were told by their Walter Reed doctors that the medical center could no longer provide the hormone therapy, but neither family ever received a notice from Tricare about benefits changing, according to the lawsuit.

The third plaintiff, known as Parker Poe, who is described as a young adult, has been unable to access treatment after his doctor at an unnamed medical facility informed the family that Tricare would no longer cover his testosterone or related care.

“He is months overdue for the lab work that he needs to monitor his treatment. Additionally, without Tricare coverage, Parker’s prescription for testosterone [redacted] was too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the lawsuit says. “This process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

The hardships detailed in the lawsuit come after Congress passed a law last year that barred Tricare from covering any “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria that could result in sterilization” for beneficiaries who are minors.

The law didn’t specify which treatments would be banned, but it was widely expected to prohibit hormone therapy and puberty blockers, as well as surgery, which is a very rare treatment for transgender minors.

In January, President Donald Trump also issued an executive order that attempted to ban any federal funding from going toward puberty blockers, hormones or surgery for anyone under 19 years old.

Throughout the spring, defense health officials issued policies and memos to implement the law and the executive order that cumulatively barred military treatment facilities from providing and Tricare from covering gender-affirmation care for military dependents of any age, including minors and adult children.

Trump’s executive order and the Pentagon’s implementation go beyond what last year’s law required, the lawsuit argues. Specifically, the law applies only to minors, while the Pentagon is restricting health care for all dependents.

Further, the lawsuit said, the law “does not support a categorical ban” on puberty blockers and hormone therapy.

“Puberty blockers and hormones for treatment of gender dysphoria do not cause ‘sterilization,’” the lawsuit says. A Pentagon memo “misstates the medical evidence by conflating potential fertility impacts with sterilization. DoD then uses this conflation to categorically deny gender transition treatments to all transgender adolescents and young adults, despite the absence of individualized medical justification and despite the statute’s limited scope, which does not support such a broad application.”

The lawsuit also argues that the new health care policies violate the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows courts to block policies that are arbitrary or capricious.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Maryland by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders, or GLAD Law, and National Center for LGBTQ Rights, or NCLR.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” Sarah Austin, staff attorney at GLAD Law, said in a statement. “When a service member is deployed and focused on the mission, they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This administration has backtracked on that core promise and put service members at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

The same pair of organizations is representing service members in a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration’s ban on transgender troops.

The restrictions on gender-affirmation health care are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to erase transgender people from public life.

In addition to kicking out transgender troops and denying health care to transgender military kids, the administration has banned books about transgender people from Defense Department schools and ended gender-affirmation care at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Outside of military and veterans spheres, the administration has also tried to remove transgender people from the history of the Stonewall riots, blocked transgender people from changing the gender marker on their passports, and tried to force states to ban transgender women from competing in women’s sports.

Last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also posted on social media that he was firing a Navy doctor after Libs of TikTok, a conservative account focused on publicly shaming LGBTQ+ people, posted a screenshot of her LinkedIn page that said she provides transgender health care at a Navy hospital in California.

The nonprofit group American Oversight filed the suit in U.S. District Court last week. It challenges DOE’s effort to require individuals to re-confirm their interest in FOIA requests. In an August notice in the Federal Register, DOE announced that those with a FOIA request submitted prior to October 1, 2024, must email the agency within 30 days to keep the request open. American Oversight argues the move violates the law and would open the door for other agencies to sidestep their obligations under FOIA.

Extra money for IT modernization projects may be harder to come by next year. For a third year in a row, the House isn't giving any new funding to the Technology Modernization Fund. Lawmakers also are cutting two other federal IT modernization funding sources in 2026. The Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill includes $55 million for the Federal Citizen Services Fund, which would be a $20 million cut as compared to 2025. The bill also includes $10 million for the IT Oversight Reform Fund, $5 million of which would go to the Department of Government Efficiency. While the overall ITOR fund would increase by $2 million over 2025, the amount available for the federal CIO's office for IT projects would drop by $3 million.

By early November, the Defense Department must submit to the White House recommendations for what actions are required to permanently change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War. President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to begin the process to rebrand the DoD to DoW. The Pentagon already changed its website to war.gov from defense.gov. But Congress must sign off on the name change before it becomes official. Congressman Greg Steube (R-Fla) proposed legislation in the House to formally change the name of the department. Senators Rick Scott (R-Fla) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) are introducing companion legislation in the Senate.

Navy Secretary John Phelan is creating new leadership billets and a program office for robotic and autonomous systems. Phelan directed the creation of a deputy assistant secretary position, a program executive office and a portfolio acquisition executive for robotic and autonomous systems. He is also pausing all related acquisition and contracting actions for the next 30 days. Phelan will issue further direction on the “full implementation” of the new roles and offices in a month. He expects the offices to reach its initial operating capacity within the next 90 days.

The Defense Health Agency has rolled out a new online tool that allows users to search for DHA locations worldwide. Users can filter searches by defense health network, TRICARE region or keywords, and the interactive map makes it easy to find a location, link to a website or click to call. FindDHA is the latest addition to the public website the agency launched in 2024 as a collaboration between the agency's communications and public affairs division and the web and mobile technology management office.

More employees at the Environmental Protection Agency have been reprimanded for signing a letter of dissent last month. EPA leadership has just suspended many of the employees who signed a dissent letter earlier this year. The two-week suspension notices went out after a handful of other EPA employees were fired the week before. The suspended EPA employees are now awaiting the agency's final call on what comes next. The American Federation of Government Employees, which represents over 8000 EPA workers is urging the agency to reinstate all of the impacted employees.

A new audit is highlighting challenges with the federal cyber workforce. Agencies have limited data on the number of federal employees and contractors working on cybersecurity issues. That’s according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office. GAO says strengthening the cyber workforce is a critical challenge given threats to federal IT networks. But most agencies haven’t fully evaluated whether various cyber workforce initiatives are making a difference. GAO is recommending the Office of the National Cyber Director work more closely with agencies on strategic workforce issues.

“TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated.
Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?
Federal law doesn’t TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition.
Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions.","The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as:

Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t?

Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it?

Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket?

“Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.”

TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select?

A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences.

Federal law doesn’t TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions?

A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk.

TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden?

A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change).

If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31?

A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for:

Those with TFL

Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus)

Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31?

A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket.

Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered?

A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include:

Ozempic

Trulicity

Mounjaro

Victoza

Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan.

Bottom line

Now they take all the federal military retirees and throw us in with all the federal workers in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program.
Terry Gerton Well, speaking of that, as people start to think about transitioning, whether it’s for military service or federal service, what’s the first step you recommend that they take?","Terry Gerton You know, summer is sort of a season of transition, not just for military members, but this year for a lot of federal employees who might be facing downsizing or retirement or career shifts. Let’s walk through some of the things that people should be thinking about as they prepare for these changes. Maybe start with life insurance. What should folks be thinking about if they’re getting out of the military or if they are getting out of federal government?

Mike Meese Well, it’s very important that they think about that in terms of protecting their family. While you’re in federal government service, in most cases you’re covered by the Federal Employees’ Government Life Insurance. If you’re in the military, it’s Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance. But you lose that when you leave either federal service or government service. And if you’re in federal service, you’ve got 31 days to apply, usually, with another carrier to be able to do that. You don’t get the government subsidy so it’s more expensive. Similar for service members, you can get VGLI [(Veterans’ Group Life Insurance)]. In both of those cases, whenever you do one of those transitions, it’s important to shop around, look at other potential providers. In our case, Armed Forces Mutual provides life insurance for the military and veterans [and] is a great place to start to be sure that you’re getting the adequate protection for your family at the right price.

Terry Gerton Are there some key considerations that people should be thinking about as they think about adequate protection?

Mike Meese Yes, you want to try to do an assessment of what your family would be dependent upon to be able to take care of all of the normal daily needs, as well as if you’ve got young children at home, putting them through college. All of the kinds of things that you had hoped to earn through your career, if your career is unexpectedly stopped because you die. You don’t want your family to either be destitute on the day-to-day things or not be able to fulfill all the expectations. So for most people, we end up finding $500,000, $800,000, even a million dollars worth of coverage is important.

Terry Gerton Well, and you don’t want to be trying to make those decisions while you’re in the middle of transition, right? Thinking early and shopping around early is the best approach here.

Mike Meese Exactly. That’s very important. And if you’re in the military and trying to get a VA disability rating, you want to get that life insurance before all your retirement physicals, because that may identify something that you did not know was necessarily wrong with you. You, of course, would disclose that on a life insurance application. But if you don’t know that you have that kind of illness, then you don’t put that on the application.

Terry Gerton Well, that’s an important caution. And it brings up another question around medical care. Folks who are in the government have access to subsidized health insurance. Folks in the military have full health insurance. What should people be thinking about as they’re preparing to step away from that full coverage?

Mike Meese The same kinds of things. What kind of coverage are you going to have? If you’re retiring, then you can go into TRICARE for retirees if you’re in the military, or the federal benefit program for retirees. If you are not retiring, it’s important for you to determine, where am I going to get my source of health care? Is that from the spouse’s employment, because sometimes your spouse will have health care coverage for the family? Or are you going to take a look at continuing the current coverage that you have from your employer through paying it yourself or going on to one of the health care exchanges? It’s a very complicated process. You want to start that early as you begin your transition.

Terry Gerton And it’s important to remember that dental and vision aren’t always included in those programs, right?

Mike Meese No, exactly, and they are usually not subsidized. So for example, there used to be a TRICARE retiree dental program that was taken away about 10 or 12 years ago. Now they take all the federal military retirees and throw us in with all the federal workers in the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. It’s organized by the federal government, but not substantially subsidized by the federal government. So you want to look very carefully at exactly what your needs are.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Mike Meese. He serves as the president of Armed Forces Mutual. Well, Mike, let’s shift gears a little bit. Let’s talk about education and training because the job market is such now that it could be really difficult without some retraining or additional education to find a new fit. What sort of benefits should people be looking into there?

Mike Meese Well, again, for veterans, you’re eligible for the Veterans Readiness and Employment. It used to be called Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, but it’s Chapter 31 benefits — up to 48 months of training, which you could get even if you have left service, maybe went to the federal government and then have left, as long as it’s within 12 years of your date of discharge from the military. If you have a disability that affects your ability to work, the Veterans Readiness and Employment is something that you may want to consider. You’d want to consider that first before looking at the other benefits such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, because if you use the Veterans Readiness and Employment first, then the Post-9/11 GA Bill benefits may still be eligible for your children.

Terry Gerton Can you talk a little bit about the transferability of the GI Bill?

Mike Meese Yeah, that’s one of the most advantageous things that happened after 9/11 is they allowed you to, if you earn post-9//11 GI Bill benefits, that’s up to 36 months of benefits. So basically, four years of nine months at school, you can transfer that to your children, eligible dependents or to your spouse and they can use those benefits. In my case, I had two daughters, I gave 18 months to each of them. And not only did they get tuition at, in their cases, University of Connecticut, George Mason University, but they were also able to get the basic allowance for housing for an E-5 in the military. And that helped defray the food and dormitory costs when they were in college.

Terry Gerton Sounds like a great opportunity. And you mentioned that it’s transferable to family members. So spouses, it could apply to spouses as well.

Mike Meese It also can apply to spouses, and a few tips on that. Children have to use it before age 26. So you could even use it if they got a scholarship for college and they were under 26, they could use that for graduate school, for example. The other thing is, you want to transfer at least one month to each child and maybe one month to your spouse. That way, in my case, those two, my two daughters, just the way semesters broke, ended up with four and a half months left over. And they’re over 26. They’re not going to be able to use it. The only one left, I may have to go back and take an art class or something to be to take advantage of all those Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Had I transferred it to my spouse, she would have been able to use that.

Terry Gerton Well, one more topic then that people can be thinking about as they’re preparing for transition is financial readiness. We’ve talked in the past about financial literacy, but what about financial readiness? How do people evaluate where they are, and what should they be thinking about?

Mike Meese Well, the important thing is you need to be situationally aware and know what your income is, what your expenses are and what your net worth is. As we take a look at it, budgeting is critically important. And when we are working with people that are transitioning out of the military or out of federal civilian service, they don’t know what their income is going to be. But frequently, what they should know is, how much do I need to live off of? In other words, what are my expenses? You’d be surprised how many people just don’t know where all the money goes and what is discretionary, what is absolutely essential. And once we identify, hey, I need this amount of money to live on each month, we recommend, especially as you’re going through a transition, that you have at least six to eight months of those expenses. Especially the ones that you absolutely need to pay, like a mortgage, like food, like car insurance, that you want to be able to have eight months of expenses so that you don’t either go into debt or have to immediately take that first job that’s available just to be able to make ends meet.

Terry Gerton And what are some of the surprising things that people come across as they begin to build that budget?

Mike Meese It’s amazing how much the transportation costs are, because if you were in federal government service or if you lived on post, you probably didn’t drive very far. Even things like gym memberships. Those people that are in the military, you not only don’t have to pay for gym memberships, but usually your first sergeant is your personal trainer that gets you up at six in the morning to be able to do PT every day. When you have those kinds of expenses, uniform expenses, clothing expenses, all of those kinds of things tend to add up quite quickly. In addition to, as we mentioned, medical and dental insurance and those kinds of things. So that’s why, definitely be prepared before you enter one of these transitions.

84% Have Other Insurance: RAND Says VA Must Curb Duplicate Spending

Veterans aren’t short on coverage — and that’s the problem. A new analysis from the RAND Epstein Family Veterans Policy Research Institute finds that about 84% of the 8.2 million veterans enrolled in VA health care also carry another form of coverage (Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid, or private insurance). RAND’s researchers say that much overlap “raises questions about whether different programs are making duplicative payments for the same care.”

This lands just as the VA and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) opened a data-matching partnership that already flagged $106 million in duplicate provider payments over six years — money both agencies say they’re moving to recover. VA News And while that’s a start, outside experts say meaningful fixes require better record-keeping and tighter tracking across all the systems veterans use.

What’s Actually Going Wrong?

Siloed systems. VA is a care provider and payer; Medicare and TRICARE are insurers. They don’t act as each other’s secondary payer, which means the same veteran can touch multiple systems without a single source of truth on who should pay.

Overlapping bills. Providers sometimes bill both VA community care and Medicare for the same encounter — hence that $106M figure and the new VA–CMS data match.

Medicare Advantage incentives. Separate investigations show the government often pays Medicare Advantage plans for veterans who still rely heavily on VA care — another flavor of double-spend risk.

Why This Matters …

Every duplicate dollar is a dollar not spent on you. Waste drains resources from claims processing, specialty clinics, prosthetics, mental health, and toxic-exposure care — the lifelines our community depends on.

Continuity of care suffers. When agencies don’t see the full picture, authorizations, referrals, and reimbursements get messy — translating into canceled appointments or surprise bills.

Policy choices flow from data. RAND’s bottom line is clear: better data integration (VHA + Medicare + TRICARE + private claims) is needed to stop paying twice and to steer veterans to the right door faster.

What RAND (and Others) Recommend

Integrate claims data across payers. Use Medicare, TRICARE, Medicaid, and private-plan claims alongside VA enrollment/utilization data to see where care actually happened — and who should pay.

Educate veterans on coverage interactions. Clearer guidance on when to use VHA, community care, Medicare/MA, or private plans reduces accidental double billing.

Sustain the VA–CMS data-matching push. Early findings show it works; scaling it can prevent new overpayments instead of chasing them later.

What You Can Do Right Now …

Check your explanations of benefits (EOBs). If you use VA community care and also have Medicare or a private plan, scan EOBs for the same date of service showing up twice. If it looks wrong, report it to your VA community care office. (The VA has provider-billing guidance and audit processes in place.)

Tell providers up front. Hand them your VA authorization (for community care) and make it crystal-clear not to bill Medicare for that visit. This reduces “we billed both to be safe” misfires.

If you’re on Medicare Advantage, ask questions. Clarify how your MA plan interacts with VA care and prescriptions so you don’t pay premiums for benefits you rarely use — and so taxpayers aren’t paying twice.

Final thoughts …

Cutting waste isn’t anti-veteran — it’s pro-veteran. The 84% overlap is reality; the solution is smarter data, clearer rules, and consistent education, not finger-pointing. If VA, CMS, TRICARE, and private insurers pull in the same direction, the dollars saved can be redirected to what matters: faster decisions, steadier staffing, and better care for disabled veterans.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country” – Sarah Austin, GLAD Law

Three military families are challenging an abrupt reversal of Department of Defense policy, which now prohibits military clinics and hospitals from providing continuing medical care for their transgender adolescent and adult children. The new policy also prohibits TRICARE, the military insurance plan, from covering the costs of care for both transgender youth and young adults no matter where it is received.

Servicemembers, including the plaintiff families, have been able to obtain medical care for their transgender children through the military health system for nearly a decade. This spring, President Trump ordered the Department of Defense to terminate this essential care.

As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden.

The case, Doe v. Department of Defense, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs are proceeding with pseudonyms for the safety and privacy of their families. They are represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD Law), National Center for LGBTQ Rights (NCLR), Brown Goldstein & Levy, LLP, and Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP.

“This is a sweeping reversal of military health policy and a betrayal of military families who have sacrificed for our country,” said Sarah Austin, Staff Attorney at GLAD Law. “When a servicemember is deployed and focused on the mission they deserve to know their family is taken care of. This Administration has backtracked on that core promise and put servicemembers at risk of losing access to health care their children desperately need.”

“President Trump has illegally overstepped his authority by abruptly cutting off necessary medical care for military families,” Shannon Minter, Legal Director at NCLR. “This lawless directive is part of a dangerous pattern of this administration ignoring legal requirements and abandoning our servicemembers.”

“President Trump’s Executive Order blocks military hospitals from giving transgender youth the care their doctors deem necessary and their parents have approved,” said Sharif Jacob, partner at Keker, Van Nest & Peters LLP. “Today we filed a lawsuit to put an end to his order, and the agency guidance implementing it.”

“This administration is unlawfully targeting military families by denying essential care to their transgender children,” said Liam Brown, an associate with Keker, Van Nest & Peters. “We will not stand by while those who serve are stripped of the ability to care for their families.”

The Trump administration has waged a relentless assault on transgender Americans, issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders—now facing multiple federal lawsuits—designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them any legal recognition.

Patients who experienced Scr doubling were significantly more likely to have hypertension (50% vs 20.3%; P =.044), acute kidney injury (38.5% vs 11.9%; P =.018), or low complement C3 levels (73.3% vs 41.4%; P =.025) at diagnosis. This subgroup also had a lower mean baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; 72.6 vs 97.0 mL/min/1.73 m²; P =.004), but proteinuria at diagnosis did not differ significantly between groups.

Clinical course diverged substantially depending on remission status. Patients without Scr doubling were significantly more likely to achieve complete remission (55.6% vs 7.7%; P =.002), UPCR less than 1 g/g (81.3% vs 33.3%; P =.001), or UPCR less than 0.5 g/g (59.4% vs 8.3%; P =.001) within 1 year of diagnosis. Partial remission was not protective. Complete remission was defined as UPCR less than 0.5 g/g and eGFR within 15% of baseline within 1 year of treatment initiation. Partial remission was defined as reduction in UPCR by 50% to at least less than 3 g/g, and eGFR within 15% of baseline.

In contrast, patients who experienced Scr doubling were significantly more likely to progress to proliferative lupus nephritis (18.8% vs 3.5%; P =.018), develop end-stage kidney disease (25% vs 0%; P <.001), or die (6.3% vs 0%; P =.021).

Kaplan-Meier analysis reinforced that Scr doubling-free survival was higher in patients achieving complete remission, UPCR less than 1 g/g, or UPCR less than 0.5 g/g. Multivariable logistic regression confirmed these protective effects after adjusting for age, race, and baseline renal function.

Complete remission (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.75), UPCR less than 1 g/g (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.59), and UPCR less than 0.5 g/g (OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01-0.69) at 1 year were each significantly associated with decreased odds of Scr doubling, even after adjustment for immunosuppressive treatment.

No differences in renal outcomes were observed by histopathology. The investigators could not determine individual effects of therapeutic agents likely due to the small sample size.

These results highlight the prognostic value of remission and proteinuria reduction as therapeutic benchmarks in pure MLN. While the retrospective design and modest sample size are study limitations, this analysis provides much-needed clarity on long-term outcomes in MLN, a subgroup often underrepresented in lupus nephritis research. Notably, patients were not censored at the time of transitioning from MLN to proliferative disease.

“Overall, our study provides data to better assess prognosis at MLN diagnosis and suggests that patients with MLN should receive treatment with the minimal goal of achieving less than 1 gm proteinuria, if not a [complete response],” Dr Olson’s team concluded. “Future MLN specific trials are required to determine the optimal treatment strategy to achieve this goal.”",https://www.renalandurologynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2024/12/Renal-Urology.png,N,0.0,2025-09-08 13:56:25.378710

“We play a combat support role at AFHSD, and we are responsible for protecting the Joint Force,” said Navy Capt. Richard Langton, chief of AFHSD. “We carry out our assigned duties through retrospective, near real-time, and prospective health surveillance — in a nutshell, full-spectrum health surveillance.”

AFHSD is a public health component of the DHA and the U.S. military’s central public health entity. The division focuses on global health surveillance, providing operational forces with early warning, health threat assessments, and force-readiness data.

The division is organized into three branches: Epidemiology and Analysis, Global Emerging Infections Surveillance, and Integrated Biosurveillance.

AFHSD is the central repository of medical surveillance data for the armed forces. This is done through technical infrastructure, expertise in database management for the Defense Medical Surveillance System and related applications, and operations, and management of the Department of Defense Serum Repository.

The DMSS houses current and historical data on diseases and medical events. These include hospitalizations, ambulatory visits, reportable medical events, laboratory tests, immunizations, periodic and deployment-related health assessments, and casualty data affecting service members throughout their military careers. It contains billions of data records on service members and other Military Health System beneficiaries.

Leveraging data to manage seasonal respiratory illnesses

The AFHSD uses this wealth of data to analyze and anticipate potential threats.

“AFHSD plays a key role in integrating biosurveillance efforts by collecting data and information in near real-time of the threats from endemic diseases and emerging infectious diseases relevant to the military worldwide,” said Juan I. Ubiera, chief of the IB branch. “IB also conducts forecasting analytics to predict and communicate seasonal respiratory illnesses threats.”

This surveillance information enables weekly trend analysis and situation reports on seasonal respiratory illnesses. It also includes a report on respiratory illness activity on and around selected installations, to assist senior leaders in making decisions regarding resource and personnel distribution.

IB also supports early warnings and monitoring of various syndromes, including respiratory illnesses at military hospitals and clinics, communicated through the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community Based Epidemics, or ESSENCE. This program, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, allows public health professionals to analyze events of public health interest, monitor health care data for events that could affect public health, and share data and analyses.

Raising awareness with the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report

The AFHSD disseminates important biosurveillance information through a peer-reviewed journal, the Medical Surveillance Monthly Report.

“The MSMR publishes summaries of notifiable diseases, trends of illnesses of special interest, and field reports describing outbreaks and case occurrences,” said Shauna Stahlman, senior epidemiologist in the E&A branch.

“Launched in 1995, the journal provides evidence-based estimates of the incidence, distribution, impact, and trends of illness and injuries among U.S. military service members and associated populations,” she said.

According to Stahlman, the MSMR publishes “pertinent articles on military public health, epidemiology, surveillance, and disease and injury prevention, continuously evaluating manuscript submissions for scientific accuracy.”

“The journal reports present data, public health information, and original research with direct relevance to the operational fitness of military members or MHS beneficiaries' health, safety, and well-being,” she added.

Future of biosurveillance

Each branch has specific goals in their continuing efforts to meet the needs of service members and other MHS beneficiaries.

“The E&A branch’s goal is to be flexible, responsive, and predictive to our customers by releasing accurate, timely, and actionable surveillance data, and leveraging partnerships and networks within and outside of DHA public health to better predict and respond to their needs,” said Stahlman.

“In addition, we also aim to reduce the spread of medical misinformation and disinformation, which were identified as potential vulnerabilities for biodefense in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review,” she noted.

The GEIS branch is expanding capabilities for pathogen-agnostic genomic sequencing, a method for detecting unknown pathogens to determine the cause of an illness, and wastewater surveillance, said June Early, deputy chief of the GEIS branch. “The future development, implementation, and expansion of these capabilities will enable a more comprehensive understanding of infectious disease threats.”

“Also, our respiratory infections focus area oversees the coordination of the DOD global influenza vaccine effectiveness analysis,” said Early. “These analyses directly inform selection and composition of the following season’s northern hemisphere influenza vaccine.”

The IB branch is enhancing biosurveillance early warning content and information dissemination on the Health Surveillance Explorer, the DHA’s mapping application that provides near real-time integrated global health surveillance information for force health protection.

“We are increasing syndromic surveillance capabilities through collaborative partnerships with additional states,” said Ubiera. “IB is working with combatant commands and services to provide tailored biosurveillance information. We are also working to expand global biosurveillance capabilities by working with partner nations and allies to exchange information. This is one of the reform initiatives established in the 2023 Biodefense Posture Review.”

Capturing the high ground in health surveillance

Military public health surveillance is vital in detecting and mitigating emerging health threats, Langton said.

“We’re very proud of the capabilities we already bring to the fight. But future success requires us to move beyond the current state,” he said. “The task before us is to capture the high ground in health surveillance. We are meeting that head-on by adopting new capabilities and tapping into the unique capabilities of our partners to create synergies that endure and allow us to dominate the health surveillance space.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2308/7999800/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-08 13:56:29.916144

The privately-operated aged care and retirement living provider originally sought to modify a May 2007 development consent for 84 independent living units, 94 supported living units and a 67-bed high care facility on the coastal site, 124km from Brisbane and 819km from Sydney.

That application was refused by Tweed Shire Council in July 2021. TriCare has since opted to pursue a new SSD development consent to complete the project.

From old approvals to new demand

The May 2007 approval was secured by another provider before TriCare purchased the site. Over time, the project has received a number of modified consents for minor amendments.

Stage One – comprising 91 independent living units across three three-storey buildings with basement car parks – was completed and occupied in 2009.

A new Scoping Report by Planit Consultancy, submitted on behalf of TriCare, outlines a redesign that the company says better reflects today’s seniors living market. The updated proposal includes:

74 additional supported living units

44 residential aged care beds

New communal facilities, including an indoor pool and bowls green

Increased on-site car parking and improved site accessibility

“These measures facilitate an ability for seniors residents to comfortably stay in their homes for longer, which is reflected in contemporary market expectations for individual suites, private space, and facilities of greater proportions,” the report states.

Bill S. 2239, titled the ""Improving Access to Prenatal Care for Military Families Act,"" proposes the establishment of a pilot program by the Department of Defense to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event for enrollment in TRICARE Select. This legislative proposal aims to facilitate better access to health care services for military families by offering an inclusive framework for enrollment driven by the occurrence of pregnancy.

[b]Main Focus and Key Objectives[/b]

The central objective of the Bill is to provide a mechanism that allows eligible beneficiaries to enroll in TRICARE Select during pregnancy, categorized as a qualifying event. The proposal underlines the need to adapt healthcare benefits to the specific needs of military personnel and their families, thus enhancing prenatal care access. The Bill signifies a commitment to supporting military families by recognizing pregnancy as an important trigger for healthcare enrollment adjustments.

[b]Pilot Program Establishment[/b]

The Bill mandates the commencement of a five-year pilot program not later than 180 days after its enactment. Under this program, the Secretary of Defense is instructed to treat pregnancy as a qualifying event as outlined in section 1099(b)(1)(B) of Title 10, United States Code. This provision applies to TRICARE Select enrollment by an eligible beneficiary, aiming to streamline and facilitate access to necessary prenatal healthcare services.

[b]Initial Briefing and Reporting Requirements[/b]

Within one year after enacting the Bill, the Secretary of Defense is required to deliver a briefing to the appropriate congressional committees regarding the status of the pilot program. This ensures continuous oversight and evaluation of the program's implementation and efficacy. Subsequently, an annual report is mandated, with the first submission due one year after the program's commencement. These reports will provide data on enrollment changes influenced by the pilot program, with disaggregated statistics by month and specific circumstances leading to such changes, including pregnancy as a qualifying event.

[b]Definitions and Relevant Terms[/b]

The Bill includes clear definitions of terms vital to the understanding and implementation of its provisions. ""Active duty"" follows the meaning set forth in section 101(d) of Title 10, United States Code. ""Appropriate congressional committees"" encompass the Committee on Armed Services of both the Senate and House, in addition to other relevant committees in the House of Representatives. The terms ""covered enrollment change,"" ""dependent,"" ""TRICARE Select,"" ""eligible beneficiary,"" and ""uniformed services"" are also defined according to the United States Code.

[b]Noteworthy Provisions[/b]

A significant aspect of the Bill is its emphasis on treating pregnancy as a notable qualifying event for health coverage adjustments, addressing potential barriers to timely access to prenatal care for the military community. The proposed pilot program serves as both an innovative and responsive measure to the unique demands faced by those serving in the armed forces and their dependents. Through systematic reporting and oversight, the Bill ensures that informed decisions are made regarding the future of such healthcare initiatives.

This Bill engages actively with the need to improve health care accessibility for military families, placing particular importance on adaptability to personal circumstances like pregnancy, thus reflecting a comprehensive approach to personnel welfare and family support within the military framework....",Not Available,"https://4a4c3a29ba9d1a23d3f6651fb46d2f54.cdn.bubble.io/cdn-cgi/image/w=,h=,f=auto,dpr=1,fit=contain/f1708896951335x142739689930226020/CodifyLogo1.png",N,0.0,2025-09-08 12:56:15.493741
