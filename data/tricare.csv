What You Need to Know: The White House has released a sweeping AI action plan outlining more than 90 policy actions, prioritizing responsible deployment of AI in health care. CMA and AMA are calling for the plan to incorporate stronger physician leadership, robust privacy protections, and safeguards to prevent bias and patient harm.

The White House recently unveiled its artificial intelligence (AI) action plan identifying more than 90 recommended changes in federal policy that the administration will pursue in the coming weeks and months. The plan is built on three pillars: accelerating innovation, building AI infrastructure, and leading in international diplomacy and security.

The administration emphasized its commitment to the responsible development and deployment of augmented intelligence – often called artificial intelligence – to improve health outcomes.

Key elements of the administration’s plan, include commitments to:

Build public and professional trust through transparent, ethical oversight.

Accelerate national standards for safety, performance, and interoperability – with strong physician representation.

Create a coordinated federal regulatory approach to close gaps and reduce duplication.

Invest in workforce education and upskilling to support safe adoption.

Promote “secure-by-design” AI systems to protect health infrastructure.

The American Medical Association (AMA) is urging the Trump administration to devote more attention to several key areas, including:

Ensuring meaningful physician leadership in shaping AI policy, regulation and implementation.

Strengthening patient privacy protections – especially in open-data and open-source environments.

Establishing clear liability frameworks to address physician concerns and appropriately assign accountability for AI errors and performance issues.

Addressing equity and bias to prevent patient harm and avoid worsening health disparities.

Adopting a whole-of-government approach, including states, to ensure balanced and consistent regulatory oversight.

The California Medical Association (CMA) is committed to ensuring that AI enhances, rather than undermines, the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship, and recently a CMA-sponsored landmark bill to ensure human oversight and patient safety are core components for the use of AI in health care settings was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. As AI-enabled tools become more common in both clinical care and administrative functions, it is critical that they are designed, developed and deployed in ways that are ethical, equitable, transparent and evidence-based.

CMA has also raised concerns that AI – whether in the form of diagnostic algorithms, health plan decision-making tools, or patient-facing chatbots – must not interfere with physician medical judgment or limit patient access to care. Strong policy safeguards are essential to ensure that these technologies support, not replace, clinical expertise, and that their use is clearly communicated to both physicians and patients.

CMA will be closely tracking how the administration’s AI policy agenda unfolds and will continue to advocate for strong safeguards that protect patients, uphold physician judgment and advance equitable care.",https://www.cmadocs.org/Portals/CMA/Images/Newsroom%20Icons/federal-issues.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-12 14:56:16.924551

Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so.

Additionally, veterans may have been exposed to depleted uranium from vehicles or being wounded by a fragment containing depleted uranium.","The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs continue to work closely together to address military-related toxic material/environmental exposures from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars through the VA’s 2014 Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry. In June 2025, the Defense Health Agency added new training requirements for healthcare providers on toxic exposures and burn pits.

On Aug. 1, 2024, the VA launched a redesigned registry after extensive feedback showing veterans found it too challenging to enroll in the program. The new registry helps inform effort to improve benefits as part of the PACT Act of 2022, also known as the “Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act.”

The VA and the DOD also expanded PACT Act benefits and VA health care for service members and veterans who served in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, as well as related operations in Iraq, the war on terrorism, and the Vietnam War.

Key updates to the registry include:

• Automatic enrollment of more than 4.7 million veterans and service members who meet the expanded eligibility criteria based on DOD manpower and deployment records

• Information from all military-exposure databases

• Removal of a 144-question survey required to participate in the registry

• Establishment of an easy opt-out process for enrollees

New Training Required

The new DHA training is for healthcare providers at all military hospitals and clinics. It’s called the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Overview.” The training is in accordance with the requirements of Section 725 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.

Under the guidance, healthcare providers must complete the one-hour Joint Knowledge Online training course if they have not already done so. It also requires providers to review the “Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry DoD Health Care Provider Clinical Toolbox.”

Provider Training Updates

The updated training includes expanded information about:

• AHOBPR eligibility criteria and the new auto-enrollment process

• Clinical content such as recommended diagnostic codes and how to manage patient encounters related to airborne hazards and open burn pit exposures

• Information about the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, and new information on the Military Health Systems’ Periodic Occupational and Environmental Monitoring Summary. Both the web-based ILER and the monitoring summaries of POEMS track and manage exposure data.

For medical personnel seeking more information on deployment-related environmental exposures, continuing education-eligible training is offered by the VA’s War Related Illness and Injury Study Center.

The resource contains:

• Background information on airborne hazards and the registry

• Guidance for conducting a medical evaluation associated with environmental exposure concerns

• Resources for providers to review and share with service members and other healthcare providers to improve health outcomes for those exposed

Educational materials regarding military exposures are regularly updated, so providers should plan to check in for any changes in guidance.

Related Illnesses

In addition to burn pits, oil well fires, smoke, sand, dust, the mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air (particulate matter), and regional pollution from the climate and environment, the VA links nine infectious diseases to military service in Southwest Asia.

About OPMED OPMED is the DOD’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, focused on enhancing warfighter lethality and readiness.","The Operational Medical Systems Program Management Office is known for its support of America’s warfighters. The key to the team’s success is summed up in one word: delivery.

OPMED PMO, part of the Defense Health Agency, is the go-to element within the Department of Defense for developing, acquiring, and delivering world-class treatment solutions for the U.S. joint force while leveraging its reputation as the heart of modernized frontline medical support.

Recently, OPMED’s Warfighter Protection and Acute Care team members made good on years of effort in blood product development, delivering to meet the unique needs of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. WRNMMC, the nation’s flagship military medical center, is also known as “the President’s Hospital,” thanks to its longstanding tradition of caring for members of the Executive Branch.

Working with industry partner Octapharma and several DOD partners – including the Armed Services Blood Program; Medical Readiness Command, Europe; U.S. European and Africa Commands; Andrews Medical Support Squadron at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland; and the Armed Services Blood Bank Center – WPAC coordinated and facilitated the procurement and delivery of freeze-dried plasma (FDP) for inclusion in Walter Reed’s medical supply.

FDP is a lifesaving treatment option for blood replacement therapies in operational and tactical environments. Octapharma and WPAC collaborated to obtain Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization approval for the FDP known as octaplasLG Powder in August 2024. The EUA authorizes military procurement, storage, and use of octaplasLG Powder when no other FDA-approved treatments, like fresh frozen plasma, are available, or when the use of traditional plasma is not practical in a compressed time continuum during some military operations, according to Kendra Lawrence, Ph.D., WPAC’s project manager.

“The FDP program is our highest priority and is delivering a transformative medical solution to meet the needs of our military end users: the medical providers on the front lines,” said Lawrence. “To be able to collaborate with the Armed Services Blood Program and Armed Services Blood Bank Center to provide this critical capability at the highest levels of the U.S. government is a testament to the importance of FDP in critical care situations when no other alternative is available.”

Last month, the WPAC team, along with representatives from Octapharma, provided training to key WRNMMC medical staff on the reconstitution and safe use of FDP during emergency treatment. Lawrence said the training event was well received, and the medical staff has indicated a need for continued training for both current and new personnel.

WPAC has a wide portfolio, and its product managers develop, test, field, and sustain innovative medical solutions to address high-priority capability gaps for DOD medical providers in clinical and deployed environments. FDP is a notable recent success with broad applicability in both military and civilian health care, according to Andy Atkinson, the FDP product manager with WPAC.

“FDP is a shelf-stable blood product that was developed with the military end user in mind – it is specifically designed to be used during an emergency involving agents of military combat,” said Atkinson. “Our goal was to develop and acquire a capability that fills a critical gap in combat casualty care for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and special forces communities.

“Providing this treatment to the expert providers at ‘the President’s Hospital’ is a unique and very important step in the project’s development, and we are honored to have helped play a role,” he added.

Walter Reed General Hospital opened in 1909 and tended to numerous U.S. presidents and injured service members in Washington, D.C. In 2011, the Army hospital was merged with the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to form the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. In addition to providing medical evaluation and treatment to presidents, members of Congress, and other high-ranking officials, Walter Reed provides health care for our nation’s fighting forces, retirees, and their families.

About OPMED

OPMED is the DOD’s leading force in medical development and acquisition, focused on enhancing warfighter lethality and readiness. Project managers with the team develop and deliver next-generation, world-class medical capabilities that empower combatant commanders for large scale combat operations, particularly within austere environments, with a twofold mission: save lives on the battlefield and swiftly return injured service members to duty.

When a family member passes away, it can feel overwhelming to deal with paperwork on top of the emotional burden. This article provides a few steps you should take in the weeks following your family member’s death. Taking these steps can help ensure your coverage continues without interruption.

“After losing a family member, your health coverage may not be the first thing on your mind,” said Zelly Zim, senior analyst, TRICARE Policy and Programs at the Defense Health Agency. “But it’s important to understand how your loved one’s death may affect your TRICARE coverage, so you’re prepared for your family’s future.”

A death in the family is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. This means that surviving family members have 90 days to make eligible health plan changes, as described in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet. Here’s what else you need to know.

Reporting the death

If your sponsor dies

You only have to report the death to the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, Express Scripts. For medical and dental care, the Defense Manpower Data Center gets information from the Social Security Administration or the sponsor’s service.

It may take some time for DMDC to get the information. If you prefer, you may notify DMDC of the death by:

Visiting a local Uniformed Services ID card office with a copy of the death certificate

Faxing a copy of the death certificate to 800-336-4416

Mailing a copy of the death certificate to:

DMDC/DEERS Support Office

400 Gigling Road

Seaside, CA 93955-6771

If your sponsor was retired, there are other steps you need to take depending on their service.

If another family member dies

If a family member who wasn’t the sponsor dies, contact the DMDC/DEERS Support Office to learn the necessary steps to report their death. Depending on your situation, your health plan options may also change from family to individual.

Coverage following the death

TRICARE continues to provide coverage for surviving family members. Plans and costs depend on:

If you're a spouse or a child:

Spouses can keep TRICARE unless they remarry. If a spouse decides to remarry, their TRICARE coverage will end unless they marry another active duty or retired service member.

Children can keep TRICARE up to normal age limits. After that, if they qualify for TRICARE Young Adult, they can purchase TYA coverage if their sponsor had TRICARE at the time of their death.

The sponsor's military status when they died:

Active duty: Children and spouses are considered transitional survivors for the first three years after the sponsor dies. Transitional survivors are eligible for special programs like the Extended Care Health Option. Spouses are covered as active duty family members (unless they remarry) for these three years. Then, they’re covered as retired family members. Children remain covered as ADFMs until they age out or lose TRICARE eligibility for other reasons.

Retired: Your health plan options and costs won’t change. Surviving spouses remain eligible unless they remarry. Children remain covered until they age out or lose eligibility for other reasons.

National Guard or Reserve member: Your sponsor’s status at the time of their death determines your TRICARE benefits. Visit Survivors of National Guard and Reserve Members to read more about your specific situation. (Note: Beginning Oct. 1, 2025, you can buy or continue coverage for up to three years from the date of the sponsor’s death. This is if your sponsor had TRICARE coverage at the time of their death.)

Filing claims

If you need to file a claim on behalf of the deceased, check out Filing Claims for forms and instructions.

For TRICARE For Life beneficiaries, you need to submit the TRICARE For Life Executor/Executrix of Estate Notification with the claim.

For beneficiaries with all other plans, submit an Authorization for Disclosure of Medical or Dental Information (DD Form 2870) with the claim.

To learn more

If you have questions about this process, call the DMDC/DEERS Support Office at 800-538-9552 (TTY/TDD: 866-363-2883).

If you have a young adult in your family who no longer qualifies for coverage under active-duty service members due to age, you may want to consider encouraging them to enroll in TRICARE Young Adult. It can cover a multitude of treatment options, which can save thousands in the long run.

Under the Affordable Care Act, all insurance companies are mandated to cover both substance use issues and mental health concerns the same way they treat medical issues. These core issues are considered one of the ten essential health benefits that cannot be denied.

That being said, active duty family members who have aged out may still have to cover some costs with TRICARE-authorized providers. But you can get help managing prescription drugs, residential treatment plans, and more.

Managing Out-of-Pocket Costs with Your TRICARE Plan

You want the best treatment centers for a young adult: ones that are knowledgeable about the unique needs and experiences of those who are underage or just past the cusp of adulthood. The problem for many families is that they must figure out how to manage out-of-pocket costs.

What will you be responsible for when it comes to residential treatment options and TRICARE coverage?

If you choose a TRICARE network provider, it’s possible that the cost of your young adult’s treatment may be covered in full. While they require a pre-authorization for many hospitalization services, family members can rest easier knowing that an approved facility is safe and financially feasible.

On the other hand, you may choose an out-of-network provider for a lot of different reasons. If this is the case, then you may have more cost-sharing responsibilities in the form of copayments for care or money paid toward your deductible.

We help all insurance holders, whether you have TRICARE Reserve Select, TRICARE Young Adult, or TRICARE Retired Reserve.","Finding Alcohol and Drug Treatment With TRICARE Reserve Select

If you are looking for help, whether for yourself or a loved one, you likely know that mental health services and substance abuse treatments can be difficult to find and access without excessive costs, no matter which of the major insurance providers you have.

But as a member of the Armed Forces or an Armed Forces family, one of the perks of a military career is access to TRICARE insurance coverage. But does TRICARE Reserve Select cover addiction treatment?

Fortunately, the ACA mandates that all insurance companies cover substance abuse help as one of their essential health benefits, and TRICARE is no different. It covers medically necessary treatment for all alcohol and drug use, from inpatient to outpatient care. In-network providers not only have a lower cost, but are required for TRICARE holders in many instances.

At TricareRehabs.com, we can help you find the perfect placement for your mental health and substance use issues while getting the most out of your insurance coverage. Here’s what you need to know about finding services for Reserve Select clients.

TRICARE Reserve Select Rehab Coverage and Treatment Options

Facing substance abuse on your own is challenging at best. Most people who struggle with addiction will require professional help at some level. What does your TRICARE insurance plan cover when you find yourself in need of inpatient and outpatient treatment centers?

The good news is that addiction treatment is covered by TRICARE as long as it is psychologically or medically necessary. If a medical professional can prove that you are in need of treatment centers to get sober, then it is likely that TRICARE Reserve Select coverage will help.

This is part and parcel of the changes made to insurance plans with the Affordable Care Act in 2010. All insurance companies were mandated to cover the essential health benefits, including substance abuse and mental health services. TRICARE is no exception to this executive order.

When you’re ready to seek help for your addiction, what can you expect to be covered by TRICARE insurance?

Drug and Alcohol Detox Covered by TRICARE Reserve Select Insurance

The first stage of treatment for substance abuse usually requires a residential treatment program with a specific detox option. During these early stages of recovery, you could require medical help to stabilize your condition. One of the best options is medication-assisted treatment.

This is typically best administered when you can be under around-the-clock care by a team within the relative safety of a medical program. When you seek treatment, the hospital or your primary care doctor might refer you to this intensive level of care before offering you inpatient and outpatient rehab.

Inpatient Rehab as a Step Down from Detox

Detox programs naturally transition to inpatient rehab care, where you have 24/7 access to counselors and other staff members who help you learn to navigate life without drugs. It’s not as intensive as your detox program, but it can still be quite expensive if not covered by TRICARE.

As long as you continue to make progress and need this level of care, TRICARE Reserve Select typically covers residential treatment facilities for your care. Only once you are stabilized will they help transition you to an outpatient program that suits your needs.

Outpatient Treatment at a TRICARE Rehab

After transitioning from residential treatment centers, outpatient is usually the next logical step. Your TRICARE insurance will likely pay for two types of outpatient treatment for your substance abuse or mental health condition: partial hospitalization programs and intensive outpatient programs.

Partial Hospitalization Programs for More Intensive Help

Partial hospitalization programs are the first step down from inpatient rehab. You’ll spend the majority of the day in treatment centers while returning to sleep in your own bed at night. TRICARE covers this for a brief period of time, depending on how much progress you make and medical necessity.

PHP programs give you an opportunity to practice new skills while still making the best use of all of the evidence-based treatments you found in inpatient care.

Intensive Outpatient Programs to Transition Out of Rehab

Once withdrawal symptoms are under control and inpatient treatment is no longer required, intensive outpatient rehab is often the next best thing. You’ll spend a few hours each day attending treatment in the form of one-on-one therapy and group therapy sessions.

Then, you’re free to leave to return to work or spend time with loved ones. You can start building your bridge back to your everyday life piece by piece. This is the first step toward traditional outpatient care with individual therapy several days each week, coupled with community-based resources like Twelve Step meetings.

Where to Find Treatment Providers with TRICARE Reserve Health Insurance

The good news is that an addiction treatment plan is possible for those with a TRICARE insurance plan, including Reserve Select. With this type of plan, clients receive the freedom to choose where they want to receive help. While some plans limit you to in-network providers, TRICARE Reserve Select allows you to go anywhere.

An in-network provider might warrant comprehensive coverage for inpatient and outpatient rehab care. An out-of-network provider may be covered in part but have more out-of-pocket costs associated with them in the long run. The choice is yours to find treatment options that work for you and your family.

When you need substance abuse treatments, it helps to know that TRICARE covers drug and alcohol addiction as well as the skills you need to function in everyday life. They will help you locate all of the resources you need for evidence-based therapies to help you take steps toward sobriety.

,,2025-08-12 13:37:57+00:00,The Michigan Independent,"VA proposes ban on abortion services for veterans, including in cases of rape and incest",Not Available,,,,,https://michiganindependent.com/reproductive_rights/va-ban-on-abortion-services-veterans-including-cases-of-rape-and-incest/,"The United States Department of Veterans Affairs is proposing a ban on all abortion services for veterans who receive care through the VA health care system, including in cases of rape or incest.
“We take this action to ensure that VA provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families,” the notice said.
Opponents argue the ban would affect the reproductive health care of veterans by possibly delaying needed care, particularly those living in states with abortion bans.
In 2024, over 50,000 women veterans enrolled in the VA medical health care, a 20% increase, the largest in enrollment on record, according to VA News.
Under the section listing proposed reforms to the Veterans Health Administration, the document reads: “Rescind all departmental clinical policy directives that are contrary to principles of conservative governance, starting with abortion services and gender reassignment surgery.","The United States Department of Veterans Affairs is proposing a ban on all abortion services for veterans who receive care through the VA health care system, including in cases of rape or incest.

According to a notice published in the Federal Register on Aug. 4, the proposal would remove abortion and abortion counseling from the list of services covered under both the VA’s medical benefits and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

“We take this action to ensure that VA provides only needed medical services to our nation’s heroes and their families,” the notice said.

Opponents argue the ban would affect the reproductive health care of veterans by possibly delaying needed care, particularly those living in states with abortion bans. In 2024, over 50,000 women veterans enrolled in the VA medical health care, a 20% increase, the largest in enrollment on record, according to VA News.

“If someone is in the VA system, that’s where they’re getting their care, and something goes wrong with their pregnancy, if they’re not even allowed to be counseled about their options, that is literally malpractice,” said Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, an obstetrician-gynecologist and CEO of the nonprofit, and nonpartisan reproductive health organization Power to Decide.

“I work and see patients in Baltimore, Maryland. I see a lot of patients who rely on TRICARE and who have been in and out of the VA system. And those people are often, you know, many of them want to get pregnant. Many of them do get pregnant and then face complications during their pregnancy, and they deserve to have the best standard of care, including counseling about all their options whenever there is a case of something that could go wrong,” McDonald-Mosley said.

According to a 2023 study from the nonprofit National Partnership for Women and Families, over 400,000 veterans live in states with abortion bans.

Reporting from Military.com concluded that 88 abortions were provided by the VA in 2023, 64 of which were necessary due to the health of the pregnant person.

The proposal claims the VA will continue to allow abortions in cases where a pregnant person’s life is in danger. But, Jackii Wang, senior legislative analyst at National Women’s Law Center, told the American Independent that exceptions to abortion bans can be complicated and can put a patient’s life at risk.

“We have seen plenty of cases of women dying because their care was delayed for too long. I think the bottom line here is that it’s a really cruel decision from an administration that purports to support veterans and those who served,” Wang said. “We believe that everyone deserves access to abortion care, but if we’re talking about veterans in particular who’ve served this country, it’s a huge slap in the face to everything that they have done.”

The proposed measure from the VA would undo an interim final ruling issued by former President Joe Biden’s administration in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that reversed Roe v. Wade.

The Biden-era ruling allowed the VA to provide abortion services to veterans if “determined needed by a health care professional, when the life or the health of the pregnant veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term or the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.”

Rescinding Biden’s rule was also a directive in Project 2025, a document published by the conservative Heritage Foundation and co-authored by anti-abortion organizations, such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, and members of Trump’s first and second administrations.

Under the section listing proposed reforms to the Veterans Health Administration, the document reads:

“Rescind all departmental clinical policy directives that are contrary to principles of conservative governance, starting with abortion services and gender reassignment surgery. Neither aligns with service-connected conditions that would warrant VA’s providing this type of clinical care, and both follow the Left’s pernicious trend of abusing the role of government to further its own agenda.”

Lindsay Church, the executive director and co-founder of Minority Veterans of America, said their membership, mostly made up of women and people of reproductive age, feels the proposal directly impacts them. Church pointed out that survivors of sexual assault in the military are upset over the lack of an exception in the policy for rape survivors.

“That’s deeply insulting, considering the unique circumstances in which our community lives, which is that we live at the intersections of the Department of Defense, military-industrial complex,” Church said. “That means that many of us are survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment in the military, and this is deeply personal, because some survivors in the Department of Defense even receive care at the Department of Veterans Affairs.”

According to an annual report from the U.S. Department of Defense, there were 8,195 reports of sexual assault in 2024

“This is not just a theoretical anti-abortion move; this is directly impacting people’s lives, and given that so much of our community, the largest states for veterans are places like Texas and Florida, places with really regressive abortion policies,” Church said.

“If you are sexually assaulted in the state of Texas, and you try to access care at the Department of Veterans Affairs, you would have to go to New Mexico to access that care,” they said. “That seems unjust given the unique circumstances of our community. Not even having a basic, very basic, and very, even regressive exceptions policy is insulting to the people who have worn the uniform to fight for people’s rights.”

Church’s partner, a civilian, became pregnant in 2022, after the Dobbs decision. At around six weeks into the pregnancy, the couple, who were living in Virginia at the time, learned that the fetus had a fetal abnormality. At 16 weeks, the couple were told that the fetus was not producing amniotic fluid, a fatal diagnosis.

“We pursued compassionate termination, because there was just not a great hope for them. We accessed care at a Richmond reproductive health clinic where we were called ‘baby killers,’” Church said, adding that under the Biden-era policy, their wife would have had the abortion care through the Civilian Health and Medical Program, which would not be allowed under the Trump administration’s proposal.

This suggests that the stock price has the potential to continue declining, with sellers dominating the market and bearish momentum likely to persist.

American Well Corp (AMWL), a leading telehealth solutions provider, reported its second-quarter 2025 results on August 5, 2025. The company exceeded analyst expectations with GAAP revenue of $70.9 million, up 11.7% compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven primarily by a significant increase in software subscription revenue [1].

The company also reported a notable improvement in adjusted EBITDA loss, which narrowed to $(4.7 million) in Q2 2025, marking an 86.6% year-over-year improvement compared to Q2 2024 [1]. Gross margin expanded to 56.1% in Q2 2025, reflecting the company's focus on high-margin revenue streams [1].

American Well's full-year revenue guidance for FY2025 was revised downward to a range of $245 million to $250 million, reflecting the divestiture of its psychiatric care segment [1]. Despite this adjustment, the company maintained a strong focus on strategic execution, securing new client wins such as Florida Blue and extending its contract with the Defense Health Agency (DHA) [1].

However, the company noted persistent risks, including ongoing declines in visit volumes and the importance of the DHA contract for long-term stability [1]. For Q3 2025, American Well expects revenue to be between $53 million and $56 million, with adjusted EBITDA loss (non-GAAP) anticipated to widen sequentially [1].

Investors should keep an eye on the pace of platform adoption, the outcome of government contract renewals, and continued improvement in profit metrics as American Well navigates the rapidly evolving telehealth sector [1].

August 12, 2025 | The pharma industry excels at collaborating with startup companies and scaling up the production of drugs and biologics, but they may be missing the big-picture perspective of the U.S. government as well as some of the cutting-edge research happening within academia. It’s a problematic norm that needs addressing if artificial intelligence (AI) is to benefit drug discovery and diagnostics as well as healthcare delivery in terms of safety, equity, and effectiveness, according to Shruthi Bharadwaj, Ph.D., program leader at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, an R&D center funded largely by the Department of Defense (DOD).

To that end, Bharadwaj will take to the stage at the upcoming Discovery on Target (DOT) conference in Boston to moderate a discussion about how to balance innovation, regulation, and real-world impact of AI in the life sciences and healthcare. At the table there will be representatives from industry, academia, and the federal government to discover and explore all the potential synergies, she says.

Joining her on the panel will be Nimita Limaye, Ph.D., research vice president for life sciences R&D strategy and technology at International Data Corporation (IDC); Sherri Cherry, MBA, deputy chief information officer at the Defense Health Agency (part of the Veterans Health Administration); Raquel Mura, PharmD, founder of RGM Life Sciences Consulting and former vice president and head of R&D North America at Sanofi; and William Streilein, Ph.D., principal staff with the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Fostering Change

Bharadwaj, who has a pharmaceutical biology background, recently joined MIT after working for two major pharmaceutical companies—first Novartis and later Sanofi—to head a team focused on leveraging AI for drug discovery. The Lincoln Laboratory has frequently convened multi-stakeholder groups to foster needed change in the way AI is viewed and deployed for the common good, she notes.

Her focus currently is an initiative seeking to understand how AI can be leveraged to predict the characteristics of drug molecules, which may in the future help the Food and Drug Administration better assess the safety and effectiveness of candidate medicines, she says. The work is supported by an unnamed but non-DOD government agency.

Outside of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Bharadwaj wears a few different hats. These include serving as an advisor to the Cancer Fund, an early-stage impact venture capital (VC) firm, by helping to evaluate startup proposals “for my own personal happiness,” she says.

Additionally, Bharadwaj is an entrepreneur-in-residence at the Technology Innovation Studio (Cambridge, Massachusetts) that brings together business leaders, scientists and researchers, serial entrepreneurs, angel/VC investors, industry experts, corporate innovation teams, and policy experts to pursue fresh approaches to problems. And for Nucleate, a student-led organization helping startups spin out of academia, she provides guidance on the development of pitch decks and connects researchers with potential sponsors or VCs.

Military Health

The Defense Health Agency, for its part, is keyed in on how AI might benefit the healthcare of veterans, Bharadwaj says, for example the diagnosis of mental health conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide ideation, and depression. The possibilities include AI-assisted vocal analysis, predictive analytics to identify at-risk individuals, and the analysis of physiological data from wearables as well as text and language patterns.

Cherry is a strong advocate for women’s health, which may not yet have a use case for AI but is what connected her to Bharadwaj. What sparked their initial conversation was Bharadwaj’s interest in ensuring women are considered when creating strategies for increasing the overall effectiveness of the military, since 20% of service members are female.

Equity is clearly a challenge in the miliary, Bharadwaj says. The MIT Lincoln Laboratory is now working with a company to address some of these situations.

The inequities are many and extend to military uniforms that are designed for the height and size of men, she adds. Women generally don’t share the same general body build and proportions, meaning their comfort and morale as well as their safety and effectiveness in the field may be negatively affected.

AI-guided Pipeline

Many pharma companies are “pushing forward with AI or at least leveraging AI to some extent,” says Bharadwaj, which certainly includes both of her former employers. “Sanofi has been all in with AI for the last three years now,” aided by the 2023 hiring of venture capitalist and cardiology-trained Houman Ashrafian as its new head of R&D.

Since then, Sanofi’s strategic vision has focused more on being “an immunoscience company that’s powered by AI,” Bharadwaj continues. “The entire drug discovery pipeline is guided by AI, so Sanofi decides what the next drug candidate should be in oncology or dermatology based on AI recommendations; it’s pretty awesome actually.”

The recommendations are being made by predictive tools, which are inherently different than the large language models many people are familiar with by now, she adds. These are machine learning algorithms designed to analyze information such as chemical structures, biological activity, and clinical trial data to predict outcomes like drug properties, bioactivity, and toxicity. At Sanofi, Aily Labs has been a significant partner in building this sort of AI capability.

Novartis has moved at a swifter pace of adoption, having launched a first-of-its-kind AI Innovation Lab through a collaboration with Microsoft back in 2019 when Bharadwaj was part of the digital team. The initiative integrated AI and data science across the company’s operations from R&D to commercialization.

Connecting the Dots

The perspective of MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s William Streilein, who previously served as the chief AI and data officer for the DOD, could be particularly valuable to the overall conversation at the DOT conference. “He understands the U.S. government like no other... when it comes especially to AI and the implementation of AI and understanding how the government may see AI in the future,” says Bharadwaj.

The Department of Defense, while less focused on the life sciences, is immersed in AI and Streilein will be at liberty to share some of the particulars. As has already been publicly disclosed, it has been involved in efforts to establish new data centers to support AI applications.

One of Bharadwaj’s near-term intentions is to spotlight some of the “amazing work that MIT scientists have done but is not necessarily published or known to everyone... and connect them to pharma and perhaps the U.S. government,” she says. She wants also to help ensure that industry stays focused on the shared goal to “benefit humankind,” in part by better understanding the role of regulators and how to scale up research-level discoveries and not get distracted by the minutiae of drug making.",,N,0.0,2025-08-12 03:56:10.160129

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas, and New York are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions. However, they’ve been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden’s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation’s three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn’t named, the law exempts any pharmacy that “exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state.” Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that’s because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa’s law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech.

There’s no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can’t be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, “Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It’s important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.”

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we’re still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as “crony capitalism,” but it’s not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don’t understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that’s not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.",https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/77/5e5b54f0-aa46-4ed1-aeb2-ebff01d2f8ee.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 13:56:23.077776

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.","As a cancer patient covered by my husband’s TRICARE health insurance, I read Rob Maness’ July 11 guest column opposing pharmacy benefit manager reform with disappointment. His argument misses the reality for families like mine.

He claims that Louisiana's proposed ban on PBMs from owning pharmacies would create barriers for veterans to access prescriptions. But PBMs already create barriers by dictating ultra-low reimbursement rates to local independent pharmacies, preventing them from participating in TRICARE. That means patients like me and my husband, a retired veteran, are forced to use PBM mail-order services whether we want to or not. Mail order might sound convenient, but it often leads to delays, lost medications and zero personal care. I’ve experienced this danger firsthand.

Maness tries to scare us by saying reform will close pharmacies and displace veterans. What’s more likely is that locally operated pharmacies and non-PBM chains will expand when unfair competition from powerful, vertically integrated PBMs is removed. When PBMs own pharmacies, they set reimbursement rates to favor themselves while underpaying competitors, driving them out of business. Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would end this conflict of interest, keeping locally operated pharmacies open and thriving.

Here in Louisiana, independents have always served rural and underserved communities where big chains refuse to go. They provide personalized care, deliver medications and work hard to ensure no one goes without. The idea that only PBM chains can serve patients is false and insulting to the small-business pharmacists working daily to keep Louisianans healthy.

PBMs use their ownership of pharmacies to manipulate the system. They underpay locally operated pharmacies, force veterans into their mail-order programs and overcharge TRICARE while pocketing the difference. That isn’t about access and quality care. It’s about greed.

Banning PBMs from owning pharmacies would bring affordability, access and better care back to Louisiana.

MHSRS, a four-day event which takes place annually at the Gaylord Palms Resort & Conference Center, provided personnel with multiple forums to demonstrate the impact NMR&D research has on the DoD warfighter.

Over 100 NMR&D personnel attended MHSRS this year, including military, civilian and contractor research, medical and support personnel. Attendees participated in a range of conference activities, speaking at 26 breakout sessions, presenting 95 research posters across three poster sessions and engaging with stakeholders and potential collaborators throughout the Military Health System.

“This year’s MHSRS was an outstanding demonstration of how the talented scientists of Navy Medicine Research and Development work together to field medical solutions in support of Joint Force health and readiness,” said Capt. Franca Jones, commander, Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC). “This year’s symposium highlighted extensive collaborations between commands in NMR&D, other service laboratories, and industry and academia.”

“MHSRS is really an opportunity to help our junior researchers understand our military medical research environment,” said Capt. William Howard, commanding officer of Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU)-Dayton. “We also use it as an opportunity for our seasoned researchers to remain calibrated and find opportunities. We try to maximize our participation for the benefit of our command as well as for military research in general.”

During the opening plenary session, two NMR&D commands were recognized. Justin Handy, from the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory (NSMRL) in Groton, CT, received the Outstanding Research Accomplishment for a Military Team award on behalf of the Naval Psychological Readiness and Human Performance team. The team was recognized for their work to improve submariner and nuclear-operator screening, career prediction, and individual coaching, which fosters readiness, professional development, leadership, team performance, and retention within the Submarine Force.

Dr. Doug Jones, Dr. Timothy Dunn, and John Marciano, from the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) in San Diego, CA, received the Warfighter Medicine Research Public Communication Award for their work raising public awareness of their DOD-sponsored medical research in the area of arctic performance.

“Dr. Jones, Dr. Dunn, and their team of top scientists work diligently in the background to help our sailors and soldiers do their jobs in the harshest of environments.” Said Dr. Ken Earhart, NHRC scientific director. “It’s exciting and immensely rewarding when the world takes notice, recognizing their individual achievements, showcasing the real-world impact of their important research, and offering inspiration to others to pursue careers in STEM.”

Three NMR&D poster presentations were recognized during the final awards ceremony, out of over 1400 posters from throughout the three poster sessions. Dr. Sabrina Snyder, from NAMRU San Antonio, was awarded first place for her poster on the survival analysis of a dental self-healing composite, and Dr. Kayla Septer, from NMRC, was awarded second place, for her poster on the antigenic characterization of currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Crouch, from NHRC, was given an honorable mention for Poster Session 2 for his presentation on using anomaly seasonality decomposition and artificial neural network modeling to predict febrile respiratory illness among U.S. military recruitment populations.

Dr. Elliot Dirr, of NAMRU-Dayton, was also recognized during this ceremony, getting third place in the Young Investigators competition, for his presentation on how the partial pressure of oxygen and nitrogen impacts the development of noise-induced hearing loss.

“This year we had two oral presentations, nine posters and two session chairs, and we’re especially proud of Dr. Elliott Dirr for his win in the young investigators category,” said Howard. “Our command cultivates the mindset of starting all research endeavors with the needs of the warfighter, and I know that is reflected in our contributions to military medical research.”

With over 3500 registrants this year, MHSRS presents a unique opportunity for researchers and leadership to meet with future collaborators in the Military Health System.

NMR&D is led by NMRC, and is comprised of NSMRL, NHRC, and NAMRU Dayton, San Antonio, INDO PACIFIC, EURAFCENT, and SOUTH.

MHSRS is the DoD’s premier scientific meeting that focuses specifically on the unique medical needs of service members. This annual educational symposium brings together healthcare professionals, researchers, and DoD leaders for four days of critical learning, intensive idea sharing and relationship building.

NMR&D, a global collective of eight commands, conducts research in support of Navy, Marine Corps and joint U.S. warfighter health, readiness and lethality, across a broad spectrum of activity from basic science in the laboratory to field studies in austere and remote areas of the world to investigations in operational environments. NMR&D studies infectious diseases, biological warfare detection and defense, combat casualty care, environmental health concerns, directed energy health effects, aerospace and undersea medicine, medical modeling, simulation, operational mission support, epidemiology and behavioral sciences.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2508/9249732/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-08-11 10:56:12.781301

web posted August 11, 2025

We don't get to pick and choose who gets to enjoy constitutional rights and who doesn't. They apply to all of us — even the large healthcare companies everyone seems intent on crusading against these days. Sometimes it comes down to freedom of choice versus monopolies, and restricting certain healthcare related businesses while granting monopolies to others isn't fixing the problems, but creating new ones.

Arkansas ran face-first into this reality at the end of July, when federal judge Brian Miller temporarily blocked Act 624, which would have prohibited pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from owning pharmacies in the state. Finding in favor of PBM plaintiffs CVS Health and Express Scripts, Judge Miller said the law appears to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in violation of the Constitution's Commerce Clause. Miller determined that the pharmacies would face irreparable harm if Act 624 were enforced, including unrecoverable economic losses and disruptions to patient access to medications, particularly for TRICARE beneficiaries, seniors, and those with complex conditions.

The ruling is significant as other states like Vermont, Texas and New York, are considering similar PBM restrictions. This means that the outcome of this case could influence policies across the country.

PBMs negotiate the cost of drugs with insurance plans and drug manufacturers, working to help patients get the best price possible for their prescriptions. They are third party negotiators that work with insurance plans and drug manufacturers to help patients get better prices for their prescriptions.

However, they've been coming under intense bipartisan scrutiny for supposedly driving prices up instead. President Donald Trump and several GOP-led states have been making headlines this year for going after PBMs. But it was Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that really got the game going just as Biden was leaving office. In January, the FTC published a report finding that PBMs charged significant markups for specialty drugs — findings that were skewed from the outset by focusing on specialty drugs with high R&D costs — a few months after the agency sued the nation's three biggest PBMs.

With gridlock freezing congressional action, states are taking matters into their own hands. That is why Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed Act 624 into law back in April, which bans PBMs from owning pharmacies with a troubling exemption: Walmart.

While Walmart isn't named, the law exempts any pharmacy that ""exclusively services the employees and dependents of the pharmacy employer while utilizing the affiliated pharmacy benefits manager in this state."" Walmart, which is based in Arkansas, is the largest employer in the state, and it appears the original law was rewritten to give Walmart a pass.

If this sounds like a monopoly in the making to you, that's because it very likely is. Walmart is not a PBM, but it does technically operate pharmacies affiliated with PBMs. And the corporation has announced plans to expand its pharmacy operations in the state while competitors like CVS get pushed out — not because of fair market competition, but because the government has stepped in to pick winners and losers via sweeping legislation.

This issue extends far beyond Arkansas, as 39 mostly Democratic state and territory attorneys general signed a letter asking Congress to prohibit PBMs from owning or operating pharmacies. States are also looking for other ways to control PBMs, but another recent federal injunction in Iowa raised similar constitutional issues. In this case, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Lochner argued that Iowa's law overstepped the bounds of state law, getting in the way of ordinary Americans accessing the healthcare they need. He stated that the law violated the First Amendment's protections for commercial speech.

There's no denying drug prices in the United States are far too high. We pay nearly three times more for prescription drugs than any other developed country. But the solution can't be to deny constitutional rights to those we blame for the problem — or, frankly, anyone else.

PBMs have taken a lot of heat in recent years for the rising costs of drugs. But studies indicate that they really do keep drug costs down. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that PBMs lowered costs on drugs for Medicare Part D by 20 percent. Another report claims PBMs save consumers over $1,000 each year.

Stacie Dusetzina, professor of health policy and an Ingram Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Department of Health Policy, testified at an FTC public listening session, ""Without PBMs, it is likely Americans would pay more for their medications than they currently do…It's important to recognize that rebates do lower overall spending on prescription drugs, so we should value rebates that are negotiated.""

In short, these companies keep us from paying even more for drugs, but we're still watching politicians turn them into convenient scapegoats for inflated drug costs.

Yes, we have to do something about skyrocketing drug costs, but the solutions we enact must uphold the Constitution. Trampling down the rights we all hold dear is a slippery slope that will only cause more pain — and inevitably higher drug prices. More competition is better; granting monopolies will drive costs up. Some refer to this kind of preferred treatment in the marketplace as ""crony capitalism,"" but it's not capitalism at all, it's the government dictating market conditions.

The problem is the issue is so complex that people don't understand it. They want to put a superficial band-aid on the problem instead of getting to the root of the disorder. While we all agree that most issues are better regulated by the states than by the federal government — federalism — that's not the only part of the Constitution. States can make bad laws that violate other parts of the Constitution. Trampling on the Constitution to grant monopolies to preferred corporations reeks of socialism.

It is not age discrimination, you are forgetting that young soldiers are on TLF because they have been declared by SSDI.

I don’t have direct advice for the work around but something that may help you with one, if it helps you get a diagnosis that requires it. Have you been diagnosed with a metabolic disorder? Ever had your genetics pulled for obesity genes? I had the best doc dive down the rate obesity genetics pool, and discovered I had a specific genetic mutation. This diagnosis requires I take glp1 for life, the only other medication that tears it nearly killed me for some reason.

TFL is not just for the 65+ crowd. I am the spouse of a young retiree and I am on TFL because I am disabled and get SSDI and Medicare. I am in my late 40s. I was able to get approved for Mounjaro based on a history of high A1C even though the high numbers were the side effect of being on steroids.

It is actually extremely common for retiree benefits to be reduced as a cost cutting measure because their budget line is usually smaller. The corporate world does it all the time. Especially with government health insurance, they have to keep within the allotted budget so all those bureaucrats can get their usual kickbacks. With all the people who have gone on GLP-1s, I am sure prescription costs have skyrocketed so far this year.",,N,0.0,2025-08-10 11:56:06.366230

CALL TO ACTION: Help a Warrior, Father, and Advocate Get Life-Saving Care

SFC David Hong has spent his entire adult life serving others—on the battlefield, at home, and in the veteran community. Now, he needs our help.

David was born in Brazil, immigrated to the U.S. in 1983, and proudly joined the U.S. Army in 2009 as a Religious Affairs Specialist (56M). He deployed to Korea and Afghanistan, and beyond his military service, he’s a devoted husband and father of three, including a child with special needs who inspired his advocacy for military families facing similar challenges.

In July 2022, during a routine colonoscopy, David’s life changed forever—he was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer.

Since then, he’s fought like hell through multiple surgeries, 24 rounds of chemotherapy, and now, the cancer has returned to his liver. His providers gave him 2-5 years to live—but they underestimated David’s will to fight.

David was offered a chance: A cutting-edge, FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment called histotripsy—which destroys tumors in the liver using sound waves, with minimal risk and quick recovery. The procedure is 85-95% effective and could give David a chance at more time with his family and to continue serving others.

But here’s the kicker: TRICARE denied the procedure for a third time yesterday, even against his doctors’ recommendations (see denial in comments).

At HunterSeven, we fight for our warriors, and we were stunned to see how much advocacy had already been done on David’s behalf—to no avail. So we’ve decided: we’re just going to get it done.

We need to raise $45,000 to fund this life-saving procedure.

No red tape. No delays. Just action.

I have found multiple doctors/clinics that are listed of the cf doctors list that will perform the procedure my only problem is I don't know how the whole insurance thing works. There is a (literally only one) gynecologist that I can see within the tricare system (I really dont know how to describe it, I go on base for all of my appointments) and although I have a consult scheduled for next month I highly doubt she'll approve me to get the procedure done. I want to schedule with one of the other ""non military"" clinics in my area but what are the steps to getting that covered? I was told that I need to call tricare and let them know? How do I schedule am appointment with another clinic? Do I have to have a referal or can I just call?

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy.
If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.
To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.
If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.","The Defense Health Agency announced that TRICARE beneficiaries in two Colorado counties may receive emergency prescription refills now through August 16, due to the Elk and LeRoux Fires.

The counties affected are Delta and Rio Blanco.

To receive an emergency refill of prescription medications, TRICARE beneficiaries should take their prescription bottle to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. If the bottle is unavailable or the label is damaged or missing, beneficiaries should contact Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

To find a network pharmacy, beneficiaries may call Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303, or search the network pharmacy locator.

If possible, visit the pharmacy where the prescription was filled. Prescriptions filled by a retail chain may be filled at another store in that chain. If the clinician who prescribed the medication is available, beneficiaries can ask them to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies. Any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,0.0,2025-08-09 16:56:08.386918
