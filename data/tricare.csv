The New York Times: Trump Aides Solicit Ideas To Raise Birthrate, From Baby Bonuses To Fertility Planning

The White House has been hearing out a chorus of ideas in recent weeks for persuading Americans to get married and have more children, an early sign that the Trump administration will embrace a new cultural agenda pushed by many of its allies on the right to reverse declining birthrates and push conservative family values. One proposal shared with aides would reserve 30 percent of scholarships for the Fulbright program, the prestigious, government-backed international fellowship, for applicants who are married or have children. Another would give a $5,000 cash “baby bonus” to every American mother after delivery. (Kitchener, 4/21)

The Washington Post: CDC Cuts Hamstring Programs That Monitor Fertility And Maternal Health

Federal programs that help people compare IVF clinics, monitor safety in fertility and make sense of health data have been scaled back by the Trump administration in a move some maternal health experts predict will have an enduring effect on women and children. Layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services this month have dismantled teams at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention responsible for collecting and analyzing data on a range of subjects, including embryo transfers and maternal health disparities.

NBC News: Tricare Military Health Insurance Leaves Pregnant Women With Ultrasound Delays, Disrupted Care

In the throes of postpartum depression, the incision site from her Cesarean section still tender, a U.S. Navy veteran in Indiana learned she had been dropped by her health insurance. Some 500 miles away, in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Air National Guard member Cortney Frazon was trying to check in for a 20-week ultrasound when she discovered her doctor no longer accepted her insurance. Faced with a crushing out-of-pocket cost, she left. (Chan, 4/18)

CNN: Puberty Conversations Are Starting Too Late, New Poll Reveals

For many parents, the idea of having “the talk” with their kids may be daunting, making them feel embarrassed or squeamish. But many parents are conflating the classic growing-up talk about sex with another crucial conversation they should be having, new research suggests. The talk in question should happen earlier than one may think, and it’s not necessarily about sex. It’s about puberty. (Lumer, 4/21)

Iowa Public Radio: Iowa House Passes Bill Requiring Fetal Development Videos Starting In 5th Grade

Public, private and charter schools in Iowa would be required to show fetal development videos to students starting in fifth grade under a bill passed Thursday by Republicans in the Iowa House. Human growth and development classes and health classes in grades 5-12 would have to teach about “human development inside the womb.” That would include an ultrasound video showing vital organs in early fetal development.

Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.

Express Scripts is super nice and helpful and I talked them extensively during my PA process because my doctors office kept filling out the forms wrong 😡😡. Bring the form into your doctor and discuss in person if you can, have them fill it out in front you and ask for a copy too. If you have a contraindication like an interaction with another medicine- then the doctor can discuss is in the form and it shouldn’t be an issue.

Side note- I used to be on antidepressants and anti anxiety’s a long time ago, but stopped taking them after I had kids (no good reason not to restart other than I was being stubborn). I’ve struggled for years off my meds, and Zep has made me feel new again. True happiness I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m not as irritable. Not as sad. More good days ❤️ Good luck with your journey!

Also- just in case…. I technically had contraindications to Qsymia/phentermine and was super adamant about not trying it. I went to an obesity specialist, who was not very kind and literally wanted to hear nothing about my contraindications concerns, and adamantly prescribed me Phentermine. I took ONE dose- had the most horrible reactions (racing heart, dizziness, irritability, etc etc) from ONE dose I told them not taking it again. I went back to my other doctor and told them my reactions. That counted as me trying and failing it for the sake of the form and my Zep PA was approved no problem after that. Not that you should have to endure a possible horrible reaction to get approved… but it’s how mine was approved.

I have TriCare as well and was able to get a PA without trying phentermine or the others. I had just worked with med management to get my adhd and anxiety under control for about a year and am on a stimulant, so i expressed my desires to my PCM that I didn’t want to get off of it because I was finally starting to feel good (you can’t take phentermine while on other stimulants). I also have a history of seizures, so I can’t take the other 2. So, a fairly unique circumstance, but ultimately they approved me for it without having to take the oral meds.

I have Tricare for life so I’m a bit older than you are and it was not a hard process at all. I know that the regulation state that you have to try three medication’s prior to going on Zepbound, but since my doctor had known me for the last 20 years and knew what I had been going through, he just zipped right through it and said I tried them all failed them and needed to go on Zepbound.Not sure if your doctor will do this for you or not but if you have to go through the steps, then do it.

I no longer have to take blood pressure medicine, cholesterol medicine, thyroid medicine, and I’m off of two of my atrial fib medication’s. I no longer am prediabetic, I no longer have sleep apnea either. I’m no longer at risk for 14 types of cancer that obese people get. I can run up and down the stairs after my granddaughters. I can walk across the room now without being short of breath. after 15 months on this miracle drug, I have lost 91 pounds. I am still considered overweight by another 15 pounds but that’s OK with me. Do I really wanna get back to what I was when I was 22 years old? I like who I am now in this body. I went from a size 22/24 to now a size 12. i’m not in maintenance yet as I would like to continue trying to lose some more weight. We are going on a cruise in a month and we’ll see what happens on that cruise. I am happy to say that my food noise is still being controlled and I have to remind myself sometimes to eat. But hunger is a good thing. now I find myself saying hey I’m hungry. I’m gonna try to eat this. And I may only eat half of it and again that’s OK. I’m sorry you don’t have a support of your mom that can be tough. I have a loving husband and two sons and three grandchildren that are cheering me on daily. Now my granddaughter did ask me if everything‘s going to change about me because she’s seen the change over the last 15 months. I told her that my heart will never change for her just the fat around it. I wish you the best of luck on this journey. Should you decide to take it. It is life-changing in so many aspects.

As NBC reports, Tricare - a lifelong benefit promised to many who serve, but one that has been plagued by widespread disruptions to service members, their families and the physicians who accept the insurance following a change in contracts.

Women across the country are speaking out about delays and denials of basic maternity because of improperly working Tricare.

NBC News collected numerous stories.

In Kansas City, at least two medical providers were telling Audrey Simmons they couldn’t see her because of ongoing negotiations with her insurance, leaving her with limited options during her high-risk pregnancy.

Then she found out that many others were in the same situation.

Marine Corps Sgt. Savannah Harper, 27, had trouble getting prenatal care in January after she transferred from a California base to one in Hawaii. She repeatedly called Tricare for help, enduring wait times of up to 90 minutes with no resolution - all leading to a full month overdue for her 20-week ultrasound.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago, NBC reports.

The result of Tricare so far: Missed diagnoses, confusion, stress, and unnecessary financial burdens. Our service members and veterans deserve better.

We call on the Defense Health Agency to fix Tricare coverage immediately. Ensure military families get timely, standard care without bureaucratic red tape.

Stop letting down the very people who served this country.

Another issue is Tricare demanding repayment of previously paid claims. In Nevada, a Navy veteran and his wife said Tricare had rescinded over $100,000 in medical claims it had approved and paid years ago, NBC reports.

The result of Tricare so far: Missed diagnoses, confusion, stress, and unnecessary financial burdens. Our service members and veterans deserve better.

We call on the Defense Health Agency to fix Tricare coverage immediately. Ensure military families get timely, standard care without bureaucratic red tape.

Stop letting down the very people who served this country.

Top 10 Nutrition Habits to be a Readiness CHAMP: 1.
Know Your Why The most important step in changing your nutrition habits is to clearly understand why you want that behavior to change.
CHAMP’s Strategic Habits for Better Nutrition worksheet helps guide you to optimal nutrition goals—and it includes how to stay motivated and committed in changing your habits.
• Identify the nutrition habits you want to focus on.","The Consortium for Health and Military Performance at the University of Uniformed Services, otherwise known as CHAMP, provides human performance resources for warfighters to maintain an optimal healthy lifestyle.

CHAMP features ways to achieve optimal readiness through a combination of psychological, social, nutritional, spiritual, and physical fitness tools—including a focus on one area that plays a critical connection between food and readiness: nutrition, which can have many benefits on mission readiness for service members and their families.

""We now know that body strength, weight, and overall functioning are the result of biological, psychological, and environmental factors,” said Dr. Marian Tanofsky-Kraff, director of Developmental Research Laboratory on Eating & Weight Behaviors for USU. “Good nutrition and physical activity can supplement physical and emotional health.""

Nutrition is vital to mission readiness. Food provides the human body with the continuous supply of energy it needs to function efficiently. This demand increases significantly when engaging in physical activities, whether for recreational, competitive, or duty purposes.

As one of the most important drivers of optimal physical and psychological wellbeing, “proper nutrition gives your brain the nutrients it needs to manage stress, regulate mood and emotions, maintain alertness and optimize physical and cognitive performance—all essential components of mission readiness,” according to military health experts. “Eating healthy keeps you sharp mentally and fueled physically. This is especially important when facing increased stress or high operational tempo.”

The CHAMP site maintains dozens of resources on nutrition basics and specialty topics to enhance warfighter performance during workouts, training, missions, and recovery.

Top 10 Nutrition Habits to be a Readiness CHAMP:

1. Know Your Why

The most important step in changing your nutrition habits is to clearly understand why you want that behavior to change.

CHAMP’s Strategic Habits for Better Nutrition worksheet helps guide you to optimal nutrition goals—and it includes how to stay motivated and committed in changing your habits. The form contains questions to assess your current nutritional intake, organized in three steps:

• Identify the “why” behind the behavior you want to change.

• Identify the nutrition habits you want to focus on. As your habits evolve and improve, revisit the worksheet to choose new habits to work on.

• Create your strategy. The worksheet contains ways to develop habits to promote nutritional fitness.

2. Value Whole Foods

Focus on whole foods, and fewer processed foods. Choose more plants, the more colors the better for foods with naturally occurring nutrients.

For more on plant-forward eating, and to view sample menus and food swaps see CHAMP’s Go for Green Power Your Menu with Plants toolkit.

3. Time Meals

Follow a regular eating pattern and plan your nutrition strategy ahead of time. Avoid skipping meals or going too long without eating. Fuel before, during, and after exercise.

4. Understand Macronutrients

Energy primarily comes from three macronutrients, and each plays a distinct role in sustaining performance and aiding recovery. Aim to get a balance of these nutrients each day.

The three main macronutrients are:

• Carbohydrates: The body's main energy source, carbohydrates break down into sugars to provide immediate energy. Complex carbohydrates—as opposed to simple carbs in candy, soda, fruit juice, or sports drinks—are preferred as they are digested slowly and release steady supply of energy. They are found in whole-grains, beans, starchy vegetables, and fresh fruit. If you’re eating bread, cereal, tortillas, or pasta, whole-grain options are much healthier.

• Fats: Essential for a balanced diet, fats supply fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), which are important for performance and recovery. Examples of fats include avocado, butter, and olive oil.

• Proteins: Found in every cell, protein is crucial for muscle repair and recovery. Sources of protein include chicken, lean beef, low-fat milk, and Greek yogurt.

5. Appreciate Omega-3

Omega-3 fatty acids support the health of your heart and blood vessels, nerves, eyes, brain, and immune system and may improve physical and mental performance. For example, omega-3s are being studied for the positive effects they might have in recovery from exercise and injury, as well as their role in protecting the brain and nervous system after a concussion or traumatic brain injury.

Find out which foods are highest in Omega-3 Content and how much you need from CHAMP.

6. Create Power Plates

CHAMP recommends a power plate guide to meet the nutritional requirements of the unique occupational and training demands of service members.

Power Plate Guide recommendations include:

• Make one-fourth of your plate lean protein.

• Make one-fourth to one-half of your plate natural and whole-grain carbohydrates.

• Aim for one-fourth to one-half of your plate to be non-starchy vegetables.

• Aim for one thumb-size portion of unsaturated fat.

• Stay hydrated.

• Eat mindfully.

7. Calculate Hydration

Water is the most abundant component of the human body—around 50–70% of its weight—so your body requires fluids regularly to ensure its normal function.

Given the unique nutritional requirements of Warfighters, the general fluid guidelines in the military are:

• Men: 96–144 oz daily (12–18 cups)

• Women: 64–96 oz daily (8–12 cups)

For more about daily fluid guidelines and how to tell if you’re at risk of dehydration see CHAMP’s Basic Hydration Strategies article.

8. Know What to Limit

The relationship between nutrition and mental health has grown in recent years. Studies show that certain foods may be used to prevent and treat conditions like depression.

Foods that cause inflammation and disrupt your “gut microbiota” may impact your mental well-being.

To get smart on what foods to limit or avoid and what foods to eat more of, see CHAMP’s Food and Mood: Does diet affect depression? article.

9. Choose More Plants

The benefits of vegetarian diets are linked to a lower risk of many chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.

To learn about the benefits of vegetarian diets and how to make sure you still get the right amount of key nutrients your body needs while on active duty, read CHAMP’s What you need to know about vegetarian diets article.

10. Track Food Intake

Knowing what you consume and how much you eat each day is a simple way to take charge of your eating habits. Consider starting a food journal or using food-diary apps to monitor your daily diet and improve your nutrition.

Several free apps are available like USDA’s MyPlate App.

I became pregnant recently (FTM) and had to really push to get a referral to a local OBGYN. My PCM said that they could only send me to a military hospital 1.5 hours away, which seemed insane to me given that there are plenty in-network providers in my local town. A patient advocate was able to help me, and I now have a referral with a local OBGYN.

My OBGYN delivers at the local hospital. Now I'm wondering if I need a separate referral for my delivery specifically? Like, is the referral for the routine pregnancy visits enough? My nightmare is that I deliver at my local hospital and TriCare refuses to cover it because they say I should have gone to the facility 1.5 hours away and we are going to have to pay thousands of dollars unexpectedly.

While most of these cases are in Texas and New Mexico, cases have been rising across the country.

Anyone who isn’t protected against measles can get the illness—and children are especially at risk of getting seriously sick. You may be wondering how to keep your family safe.

“Measles is more than just a rash; it can lead to severe illness, and it’s extremely contagious—you can catch it just from being in the same room as an infected person,” explained Dr. Eric Deussing, Public Health Emergency Officer for the Defense Health Agency. “So, it’s important to take steps to keep you and your loved ones protected and learn how to recognize potential symptoms. Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine provide the best protection against measles.”

Here’s what you need to know.

What is measles?

Measles is a highly contagious illness that can cause serious complications. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes—sometimes, this happens up to four days before they’re even showing symptoms.

People of any age can get serious cases of measles. But the following groups are at increased risk for complications:

Children younger than age 5

Adults older than age 20

Pregnant women

People with weakened immune systems

Recognizing measles signs and symptoms

Measles symptoms usually appear between seven and 14 days after infection.

Initial symptoms typically include:

High fever (sometimes above 104 degrees)

Cough

Runny nose

Red, watery eyes

Two to three days after the start of symptoms, you may see tiny white spots (Koplik spots) in your mouth.

In three to five days, you may develop the measles rash—flat red spots that usually start on the face, and then spread down the body towards the feet.

Common complications of measles are ear infections and diarrhea. More severe complications can include pneumonia, swelling of the brain, and other conditions that can lead to hospitalization.

Are you or a family member showing signs of measles? Call the Military Health System Nurse Advice Line at 800-TRICARE (874-2273). Describe your symptoms to a registered nurse, who can advise you on what to do next.

Preventing measles

Your best defense against measles is getting vaccinated. Most people who got their vaccination have protection against measles for life, as described by the CDC.

The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine protects against measles as well as mumps and rubella. This vaccine is available to those older than 12 months old.

The measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, or MMRV, vaccine protects against these illnesses as well as chickenpox. This vaccine is only available to children 12 months old through 12 years old.

Both the MMR and MMRV vaccines are administered in two doses. Children under age 12 should get the first dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. (Children may also get the MMRV second dose three months after the first dose.)

Older children, teenagers, and adults should get one or two doses of the MMR vaccine if they don’t have evidence of immunity. (Note: You’re considered immune if you were born before 1957, since it’s likely you were infected naturally.) Doses should be given at least 28 days apart.

TRICARE covers age-appropriate doses of these vaccines, as recommended by the CDC. You don’t need a referral or other approval to get these vaccines. As described in the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook, you can get these vaccines at no cost, as long as you:

Go to a military hospital or clinic.

Go to a TRICARE retail network pharmacy. Make sure the person who gives you the vaccine is a pharmacist. If another type of provider gives you a vaccine at a retail pharmacy, you may have out-of-pocket costs.

See a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider. However, if you get other services at the same time, you may have to pay copayments or cost-shares. These costs vary based on your health plan.

If you live overseas, you can get vaccinated at your local military hospital or clinic or by a TRICARE-authorized civilian provider.

Do you have more questions about the measles or getting an MMR or MMRV vaccine for yourself or your child? Talk to your healthcare provider or contact the MHS Nurse Advice Line.",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/measles.png,N,0.0,2025-04-18 21:56:27.507781

Cmdr.
Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.
She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families.
“All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said.
Gibson said, “It’s an honor to serve our beneficiaries, and we strive to provide them with world-class health care service.”","Defense Health Agency military medical laboratory professionals play a crucial role in supporting warfighter readiness, said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Clara Pangco, laboratory department head at Naval Hospital Twentynine Palms in Twentynine Palms, California.

She is one of hundreds of military lab professionals who offer critical services and vital information to service members and families. “Lab teams are part of patients’ health care teams and assist providers in making clinical decisions,” said Pangco.

“We provide relevant information to help treat and diagnose,” she said. “From a warfighting readiness standpoint—we ensure service members are ready to deploy and can meet the demands of combat operations.”

It’s fulfilling and rewarding work, noted Pangco. “I love everything about laboratory science and its management, as we get to play scientists, investigators, and problem solvers every day,” she said, noting that their work is often behind the scenes.

“The laboratory result a patient or provider sees is but a small percentage of the work we do,” Pangco continued. “Day in and day out, we make sure the result is always accurate and reliable by ensuring we adhere to strict quality assurance requirements such as equipment maintenance, calibration, and quality control.”

Like the Twentynine Palms team, warfighter readiness is a priority for the lab team at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo, according to U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Cordy Herring, Yokota Air Base lab officer. “All service members have Individual Medical Readiness requirements, which include specific immunizations, physical examinations, and medical evaluations,” he said. “The lab collects, tests, and ships samples for IMR testing to ensure people are medically ready for deployment. “We also run several programs contributing to readiness,” said Herring, “including a frozen blood program, an expeditionary blood program, a laboratory biological defense team, and a walking blood bank team.”

In addition, the Yokota Air Base lab team supports clinical operations. “The team examines tissues and bodily fluids and provides information to clinical teams to help determine overall health and treatment plans for our patients,” explained Herring. “We also provide blood products for hemorrhaging patients to save lives.”

The team collects forensic samples for alcohol-related incidents, aircraft mishaps, and also sends samples to assist with Department of Defense investigation processes. “We are always striving for continuous improvement,” Herring added.

These improvement efforts were showcased during a recent visit from the Air Force Blood Program and the Food and Drug Administration. “The visit resulted in the lab being named as one of the best within Japan’s DOD military hospitals and clinics,” said Herring. “The FDA was very impressed. We received a flawless inspection, acknowledging our safe blood practices and our commitment to care.”

Preventing Disease and the Spread of Infection

Lab professionals also help conserve service member strength by working to prevent disease and infection, said William Gibson, supervisory microbiologist at Madigan Army Medical Center at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. “Our lab tests over 100,000 specimens per year from beneficiaries on the West Coast, including Alaska, to the Midwest,” said Gibson. “The microbiology laboratory’s scope includes bacteriology, immunology, molecular microbiology, mycology, and blood parasitology. “We are currently working on several projects including cervical cancer screening through HPV testing,” he continued.

“We started HPV primary screening on April 7, 2025—this is a national guideline supported practice that is both workflow optimization and fiscally efficient,” said Gibson. “This summer, we intend to offer HPV self-collection testing, which has the potential to increase access to care.”

Communicable disease reporting is another ongoing project. “Infections are a fact of life. Everyone will be personally impacted by one throughout their lifespan,” he said. “Our active duty force travels the global and are exposed to a myriad of pathogens in which we must be able to provide education for prevention, prophylactics, diagnostics, and treatment for the world’s diseases. “We are looking to make sure that the reporting systems used to trace certain infections contain all the applicable test results across the DHA enterprise,” said Gibson. “This helps ensure the DHA, especially Epidemiology and Infection Control staff, have accurate data to react to things like outbreaks and facilitate an operational picture regarding medical intelligence.”

Delivering for Beneficiaries

Herring said the lab is needed. “Whether taking care of our patients, consoling a child when they are crying about getting blood collected, providing information to commanders to make decisions on careers, detecting possible biowarfare agents, or ensuring we can take care of our populace with blood programs—the lab is involved in operations,” he said.

This is all made possible through teamwork. “The team works hard together,” said Herring. “They excel in all duties and leave programs better than they found it. We take care of each other, support each other through the stressful times, and celebrate our wins. We’re proud of how much we have grown, how much we have accomplished.”

Pangco had praise for the staff at Twentynine Palms. “I am blessed with a great team,” Pangco said. ""Our recent successful FDA and College of American Pathologists reinspection was a testament of their hard work and dedication. The inspectors expressed noteworthy commendations. It was an all-around team success."" Ultimately, caring for beneficiaries is at the heart of the work of every lab professional.

Key Initiatives by the Defense Health Agency

Innovative Training Programs

The Defense Health Agency (DHA) is at the forefront of developing innovative training programs that are essential for enhancing the capabilities of military medical personnel. These programs are designed to ensure that healthcare providers in the military are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to handle the unique challenges posed by military operations.

One of the key initiatives undertaken by the DHA is the implementation of comprehensive emergency medical training programs. These programs focus on preparing military medical staff to respond effectively to a wide range of emergency scenarios, from combat injuries to natural disasters. By simulating real-world situations, these training programs help medical personnel develop the critical thinking and decision-making skills necessary to provide timely and effective care under pressure.

Another significant initiative is the development of specialized training modules that cater to the specific needs of different branches of the military. For instance, the DHA has introduced programs that focus on the unique medical challenges faced by special operations forces. These programs include tactical medical readiness training, which equips personnel with advanced skills in trauma care, field surgery, and evacuation procedures.

Moreover, the DHA’s commitment to innovation extends to the integration of cutting-edge technologies into its training programs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in training simulations has revolutionized the way military medical personnel are trained. These technologies provide a highly immersive and realistic training environment, allowing trainees to practice complex procedures and hone their skills in a controlled setting.

What is the impact of innovative training programs on military medical personnel? Innovative training programs developed by the Defense Health Agency enhance the skills and preparedness of military healthcare providers, enabling them to deliver effective care in diverse and challenging environments.

In addition to technological advancements, the DHA places a strong emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration. By fostering partnerships between military and civilian healthcare systems, the agency ensures that military medical personnel have access to the latest medical research and best practices. This collaborative approach not only enhances the quality of training but also strengthens the overall healthcare framework, benefiting both military and civilian populations.

The DHA’s innovative training programs are a testament to its dedication to maintaining the highest standards of military medical readiness. By continuously evolving and adapting to the ever-changing landscape of military medicine, the agency ensures that military healthcare providers are well-prepared to meet the demands of their roles, both on and off the battlefield.

Technological Advancements in Military Medical Training

The integration of technology into military medical training has revolutionized the way medical personnel are prepared for the unique challenges they face. Under the guidance of the Defense Health Agency (DHA), various technological tools and simulations have been introduced to enhance training efficiency and effectiveness. These advancements ensure that military healthcare providers are well-equipped to deliver optimal care in diverse and often high-stress environments.

One of the most significant technological advancements is the use of simulation-based training programs. These programs allow medical personnel to engage in realistic scenarios that mimic battlefield conditions. By utilizing virtual reality and augmented reality platforms, trainees can practice critical procedures in a controlled, yet lifelike setting. This not only improves their technical skills but also enhances their ability to remain calm and effective under pressure.

Moreover, the DHA has spearheaded the development of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical training. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to provide personalized feedback and adaptive learning paths for trainees. This ensures that each individual receives targeted instruction that addresses their specific strengths and areas for improvement. As a result, trainees can achieve a higher level of proficiency in a shorter amount of time.

Another crucial technological advancement is the implementation of telemedicine platforms, which facilitate remote training and consultation. These platforms enable military healthcare providers to access expert guidance and resources from anywhere in the world, ensuring that they are always up-to-date with the latest medical practices and protocols. This is particularly beneficial for personnel stationed in remote or austere locations, where access to traditional training resources may be limited.

The integration of these technologies into military medical training not only enhances the skills of healthcare providers but also contributes to the overall readiness of the military healthcare system. By ensuring that medical personnel are thoroughly prepared for any situation, the DHA plays a crucial role in maintaining the health and well-being of service members. This commitment to excellence and innovation underscores the importance of continued investment in federal support for military medical readiness.

In conclusion, technological advancements have transformed military medical training, providing healthcare providers with the tools they need to excel in their roles. As these technologies continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly play an even more integral role in preparing military medical personnel for the challenges of tomorrow.

Future Prospects for Military Medical Training

The future of military medical training is poised for significant advancements, spearheaded by the strategic plans of the Defense Health Agency (DHA). As we look ahead, it’s clear that the DHA is committed to evolving and enhancing the quality of military healthcare education. This commitment is crucial for maintaining the readiness and effectiveness of military medical personnel in an ever-changing landscape.

One of the key areas of focus for the future is the integration of cutting-edge technologies in training programs. The DHA is exploring the use of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create more personalized and adaptive learning experiences. AI can provide real-time feedback and tailor training modules to the specific needs of each trainee, ensuring that all personnel reach their full potential.

Additionally, the DHA is investing in the development of simulation-based training environments that replicate the complexities of battlefield medicine. These simulations are designed to mimic real-world scenarios, allowing trainees to practice their skills in a safe yet challenging setting. This approach not only boosts confidence but also enhances decision-making abilities under pressure.

Another exciting prospect is the expansion of telemedicine capabilities within military medical training. The DHA is working to improve remote consultation and training platforms, making it easier for medical personnel to access expert guidance and resources from anywhere in the world. This is particularly beneficial for those stationed in remote or austere locations, where traditional training resources may be limited.

Moreover, the DHA is committed to fostering collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems. By enhancing interoperability, the agency aims to ensure seamless coordination during joint operations and large-scale emergencies. This collaboration is essential for optimizing resource allocation and improving overall healthcare outcomes.

As we move forward, the DHA’s strategic plans also include strengthening partnerships with academic institutions and research organizations. These collaborations will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and innovation, driving continuous improvement in military medical training methodologies. By leveraging the expertise of external partners, the DHA can stay at the forefront of medical education and ensure that military healthcare providers are equipped with the latest skills and techniques.

In conclusion, the future prospects for military medical training are bright, with the DHA leading the charge in implementing innovative strategies and technologies.

As a reminder, TRICARE beneficiaries, other than active duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider and do not need a referral. This allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.

New York, New York--(Newsfile Corp. - April 18, 2025) - Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (""Zynex"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ: ZYXI) and reminds investors of the May 19, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company.

Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com.

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

On June 4, 2024, medical journal STAT published a report on Zynex entitled ""How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills."" The report claimed Zynex engaged in an ""oversupplying scheme"" by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to ""bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could."" The report further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were ""kicking the company out of network.""

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $0.50 per share, or 5%, to close at $9.35 per share on June 4, 2024, on unusually heavy trading volume.

On March 11, 2025, after the market closed, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military.

On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume.

The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

Technological Innovations in Defense Health Agency Collaborations

In the rapidly evolving landscape of global health security, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) leverages cutting-edge technologies to enhance its collaborative efforts. By integrating advanced tools such as telemedicine, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the DHA significantly improves its ability to respond to health threats with precision and speed. These technological innovations are not just enhancements but are pivotal in transforming how the agency operates and collaborates with its partners.

One of the most impactful technological advancements is the use of telehealth systems. Telemedicine allows healthcare professionals to provide real-time consultations and medical support to military personnel across the globe. This capability is particularly beneficial in remote or conflict zones where access to traditional healthcare facilities is limited. By utilizing telehealth, the DHA ensures that medical expertise is always within reach, thus enhancing its global health security network.

Data analytics is another critical component of the DHA’s technological framework. Through sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques, the agency can monitor health trends, predict potential outbreaks, and allocate resources more efficiently. This predictive capability is essential for effective public health collaboration and for making informed decisions that safeguard both military and civilian populations.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a transformative role in the DHA’s operations. AI-driven tools enhance the agency’s ability to detect and respond to health threats quickly. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI can identify patterns and anomalies that might indicate emerging health risks. This proactive approach enables the DHA to implement preventive measures and respond to threats before they escalate, thereby reinforcing its commitment to global health security.

Moreover, the integration of these technologies into the DHA’s partnerships extends beyond traditional healthcare boundaries. By collaborating with technology firms and research institutions, the agency fosters an ecosystem of innovation that continuously evolves to meet new challenges. These partnerships are vital for developing novel solutions and maintaining a competitive edge in the field of global health security.

One of the key areas where these technological innovations have a profound impact is in military healthcare logistics. By optimizing supply chains and improving logistical operations, the DHA ensures that medical supplies and personnel are deployed swiftly and efficiently during health emergencies. This logistical agility is crucial for maintaining combat readiness and ensuring that military operations are not hampered by health-related issues.

Furthermore, the DHA’s commitment to technological advancement extends to the development of next-generation medical devices and treatments. By investing in research and development, the agency supports the creation of innovative medical technologies that enhance treatment outcomes and improve the quality of care provided to military personnel.

In conclusion, the incorporation of technological innovations into the DHA’s collaborative efforts is a testament to its forward-thinking approach to global health security. By harnessing the power of telemedicine, data analytics, and AI, the agency not only improves its operational efficiency but also strengthens its partnerships with key stakeholders. These advancements are instrumental in enhancing the DHA’s ability to respond to global health challenges and ensure the safety and well-being of military personnel worldwide.

Challenges and Opportunities in Strengthening Global Health Security

In the quest to bolster global health security, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) faces a complex array of challenges and opportunities. These dynamics are critical in shaping the agency’s strategies and responses to global health threats. Understanding these factors is crucial for stakeholders who aim to support and enhance the DHA’s mission.

One of the primary challenges is resource limitations. The demand for healthcare resources often exceeds supply, especially in crisis situations. This scarcity can hinder the DHA’s ability to respond effectively to health emergencies. Additionally, geopolitical tensions can complicate international collaborations, making it difficult to establish and maintain partnerships that are crucial for global health security.

Despite these challenges, there are significant opportunities for growth and enhanced collaboration. The DHA can leverage its existing partnerships to expand its network and improve its response capabilities. By fostering stronger alliances with international organizations, governments, and non-governmental entities, the agency can enhance its capacity to address global health challenges.

Moreover, technological advancements present a unique opportunity for the DHA to improve its operations. Innovations in data analytics, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence can significantly enhance the agency’s ability to predict, monitor, and respond to health threats. By integrating these technologies into its strategies, the DHA can improve its efficiency and effectiveness in safeguarding global health security.

Furthermore, the DHA’s commitment to innovation can drive the development of new medical technologies and treatments. By investing in research and development, the agency supports the creation of cutting-edge solutions that can improve health outcomes and enhance the quality of care provided to military personnel.

Another significant opportunity lies in the potential for enhanced collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems. By improving interoperability, the DHA can ensure a more coordinated and efficient response to health emergencies, benefiting both military and civilian populations.

In conclusion, while the challenges in strengthening global health security are significant, the opportunities for growth and enhancement are equally substantial. By addressing these challenges head-on and leveraging available opportunities, the Defense Health Agency can continue to play a pivotal role in safeguarding global health security.

These include Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinators. You can find them at any military hospital or clinic.

Before you reach out to a BCAC, it’s important to first contact your regional contractor for help with TRICARE issues. Most TRICARE questions and concerns—such as those about enrollment, claims, referrals, or provider networks—can be handled directly through them. If you've already reached out to your contractor and still need help, a BCAC is your next step. They can take a deeper look at your issue and help guide you toward a resolution.

To get help, start by contacting the appropriate resource:

Questions about TRICARE eligibility or updates to a military service record: Contact your Service Personnel Component or the DMDC/DEERS Support Office (800-538-9552).

Questions about enrollment, claims, provider networks, or referrals: Contact your regional contractor first.

So, when should you get in touch with a BCAC? Read below to learn more.

What does a Beneficiary Counseling and Assistance Coordinator do?

BCACs can explain your TRICARE plan and how your benefit works. They work closely with regional contractors and claims processors to help resolve your concerns.

BCACs can address TRICARE-related questions, including:

Enrollment

Referrals and pre-authorizations

Claims processing delays

Covered services

The Military Health System Nurse Advice Line

Getting healthcare services outside the military hospital or clinic

“You may have questions or concerns about TRICARE enrollment, coverage, or costs that haven’t been resolved through traditional channels. BCACs are people you can contact, and even meet with in person,” said Calvin Keller, health systems analyst, Benefit Education, at the Defense Health Agency. “They’re committed to answering your questions and addressing your concerns.”

For example, you may have a question about your TRICARE eligibility or enrollment as shown in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System. Maybe your record shows “No healthcare coverage plan” and you believe this is an error. After reaching out to the DMDC/DEERS Support Office, a BCAC can:

Explain the different messages you see in your DEERS record

Provide information on eligibility requirements

Guide you on how to follow up with your sponsor’s Service Personnel Component

BCACs don’t determine or fix TRICARE eligibility—but they can be a valuable resource in navigating the process.

Why reach out to a BCAC?

If you feel lost after trying to resolve issues with your regional contractor or service, there are still other TRICARE experts who can help. Consider reaching out to a BCAC. BCACs will work with you to understand your concerns and explore possible solutions.

Who can get help from a BCAC?

Do you still have questions after contacting your regional contractor? Any TRICARE beneficiary can visit or call a BCAC, even if you don’t regularly get care at a military hospital or clinic, or live far from one.

How do I find a BCAC?

You can meet with a BCAC in person by walking into their office. You don’t need an appointment. If you can’t get there in person, you can give them a call.

Each military hospital or clinic has contact information for their BCAC. Find their information online on the Find a Military Hospital or Clinic page. Or check out the Customer Service Community Directory. You can also ask the hospital staff for their office location if you’d like to meet in person.

What’s the difference between a BCAC and a patient advocate?

While both are there to support you, BCACs and patient advocates have different roles. BCACs help with TRICARE benefits. Patient advocates help with concerns or questions about healthcare services you received at a military hospital or clinic.

They can:

Explain the Patient Bill of Rights and Responsibilities and give you a copy

Explain military hospital or clinic policies, procedures, and operations

Mediate concerns between you and your medical team
