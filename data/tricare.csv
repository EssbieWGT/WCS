The Fort Carson Intrepid Spirit Center, or ISC, is a state-of-the-art treatment facility dedicated to the assessment and care of concussions and other forms of brain Injuries.

“As part of the Defense Intrepid Network, the Intrepid Spirit Center provides comprehensive care and support for service members, veterans, and their families who have experienced traumatic brain injuries,” said U.S. Public Health Service Cmdr. Steve Spoonemore, a board-certified orthopedic clinical specialist and physical therapist with the Fort Carson ISC. “Our primary mission is getting service members back to duty in order to maintain an effective fighting force.”

Spoonemore says that many of the symptoms with traumatic brain injury are difficult to see externally yet impact the ability for service members to function in their military and family roles.

“The team-based care model helps us identify the associated symptoms of TBI, address them in comprehensive way, and empower the service member and family with tools to maintain optimum capability,” Spoonemore said.

Dr Brian Kelly, the deputy director of the ISC, says that these ""invisible injuries"" often go unrecognized, making events like this crucial.

“The military is deeply committed to addressing brain injuries to enhance warfighter readiness and improve quality of life during and after military service,” Kelly said. “The brain plays a vital role in numerous functions, from mood to memory to marksmanship. Just as soldiers once sharpened their swords for battle, we strive to ensure today's service members have sharp minds, free from symptoms.”

Kelly says that treatment at the ISC is highly individualized based on patient needs and goals. Services provided often include medication management, physical therapy, occupational therapy, neuropsychology, speech and cognitive rehabilitation, art therapy, and music therapy.

The ISC also sees other TRICARE beneficiary categories, to include family members and retirees.

Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Securities Class Action:

The litigation is focused on the propriety of Zynex’s statements about its sales and billing practices, its revenue recognition practices, and its relationship with the military health program for active-duty soldiers and their family members (“Tricare”), which represents 20 – 25% of company’s revenue.

The complaint alleges that Zynex made false and misleading statements while failing to disclose crucial information to investors. More specifically, the suit alleges that:

Zynex shipped product, including electrodes, in excess of customers’ needs;

As a result of this practice, Zynex inflated its revenues;

Zynex’s practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and

As a. result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences such as removal from insurer networks and penalties by the federal government.

Investors began to learn the truth on June 4, 2024, when medical journal STAAT published “How a device maker inundated pain patients with unwanted batteries and surprise bills.” This report claimed that Zynex engaged in an “oversupplying scheme” by sending inordinate amounts of monthly supplies like electrode pads and batteries in order to “bill insurers for thousands of dollars more than it otherwise could.” STAAT further revealed that, as a result of this practice, insurers were “kicking the company out of network.”

Then, on March 11, 2025, Zynex reported dismal Q4 and FY 2024 financial results. The company’s Q4 revenue implied a 2% drop from the year-earlier period and YE net income per share plummeted from $0.27 in 2023 to $0.09 in 2024. According to Zynex CEO Thomas Sandgaard “[o]ur fourth quarter revenue was less than expected[]” and “[t]he shortfall was due to slower than normal payments from certain payers and we were recently notified that Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.”

“We are concerned about potential issues with Zynex’s revenue recognition and sales practices,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

If you invested in Zynex and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

Whether we’re deployed, training stateside, or sitting down with family at home, the food we consume not only fuels our bodies but also strengthens our bonds with one another. Reflecting on the importance of proper nutrition for health and the acknowledgement of how food unites us as a community. These concepts ring true with service members, where shared meals support mission readiness and build camaraderie.

The Importance of Nutrition in the Military

In the military, nutrition is more than a personal choice – it’s a mission-critical component. Every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, Marine, and Guardian depends on proper nutrition to perform at their peak. Balanced diets rich in essential nutrients enhance physical endurance, mental clarity and recovery from intense activity. For example, incorporating complex carbohydrates, lean proteins and healthy fats into meals provides sustained energy for rucksack marches or demanding physical training sessions. Vitamins and minerals found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports immune function, ensuring service members stay fit to fight. Hydration is another cornerstone of nutrition, as staying hydrated supports cognitive function and minimizes fatigue.

For service members who are training or deployed, operational rations, such as Meals, Ready-to-Eat, or MREs, or Unitized Groups Rations, known as UGRs, are designed to meet nutritional needs in challenging environments. While these rations may not replace the comfort of a home-cooked meal, they demonstrate how food is tailored to meet specific missions and sustain service members around the world.

Food as a Cultural Bridge

We all know that food is not just fuel—it’s a bridge that connects people across cultures, ranks and generations. Service members experience this firsthand. Shared meals in the dining facility, potlucks during holidays, and barbecues after field exercises all create opportunities to foster relationships and build unit cohesion. When service members are deployed, dining can become a moment of connection that boosts morale and sustains resilience.

“As the military sends service members all around the world, one of the many benefits of experiencing new cultures is also trying new foods,” said Joanna Reagan, a public health nutritionist with Defense Health Agency – Public Health in Aberdeen, Maryland. “Opportunities to eat or cook in new locations expands knowledge of spices, cooking styles, new ingredients and shopping experiences. Certainly, the location affects how adventurous one might be in trying new foods while keeping the principles of food safety in mind.”

Food also connects us to our heritage and reminds us of home. A meal from childhood or a favorite family recipe shared during downtime can provide comfort and strengthen resilience for service members stationed far away from friends and family. Sharing traditional dishes from another culture promotes understanding, camaraderie and appreciation of diversity.

“Sharing your favorite recipes and traditions with others can create lifetime memories, not to mention expanding your list of favorite recipes,” added Reagan.

Leading by Example

Military leaders play a vital role in modeling healthy eating habits. Leaders have an opportunity to model healthy habits that may influence service members’ behaviors. Demonstrating a commitment to nutrition by choosing balanced meals, encouraging hydration, and avoiding excessive junk food sets a positive example.

“Military leaders shape the culture of eating habits within the units they lead,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Melissa Troncoso, a family nurse practitioner and researcher at the Uniformed Services University’s Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of Nursing in Bethesda, Maryland. “Through their food choices, recommendations for unit events, and advocacy for healthier options within the food environment, they can promote a lifestyle of good nutrition.”

Leaders can also advocate for nutrition education. Military installations offer resources such as dietitians and health promotion programs designed to educate service members and their families on healthy eating. At Armed Forces Wellness Centers, service members and their families; retirees; and Department of Defense civilians can utilize health coaches to revie w health habits, analyze risk factors or explore personal health and wellness goals. AFWCs can be found on many installations. Leaders encouraging their teams to take advantage of these resources promotes mission readiness as well as long-term health and well-being.

Strengthening Family Bonds Through Food

For families, food is often the centerpiece of connection. Whether they gather to share a holiday meal or a quick dinner before a parent heads out for a late-night duty shift, families can enjoy spending time eating together.

Military spouses and children also play an important role in maintaining the nutritional health of the household. Preparing meals together can teach children about healthy eating habits and provide a sense of normalcy amid the unique challenges of military life. Cooking as a family is a chance to strengthen relationships and create lasting memories.

“Loneliness and isolation increase the risk for individuals to develop mental health challenges,” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. Melissa Boyd, a clinical psychologist with DHA-Public Health in Aberdeen. “Sitting down together to build connection over food can improve the physical and mental health of all family members involved and has been linked to preventing eating disorders, alcohol and substance abuse, violence, depression and suicidality.”

Family meals also encourage open communication and motivate parents to listen to children talk about their day, which communicates they are valued, said Boyd.

Research has shown that family meals support the health and well-being of children and parents, demonstrating the benefits of spending time together during meals for the whole family.

Conclusion

Take a moment to appreciate the many ways food impacts our lives. In the military, food is not only fuel — it enhances unity, resilience, and readiness. Prioritizing nutrition and sharing meals together strengthens the bonds that make our military community unique.

This month, take the opportunity to evaluate your nutritional habits and find ways to connect with those around you through food. Whether you’re sitting down for a meal with your team, trying a new recipe with your family, or learning about the cuisine of another culture, let food be the common ground that connects you to the people in your life.

Related: Military Medical System Not Ready for War Due to Cuts and Delayed Reforms, Experts Warn Story Continues","Ahead of his confirmation hearing Thursday to become assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, Keith Bass is facing tough questions from a prominent Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

Bass, a retired Navy commander and substance abuse counselor who previously led the Central Intelligence Agency's Office of Medical Services and the White House Medical Unit, was nominated Dec. 22 to manage the Defense Department's $61 billion health system, which serves 9.5 million beneficiaries, including 1.3 million active-duty troops.

The health affairs assistant secretary is responsible for protecting and preserving the health of the armed forces, setting policy, and managing the Pentagon's health budget. He also serves as senior adviser on health issues relevant to beneficiaries for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

But the military health system currently is facing challenges on multiple fronts, including staffing shortages at medical facilities, patient retention issues that have affected provider training and proficiency, and problems within the Tricare health program that have resulted in delays in patient care and payments to providers.

In a letter to Bass on Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., ranking member of the Armed Services personnel subcommittee, questioned whether he is up to the task.

Citing Bass' experiences at the White House and CIA, which were investigated by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and in media reports for reported mismanagement, Warren said she had concerns that he is ""not capable of filling the role.""

According to an article in SpyTalk cited by Warren, Bass allegedly was fired as head of the CIA medical office following his mishandling of the investigation into Havana syndrome, also known as anomalous health incidents, that affected more than 330 U.S. State Department, intelligence and defense officials as a result of exposure to painful, piercing noise from an unknown source.

The article also pointed to Bass' alleged mishandling of the COVID-19 response at the agency, ""afflicting its rank and file.""

Warren also cited a DoD IG report released last January that found that, during Bass' tenure at the White House, civilian staff members who weren't eligible for military health services -- an average six to 20 patients a week -- received specialty care and surgeries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital in Virginia, and elsewhere.

That investigation also found that the unit distributed sedatives including Ambien and stimulants such as Provigil to ineligible beneficiaries, often without a prescription.

Warren asked Bass whether he was aware of ""severe and systemic problems"" under his watch.

""At best, you were oblivious to the wider distribution of sedatives and stimulants by White House pharmacy operations and, in the worst case, you were complicit. Either scenario should disqualify you from serving as the [assistant secretary of defense for health affairs],"" Warren wrote.

In his most recent position, Bass led the West Texas VA Health Care System, overseeing a medical center with an operating budget of $153 million and 1,120 employees, serving 24,000 veterans.

President Donald Trump announced Bass' nomination along with several other Defense Department leaders on Dec. 22, calling them ""a slate of America First patriots.""

""Keith is a retired Navy commander with over 30 years of health care experience. ... Keith will be leading the charge to ensure our troops are healthy, and receiving the best medical care possible,"" Trump wrote in an announcement.

Bass' appearance at his nomination hearing will be the first time he has made public statements about his plans for the military health system.

Dr. Stephen Ferrara, a retired Navy interventional radiologist who served as chief medical officer at the CIA, has served as acting assistant secretary for health affairs since January and, since assuming the duty, has traveled throughout the military health system, including a trip to U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay in Cuba last month.

Ferrara has pledged to ensure that the military health system realigns its efforts to support and provide combat medicine.

""And it's a moral imperative ... when America's sons and daughters go down range and go into harm's way, we honor the pact they make and that their parents made when they sort of handed their children over to us to do those missions that, should they become ill or injured, they will receive prompt and effective medical attention anywhere in the world,"" Ferrara said during a military health conference March 3.

The Senate Armed Services Committee will hear testimony Thursday from three other nominees in addition to Bass: Troy Meink to be Air Force secretary; Michael Duffey, proposed undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment; and Emil Michael as undersecretary of defense for research and engineering.

In her letter, sent to Bass via the White House, Warren requested answers to her questions in writing by Wednesday.

""Given your checkered past ... I am concerned that, if you are confirmed, you will not be able to effectively manage the military health care system, placing care at risk for millions. I urge you to demonstrate a commitment to clarity,"" Warren wrote.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.

I'm confused about how my current postal insurance will work with reserve military insurance (Tricare). I'm hoping other experienced reservists in this sub can give me advice and cclarification.

Right now I'm currently paying into postal health and dental insurance (high option) and also signed up for FSA which I will be contributing the max amount ($3,300). My postal insurance premium is about $176 a month for me and my dependent wife. Looking at Tricare Reserve Select, the family option is about $275 a month.

The part that confuses me is...(based on a discussion I had in r/navyreserve ; you can look up my post history).

I was told that I can't get Tricare if I already have FEHB (can someone provide the official documentation on this?) That said, someone else said that I will be on Tricare while I attend boot camp and A-School. Do I just tell the admins at boot camp that I already have FEHB or do I need to contact postal HR to put a pause on my postal insurance while I'm away with the military? (And then what about my wife? I don't want to risk gaps in her insurance coverage).

Also, while FEHB is cheaper for me since I'm on a postal union-sponsored healthplan, Tricare is more appealing to me since it definitely seems to have better coverage overall despite the higher premiums. That said, is there a way to opt out of FEHB and then go on Tricare fulltime? (Due to my FSA account this year, I probably have to ride out the postal insurance until the next open season).",,N,0.0,2025-03-24 14:56:20.737164

Volunteers are still needed for earth-friendly home front judging. No experience or knowledge needed. Sign up online and include Emerald Keepers in the comment box.

Considerations to earn an earth-friendly green ribbon include:

Limited to no lawn. Grass is water and energy intensive and provides limited benefits to our local biodiversity. Home fronts should be no more than 25% grass.

Limited to no artificial grass. Fake grass should be avoided. Made out of plastic, it harms the soil, wildlife, and human health. The benefits from using less water with artificial grass are far outweighed by the environmental harm caused by this plastic ground cover. No more than 10% of a garden should be covered with artificial grass.

Majority native or low-water plants. Support bees, birds, and butterflies with low-maintenance native and drought-resistant plants that thrive in Coronado’s soil and climate.

Natural mulches covering soil. Mulches such as bark, rocks, sand, and decomposed granite retain moisture, limiting the need for watering. They also inhibit the growth of weeds and therefore the need for chemical weed killers.

Majority ground surface non-paved. Permeable, non-paved ground surfaces allow for water absorption into the soil rather than runoff. Patios are acceptable if there is permeable space between pavers.

Green ribbon home fronts must also meet the Coronado Flower Show requirements for obvious effort, good maintenance, and curb appeal.

Home fronts include the parkway strip between the sidewalk and the street. While the strip is city property, homeowners are responsible for its maintenance. This visible space presents another opportunity to expand your earth-friendly impact.

In 2024, 319 homes were recognized for their earth-friendly landscaping. The winner was 801 Country Club Lane; 931 J Avenue took second place; and 1001 E Avenue came in third place. The winners exhibited an attractive and thoughtful combination of drought-tolerant plants and permeable hardscape that extended to the parkway strip.

Therefore, I am led to believe that my postal health/dental insurance is cheaper, but my question is: is military insurance mandatory while I am actively serving (training, schooling, deployment, etc.)? Is there a way to opt out of military insurance or am I forced to use it since I will be in LWOP status with my civilian job?

Also, I read somewhere that there is no enrollment window for Tricare (i.e. you can enroll whenever you want), is that true or do certain conditions have to be met?",,N,0.0,2025-03-24 00:56:17.752557

The first question would be did she have a referral? But also if she did talk with your provider because tricare changed some stuff in their system and led to claims being denied. I have them say that me as the service member was going to be responsible for $6300 that I had preauthorization for. Turns out it was an error on tricare’s side",,N,-1.0,2025-03-23 16:56:14.904006

TriCARE Buyback programs can significantly enhance the benefits for military veterans transitioning to federal civilian jobs, allowing them to count military service towards their federal retirement.

Understanding how military benefits like TriCARE integrate with federal retirement systems such as FERS can open up valuable opportunities to boost your retirement income and healthcare coverage.

If you’re a military veteran transitioning to a federal civilian career, you may already know that your military service can impact your federal retirement benefits. What you may not realize is how integrating military benefits like TriCARE with federal retirement systems such as the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) can be a game-changer. A key opportunity in this transition is the TriCARE Buyback option, which allows you to count your years of military service toward your federal retirement. Understanding how this buyback option works, and how it fits into your overall retirement strategy, can help you maximize your benefits and secure a financially comfortable retirement.

What Is TriCARE Buyback and Why It Matters

The TriCARE Buyback option allows military veterans who become federal employees to “buy back” their years of military service so that those years count toward their federal retirement under FERS. This can significantly increase your pension benefits by allowing you to add your military service time to your civilian service years.

For instance, if you served 10 years in the military and then transition into a federal civilian job, buying back your military service could add those 10 years to your federal service time. This means you could potentially retire earlier or receive a higher pension payout. However, the buyback process isn’t automatic—it requires a financial investment upfront, and the cost depends on your base pay during your military service. While this can be a considerable expense, the long-term retirement benefits often outweigh the initial cost.

How TriCARE Fits Into Your Healthcare in Retirement

Military retirees who are eligible for TriCARE have a unique advantage when it comes to healthcare coverage. TriCARE can serve as a key component of your retirement healthcare, especially when integrated with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program.

For many veterans, TriCARE covers much of their healthcare costs, but when you transition into a federal job, you become eligible for FEHB as well. At that point, you need to decide how to coordinate these two healthcare programs for maximum benefit. One option is to use TriCARE as your primary insurance and FEHB as secondary coverage, which can help lower your out-of-pocket costs by covering services that TriCARE may not fully cover.

The real advantage comes when you retire. Retired federal employees often rely on FEHB as their primary healthcare coverage, but military veterans have the option to keep using TriCARE, which can be a more cost-effective solution. By combining TriCARE with FEHB, you can ensure comprehensive coverage that meets all your healthcare needs in retirement while keeping costs manageable.

Navigating the FERS Retirement System with Military Service

If you’re a military veteran working under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), your military service can play a crucial role in boosting your retirement benefits. FERS is a three-part system that includes a civil service pension, Social Security, and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). By buying back your military service, you can add your years of military service to your federal civilian service, increasing your overall pension.

The formula for calculating your FERS pension is based on your years of service, your “high-3” salary (the average of your highest three consecutive years of basic pay), and a multiplier. For most employees, this multiplier is 1%, but it increases to 1.1% if you retire after age 62 with at least 20 years of service. Buying back your military service adds those years to your total service, allowing you to reach this 20-year threshold sooner, which can substantially increase your pension.

However, it’s important to note that while buying back your military service enhances your FERS pension, it may affect your eligibility for other benefits, like military retirement pay. If you’re receiving military retirement pay, you may need to waive it in order to buy back your military service for FERS. This is a decision that should be carefully considered based on your individual financial situation.

Weighing the Cost of Military Service Buyback

One of the key questions veterans face when considering the TriCARE Buyback is whether the cost is worth the added retirement benefits. The cost of buying back your military service is based on a percentage of your base pay during your years of military service, plus interest if you delay the buyback for too long after joining the federal workforce.

While the upfront cost may seem daunting, it’s important to consider the long-term financial benefits. Buying back your military service can increase your pension, allowing for a more secure retirement. Additionally, it may enable you to retire earlier, giving you more years to enjoy your retirement. In many cases, the pension increase far outweighs the initial cost of the buyback, making it a worthwhile investment for those planning for a long retirement.

Combining TriCARE, FEHB, and Medicare

When it comes to retirement healthcare, veterans have a variety of options. Many choose to rely solely on TriCARE, but others may find that combining TriCARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, and Medicare offers the most comprehensive coverage.

Once you turn 65, you’re eligible for Medicare, and at that point, TriCARE for Life kicks in as your Medicare supplement. By coordinating these three programs—Medicare, TriCARE, and FEHB—you can minimize out-of-pocket healthcare costs in retirement. Medicare will serve as your primary insurance, with TriCARE or FEHB picking up the remainder.

Choosing whether to enroll in FEHB in retirement or rely solely on TriCARE and Medicare depends on your individual healthcare needs and financial situation. Some retirees find that TriCARE and Medicare are sufficient, allowing them to save on FEHB premiums, while others prefer the additional coverage FEHB provides.

Boosting Retirement Income with the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)

In addition to your FERS pension and Social Security, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a key component of retirement planning for federal employees. The TSP operates like a 401(k) and provides a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. For veterans who buy back their military service, those additional years of service also increase the time you have to contribute to your TSP, giving you more time to grow your retirement savings.

The TSP offers several investment options, including stocks, bonds, and government securities, allowing you to tailor your investment strategy to your risk tolerance and retirement goals. As you approach retirement, it’s important to adjust your TSP contributions and investments to ensure that your savings will last throughout your retirement years.

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military. On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended the assessments as a part of its ongoing investigation into the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore nearly a year ago.

This does not mean that the Coronado Bridge is an active collapse risk: Rather, it made the list because it was built prior to guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).

Baltimore’s Key Bridge was almost 30 times above the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges established by AASHTO when it was struck by a containership on March 26, 2024 and subsequently collapsed.

Now, the NTSB is recommending that 68 bridges that were built prior to AASHTO guidance be assessed for potential vulnerability.

In 1991, AASHTO developed a vulnerability assessment calculation for all new bridges on the National Highway System. Construction of the Coronado Bridge began in 1967 and concluded in 1969. It is owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).

The vulnerability assessment was the result of the NTSB’s investigation of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge collapse in Florida.

The TRICARE Online Patient Portal, or TOL, will be discontinued in favor of a new system, MHS Genesis.
Healthcare providers will still have access to patients’ full health records.
TRICARE has released instructions for downloading legacy health records.
“We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions.","New law for parking near intersections in effect

Pedestrian fatalities are on the rise, and a new law meant to improve safety is now in effect.

Known casually as the “Daylighting Law,” Assembly Bill 413 prohibits vehicles from parking within 20 feet of the approach of a crosswalk in California. For crosswalks with a curb extension (also known as a bulb out), parking within 15 feet is prohibited.

Although it went into effect in 2024, the law began with a grace period, in which municipalities could issue warnings, rather than citations. The law is now in full effect.

The law does not require that cities mark these 20-feet zones, and instead places the responsibility on driver to comply.

“In preparation for AB 413 taking effect,” said Kelli Maples, Coronado’s senior management analyst, “the city reviewed its streets last year for compliance and identified 13 locations where t-boxes, diagonal parking lines, blue zones, or conflicting markings were within the restricted areas. City staff subsequently removed the conflicting markings and signage in those locations.”

Maples said a review of traffic report found no recommendations related to pedestrian collisions caused by limited visibility, but that the city will continue to monitor reports and adjust intersection and street design if the city deems it necessary.

Curb extensions are another measure meant to enhance pedestrian safety. The city in 2023 installed them along Ocean Boulevard. The United States Department of Transportation reports that bulb-outs and other traffic-calming techniques decrease pedestrian collisions.

Violations of the daylighting law will yield a $65 fine, along with a $12.50 administrative fee.

Currently, 43 states have passed similar laws.

As the law does not require painted curbs, drivers must determine for themselves whether they are parked far enough from a crosswalk. The average car in the United States is 14.7 feet long, according to Cartelligent, so leaving a space of about one and a half car lengths before crosswalks without curb extensions is an easy metric for estimation.

TRICARE Online Patient Portal will decommission in April

The Department of Defense is shifting its online healthcare portal, and beneficiaries are encouraged to download their health records from the former system before it is decommissioned on April 1.

The TRICARE Online Patient Portal, or TOL, will be discontinued in favor of a new system, MHS Genesis. Beneficiaries can sign up for the new system here.

Healthcare providers will still have access to patients’ full health records. However, if patients would like their own copies, they must download them from TOL before April 1.

TRICARE has released instructions for downloading legacy health records. Read them here.

“All military hospitals and clinics have transitioned to MHS GENESIS,” said Rear Adm. Tracy Farrill, Principal Deputy, Assistant Director for Health Care Administration, and Military Health System EHR Functional Champion at the Defense Health Agency, in a statement. “We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions. Your medical history is a valuable resource for managing your health, and saving your records now ensures you have access if you need it.”",https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Orange-Ave-crosswalk-2024-06-17.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-22 10:56:29.261845

Prolonged use can result in many drug-related health issues, such as respiratory problems, liver and kidney damage, cardiovascular issues, brain damage, weakened immune system, gastrointestinal issues, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, psychosis, infectious diseases, and physical dependence. There are several types of drug rehab programs, including outpatient treatment services, residential inpatient treatment, drug detox programs, holistic therapies, dual diagnosis treatment, and aftercare support.

Health insurance coverage for drug rehab in Riverside County largely depends on your insurance policy and the specific facility. Covered services typically encompass medically supervised drug detoxification, inpatient rehabilitation, therapy, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for drug addiction, drug relapse prevention techniques, and drug counseling.

Even with health insurance assistance, you might still be responsible for certain out-of-pocket expenses, including deductibles, coinsurance, premiums, and copayments. Additionally, prior authorization may be required before you can begin your drug addiction recovery rehabilitation.

Health insurance often covers drug rehab treatment programs in Palm Desert, California; however, the details of this coverage can differ depending on the terms of your policy. Thankfully, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires insurance companies to include coverage for drug treatment programs.

It’s still possible that you might encounter out-of-pocket costs like copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. It’s crucial to fully understand your coverage before starting your drug dependency treatment. Please contact us at CA Behavioral for help confirming your coverage details and take the first step in becoming one of our drug recovery success stories.

TRICARE is a program administered by the United States Department of Defense designed specifically for active-duty military personnel and their dependents. Notable aspects of TRICARE’s drug rehabilitation services include inpatient and outpatient treatment services, drug detoxification, dual diagnosis treatment, and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

TRICARE is available to active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. As a government-funded health insurance initiative, it operates differently from the underwriting of conventional private insurance plans, such as indemnity agreements. While private insurers evaluate risks based on age and health, TRICARE eligibility is solely based on military service status without considering individual risk factors. Funded through federal resources, TRICARE generally does not use reinsurance or involve endorsements, umbrella policies, or insurance adjusters, though it may seek subrogation stemming from third parties’ liability.

Insured active-duty service members typically do not incur costs for drug treatment programs. However, other insured beneficiaries may need to manage out-of-pocket costs, including co-payments, premiums, or specific deductibles. The fees, determined by an actuary, will vary according to your policy. To minimize claims expenses, seeking treatment from in-network providers is essential. Some services may require prior authorization before treatment can begin, and unanticipated peril may present risks of loss. Furthermore, TRICARE may have coverage exclusions, such as lavish rehabilitation facilities and new treatment plans.

To secure TRICARE drug rehab coverage for drug rehabilitation in Palm Desert, California, follow these basic steps. First, verify your TRICARE coverage. Next, obtain a referral from your primary care provider (PCP) or secure prior authorization documentation. After that, select a drug treatment center that accepts TRICARE, and ensure you meet all TRICARE’s eligibility requirements.

It’s essential to recognize that your TRICARE plan may involve cost-sharing, copayments, or deductibles, so be aware of your overall expenses before starting drug dependency rehab. You must keep diligent records by saving copies of all submitted documentation. Drug treatment centers that accept TRICARE, like CA Behavioral, can assist you in navigating the approval process. You have the legal right to appeal the decision if your coverage is denied. Additionally, you can present a claim settlement to reimburse expenses if you have already completed your rehab.",https://cabehavioral.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tricare-insurance.png,N,1.0,2025-03-22 11:56:34.860726

The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Inflated its Revenue and Filed False Claims

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On March 11, 2025 , Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military. On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025 .

What Now : You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Zynex, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 19, 2025 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery.
