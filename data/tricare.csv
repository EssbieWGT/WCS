The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe.
The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare.
The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility.
The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel.","Although the Defense Authorization Act signed by former President Biden blocks the U.S. Military’s healthcare system from providing specialized treatments to the transgender children of service members, three families are suing the Department of Defense (DOD) to reinstate the benefit, claiming they have been left with “significant” and “crushing out-of-pocket costs.” Leftist groups were outraged when the measure passed late last year and called on Biden to veto it because it bans the military’s Tricare Health Plan from covering gender-affirming care such as hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants to treat “gender dysphoria.” An analysis cited by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a leader in the campaign opposing the military’s transgender healthcare ban, estimates that 2,500 minor patients receive care for gender dysphoria through Tricare and 900 get puberty-suppressants or gender-affirming hormones.

In their lawsuit against the DOD military personnel with transgender children claim that Tricare’s sudden refusal to cover medically necessary care has inflicted profound harm and that plaintiffs’ families now face significant and crushing out-of-pocket costs. “This is not an abstract policy shift – it is an immediate and devastating disruption of essential health care that affects the physical and psychological well-being of plaintiffs and other young people throughout the country,” according to the complaint filed this month by two LGBTQ+ rights groups on behalf of the families. The transgender patients are not named to protect their privacy and are identified in the complaint as Diana Doe, Nathan Noe, and Parker Poe. The first two were taking hormones prescribed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland and were recently told by doctors that the treatments would no longer be covered under Tricare. The third plaintiff, Poe, is identified in the lawsuit as a young adult who has been taking testosterone covered by Tricare at an unnamed medical facility. Without Tricare coverage the testosterone prescription is “too expensive to purchase out-of-pocket,” the complaint states, adding that the “process has resulted in unnecessary stress and panic.”

Servicemembers and their families have been able to obtain puberty blockers or cross-sex hormone therapy for their transgender children through the military insurance for nearly a decade, one of the LGBTQ+ groups that filed the lawsuit writes in a statement that blames President Trump for ordering the DOD to terminate the essential care. “As a result of the Trump administration’s directive, the families’ trusted doctors cannot provide ongoing care and families are unfairly forced to take on this financial burden,” according to the group, which accuses the Trump administration of waging a relentless assault on transgender Americans and issuing a barrage of discriminatory executive orders designed to strip away their basic legal rights and deny them recognition. The reality is that the defense bill signed by Biden back in December 2024 bans gender-affirming care for transgender youth whose parents are active-duty military personnel. Leftist groups like the ACLU mounted a campaign to pressure Biden to veto the bill, but he signed it even though it prohibits insurance coverage for “medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria,” including the hormone therapy and puberty-suppressants taken by the minors in this lawsuit.",https://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/JW_2025Template_CorruptionChronicles-Logo_09.12_1200x627_v1.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-09-12 13:56:12.654193

Of the different types of health insurance coverage, employment-based insurance was the most common, covering 53.8% of the population for some or all of the year, followed by Medicare (19.1%), Medicaid (17.6%), direct-purchase coverage (10.7%), TRICARE (2.8%), and VA and CHAMPVA coverage (1.2%).
Meanwhile, the 2024 public coverage rate was 0.8 percentage points lower than the rate in 2023.
CBO estimates that the law will increase the number of people without health insurance by 10.9 million in 2034.
Changes to Medicaid would be expected to increase the number of people without health insurance by 7.8 million in 2034.","About 8% of Americans were uninsured in 2024, a rate that held fairly steady over the preceding year, according to new federal data released by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Ninety-two percent were enrolled in some sort of coverage last year, representing about 310 million people. Private health insurance coverage continued to be more prevalent than public coverage, at 66.1% and 35.5%, respectively.

Of the different types of health insurance coverage, employment-based insurance was the most common, covering 53.8% of the population for some or all of the year, followed by Medicare (19.1%), Medicaid (17.6%), direct-purchase coverage (10.7%), TRICARE (2.8%), and VA and CHAMPVA coverage (1.2%).

The private coverage rate increased from 2023 to 2024 by 0.7 percentage points, driven by an increase in direct purchase coverage, the report found.

Meanwhile, the 2024 public coverage rate was 0.8 percentage points lower than the rate in 2023. This decrease, the report found, was driven by a change in Medicaid coverage, which was 1.3 percentage points lower in 2024.

Medicare coverage and VA and CHAMPVA coverage rates both increased from 2023 to 2024.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT

Separately, KFF released an analysis of the Census Bureau data, finding that certain provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would likely increase the uninsured rate over the next 10 years.

While robust Marketplace enrollment helped keep the uninsured rate low in 2024, the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits for Marketplace enrollees, which will happen at the end of 2025 unless Congress acts to extend them, will increase the number of people without health insurance, KFF said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act imposes new work requirements and more frequent eligibility determinations for some Medicaid enrollees, and limits how states can finance their share of Medicaid spending. It also restricts immigrant eligibility for both Medicaid and the subsidized Marketplace coverage, and according to KFF, will make it harder for people to renew Marketplace coverage and enroll in coverage following a change in circumstances.

CBO estimates that the law will increase the number of people without health insurance by 10.9 million in 2034.

""This projected increase in the number of people who are uninsured would reverse more than a decade of coverage gains under the ACA,"" KFF wrote. ""The impact on access and affordability of healthcare will be significant for those who lose coverage, leading to reduced use of health services, increased financial burden and medical debt, and worse health outcomes.""

THE LARGER TREND

On top of the 10.9 million people projected to lose coverage due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, CBO estimated in June that another 16 million people would lose health insurance by 2034 under policies affecting the Affordable Care Act. These include the elimination of the premium tax credit at the end of 2025 and the implementation of a proposed Department of Health and Human Services rule regarding coverage that is included in HR 1.

If more people are uninsured, that in turn would add to the amount of uncompensated care for hospitals, CBO said.

Changes to Medicaid would be expected to increase the number of people without health insurance by 7.8 million in 2034. The increase is due to several proposed provisions, including work requirements.

Few of those disenrolled from Medicaid would have access to employment-based coverage, and none would be eligible for the premium tax credit, the CBO said.",http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/hfn/files/2025-09/Patient_Receptionist_Luis%20Alvarez_Getty%20Images.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-12 11:56:08.293547

Overseas coverage is via TRICARE Prime/Prime Remote Overseas (AD & command-sponsored family) and TRICARE Select Overseas (for other eligible beneficiaries).
The Foreign Medical Program (FMP) The Foreign Medical Program helps veterans who live or travel abroad receive care for service-connected conditions.","Understanding your veteran insurance options is the first step to making confident healthcare decisions. Between TRICARE, VA medical benefits, and the Foreign Medical Program (FMP), each serves a different purpose. Add in the complexity of military health benefits, and many veterans wonder which program actually works best for their situation, especially when living or traveling abroad.

Choosing the right coverage affects more than paperwork, it directly impacts your access to care, wait times, and financial peace of mind. For veterans balancing service-connected conditions, family needs, or even a move overseas, knowing how each program works is essential.

The Complexity of Military Health Benefits

For many veterans, terms like TRICARE, VA healthcare, and FMP sound similar, but they serve different groups:

TRICARE is mainly for active-duty, retirees, and their families.

VA healthcare is for eligible veterans living in the U.S. Veterans living abroad can still use VA facilities when in the U.S.

The Foreign Medical Program supports veterans living internationally (or traveling internationally) with service-connected conditions from 0% to 100% (and conditions medically associated with/aggravating those), or care while participating in VR&E. It does not cover care in the U.S. or U.S. territories. Veterans should register for FMP (you don’t have to be enrolled in VA health care to register).

Common Questions Veterans and Families Face

Am I covered if I live abroad?

Do I need more than one program?

Can I use these benefits at a veteran clinic overseas?

What happens if I need specialized care not available at home?

What TRICARE Covers

TRICARE is the healthcare program for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide.

Eligibility for TRICARE

Active-duty service members

Military Retirees

Certain National Guard/Reserve members

Eligible dependents

TRICARE it is not a general veteran benefit after separation (unless retired or otherwise eligible)

Services and Limitations

TRICARE offers a broad scope of services, but costs and networks vary depending on your status. While it covers care abroad, it is not available to every veteran, especially those separated from service without retiree status.

Overseas coverage is via TRICARE Prime/Prime Remote Overseas (AD & command-sponsored family) and TRICARE Select Overseas (for other eligible beneficiaries).

The Foreign Medical Program (FMP)

The Foreign Medical Program helps veterans who live or travel abroad receive care for service-connected conditions.

Who Qualifies for FMP

Any veteran with a VA-rated service-connected condition (even with a 0% rating) getting care outside the U.S. may qualify for FMP coverage for that condition (registration required).

Care Abroad Through the FMP

The program allows veterans to access approved treatment overseas. Clinics experienced with FMP documentation (like our teams in the Dominican Republic) can help veterans with the paperwork, making care seamless. Providers can bill FMP directly; if they don’t, the veteran pays and files for reimbursement. Claims must be filed within 2 years of care.",https://veteranscareinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/veteran-insurance-options.avif,N,0.0,2025-09-12 11:56:13.996765

As far as TRICARE goes, I'd at least enroll yourself to maintain coverage and eligibility. Search the rates for single sponsorship coverage for medical retirees, should be under 100 a month (my family plan is 96 a month). I've used TRICARE many times for medicine coverage when given meds by community care, the ER, etc. and it's damn good for that.

If you don't enroll you'll only be eligible to enroll during open season enrollment periods, and if it was me I'd want as much coverage as possible even if the vast majority is redundant. Another benefit of TRICARE (I highly recommend Select, not Prime!) is that you can see a doctor very quickly usually on the doctor's availability. Prime you need to see a doctor to verify medical necessity of any specialists, Select you can cut the middle man out and go straight to the specialist.

A good example of this being useful was when I had a random throat closing episode. Had to go to the ER. Closest VA appt was 4 months out. I called up TRICARE Select, I was able to see an ENT doctor in 3 days. 50 dollar copay for the visit after x-rays and prescription.

That is the main benefit of TRICARE coverage imo, its speed.

You could enroll into the Tricare Retiree program but you’d have to pay into that. Prime is good if you want to be seen in the MTF but Select is also good because you can just get seen out in town without an authorization, as long as the facility is within the Tricare network. If you have TriWest with the VA, Tricare will be the last insurance you can use and will be the last to get billed. Usually TriWest is really good at covering the costs though. Keep in mind you can only be on one Tricare plan. So you can be under the Retiree program and pay into it, or be under your wife and not pay for it. Hope that helps",,N,0.0,2025-09-12 06:56:11.338356

Seventeen Democrats voted to advance the bill despite this.
“I want to make sure we understand some broad themes—why these amendments are problematic,” said Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington.
Reps. Fields and Figures approved the proposed trans care funding ban for Tricare, but not the other amendments—including the similar care regulation on the EFMP.
Ultimately, 37 Democratic senators voted in favor of that NDAA with that anti-trans provision intact.","Six anti-trans amendments were added to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on Wednesday, Sept. 10, during a Congressional debate over the routine greenlighting of the defense budget. Seventeen Democrats voted to advance the bill despite this.

The provisions include two all-ages health insurance restrictions for trans service members and their families, who are already being forced out of the military; a rule barring cadets assigned male at birth from any “athletic program or activity” for women, functioning as a sort of military-grade anti-trans sports ban; a “trans bathroom ban” for all single-sex military facilities, including housing and locker rooms; the exclusion of gender identity from military surveys; and a functional ban on Pride flags at all Department of War (deadname: “Defense”) workplaces.

If signed into law, most trans-affirming care will be defunded for those on Tricare and the Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP).

“I want to make sure we understand some broad themes—why these amendments are problematic,” said Rep. Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington.

“The transgender community has been targeted and discriminated against aggressively,” he said in a speech on the floor. “This is exactly what these amendments are about—a right-wing culture war.”

Four of amendments—including one of the anti-gender affirming care provisions, the sex segregation of athletics, the rule against trans-inclusive surveys and the anti-trans facilities policy—were introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, who spewed anti-trans slurs onto the House floor. The Trump acolyte is also running for South Carolina Governor.

Some of the worst offenders were Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina, both of whom voted in favor of all six provisions. Rep. Adam Gray voted for all of them except the flag ban, and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted in favor of the restrictions on health care and military athletics.

Reps. Fields and Figures approved the proposed trans care funding ban for Tricare, but not the other amendments—including the similar care regulation on the EFMP.

Meanwhile, the athletics provision was also supported by Democratic Reps. Laura Gillen, John Mannion and Tom Suozzi of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Susie Lee of Nevada; and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Kim Schrier of Washington.

""The Democrats who voted for the anti-trans NDAA amendments are out of line if they think throwing military families under the bus will win them votes,” said Tyler Hack, Executive Director of The Christopher Street Project, a group dedicated to supporting trans-friendly Democrats in elections. “Now is not a time for leaders to capitulate to this disgraceful attempt to erase trans people from existence and erode the fundamental rights for anyone who doesn't fit MAGA's ideal.”

All the amendments passed via a voice vote, but Democratic representatives insisted on a roll-call vote, where despite the anti-trans amendments, at least 17 Democrats voted to advance the full NDAA bill with the provisions included.

The December iteration of the NDAA also included language targeting what Senator Tammy Baldwin called “servicemembers’ parental rights to access medically necessary health care for their transgender children.” She and 24 other Democrats pushed for an amendment to block the anti-trans language, but a vote on that provision was sidestepped by Senate leadership—which, at the time, was controlled by Democrats. As Erin in the Morning reported, they refused to let the amendment even come to a vote. Ultimately, 37 Democratic senators voted in favor of that NDAA with that anti-trans provision intact.

“The National Defense Authorization Act has traditionally received strong bipartisan support, yet for the second Congress in a row House Republicans have tainted a bill aimed at improving the lives of servicemembers with poison-pill riders that threaten our troops’ rights, their families’ stability, and our efforts to retain top talent,” said Rep. Mark Takano, a California Democrat and Chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, as per Bluesky.

“Republicans’ sacrifice of a strong bipartisan vote for a politicized NDAA to appease the Trump Administration and a small slice of their base cannot undo the sacrifice of the transgender servicemembers, cadets, or military dependents that will be hurt by this bill.”

The debates were marked by a sense of chaos on the House Floor, which transpired as news permeated about the assasination of the ultra-conservative and anti-trans pundit Charlie Kirk.

GOP congressmembers tried to stop Rep. Maxine Dexter of Oregon from even holding a Pride flag while speaking out in support of LGBTQ servicemembers. Rep. Sara Jacobs of California countered anti-trans rhetoric by drawing attention to the many kinds of gender-affirming care commonly provided to cisgender people, such as Botox, but Rep. Mace began yelling and posted on social media that Jacobs, who is Jewish, needs a “nose job.”",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1603119761708-9252f043c139?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxjb25ncmVzc3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3NTc2MDA4ODF8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080,N,0.0,2025-09-11 22:56:08.230843

“Filler is gender-affirming care,” she continued.
“Boob jobs is gender-affirming care.
Botox is gender-affirming care.
You are an insult.” A clip of Jacobs’ remarks — and Mace’s tantrum in response — has been widely shared on social media.","U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) lashed out at Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.), an LGBTQ ally whose brother is transgender, after Jacobs criticized Republicans for introducing a series of anti-transgender amendments to the annual National Defense Authorization Act.

Several of the amendments — including some introduced by Mace herself — target gender-affirming care for transgender service members. One Mace-backed measure would bar TRICARE, the military’s health insurance program, from covering gender-affirming treatments.

“I would just like to point out that it’s interesting my colleague from South Carolina is so obsessed with the issue of trans people, using horrible slurs to talk about them, when many people in this body have received gender-affirming care,” Jacobs said on the House floor.

“Filler is gender-affirming care,” she continued. “Boob jobs is gender-affirming care. Botox is gender-affirming care. Lots of my colleagues have received gender-affirming care, and let me be clear, I think everybody should have access to the gender-affirming care they need, and I think that we should respect everybody in this country.”

According to The Hill, Mace — no longer recognized for debate and standing elsewhere on the floor — allegedly yelled at Jacobs for making comments about “my body.”

“Ridiculous,” Mace shouted. “You are absolutely ridiculous. What the hell is your problem?… You are disgusting. You are an insult.”

A clip of Jacobs’ remarks — and Mace’s tantrum in response — has been widely shared on social media.

Jacobs asked that Mace’s words be stricken from the official record, but presiding officers rejected the request, arguing that Mace was not recognized when she lashed out at the California Democrat.

It remains unclear why Mace believed Jacobs was referring to her personally. Some online commenters — including Mace’s former communications director — have speculated she has had cosmetic surgery, according to The List, an entertainment and celebrity news site. Those rumors have not been verified.

Mace, who has recently made opposition to transgender rights central to her political identity, scolded Jacobs on X and invoked her status as a sexual assault survivor in response to the criticism.

“To @RepSaraJacobs, I talk about women’s safety and your response is commentary about my body on the House floor. If you knew anything about survivors you would know some women change their bodies because of the trauma of sexual violence. They live with the consequences for a lifetime,” Mace wrote.

Mace then added, “PS – I have a good surgeon if you ever want to get your nose done.” Critics noted the remark targeted Jacobs, who is Jewish, and echoed anti-Semitic tropes about Jewish women’s appearance.

A day later, the Nexus Project — an Israeli nonprofit that says it combats anti-Semitism — lightly chastised Mace on Bluesky: “We call on all members of Congress manage to refrain from antisemitic, schoolyard bullying about their Jewish colleagues’ noses generally, and especially in a post about respecting women’s bodies.”

No other major anti-Semitism watchdog groups publicly defended Jacobs or condemned Mace’s remark.

Jacobs did not respond to the anti-Semitic trope, but she did reply to a separate X post in which Mace claimed, “there is no such thing as a ‘trans child.'”

“I feel sad for you,” wrote Jacobs. “Stop lashing out against trans kids and pretending it’s to ‘protect women.’ Hope you get the help you need.”",https://www.metroweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Nancy-Mace-Sara-Jacobs-Official-Portraits.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-11 22:56:17.578101

Program Origin

ILER was approved in January 2013 as a Joint Incentive Fund initiative to support White House Presidential directives for managing beneficiary and deployment health needs.

What ILER Is:

ILER is a secure, centralized system that gathers and integrates data from multiple sources.

Information includes unit assignments, deployment records, environmental monitoring systems, and known hazard reports.

The ILER platform provides consolidated, career-long exposure information that’s been submitted for individual service members. Exposures may have occurred in combat zones, during training, or in garrison environments.

Privacy and data security are central to ILER’s design.

Access is strictly limited to authorized DOW and VA personnel and is governed by robust federal data protection standards.

For veterans, ILER can play a vital role in the VA disability claims process.

ILER helps verify exposure history, especially when a veteran’s recollections can be confirmed with documented environmental or unit-based data.

Ultimately, ILER is a major step forward in the military’s commitment to lifelong care for service members and veterans. By improving how we track, understand and respond to environmental and occupational exposures, ILER helps us recognize and better support service member and veteran’s health concerns.

The Steube amendment was made part of the larger National Defense Authorization Act, which now goes to the Senate for consideration.","Arlington, Va. -- The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Sept. 10 to approve a plan to restore chiropractic services at more than a dozen U.S. military bases where services have been arbitrarily discontinued. The action is consistent with the Defense Health Agency’s (DHA) ongoing concern over the use of opioids by active-duty members of the military and calls to make non-addictive alternatives for pain management more readily available to military personnel.

The amendment was introduced by Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.). It reflects upon the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act (Public Law 106-398), which in 2001 established the original chiropractic benefit in the Department of Defense's healthcare system.

The Steube amendment responds to chiropractic clinic closures over the past year caused by contracts with participating doctors of chiropractic being allowed to elapse. It calls on DHA to develop a plan to reopen closed clinics and to explore the feasibility of putting chiropractors stationed at military facilities in the federal General Schedule (GS) system. The amendment also directs DHA to report back to the House and Senate on its progress by March 31, 2026.

Surveys show chiropractic services are highly valued at U.S. military facilities. Reports show that these clinics provide proven, cost-effective care to hundreds of patients monthly, offering a range of non-drug services to address painful musculoskeletal conditions commonly experienced by members of the military and enabling them to return to service.

“We thank Rep. Steube for his foresight to tackle this issue and we also acknowledge House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) for his long-standing support of chiropractic in the military,” said John Falardeau, American Chiropractic Association (ACA) senior vice president of public policy and advocacy.

A four-year clinical trial conducted at several military sites—the largest chiropractic clinical trial on record—showed evidence that chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity in active-duty personnel. The results of the trial, published in 2018 by JAMA Network Open, served as additional support for the inclusion of chiropractic services as a component of multidisciplinary health care for back pain, as currently recommended by existing guidelines.

The Steube amendment was made part of the larger National Defense Authorization Act, which now goes to the Senate for consideration. ACA will be working with senators to ensure the provision remains in the final defense package.

Walter Reed Leads the Way in Integrating Pain and Substance Use Disorder Care

By Roan Smith, WRNMMC Office of Command Communications

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center recently hosted a Pain Care Skills training and Substance Use Disorder Care event in Washington, DC. For the first time they merged two traditionally separate annual events with the intent to gather international experts and military professionals with a shared goal: improving pain management for service members, veterans and war-impacted civilians.

Effective pain care is directly tied to readiness, recovery and quality of life—not only for active-duty service members preparing to return to duty, but also for veterans and civilian patients who look to Walter Reed for presidential-level care.

This year’s training brought together military and civilian providers from across the country, with both in-person and virtual sessions designed to improve how providers treat pain and prevent substance use disorder.

By integrating substance use disorder and pain treatment, Walter Reed is modeling a new standard of care that not only serves military beneficiaries but also influences best practices across health systems.

“We’re really leading the Military Health System—and even the civilian communities—in integrating care for both substance use disorder and pain,” said Dr. Christopher Spevak, director of the National Capital Region’s (NCR) Opioid Safey Program and the deputy director of the NCR’s Pain Initiative and Wounded Warrior Pain Care Initiative. “By bringing these groups together, it becomes a force multiplier in terms of taking care of patients.”

The symposium combined nine virtual meetings and 24 in-person workshops, creating a blended model of education that brought together internationally recognized experts and hands-on training. Online sessions included topics such as Dopamine Nation and the Pleasure-Pain Balance by Dr. Anna Lembke of Stanford, An Overview of the Management of Benzodiazepine Use Disorder by Dr. Logan Adam, and Artificial Technology in Pain Medicine: Transforming Assessment and Treatment Through Technology. In-Person workshops provided practical skills in therapists ranging from battlefield acupuncture and medical hypnosis to musculoskeletal ultrasound, art therapy, dry needling and cupping.

“This blended format allows us to reach a wide audience while ensuring providers gain practical, skills-based training,” said Spevak. “It’s something that isn’t being modeled anywhere else.”

This year also featured the International Pain Working Group, which brought together military physicians from partner nations including Germany, France, Georgia, and Australia. The group aims to share best practices, collaborate on research and improve pain care for service members worldwide.

Lt. Col Alex Kumar, the U.K.’s defense medical services lead for pain managements, stressed the importance of empathy in caring for services members.

“It’s about empathy, it’s about communication,” said Kumar. “Especially for the military population — these people have put their lives at risk. So, it is our duty to give them the best possible care we can.”

The training also showcased lessons from the battlefield. Dr. Marshall Bedder, a former Navy commander described his deployment experience. “In Kandahar in 2014, all battlefield injuries were treated by medics with nasal ketamine, and we had amazing success with that,” said Bedder. “This ability to use a nasal mister is so simple.”

By blending clinical research, real-world lessons, and hands-on skills, this year’s Pain Care Skills Training reinforced Walter Reed’s Leadership in advancing pain care across military health system and beyond.

Walter Reed’s Pain Management team continues to deliver world-class care that supports the readiness of our force and he health of our community. For more information about Walter Reed’s Pain Management Clinic talk to your primary care provider.

If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.
So, Americans with “creditable” coverage can apply for a Medicare Part D plan at a later date without paying a penalty.
(Chapter 5 of the Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).
Medicare calculates the Part D penalty by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium” ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months you didn’t have either Part D or creditable coverage and rounding to the nearest 10 cents.","UNITED STATES—Hello Toni: When I turned 65 in May 2024, I continued to work full-time with a health savings account HSA as my employer benefits and use GoodRX to cover prescriptions. My employer’s human resources manager advised me to enroll in Medicare Part A when I turned 65, which was not correct information because I could not fund my HSA from the time I enrolled in Medicare Part A. When I retire at 70 is when I will enroll in Medicare Part B.

Now I am experiencing a Medicare issue and need guidance, Toni. In July, I applied on medicare.gov for a Medicare Part D plan to begin Aug. 1 because I am now taking an expensive blood pressure prescription that GoodRX does not cover which costs over $650 a month.

I just received a notice from Medicare saying they do not have a record of me having prescription drug coverage that “met Medicare’s minimum standards” from 5/1/2024 to 7/31/2025, and I will receive a Part D late enrollment penalty. What does this mean?

Toni…Thank you in advance,

Don from Charlotte, NC

Don: I do not have good news for you. You have a Medicare Part D prescription drug penalty problem because you did not enroll in a Medicare Part D plan at the right time when your Part A began 5/1/2024. Unfortunately, prescription discount programs — such as GoodRx, Single Care, AmazonRX or store prescription memberships such as Walmart, Kroger, etc., are not considered “creditable” coverage which is why you will be receiving Medicare’s late enrollment penalty (LEP).

The Medicare & You handbook states: Creditable prescription drug coverage could include drug coverage from a current or former employer or union, TRICARE, Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or individual health insurance coverage. If you go 63 days or more in a row without Medicare drug coverage or other creditable prescription drug coverage, you may have to pay a penalty if you sign up for Medicare drug coverage later.

So, Americans with “creditable” coverage can apply for a Medicare Part D plan at a later date without paying a penalty. (Chapter 5 of the Medicare Survival Guide Advanced edition explains Medicare Part D and how to avoid Part D penalties).

The Late Enrollment Penalty (LEP) when applying for Medicare Part D can be applied if:

— You are older than 65, retiring and leaving employer benefits and waited more than 63 days without creditable prescription drug coverage to enroll in Part D. (Filing Medicare forms with Social Security does not inform Medicare that you had creditable prescription drug coverage. Do not wait to enroll in a Part D plan.)

–Your prescription drug benefit (not health benefits) is not creditable as Medicare defines it.

–You never enrolled in Medicare Part D when first eligible for Medicare.

Medicare calculates the Part D penalty by multiplying 1% of the “national base beneficiary premium” ($36.78 in 2025) by the number of full, uncovered months you didn’t have either Part D or creditable coverage and rounding to the nearest 10 cents. That amount is added to your monthly Part D premium.

Your late enrollment period (LEP) does not begin from the day you lose or leave your company health plan, but from the month your Medicare Part A started. So, Don, your 14 months without creditable coverage will cost you an extra $5.15 per month plus the Part D premium for 2025. The national base amount can change each year, so your penalty will change and NEVER go away.

Remember with Medicare what you don’t know that WILL hurt you! Please enroll in Medicare Part D whether you are taking prescriptions or not.

”At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own.

Army Heat Center S. Army Heat Center HPRC (WHEC resource hub): https://www.hprc-online.org/resources-partners/whec ***","Newswise — Bethesda, Md. — The Uniformed Services University (USU), in partnership with the U.S. Army Heat Center and other Department of Defense collaborators, has released the a recently updated standardized Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Management of Exertional Rhabdomyolysis (ER) in Warfighters. Developed through USU’s Consortium for Health and Military Performance (CHAMP) and the Warfighter Heat- and Exertion-Related Events Collaborative (WHEC), this guideline provides military clinicians with a critical, evidence-based framework to identify, manage, and return Service Members to duty following this potentially dangerous condition.

Exertional rhabdomyolysis—muscle breakdown caused by strenuous activity—can escalate quickly to serious complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI). The updated guideline standardizes recognition, risk stratification, treatment, and return-to-duty (RTD) decisions across the Military Health System, ensuring timely and consistent care while protecting Service Members and strengthening operational readiness. Importantly, while designed with Warfighters in mind, the principles outlined in the guideline also have broad application for civilian populations—including athletes, first responders, and others who engage in intense physical activity.

“We are very pleased to release this 2025 Rhabdomyolysis CPG update, which presents multiple significant changes and additions from our 2020 product,” said Dr. Francis O’Connor, professor of Military and Emergency Medicine and medical director of CHAMP. “Our joint service team of DoD providers, representing hundreds of years of military relevant experience, has worked very hard to share the most current evidence-based information to our military colleagues to optimize the diagnosis and initial management of warfighters impacted by exertional rhabdomyolysis, and importantly, facilitate return to duty decisions.”

The extensively updated guideline sets a clear standard for diagnosing exertional rhabdomyolysis, helping doctors recognize the condition earlier and with greater accuracy. It also gives medical teams a way to quickly sort patients into low-, or high-risk categories to assist in both initial management and return to duty decisions. High-risk warning signs include significantly elevated muscle enzyme levels, signs of dangerous muscle pressure inside the muscles (compartment syndrome), lab results that show kidney damage, very dark urine, serious chemical imbalances in the blood, or having the sickle cell trait. Another important tool introduced in this update is the McMahon Score, which combines lab results and patient information to help predict the chance of severe kidney injury or the need for dialysis. Patients are also considered higher risk if their situation makes it hard to ensure close medical follow-up.

For patients who need to be admitted to the hospital, the guideline recommends treatments that protect the kidneys and close monitoring for those at moderate to high risk of complications. For patients who can be managed outside the hospital, it provides a clear step-by-step approach focused on staying well-hydrated, limiting activity, and coming back for a check-up within 24–72 hours. This outpatient pathway is especially important for lower-risk cases or when exertional rhabdomyolysis is suspected but not yet confirmed.

Decisions about returning to duty are guided by a gradual, staged process. Low-risk patients start with rest, fluids, and careful monitoring, then slowly move through reconditioning phases until they can safely return to full activity if symptoms don’t return. Patients at higher risk, or those who experience the condition more than once, require a tailored plan that involves input from medical specialists. To support clinicians in these decisions, the guideline includes practical tools such as step-by-step flow charts, a glossary of terms, and appendices that address duty profiles, return-to-duty guidance, and medical coding.

”At the Army Heat Center, we frequently see cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, either secondary to heat illness or on its own. Unlike exertional heat stroke, prior to the development of this CPG, return-to-duty guidance was lacking,” said Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) David DeGroot, director of the Army Heat Center. “Now, providers have a resource to help as they work to return the injured warfighter to duty as quickly as possible but without jeopardizing their health or increasing risk of reoccurrence.”

The CPG is designed for use by military primary care, emergency medicine, sports medicine, and operational clinicians, as well as command medical leaders overseeing training, selection, and deployment cycles. Civilian clinicians may also find it a valuable reference when treating exertional rhabdomyolysis in athletic or occupational settings.

The House voted 231-196 to pass the legislation, with four Republicans voting against it: Reps. Tim Burchett, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Anna Paulina Luna and Thomas Massie. Seventeen Democrats voted in support. The massive bill authorizes $848 billion in defense spending for fiscal year 2026.

“We didn’t get any of the amendments and the debates that we wanted; not a single solitary one,” Rep. Adam Smith, the ranking member of the House Armed Services committee, said, according to Politico. “Meanwhile, all manner of different issues that are pure culture war partisan issues were allowed in. I fear that many of those are going to pass.”

The NDAA struggled to gain popularity among Democrats within the Armed Services Committee, but still ultimately passed out of committee by a vote of 55-2, even after several provisions were added to block gender-affirming medical care from being accepted under Tricare and an amendment to repeal the 1991 and 2002 laws authorizing the use of military force.

Republicans were eager to tout the legislation passing, though it still has to pass the Senate.

“The FY-26 [defense authorization bill] cuts red tape, streamlines bureaucracy, and refocuses acquisition on its most important mission: getting our warfighters what they need when they need it,” Rep. Mike Rogers, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the policy bill ensures American “military forces remain the most lethal in the world and can deter any adversary.”

“This legislation advances President Trump and House Republicans’ Peace Through Strength Agenda by codifying 15 of President Trump’s executive orders, ending woke ideology at the Pentagon, securing the border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and restoring the warrior ethos,” Johnson said in a statement.

The bill now heads to conference with the Senate later this year.

“I came to Congress to make sure our military has what it needs to fight and win, and that our servicemembers and their families are never taken for granted,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “While there is more work to do as the bill heads to conference, I will continue fighting to ensure the final NDAA keeps America’s Navy the strongest in the world and delivers for the men and women who call Hampton Roads home.”

The FY26 NDAA carries forward President Trump’s peace through strength agenda while addressing the urgent needs of servicemembers and their families. It supports a 3.8% pay raise, expands military bonuses and special pays, reforms the Basic Needs Allowance by removing Base Allowance for Housing (BAH) from income calculations, and invests over $1.4 billion in new barracks and family housing construction. The bill strengthens healthcare access by preventing cuts to military medical billets, authorizing major hospital renovations, improving TRICARE coverage for pregnant women and reservists, and expanding mental health services and studies, including a new longitudinal review of traumatic brain injuries and the unique impacts of G-force exposure on military pilots. It also expands commissary and MWR access to civil service mariners and increases childcare resources, with more than $361 million authorized for new childcare centers.

“As a proud Navy veteran, military spouse, and Mom, I know that taking care of our servicemembers and their families is the foundation of our national defense,” said Congresswoman Kiggans. “This year’s NDAA delivers for Hampton Roads by strengthening naval aviation and shipbuilding, protecting access to quality health care for military children, and ensuring the quality-of-life our troops and families deserve. I’m proud to have secured these wins for Virginia’s Second District and for servicemembers around the globe.”

The NDAA ensures Hampton Roads remains at the forefront of America’s naval readiness. It requires the Navy to provide a detailed plan for basing F-35C squadrons, advances shipyard modernization through cost-saving software evaluation, and authorizes over $22 billion in new shipbuilding, including a Columbia-class submarine, Virginia-class submarine, and Ford-class aircraft carrier. The bill also establishes a National Commission on the Maritime Industrial Base to recommend policies that revitalize American shipbuilding and protect long-term naval readiness.

Congresswoman Kiggans also secured several floor amendment victories that directly support servicemembers and their families. These include new protections requiring timely electronic notices for TRICARE beneficiaries before coverage transitions, stronger oversight of PCS reimbursements and the family impacts of frequent moves, and reforms to make housing allowances more responsive to rising costs of living. She advanced provisions to implement GAO’s recommendations on improving military housing, authorized cost-plus contracts to accelerate shipyard infrastructure modernization, and required reports on installing rotary-wing collision avoidance systems to enhance aviator safety.

Yet the Defense Health Agency has terminated coverage of weight-loss medications for 2.5 million Medicare-eligible veterans in Tricare for Life — the Tricare plan for Medicare-eligible military retirees and their Medicare-eligible family members — while continuing to cover the exact same prescriptions for younger retirees.

This is not just unfair, it is unlawful.

In 2001, Congress ended decades of second-class treatment for older retirees with the creation of the Senior Pharmacy Program, guaranteeing Medicare-eligible retirees the same pharmacy coverage as younger beneficiaries.

Lawmakers also restored full Tricare eligibility for those enrolling in Medicare Part B. The intent was clear: Service members would no longer see benefits curtailed simply because they turned 65.

A governing statute — 10 U.S.C. § 1074g — reinforces that commitment by requiring a uniform formulary of covered drugs for all beneficiaries.

The Defense Department’s own 2002 rule was equally unambiguous, promising Medicare-eligible retirees “the same coverage for pharmacy services and the same requirements for cost-sharing and reimbursement.”

For more than 20 years, that promise held. When I turned 65, nothing changed: same formulary, same co-pays, same access. Until now.

DOD’s misreading

The Defense Health Agency now claims authority to deny Tricare for Life beneficiaries coverage for GLP-1 medications by invoking 32 C.F.R. § 199.17(f)(3), a regulation stating that treatment of obesity is covered under Tricare Prime and Select “notwithstanding” a statutory exclusion that applied to dependents in § 1079(a)(10).

The logic is tortured. First, § 1079(a)(10) governs dependent coverage, not retiree benefits.

The obesity exclusion was added in the 1970s to prevent the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniform Services (CHAMPUS) from paying for elective weight-loss clinics for spouses and children, not to deny treatment to retirees themselves.

Second, DOD’s own regulation at § 199.17(a)(6)(ii)(C) flatly states that Tricare for Life is “unaffected by this section.”

In plain English: The regulation DHA cites does not apply to Tricare for Life.

Third, when Congress addressed obesity treatment in the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, it did so by authorizing programs for all “covered beneficiaries,” not by singling out Prime and Select.

The Pentagon elected to implement that authority narrowly — it was not required. That choice cannot override a statutory command for a uniform formulary.

The human cost

This is not an abstract dispute. It is a matter of health and dignity for older veterans.

Without coverage, the monthly cost for me and every other retiree on TFL ranges from $499 at best to $1,349 at retail.

On a fixed retirement income, that is devastating.

Meanwhile, a 64-year-old retiree on Tricare Select pays a $35 co-pay for the same drug. The only difference between us is that I lived long enough to become Medicare-eligible.

And it is cruelly targeted. Older adults are more likely to suffer from obesity, less able to lose weight through exercise, and least able to absorb thousands of dollars in new drug costs.

Many suffer mobility issues caused by service-connected injuries. After decades of service, we now are asked to choose between essential medications and groceries.

The Pentagon’s misreading of its own rules cannot stand.

Congress should: Suspend the policy immediately pending review, investigate how DHA justified such a clear violation of statutory and regulatory text, clarify by statute that no drug on the uniform formulary may be denied to Tricare for Life beneficiaries if it is available to any other Tricare enrollee and require public accountability by compelling DOD to explain why it used a regulation that expressly excludes Tricare for Life to strip benefits from older veterans.

“Tricare for Life” was meant to be just that — for life. Not “for life with exceptions,” not “for life until you’re too old.”

The law promises uniform coverage for all beneficiaries.

By twisting a regulation, DOD has broken faith with those who served longest.

If the Pentagon believes these medications are too costly, it should seek new authorization from Congress — not engage in bureaucratic sleight of hand that punishes seniors.",https://www.navycrf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,0.0,2025-09-11 03:56:12.733202

“None of these amendments are remotely necessary,” said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.
“They are an effort to take advantage of a culture-war partisan issue to drive a wedge into this bill.
It also builds on the quality-of-life improvements for military members initiated under last year’s defense policy bill.
Service members would see a 3.8% pay raise under the bill, as requested by the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON — The House approved an annual defense policy bill on Wednesday that authorizes a 3.8% pay raise for troops, bolsters support for European partners and restricts gender-affirming medical treatment.

Many Democrats refused to vote for the legislation due to several Republican amendments that target transgender individuals and forbid the Defense Department from funding certain health care for them. The vote was 231-196.

“None of these amendments are remotely necessary,” said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. “They are an effort to take advantage of a culture-war partisan issue to drive a wedge into this bill. It doesn’t belong here.”

The provisions include a ban on Tricare, the military’s health care program, from providing gender-related medical treatment and on the Exceptional Family Medical Program from approving gender transition procedures.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., won approval for amendments that prohibit males at military service academies from participating in female athletics and that require individuals on military installations to access single-sex spaces that correspond with their sex.

The Senate is voting on its own version of the legislation, and both chambers will need to negotiate and vote on a final version before the bill can be sent to President Donald Trump’s desk. Divisive social issue provisions are typically stripped from the final bill.

The legislation’s primary focus is on reforming the Pentagon’s slow and costly weapons acquisitions process — reducing decision timelines for requirements from three years to as few as three months.

It also builds on the quality-of-life improvements for military members initiated under last year’s defense policy bill. Service members would see a 3.8% pay raise under the bill, as requested by the Trump administration.

The family separation allowance, which helps offset expenses incurred when a service member is separated from their family for more than 30 days, would go up from $250 to $400 per month.

Eligibility calculations for the basic needs allowance would exclude the basic housing allowance from a service member’s household income to allow more troops to qualify for the benefit.

“These and several other provisions in the bill will certainly positively impact service members’ pocketbooks, and their ability to put food on the table,” said Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Penn.

Another provision waives fees and co-pays for Tricare’s dental program for all members of the selected reserve.

The legislation also extends an at-home child care pilot program and authorizes nearly $3 billion in construction for new barracks and family housing, dining facilities, medical facilities, child care centers and schools.

The bill also pushes back against the Trump administration’s moves to withdraw from Europe.

The House’s legislation authorizes $400 million for the longstanding Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, and lawmakers added an amendment requiring the Pentagon to maintain military cooperation with Baltic allies Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

“This amendment is necessary because there are some appointees in the Pentagon who’ve embraced a foolish policy of decoupling from Europe and weakening our leadership in NATO, and we’ve got to stand opposed,” said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.

Lawmakers also reasserted congressional war powers, approving a bipartisan amendment repealing laws that green-lighted the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 1991 Gulf War. Democrats and some Republicans have raised concerns about presidential abuse of the authorizations.

China remains a top priority in the legislation. The bill authorizes more than $1.5 billion for projects needed to carry out military operations in the Indo-Pacific, and $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative to strengthen the island nation’s defense capabilities.

The legislation also authorizes $22 billion in shipbuilding for additional submarines and surface vessels, $38 billion for new aircraft, $15 billion to restore munitions stockpiles and $142 billion to develop new technologies for the battlefield.

“We need a ready, capable and lethal fighting force because the threats our nation faces, especially those from China, are more complex and challenging than at any point in the last 40 years,” said Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.",https://www.stripes.com/incoming/hu6xqf-20250731_us_capitol_0213.jpg/alternates/LANDSCAPE_480/20250731_US_Capitol_0213.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-11 00:56:10.247821

Horsford, who represents multiple military instillations in Nevada, specifically negotiated to include a bipartisan provision studying the psychological and mental health impacts of combat with Remotely Piloted Aircraft on personnel stationed at Creech Air Force Base in his district.

Rep. Horsford’s legislation, the bipartisan TRICARE OB-GYN Treatment and Access without Lags in Care Act (TOTAL Care Act), which provides servicemembers and their families obstetric and gynecologic (OB-GYN) care without requiring burdensome referrals, was also included in the base text.

“The National Defense Authorization Act is our opportunity to invest in military readiness,” Rep. Horsford said. “I amended this NDAA to help support military families, address mental health challenges our servicemembers endure, and ensure our Air Force units have the resources they need to modernize and succeed. Supporting the troops means supporting their families, their healthcare, and their ability to serve authentically. That’s not a partisan value – it’s a military necessity.

“While I voted in favor of this NDAA, I am concerned that many of the provisions Congressional Republicans included undermine its intent,” Horsford continued. “This bill includes provisions that ban healthcare, undermine equal services, and openly discriminate against the very same patriots who volunteer to serve our country. I expect my colleagues to address these extreme provisions at conference, and I hope to see an improved, bipartisan bill once it returns to the House for final passage.”

Rep. Horsford’s amendments to the NDAA are:

To investigate the financial impact of Permanent Change of Station (PCS) costs on military families.

To undertake a study examining the psychological effects and mental health impacts associated with combat Remotely Piloted Aircraft operations for personnel stationed at Creech Air Force Base.

To provide a formal report on the modernization requirements of the United States Air Force Thunderbirds Demonstration Team.

You can read more about the FY26 NDAA here: House committee’s NDAA authorizes more money for Ukraine, thwarts troops reductions in Europe HASC adds funds for Virginia class subs, Ukraine in FY26 policy bill","WASHINGTON — The House passed its version of the fiscal 2026 defense policy bill today, with members rallying to protect funding for military aid to Ukraine and to speed defense procurement at home.

The 231-196 vote was split mostly down party lines due to the addition of Republican-backed amendments on culture war issues, such as several measures pertaining to transgender individuals.

The centerpiece of the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act is a wide-ranging proposal meant to help speed up and streamline the defense acquisition process, specifically by cutting the time it takes for the Pentagon to validate requirements for a new procurement program.

The bill, which authorizes $848 billion for defense but does not obligate spending, largely sticks to the amounts laid out in the Pentagon’s budget request.

Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, announced on Tuesday that he would not support the bill if it included “problematic amendments included in the rule that focus on divisive topics rather than strengthening our national security.” He also criticized House Republicans for blocking debate on Democrat-led amendments on topics such as the Trump administration’s use of the US military for domestic law enforcement.

“We didn’t get any of the amendments or debates that we wanted. Not a single solitary one,” he said on the floor today.

There were two notable shows of bipartisanship. First, Democrats and Republicans largely banded together to defeat amendments from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., that would have prohibited funding for Ukraine and eradicated funding for the Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative. (The House NDAA authorizes $400 million for Ukraine, but no money is included in the House’s version of the defense appropriations bill, which actually greenlights the Pentagon’s budget.)

Two Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee — Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Turner of Ohio — spoke against the move to curb further military aid to Ukraine.

“A Ukrainian victory is in our security interests,” Bacon said, adding that Russia could put military pressure on the Baltic countries if Ukraine falls. “It’s not conservative to appease [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,” he added.

The Ukraine funding prohibition was shot down in a 60-372 vote, while the Taiwan amendment was defeated 9-422.

Members also voted in favor of an amendment that repeals the 1991 and 2002 Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMF) related to Iraq, which saw 49 Republicans join Democrats in a 261-167 vote. The measure’s cosponsors — Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas — have said the war authorizations are outdated and no longer serve a purpose.

Over Democrats’ objections, Republicans passed six amendments targeting transgender individuals, including one that prohibits the Pentagon from covering gender-related medical treatment under TRICARE.

GOP members also successfully backed an amendment that eliminates a Pentagon preference for hybrid or electric vehicles.

The House’s NDAA will have to be reconciled with the Senate’s version of the bill, which authorizes a topline that is $32 billion larger than the House version. The Senate is also debating its NDAA on the floor this week, with passage likely by end of week.

“I think it’s very interesting that my colleague from South Carolina is so obsessed with the issue of trans people,” Democratic California Rep. Sara Jacobs said Wednesday, referring to Republican Rep. Nancy Mace. (RELATED: NANCY MACE: America Has A 1% Problem But It’s Not What The Left Thinks)

Jacobs accused Mace of “using horrible slurs to talk about [transgender-identified people], when many people in this body have received gender affirming care.”

The House is set to vote on a slew of Mace-introduced amendments, including an amendment to prohibit the Department of War “from allocating taxpayer resources toward gender-transition procedures or treatments through TRICARE,” a military healthcare program. Another of Mace’s amendment’s prohibits “biological males [from] competing against our daughters in uniform.”

“Filler is gender affirming care,” Jacobs claimed. “Boob jobs is gender affirming care. Botox is gender affirming care.”

“Filler is gender-affirming care.
Boob jobs is gender-affirming care.
Botox is gender-affirming care,” Jacobs said.
“To @RepSaraJacobs, I talk about women’s safety and your response is commentary about my body on the House floor.","Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) yelled at Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) on the House floor Wednesday over a comment Jacobs made saying that breast augmentations are gender-affirming care, with Mace later taking to social media to offer Jacobs a surgeon for a nose job.

The outburst came during debate on amendments to the annual defense authorization bill, with Mace leading several anti-transgender amendments, including one to prevent gender-affirming care under the military’s TRICARE health benefits.

“I would just like to point out that it’s interesting my colleague from South Carolina is so obsessed with the issue of trans people, using horrible slurs to talk about them, when many people in this body have received gender-affirming care,” Jacobs said on the House floor.

“Filler is gender-affirming care. Boob jobs is gender-affirming care. Botox is gender-affirming care,” Jacobs said. “Lots of my colleagues have received gender-affirming care, and let me be clear, everybody should have access to the gender-affirming care they need, and I think that we should respect everybody in this country.”

Mace, who was no longer recognized for debate and was elsewhere on the House floor, could be heard yelling at Jacobs for making comments about “my body.”

“Ridiculous,” Mace said. “You are absolutely ridiculous. What the hell is your problem?”

“You are disgusting. You are an insult,” Mace said, as the presiding officers gaveled and said that the House was not in order.

Jacobs requested to have Mace’s words be taken down — stricken from the official record — but no additional parliamentary consideration occurred because Mace was not recognized during the outburst.

Mace, who has made her personal stories of sexual assault and advocacy against transgender rights core to her political identity, then took to social media to continue scolding Jacobs.

“To @RepSaraJacobs, I talk about women’s safety and your response is commentary about my body on the House floor. If you knew anything about survivors you would know some women change their bodies because of the trauma of sexual violence. They live with the consequences for a lifetime,” Mace said.

“For a small military treatment facility, we really do a lot, and we are proud to welcome you into the footprint and show you how Munson makes a difference,” said Walker, who led Summons and Blash on a tour through the facility, including Smith Dental Clinic and Gentry Behavioral Health Clinic.

On Sept. 4, Summons and Blash joined Walker and Trevino as they conducted a workforce town hall, where staff had the opportunity to ask questions and discuss issues directly with senior leadership. Several team members were also recognized with awards for their contributions to patient care and mission success during the forum.

“It was important for Brigadier General Summons to hear directly from the Munson team,” said Trevino. “The work we do here is vital—not just for Fort Leavenworth, but for the readiness of the Army as a whole. Those efforts ensure Soldiers are medically ready and that families receive the support they need.”

During the visit, Summons also administered the oath of enlistment to four Munson Soldiers reaffirming their commitment to serve.

This article explores what services you can access if you need support.

The Office of Military Community and Family Policy

The company's recent financial and operational updates underscore a critical inflection point: a transition from growth-at-all-costs to disciplined scalability and profitability. This transformation, driven by Converge's SaaS-based architecture, is not merely a technological upgrade but a recalibration of Amwell's value proposition in an industry increasingly demanding efficiency and measurable outcomes.

Converge's Role in Revenue Resilience and Margin Expansion

Amwell's Q2 2025 results reveal a company recalibrating its financial trajectory. Total revenue reached $70.9 million, surpassing analyst estimates by 11.7%, with subscription software revenue—a direct indicator of Converge's adoption—jumping to $40.4 million, up 47% year-over-year and 24% sequentiallyAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. This growth is not isolated to volume; it reflects a structural shift in client demand. The Converge platform, which integrates virtual care, care coordination, and analytics, now accounts for 60% of Amwell's projected 2025 revenueAmerican Well Q2 2025 Earnings Report[ 2 ].

The platform's impact extends beyond top-line growth. Gross margin expanded to 56.1% in Q2 2025, a 500-basis-point improvement year-over-yearAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. This margin expansion, coupled with a narrowing adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.7 million (down 86.6% from Q2 2024), signals progress in balancing investment in growth with operational disciplineAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. The key driver here is Converge's scalable SaaS model, which reduces per-unit costs as adoption rises—a critical advantage in an industry historically plagued by high fixed costs.

Strategic Partnerships as a Force Multiplier

Amwell's partnership with the U.S. Defense Health Agency (DHA) exemplifies how Converge is becoming a strategic asset rather than a commodity. The DHA contract, which replaces a legacy video solution with Converge's integrated platform, has already tripled virtual visits within the Military Health System (MHS) and achieved high satisfaction ratesAmerican Well Q2 2025 Earnings Report[ 2 ]. This partnership, initially deployed at five sites and now expanding enterprise-wide, is described by Amwell as “the most significant growth initiative in its history”Digital health earnings roundup—The hits and misses in Q1[ 3 ].

The DHA's 9.6 million-member footprint provides a unique testing ground for Converge's capabilities. According to a report by FierceHealthcare, the DHA project has driven a 30% year-over-year increase in subscription software revenueDigital health earnings roundup—The hits and misses in Q1[ 3 ]. More importantly, it validates Converge's ability to scale in complex, high-stakes environments—a credential that enhances Amwell's appeal to other large payers and health systems.

The EBITDA Turnaround: Realistic or Optimistic?

Amwell's revised 2025 revenue guidance of $245–$250 million, despite the divestiture of its psychiatric care segment, reflects confidence in Converge's ability to offset lost revenue streamsAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. However, the path to EBITDA profitability remains contingent on two factors: continued margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation.

The company's adjusted EBITDA loss, while narrowing, still reflects significant investment in platform development and client onboarding. For instance, the DHA rollout required upfront costs to customize Converge for military-specific workflows. Yet, these investments are beginning to pay off: the platform's gross margin of 56.1% in Q2 2025 suggests that Amwell is nearing a breakeven point in its core SaaS operationsAmerican Well (AMWL) Q2 Revenue Up 13%[ 1 ]. If this trend continues, the company could achieve EBITDA positivity by 2026, assuming no major disruptions in client acquisition or cost management.

Risks and Opportunities in the Hybrid Care Market

While Converge's trajectory is promising, Amwell faces headwinds. The healthcare technology sector is highly competitive, with rivals like

and Doxy.me vying for market share. Additionally, regulatory shifts—such as changes in reimbursement models for virtual care—could impact adoption rates.

Yet, Amwell's focus on enterprise clients (e.g., DHA, Florida Blue) provides a buffer against these risks. Enterprise contracts typically offer longer-term commitments and higher margins compared to consumer-facing models. Furthermore, Converge's integration of AI-driven analytics and care coordination tools positions it to capture value in the shift toward value-based care—a $1.2 trillion market by 2030American Well Corp (AMWL) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Highlights[ 4 ].

Conclusion: A Platform, Not Just a Product

Amwell's strategic transformation is no longer theoretical. The Converge platform has demonstrated its ability to drive revenue, improve margins, and secure high-impact partnerships. For investors, the critical question is whether this momentum can translate into sustained EBITDA growth. The data suggests that Amwell is on the right path, but execution will determine the pace.

As the healthcare sector grapples with rising costs and fragmented care delivery, Amwell's hybrid care model offers a compelling alternative.

Walter Reed Office of Command Communications

Surgeons at Walter Reed continue to use innovative approaches to providing presidential-level care to beneficiaries of the Military Health System.

“We used a microsurgical robot to do the microvascular anastomosis [as part of a breast reconstruction],” said U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Paul Hwang, director for surgery at Walter Reed.

Microvascular anastomosis is surgery reconnecting very small blood vessels, such as those with a diameter of 3mm or less, using a microscope and specialized instruments. It’s crucial in reconstructive surgery, especially when transferring tissue from one part of the body to another or repairing nerves.

“The [microvascular anastomosis is] usually done by hand and a large microscope,” Hwang explained. “This robot allows us to descrub and use remote [controllers] and a 3D video screen to do the anastomosis.”

Hwang’s team performed a DIEP (Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator) flap for breast reconstruction, which used the patient’s own tissue from the lower abdomen to rebuild the breast following a mastectomy. The microsurgical procedure where the tissue is transferred to the chest and reattached using tiny blood vessels, creating a reconstructed breast with its own blood supply.

Hwang added that using the microsurgical robot “makes the vessel connection more accurate and chances for higher quality anastomosis that is less prone to collapse, clotting, [and] complications.”

Hwang explained that robotic microsurgery studies show improved flap survival and reduced adverse events when compared to literature on manual techniques.

“Robotic assisted microsurgery is a novel approach to tackle some of the most complex reconstructive problems in our field. The potential to have better outcomes in trauma, limb salvage, cancer and lymphedema cases through this technology that is limited in availability throughout the United States, makes it only fitting that Walter Reed leads the way in introducing the use at our flagship military treatment facility,” Hwang added.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2509/9302102/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-10 11:56:44.481226

TRICARE For Life beneficiaries

Beneficiaries only eligible for care at military hospitals and clinics

Beneficiaries with NATO status or Partnership for Peace Agreement

At Apple A Day Virtual Clinic, we believe everyone deserves access to safe, effective, and affordable weight loss care. That’s why we continue to provide weight loss medications, medical guidance, and telehealth support without the high costs of traditional care.

What’s Happening with TRICARE Coverage?

TRICARE recently updated its pharmacy benefit policies. Some commonly prescribed weight loss medications, including newer options like GLP-1s (tirzepatide, semaglutide, etc.), are now restricted or not covered for many individuals.

This means:

Patients who were previously covered may now face denials at the pharmacy

Out-of-pocket costs for these medications can skyrocket

Those relying on weight loss medication as part of their care plan may feel stuck

Why Weight Loss Medications Matter

Medications like GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide), as well as other weight loss treatments, have been proven to:

Support sustainable weight loss

Improve blood sugar levels

Reduce risks for conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure

Boost confidence and quality of life

For many patients, these aren’t just “weight loss aids”, they’re life-changing tools for better health.

Apple A Day Virtual Clinic’s Affordable Options

Even though TRICARE may no longer cover these medications, you still have options. At Apple A Day Virtual Clinic:

Virtual Consultations: Meet with a licensed provider from the comfort of your home

Affordable Weight Loss Medications: Access to a variety of options, tailored to your needs

Cost-Effective Care: We keep services affordable for patients paying out of pocket

Quick, Seamless Process: Easy appointment scheduling and prescription management

We understand the unique challenges military families face, and our goal is to make weight loss care accessible, flexible, and supportive no matter where you are.

Regardless of the code justifying it, the DHA has now implemented a separate tier of treatment for us Tricare For Life beneficiaries. Note that there is nothing in the newsletter about how to help get this changed—only, sorry, but those are the rules!

Here is my cut and paste from the applicable CFR:

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the official legal print publication containing the codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR) is a continuously updated online version of the CFR. It is not an official legal edition of the CFR. Learn more about the eCFR, its status, and the editorial process.

CHAMPUS rules:

§ 199.4 Basic program benefits. (a) General. The CHAMPUS Basic Program is essentially a supplemental program to the Uniformed Services direct medical care system. The Basic Program is similar to private insurance programs, and is designed to provide financial assistance to CHAMPUS beneficiaries for certain prescribed medical care obtained from civilian sources.

(15) Morbid obesity. The TRICARE morbid obesity benefit is limited to those bariatric surgical procedures for which the safety and efficacy has been proven comparable or superior to conventional therapies and is consistent with the generally accepted norms for medical practice in the United States medical community. (See the definition of reliable evidence in § 199.2 of this part for the procedures used in determining if a medical treatment or procedure is unproven.) (i) Conditions for coverage. (A) Payment for bariatric surgical procedures is determined by the requirements specified in paragraph (g)(15) of this section, and as defined in § 199.2(b) of this part. (B) Covered bariatric surgical procedures are payable only when the patient has completed growth (18 years of age or documentation of completion of bone growth) and has met one of the following selection criteria: (1) The patient has a BMI that is equal to or exceeds 40 kg/m2 and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. (2) The patient has a BMI of 35 to 39.9 kg/m2, has at least one high-risk co-morbid condition associated with morbid obesity, and has previously been unsuccessful with medical treatment for obesity. Note: The Director, TMA, shall issue guidelines for review of the specific high-risk co-morbid conditions, exacerbated or caused by obesity based on the Reliable Evidence Standard as defined in § 199.2 of this part. (ii) Treatment of complications. (A) Payment may be extended for repeat bariatric surgery when medically necessary to correct or treat complications from the initial covered bariatric surgery (a takedown). For instance, the surgeon in many cases will do a gastric bypass or gastroplasty to help the patient avoid regaining the weight that was lost. In this situation, payment is authorized even though the patient's condition technically may not meet the definition of morbid obesity because of the weight that was already lost following the initial surgery. (B) Payment is authorized for otherwise covered medical services and supplies directly related to complications of obesity when such services and supplies are an integral and necessary part of the course of treatment that was aggravated by the obesity.

(iii) Exclusions. CHAMPUS payment may not be extended for weight control services, weight control/loss programs, dietary regimens and supplements, appetite suppressants and other medications; food or food supplements, exercise and exercise programs, or other programs and equipment that are primarily intended to control weight or for the purpose of weight reduction, regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

2017 Act: Tricare Prime and Select

§ 199.17 TRICARE program. (a) Establishment. The TRICARE program is established for the purpose of implementing a comprehensive managed health care program for the delivery and financing of health care services in the Military Health System. (1) Purpose. The TRICARE program implements a number of improvements primarily through modernized managed care support contracts that include special arrangements with civilian sector health care providers and better coordination between military medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and these civilian providers to deliver an integrated, health care delivery system that provides beneficiaries with access to high quality healthcare. Implementation of these improvements, to include enhanced access, improved health outcomes, increased efficiencies and elimination of waste, in addition to improving and maintaining operational medical force readiness, includes adoption of special rules and procedures not ordinarily followed under CHAMPUS or MTF requirements. This section establishes those special rules and procedures.

(3) Treatment of obesity. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1097 and sections 706 and 729 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, notwithstanding 10 U.S.C. 1079(a)(10), treatment of obesity is covered under TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select even if it is the sole or major condition treated. Such services must be provided by a TRICARE network provider and be medically necessary and appropriate in the context of the particular patient's treatment.

Q&A: TRICARE For Life Coverage of Weight Loss Medications By TRICARE Communications

FALLS CHURCH, Va. – The Defense Health Agency recently announced it will implement existing regulatory controls regarding TRICARE coverage of weight loss medications, including Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) drugs, to ensure prescription processing aligns with federal coverage requirements. You may have questions, such as: Why do some plans cover these drugs while TRICARE For Life doesn’t? Should I stop taking my medication if TFL doesn’t cover it? Can I keep taking my prescription if I pay for it out of pocket? “Many TFL beneficiaries have concerns about why some obesity treatments are covered and others aren’t,” said Edward C. Norton, Chief, Pharmacy Operations Division at the Defense Health Agency. “TFL coverage of these drugs isn’t authorized when obesity is the sole or major condition treated. Our goal is to help you understand the existing rules and how to explore options that still meet your needs.” TFL offers Medicare wraparound coverage. It’s different from other TRICARE plan options, like TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select.

Different laws govern TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. These laws allow the Department of Defense to offer certain additional preventive care services and health benefits when received from network providers under those plan options.

Q: Why does weight loss drug coverage differ between TFL and TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select? A: Federal law and regulation determine the differences. Federal law doesn’t authorize TFL to cover weight loss medications when prescribed for weight loss as the sole or major condition. This is true regardless of the patient's age.

Other than bariatric surgery, which is authorized for the treatment of morbid obesity, federal regulation only extends coverage for treatment of obesity for beneficiaries with TRICARE Prime or TRICARE Select benefits when provided by network providers.

Q: Why doesn't TFL follow Medicare's exceptions for sleep apnea and heart disease conditions? A: TRICARE and Medicare operate under different legal frameworks with different coverage authorities. Medicare Part D may cover certain weight loss medications for non-obesity conditions. These may include sleep apnea or reducing cardiovascular risk. TFL follows separate federal laws and regulations. These laws and regulations exclude medications intended to control or reduce weight. This is regardless of the existence of co-morbid conditions.

Q: Why does this feel sudden? A: We understand this may feel abrupt. Express Scripts, the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor, mailed detailed notification letters to affected beneficiaries. These letters were mailed July 31, 2025 (30 days prior to the change). If you are affected, you shouldn’t stop taking your medication right away. Ask your provider what’s most appropriate during this transition period.

Q: Which prior authorizations became invalid on Aug. 31? A: Prior authorizations for obesity medications became invalid on Aug. 31 only for: Those with TFL Others not enrolled in TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or premium-based plans (such as direct care only beneficiaries, foreign force members, or those with TRICARE Plus) Q: I’m a TFL beneficiary. What happens if I try to fill my prescription after Aug. 31? A: TRICARE will not cover your prescription. You can talk to your provider about other treatment options. Or you can prepare to pay for your prescription out of pocket. Q: I have TFL and diabetes. Are my GLP-1 drugs still covered? A: It depends. TRICARE covers certain GLP-1s for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These include: Ozempic Trulicity Mounjaro Victoza Coverage continues for all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes when prior authorization criteria are met. This is true regardless of their health plan. Bottom line We know this may be difficult. We encourage you to work closely with your provider. They can help you find safe and effective approaches that support your long-term health and well-being.",,N,,2025-09-10 03:56:35.189816

Early last month, TRICARE announced that it will no longer cover obesity medications for retirees and for others who retain coverage care is restricted to in-network providers only.

For so many living with obesity, these medications are not optional. They are lifelines. They help manage a serious, chronic disease — just like insulin for diabetes or blood pressure medications for hypertension. Without them, many will face worsening health conditions like sleep apnea or heart disease, and the heartbreak of losing the progress they worked so hard to achieve.

This decision is more than unfair — it’s dangerous. It tells service members and their families, who sacrifice every single day, that their health doesn’t matter. It risks national security by making it harder for active-duty members to stay healthy and ready to serve.

Why This Change is Concerning

An estimated 27,000 people lost coverage for their obesity medications.

Those beneficiaries that have coverage must now receive care through in-network providers.

There are few TRICARE providers who are trained in obesity medicine.

Impacted beneficiaries were given less than 30 days to notice of the change, which is not adequate time to switch to a new provider.

People who finally found something that works are being forced to stop suddenly.

Service members’ health and readiness are being put at risk.

Obesity is being singled out, treated as “less than” other chronic diseases.

What You Can Do

We can’t stay silent. Congress needs to hear from the people this decision impacts most — you, your family, your story. Together, our voices can push TRICARE to reverse this harmful policy.

Take action today. Use our Advocacy Action Tool to send a message to your Members of Congress.

This is about fairness. It’s about health. It’s about honoring the sacrifices of military families who deserve the same chance at care and dignity as anyone else.",https://www.obesityaction.org/wp-content/themes/oac/assets/images/favicon.png,N,0.0,2025-09-10 07:56:11.389395

At my first job, no issues with credentialing or reimbursement, I had a handful of Tricare clients.
The pay was quite a lot better than my first salaried job, so the inconsistency of commissions didn’t bother me.
1) our clinic director states there is an issue with reimbursing folks who take Tricare insurance because of the Tricare redistricting.
2) our operations director sends out a “new” attestation form about our Tricare credentialing eligibility.","Hi all, long post ahead. TLDR: my old job made a gross mistake regarding Tricare credentialing and it’s costing me thousands, what do I do?

I am a mental healthcare provider licensed in MD. I have been credentialed with Tricare since I became a counselor 5 years ago. At my first job, no issues with credentialing or reimbursement, I had a handful of Tricare clients. I was salaried as well, so might have missed some things on the back end, but it never affected my pay and I never heard anything about needing to attest to my credentialing.

I got Job #2 in 2023, where I was also credentialed with insurances including Tricare. Job 2 took full responsibility of credentialing me, I never thought twice about it, and was informed that all fully-licensed providers were eligible for the same credentialing (slightly different process for provisionally licensed folks, per MD laws). My pay structure at this job was technically w-2, so I did receive PTO and subsidized healthcare, but I was paid a base hourly rate and received commission from my client revenue (insurance reimbursements and copays). The pay was quite a lot better than my first salaried job, so the inconsistency of commissions didn’t bother me.

I never actually saw my first Tricare client at Job 2 until end of January 2025. For whatever reason, I had a full caseload of non-Tricare clients until then. I proceeded to get 3-4 more over the course of the next few months (the last was referred to me in mid-June 2025). Over the course of January 2025-July 2025, I watched these clients’ insurance balances slowly climb- $800, $1,200, $2k, all the way until a couple of these folks were showing $4k+ balances that insurance hadn’t paid out. Because of my pay structure, I was missing A LOT of commission from these clients.

I had begun verbally prodding our clinic director and staff leader about this in our staff meetings back in about March or April, when the balances were hovering closer to $600-$1000 each, knowing that other clinicians at Job 2 were also taking Tricare clients (I learned not as many as me, most folks only had 1 or 2 and I had about 5). At the time the answer we got was, “reimbursement takes a while, we’ll take this to the owner and see what she can find out.”

Fast forward to July 2025, when all the shit hits the fan. 1) our clinic director states there is an issue with reimbursing folks who take Tricare insurance because of the Tricare redistricting. She recommends everyone cancel all Tricare appointments until further notice, and communicate to our clients that they should probably find a new provider. RED FREAKING FLAG. 2) our operations director sends out a “new” attestation form about our Tricare credentialing eligibility. One of the requirements for eligibility stipulated on this form is passing the National Counseling Exam (NCE) prior to 2017. I in fact passed this exam AFTER 2017. I fill out what I can and email our operations director back, asking what this means for my eligibility AND ALL the sessions I had completed up to this point. She says “we’re working to figure that out.”

In August, every staff meeting now has someone asking about Tricare eligibility and reimbursement. Every weekly catchup email has a bullet point about the Tricare debacle and how “we’re still working to figure this out.” It’s now been 7 months of “working to figure this out,” and I am sitting with literal thousands of dollars missing from my pay stubs. Between the lack of answers and then having to cancel 5 regular clients, not knowing if I would get them back, I was losing income fast. NOW the commission-based pay bothered me.

The last detail is, also in August, the clinic director informed us that when the redistricting of Tricare happened in January 2025, it changed their credentialing requirements. I immediately responded to this email asking what the company planned to do about reimbursing providers, seeing as it is their corporate team’s responsibility for accurately credentialing their providers, and the fact that I/we was/were not accurately credentialed is a grave oversight on their part. And the response I got was “that is precisely what we are trying to figure out.”

I applied for and accepted Job #3. I cannot work for a company that continues to be unaccountable for this gross error, whether the fault lies with my clinic director, operations director, owner, or corporate heads. However, not working for Job 2 anymore has made it vastly more difficult to keep them accountable, maintain updated communication, or make sure I’m getting paid correctly. My biggest concern is that I have completed work that I have not been paid for, based on a mistake that wasn’t mine, and I have heard zero promises that I will get paid the commission of thousands of dollars that are owed.

I am angry, but all I’m presenting is the facts. Do I file a complaint with DOL? Do I continue to harass Job 2 via email (I did email all professional correspondence to my personal email so I wouldn’t lose the information or the documentation of advocacy when I left)? Do I threaten to talk to a labor lawyer about missing wages?",,N,,2025-09-10 03:56:39.242276

Contact Information: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.","NEW YORK, Sept. 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Zynex, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZYXI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Zynex on July 9, 2025 with a Class Period from March 13, 2023, to the present. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Zynex have breached their fiduciary duties to the company.

The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants began artificially inflating Zynex’s stock price by issuing or allowing false and misleading statements about the Company’s financial performance, operational practices, and compliance with insurance reimbursement policies. These statements concealed a systemic “oversupplying scheme” whereby Zynex shipped excessive quantities of supplies, such as electrode pads and batteries, to patients, billing insurers for thousands of dollars more than necessary. Zynex’s undisclosed practices drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare (the federal health insurer for the military), which represented 20–25% of its annual revenue.

The full extent of Zynex’s misconduct was finally revealed on March 11, 2025, when the Company issued a press release announcing fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 results. The release disclosed a significant revenue “shortfall” due to “slower than normal payments from certain payers” and revealed, “Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims.” The March 11, 2025, press release admitted that Tricare, representing 20% to 25% of Zynex’s annual revenue, was scrutinizing prior claims, threatening the Company’s financial stability.

The next day, on March 12, 2025, Zynex’s stock price plummeted $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share. This catastrophic decline wiped out significant shareholder value, reflecting the market’s reaction to Zynex’s exposure to regulatory and financial risks concealed by the Individual Defendants.

Lastly, seven marketers and their entities agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks disguised as MSO payments to doctors to induce laboratory testing.
These include several True Health, other lab, and marketing firm employees.
“We will continue to pursue those who steal from federal healthcare programs through these types of schemes to pay improper kickbacks to providers.”","After being indicted in 2022, True Health Diagnostics CEO Christopher Grottenthaler and others have agreed to settle the federal allegations that the company made kickback arrangements with marketers and physicians and made fraudulent claims for laboratory testing against federal payers Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE.

In a case that began in California with a whistleblower complaint, prosecutors alleged that Grottenthaler agreed to a kickback scheme in which marketers and True Health employees offered and paid doctors kickbacks disguised as management service organization distributions to boost referrals to the True Health lab. At other times, prosecutors allege that Grottenthaler arranged for True Health to pay kickbacks disguised as consulting fees, processing and handling fees, and waivers of copayments and deductibles to bring in more referrals, many of which were unnecessary lab panels. The settlement resolves these allegations after Grottenthaler pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit illegal remuneration.

The original 125-page complaint, dated 2016, describes how True Health would promise doctors that it would not charge patients copayments or deductibles, helping physicians retain patients while the lab collected insurance payments without charging the patient directly. It also alleges the defendants created a “Speakers Bureau” and advisory panels where they paid physicians in exchange for the physicians referring lab work to them and sent out some lab work to other labs while billing insurance as if they had done the job.

Evidence in the case showed that Grottenthaler continued the alleged scheme even after receiving warnings from colleagues that the marketers the lab worked with “are a powder keg waiting to explode on us” and that “people are gonna go to prison.”

An email exhibit from a physician who worked with an entity acquired by True Health, which was included in the complaint, describes how the lab would not charge patients for lab results, which is illegal. “It is absolutely back to business as usual!!” it reads. “As much as I thought this would happen, a part of me really couldn’t believe they would have the gall to just resume the same behaviors!!”

The complaint also details how Grottenthaler has been connected to healthcare fraud before. As the VP of Finance at Ameritox, the Department of Health and Human Services accused the company of paying kickbacks to encourage physicians to refer drug testing services to the lab, and in 2010, Ameritox paid $16.3 million to settle the case.

Another recently announced settlement resolved allegations against Dr. Hong Davis of Denton, who agreed to pay $124,627 to resolve allegations that she received thousands in payments between 2015 and 2017 from purported MSOs in return for ordering laboratory tests from labs in Rockdale, Texas, and Framingham, Massachusetts. Dr. Elizabeth Seymour agreed to pay $234,215 to resolve allegations that she also received payments from purported MSOs to order lab tests from True Health and other labs.

Lastly, seven marketers and their entities agreed to pay $1.5 million to resolve allegations that they paid kickbacks disguised as MSO payments to doctors to induce laboratory testing. These include several True Health, other lab, and marketing firm employees.

“These settlements reflect the firm commitment of the Eastern District of Texas to punish those who use fraudulent means to profit at the expense of federal healthcare programs funded by the hard-working taxpayers of the United States,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Jay R. Combs for the Eastern District of Texas. “We will continue to pursue those who steal from federal healthcare programs through these types of schemes to pay improper kickbacks to providers.”",https://assets.dmagstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iStock-1300036735.jpg,N,0.0,2025-09-09 17:56:22.409439
