Today’s Military Health System relies on multiple online platforms—each with a specific purpose. Understanding them, and how they’re evolving, can help you make the most of your health coverage.

Keep in mind: TRICARE doesn’t own these platforms. Other agencies or contractors do. But you can visit the TRICARE All Logins page for a comprehensive list.

Here’s what to know.

One healthcare system, several portals

There’s no single portal that does it all. Instead, different login platforms support different parts of your benefit. Generally, they fall into three categories:

Updating personal information and enrollment in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System

Getting care at military hospitals and clinics with MHS GENESIS

Getting civilian care through a TRICARE contractor

Here’s a look at each.

DEERS and milConnect/Beneficiary Web Enrollment

DEERS is the foundation of TRICARE eligibility. The milConnect website lets you update contact information, check your enrollment status, and access Beneficiary Web Enrollment tools. You can use this platform to:

Enroll in or change TRICARE plans

Update contact information, like your address or phone number

milConnect now uses myAuth, a new user-friendly secure login that is gradually replacing DS Logon. Keep reading to learn more about myAuth.

MHS GENESIS Patient Portal

If you get care at a military hospital or clinic, the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal is your main access point. You can:

View laboratory results

Request prescription refills

Make appointments

Send secure messages

You may also view your health records and appointment notes from military hospitals and clinics.

Regional contractor portals

Health care outside of military hospitals and clinics is administered by TRICARE contractors. Each has its own portal:

TRICARE East Region: Humana Military

TRICARE West Region: TriWest Healthcare Alliance

TRICARE Overseas: International SOS

TRICARE For Life (in all regions): WPS Military and Veterans Health

Use these portals to:

View claims

Check referrals

Find network providers

Pharmacy login

Express Scripts is the TRICARE Pharmacy Program contractor. Through their portal, you can switch eligible medications to TRICARE Pharmacy Home Delivery and:

Request new prescriptions

Refill prescriptions

Track your order status

Pay bills

Dental login

Are you enrolled in the TRICARE Dental Program? If so, United Concordia is your TRICARE dental contractor. Your United Concordia TDP My Account lets you:

View plan coverage details

Check claims history

View your dental explanation of benefits

Pay bills

What is myAuth?

myAuth is a new secure login option replacing DS Logon across Department of Defense systems. With myAuth, you can use your Common Access Card or a username/password, plus a secure multi-factor authentication method. This lets you access multiple DOD websites with just one login.

Currently, myAuth is used on:

milConnect

ID Card Office Online

Over time, all DOD systems that use DS Logon will transition to myAuth. Until then, platforms may use either DS Logon or myAuth depending on their system. (Note: You must have an active DS Logon account to create a new myAuth account.)

Civilian health portals

If you see a civilian provider, your provider may use an electronic health record, or EHR, other than MHS GENESIS. The DOD doesn’t own these other EHRs. You’ll need to follow your provider’s instructions to sign in and view records or communicate with providers.

Bottom line

Managing your TRICARE benefit means knowing which login to use—and when. While it may seem complex, here’s a breakdown:

Use milConnect for enrollment and DEERS updates.

Use MHS GENESIS to see your records for care at military hospitals and clinics.

Use your TRICARE contractor’s portal to manage claims, view referrals, and pay bills.

When in doubt, visit TRICARE All Logins page to find the right access point.

Remember: myAuth is coming, bringing with it a more unified login experience. Until then, save the portals you use most, keep your passwords safe, and check back for updates as the rollout continues.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/24/2003760729/1920/1080/0/250724-O-D0202-1001.PNG,N,0.0,2025-07-24 15:56:07.085602

For decades, the number of Medicare-funded residency slots has remained effectively frozen, creating a bottleneck that’s worsened the country’s physician shortage and left aspiring doctors with fewer pathways to practice.

Recently, Congress revived H.R. 3890, the Resident Physician Shortage Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill that would add 14,000 new Medicare-supported residency slots over the next seven years—marking the most significant expansion of the physician training pipeline in nearly 30 years.

The bill would increase the number of available slots by 2,000 each year from 2026 through 2032, with at least 10% of those new positions directed toward hospitals in rural areas, medically underserved communities and regions with new medical schools. It also limits each hospital to a maximum of 75 additional slots over the seven-year period.

The California Medical Association (CMA) has long pushed for this kind of investment. With the U.S. facing a projected shortfall of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036, expanding graduate medical education (GME) is no longer optional if we hope to close that gap and ensure that patient access to care does not continue to erode.

The bill also makes permanent the Rural Residency Planning and Development (RRPD) Program, which supports the creation of new rural training tracks to encourage physicians to practice in hard-to-reach regions.

If passed, the legislation would mark a rare and long-overdue federal investment in physician workforce development. Medicare has supported residency training since the program’s inception in 1965, but a cap imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has constrained the growth of GME ever since. Only small increments—1,000 slots in 2021 and another 200 in 2023—have been added since.

This bipartisan proposal is backed by more than 200 members of Congress.

At the same time, CMA’s philanthropic arm—Physicians for a Healthy California—is gearing up for a major expansion of its GME grant programs, funded by last year’s Prop. 35. Look for more information on the upcoming grant cycles very soon.

This hastens the referral process, allowing patients to see specialty providers in the network as soon as necessary.

For members and families with TRICARE Prime, if your Primary Care Manager (PCM) determines you need medical treatment they can’t provide, they can put in a referral for specialty care.

“Any time that your PCM determines that you need specialty care that we can't offer in the primary care clinics, you will receive a referral,” explained the TOPA flight chief.

Certain specialty care providers require that the patient’s medical notes are reviewed before seeing the patient, and in some cases before they book the appointment.

Under the previous referral process, patients were directed to visit TOPA after their initial appointment with their PCM, where they would “activate” their referral, fill out a request for notes to be sent to the specialist, and receive the TRICARE Prime travel benefit brief. This is no longer required.

“The goal of the new referral process is to improve access to specialty care with a more seamless process,” said the TOPA flight chief.

With the new referral process, patients wait two to three business days after their PCM appointment to review their referral on the TriWest Patient Portal. Using the information on the TriWest Patient Portal, patients call the specialist and schedule an appointment.

If the specialist notifies the patient that they require clinical notes to be seen, then the patient should call or visit TOPA to have the necessary notes faxed. On average, it takes eight to ten business days for the specialty care clinic to receive the notes.

Once the patient has an appointment with a specialist, provide the date and time to Referral Management - TOPA, or the patient will receive automated phone calls as a reminder to book their specialty care appointment.

Any specialty referrals submitted between January 1, 2025 and June 8, 2025 - with the exception of inpatient care, applied behavior analysis/autism care demonstration services, laboratory developed tests, extended care health option services and other services that require pre-authorization – will still fall under the TRICARE West Region Referral Waiver and follow a different process. These referrals are valid until September 30, 2025 and can be viewed on the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal.

That’s reality.” Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.","Military Health System Partnership, Specialized Care Saves Special Operations Soldier

U.S. Army Master Sgt. Jerry Millan lives life by two promises:

“I’m not done yet,” was his vow when Military Health System doctors gave him a lifechanging diagnosis—a rare cancer in his abdominal area, the “most aggressive cancer they've ever come across,” he said. It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.

The second, “I got you,” is his assurance to fellow service members he mentors that he’ll be there to support them and his fellow athletes as they prepare for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games.

Millan’s cancer has been in remission for over five years, and he shares his story of survival to encourage and lift up others facing difficult odds.

A Sudden Pain, A Grim Diagnosis

Millan, a special operations forces soldier, was participating in pre-deployment training in the woods of Fort Polk, Louisiana, when he hit the ground and felt a sharp pain in his gut. He thought it was just a hernia. A medic agreed and ordered a scan. The scan confirmed an umbilical hernia, but the military radiologist saw more.

“I just had this pain in my navel. It wasn’t a typical pain from exercise or indigestion; rather, something unfamiliar” Millan recalled. “But thanks to the radiologist—they saw multiple masses inside my abdomen.”

He was immediately sent to the Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where specialists identified Burkitt’s Lymphoma, an aggressive growing type of cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. He waited with his parents to find out the prognosis.

“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said. “I'm just sitting there looking at like the floor, my dad's sitting at the edge of the bed, and I started saying to myself, ‘I'm not done yet.’”

“It was just a decision to live.”

MHS and NIH Partner to Save his Life

Because Burkitt’s Lymphoma is rare, Walter Reed oncologists quickly linked Millan with doctors and researchers at the NIH who study the disease. The partnership gave him access to an experimental, high-dose chemotherapy protocol for six cycles.

“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said. “At the time, three doctors in network in the United States were trained on that type of cancer.”

Like the cancer, the treatment was aggressive.

“You’re given a massive dose of chemotherapy—I was on a 96-hour drip at first,” he said. “It was the harshest form of chemotherapy that has been developed. But you had to do it because the cancer, by that time, grew over 1000%. My gut was extremely distended.”

Besides the side effects of cancer treatments, he found the isolation to be an additional challenge. He was diagnosed just before the pandemic in 2020. Due to his severely compromised immune system and COVID-19, he was unable to be around people for the better part of a year. On top of that, the unit he trained so hard with deployed without him.

“My friends were deployed; I couldn't see my family. I couldn't have conversations face to face, it was: Wash your hands, wear your face shields, don’t touch each other,” he said.

His mental resilience was one of the key factors to his recovery. Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.”

Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition. They gave his mother a place to stay during treatment, arranged flights, and later linked him to educational resources and a staff position to let him continue serving while he healed.

They made sure his mother could focus on him and not on logistics. “She didn’t have to worry about anything,” Millan said. “She could just focus on me.”

After his chemotherapy rounds, doctors declared him cancer-free.

Finding New Strength Through Sports

Millan looked for what was next and returned to serving—yet struggled to navigate what his new duty looked like while in recovery.

“I felt like they really had no use for me. They had people that were deployable and ready to go. And I can’t. That’s reality.”

Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.

“The Military Adaptive Sports program provided me the opportunity to find a new purpose in life by helping others going through similar situations,” he said. “They helped me find a new community.”

He trained for powerlifting, rowing, sitting volleyball, track and field, and precision air sports. At his first DOD Warrior Games in 2022, he balanced competition with duty, commuting between his events in Orlando and his assignment at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. The camaraderie hooked him.

“Once I got to participate and train with the other athletes that were there, I learned about their stories and the things they’re going through,” he said. “It's like, wow, you know, there are other people out there in the military community … that all have their struggles, and they are facing their adversity.”

“Then I ended up finding this new community,” Millan added, “I didn’t realize how badly I needed that.”

He was invited to participate in the 2025 Invictus Games, where he took Gold in rowing. The togetherness, teamwork, and community inspired his second promise.

‘I Got You’

In the 2025 games, Millan will again wear Team SOCOM colors. He qualified for the “Ultimate Champion” category, a grueling slate of every individual event: powerlifting, cycling, swimming, archery, shooting, rowing, track and field, and volleyball. He uses his experience to help service members who are struggling, recruiting new athletes, visiting recovery units, and offering virtual coaching to anyone who needs it. He shares his message of recovery and support to uplift others.

“If you’re a teammate of mine, I got you,” he stresses. “I will come to you and walk you through the things that helped me. I’ll do this with you. I’ll tell them this is what I did that helped me. I didn't follow a guided path. I didn't have someone walking me through it. But if you're in my community … I got you.”

Health and Fitness Key to Recovery

As the WCP-CC East Region noncommissioned officer in charge, he is a liaison to U.S. Army Special Operations Command and visits the Soldier Recovery Unit twice a week. He demonstrates workouts, shares nutrition tips, and, most importantly, listens.

“I learn about their stories and the stuff they're going through,” Millan said. “I say, ‘here are the things that helped me to get through what I was going through.’ Maybe what I've learned in my own journey that could possibly help.”

“I just embrace it, and they embrace. That helps amplify any type of recovery,” he added.

To continue to keep his own health in check, he trains. He believes movement builds mood and resilience. A chemotherapy-induced heart issue demands top fitness, so he lifts, rows, and runs often.

“To build resilience, you have to build a routine,” he said. “Maybe you start with walking 20 minutes a day. Then it builds from there. Your body is meant to move.” For him, exercise helps his mental health. “My mood and my attitude are directly tied to how I feel.”

Millan maintains annual needed checkups through the care of his MHS team.

“I get labs and then I have specialty care for my heart,” he said. “I'm able to use these specialty clinics to help with issues I'm having from chemotherapy right on base.”

Millan refuses to let cancer define him, but it does define his new outlook—living by a new mantra:

“There’s more I want to do in life,” he said. “And I’m not done yet.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/Jerry-Millan.png,N,0.0,2025-07-24 13:56:14.578085

QLEs can be a powerful tool to get the right plan without delay. Therefore, it's worth knowing what counts as a QLE and how the process works.

Tricare, like most health care programs, won’t let you switch between plans whenever you feel like it. Generally speaking, you have to wait until the annual open season to be able to switch your health care coverage. Tricare's open season typically runs from the Monday of the second full week in November to the Monday of the second full week in December. Changes made during this open season take effect Jan. 1.

What Counts as a QLE

However, you can also make changes to your Tricare plan within 90 days of someone in your family having a qualifying life event. Tricare has a pretty long list of QLEs. These include:

Retiring

Separating from the military

Activating or deactivating from reserve or National Guard

Marriage, divorce or annulment

Birth or adoption of a child

Placement of a child by a court in a member's home

Children becoming adults

Death in the family

Child moving away to college

Relocation to a new country, city, region or ZIP code

Government-directed primary care manager change

Government-directed health plan change

Gaining or losing permission to have family members accompany the military member at an overseas assignment

A retired reservist turning age 60 and gaining Tricare eligibility

Becoming eligible for Medicare

Change in eligibility status for either member of a joint service family

Losing or gaining other health insurance, such as employer insurance

Rapid Response to Changing Circumstances

As you can see, many people experience one or more of these situations each year, opening opportunities to change Tricare plans.

For example, let's say you're on Tricare Prime. Prime requires all care to be coordinated through the patient's primary care manager. You need a referral for any specialty care, and speciality care must be from a Prime network provider.

Your child injures their knee playing soccer, and you're frustrated with the process to get the necessary radiological imaging and referrals to physical therapy. But, your other child just moved to college. As long as you're within 90 days of that change of address, you're in a QLE period that would allow you to switch to Tricare Select. With Select, you don't need a referral and you can go to any Tricare-authorized provider, not just those who accept Tricare Prime.

Switching Tricare Coverage After a QLE

In order for the QLE to unlock your ability to change Tricare plans, you'll first need to make any relevant changes to your personal information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), such as updating an address. Then contact Tricare within 90 days of the QLE to make your plan change. You should be able to do this online or by telephone.

The plan change will be retroactive to the date of the QLE, so it'll make your life easier if you make the change as close to the QLE as possible. Otherwise, you may need to refile claims for care that took place during that period of time. That can get messy, so it's best to avoid it.

If your change incurs the payment of any enrollment fees or premiums, you'll need to pay those retroactively to the date of the QLE. For example, if you're part of a retiree family whose sponsor entered the military before Jan. 1, 2018, and you switch from Tricare Select to Tricare Prime, you'll owe those additional enrollment fees from the date of the QLE to the date that you made the switch.

It's important to note that Uniformed Services Family Health Plans (USFHP) are a Tricare Prime primary care manager (PCM) choice and that movement between USFHP and military-managed Tricare Prime does not have to wait for an open season or QLE. You can switch between military-managed Tricare Prime and a USFHP at any point in time.

“And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.” In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games.

I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”","After U.S. Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Aaron Lin cleared landmines from an Iraqi neighborhood in 2008, a local resident came up and reached out his hand. “Thank you for making my neighborhood safe for my grandkids,” the man told the explosive ordnance disposal technician.

It was a moment of gratitude and trust that Lin carried with him throughout his deployment. “I thought to myself, I could do this job for the rest of my life,” he said. “We were disarming 10 improvised explosive devices a day …trip wires, land mines, pressure plates, anything you could think of. I was supremely confident.”

But an attack on his unit during another deployment in Afghanistan took a toll on him. “All that confidence I had just went to the basement. It just bottomed out.”

He would begin to suffer an injury with no visible scars: posttraumatic stress disorder. It was Lin’s turn to reach out—and his leadership, family, and professionals in the Military Health System took his hand.

Attack on March 30, 2010

Lin and his team were disarming IEDs on foot when an explosion ripped through their patrol. Two of his friends were killed. He felt immense guilt that he survived when others died. “I got blown up a couple times, but that part didn’t really bother me,” he said. “What bothered me is we had a couple casualties that day. I should have died out there with them.”

Lin said the motto of EOD training, “initial success or total failure,” haunted him as he felt like “a complete failure.” He returned home, but not the same. Even in joyous moments, he felt nothing. “I was numb,” Lin said. “I could not feel closeness to my wife. I just couldn’t feel anything.” He deployed again but was “running away from my problems and everything.” When he returned home this time, he experienced depression and detachment, and suffered nightmares. It was a “a pain that I can't describe,” he said. “But I could feel it in my heart.”

A Sergeant Intervenes

Lin, then stationed at Joint Base Andrews, was struggling as new deployment orders to Syria fast approached. “I could not handle it. I was not sleeping and having nightmares every other night.”

A unit leader noticed Lin was struggling. According to Lin, he was doing the “first sergeant thing” by simply asking if he was OK. “I was like, ‘I'm fine, I’m fine. I don’t need any help,’” said Lin. But the first sergeant could tell he wasn’t fine. At his encouragement, Lin decided to go to the mental health clinic.

That intervention led to six weeks of intensive outpatient treatment at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. There, he was diagnosed with PTSD and started a comprehensive treatment plan under the care of his MHS team. “They had a schedule for me printed out for the whole six weeks,” he said. “Cognitive processing therapy, yoga, art, sleep classes, group therapy … it helped me to start looking at things differently. It’s basically anything you can think of to help yourself work through it.”

He credits the Fort Belvoir care team with saving his life. “That intensive outpatient truly changed me … I came out of it so much better than I was before.”

Lin was also inspired by the acts of the first sergeant that he applied to be one himself. “When he pushed me to go to mental health, I decided that I wanted to become a first sergeant so I could pay it forward and help other people,” he said. Like his former first sergeant, he encouraged those who seemed to be struggling to seek help. Yet an attempted suicide in Lin’s unit brought back to negative thoughts of doubt and self-worth. “All those feelings that I got back while I was deployed: ‘What could I have done different?’ I thought I did everything that I possibly could to prevent that. I began to plummet again.”

‘Warrior Mindset’ and Perseverance

While Lin continued mental health treatment, a friend and fellow EOD technician convinced him to give the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program a chance. Lin questioned whether he deserved to be in the program. “I’m not missing a limb,” he said. “I don’t think I belong.” But seeing the other wounded warriors sharing their own stories, Lin decided to try out for Team Air Force. “I found something that helped me reconnect,” Lin said. “Being with other warriors who understood, it gave me a path forward.”

“I found the power of sports, competing, striving for something,” Lin said. “And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.”

In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games. He went on to earn silver medals in wheelchair basketball and rugby.

His new passion for athletics didn’t stop there. At trials and competitions throughout the year, Lin medaled in air pistol, placed in archery, and exceled in discus, shot put, and rowing. In the 2024 DOD Warrior Games, he recalled a moment where he channeled his “warrior mindset” when his rowing team was facing last place in competition. “When I was in Afghanistan and Iraq, you had to have that warrior mindset,” Lin said. “If your team is down, you still have to push through, whether that’s on the field of sports or the field of battle.”

He leveraged the experience of his own journey to encourage his team to persevere. “We are not representing the Air Force like this,” he told the team. “We pulled each other up and ended up coming back and getting bronze. That bronze felt like gold.”

Out of competition, Lin gave back. He has mentored adaptive sports athletes and has helped several make Team Air Force. He shared his journey as an Air Force Wounded Warrior ambassador, speaking at events to fellow service members around the country. He encourages fellow service members to reach out to local mental-health clinics, chaplains, or inpatient care, and shares resources like to Military OneSource for support.

Even with all the support from his health care team, the Wounded Warrior program, and friends, Lin stresses his wife has been his strongest form of support, “100%.” “She’s my caregiver. She reminds me to take my medicine, grounds me when I wake up from night terrors. She’s the reason I can do what I do,” he said. “What’s most important is you and your family. That’s forever.”

He said the warrior mindset is not about perfection, “It’s about heart and perseverance.”

Lighting the Path Forward

Since 2024, Lin has been promoted to senior master sergeant, received his master’s degree, named Air Force Male Athlete of the Year, and is competing in the 2025 DOD Warrior Games, representing his team as a torchbearer—an honor bestowed upon him by his teammates. “They entrusted me to be the warrior spirit of the team,” he said. “I don’t take that lightly.”

Lin hopes his story encourages others to ask for help and stay the course. “When you or your team gets knocked down, you got to get back up. Got to do it again. Got to try again.”

Lin said he continues to push forward. Still serving. Still finishing the mission—thanks to the care of his MHS team. “I wish I had sought help earlier, but I’m here now, and I’m better for it,” Lin said. “Our health care system really didn't turn me away. I'm grateful for that. Even though I didn't feel like I deserved the help, they didn't turn me away. They took care of my concerns and took me seriously. I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”",https://dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/8953663.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-24 13:56:28.961664

The Medicare exclusion Best known as the federal health insurance program for adults aged 65 and older, Medicare also covers nearly 7 million non-elderly people with disabilities.
Depending on the type of birth control, these costs may add up to anywhere between $48 and $1,800 a year.
For women with disabilities, a population with higher unemployment rates and lower wages than the general population, that kind of cost is a major deterrent to getting on birth control.
Advocates are contacting their congressional representatives to push for action, but the current Congress seems more focused on stripping people of their health insurance than improving it.","With new laws in 19 U.S. states giving residents little choice but to carry an unwanted or dangerous pregnancy to term, many people consider access to birth control more essential than ever.

In the six months after the Supreme Court revoked the constitutional right to abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, permanent contraception use surged. Rates of tubal sterilization increased most among U.S. women aged 18 to 49 who lived in states with abortion bans. In those states, from June to December of 2022, procedure rates rose 39 percent, from 3.6 procedures per 10,000 women per month to 5 procedures per 10,000 women per month (a “person-month” is a way researchers can measure change over time in a given population).

This increased reliance on permanent contraception has been made possible by federal mandates requiring that health insurers cover contraceptives without out-of-pocket costs. By law, the federal low-income plan Medicaid, the U.S. military insurer TRICARE, and most employer-based private health insurance plans protect the vast majority of insured women—perhaps as many as 90 percent, according to our calculations—from receiving bills as high as $6,000 for tubal ligation surgery.

Yet, even as more women seek permanent or long-acting reversible contraception to avoid unwanted pregnancy, our research shows that people with disabilities may struggle to obtain a permanent or long-lasting solution. This is particularly true for those enrolled in Medicare, which remains exempt from the federal mandates that make birth control an economic possibility for so many women.

The Medicare exclusion

Best known as the federal health insurance program for adults aged 65 and older, Medicare also covers nearly 7 million non-elderly people with disabilities. This figure includes more than 1.3 million reproductive-aged women, research shows.

Yet Medicare does not cover permanent contraception for pregnancy prevention—only as a treatment for conditions like endometriosis. Patients can be denied that coverage even when clinicians explicitly indicate that a future pregnancy could seriously endanger their health. Medicare also requires that patients pay substantial out-of-pocket costs for hormonal birth control pills and long-acting reversible contraceptives like intrauterine devices (IUDs), typically requiring copays (a fixed dollar amount) or coinsurance (a percentage of the full cost). Depending on the type of birth control, these costs may add up to anywhere between $48 and $1,800 a year.

For women with disabilities, a population with higher unemployment rates and lower wages than the general population, that kind of cost is a major deterrent to getting on birth control.

A new peer-reviewed study, published in JAMA Network Open in June 2025 and conducted by Meghan Bellerose, one of the authors of this story, finds that women with disabilities enrolled in Medicare had 72 percent lower contraceptive use than women with disabilities enrolled in Medicaid, the federal government’s other public health insurance plan, which fully covers contraception.

Some of these Medicare-insured women later obtained full contraceptive coverage by enrolling in an additional insurance plan—specifically, Medicaid. Contraceptive use among those women increased by 35 percent within one year, the study shows.

Medicare’s contraception problem was on the Biden administration’s radar. That led to some progress in Medicare covering contraceptives, including IUDs and implants (albeit with copays and coinsurance). It’s unclear why those changes did not include full contraceptive coverage on par with Medicaid and TRICARE.

Given that the vast majority of Medicare’s reproductive-aged population is disabled, this coverage gap has undeniably discriminatory effects. And it reinforces longstanding neglect of disabled women’s reproductive health needs in the United States.

Historic discrimination continues

The origins of Medicare’s contraception exclusions are rooted in a troubling history of reproductive discrimination against disabled women.

Nearly a century ago, a notorious 1927 Supreme Court case called Buck v. Bell legally sanctioned the forced sterilization of people deemed “feebleminded,” a category that explicitly included people with disabilities. The case originated with 17-year-old Carrie Buck, whose state mental institution sought to forcibly sterilize her after she was raped and became pregnant. Disturbingly, according to the National Women’s Law Center, 31 states and Washington, D.C. still have forced sterilization laws on their books. Their existence underscores the deeply entrenched ableism within American reproductive policy.

Today, harmful stereotypes persist about sex and people with disabilities. Disabled women frequently report that health-care providers expressed surprise or discomfort when they requested contraception. Research shows that this reaction reflects outdated assumptions that people with disabilities are asexual or do not want to become parents. In reality, disabled women are just as likely to desire sexual relationships and pregnancy as anyone else, and they need the same access to contraception.

In this way, our research shows that Medicare’s lack of contraceptive coverage intensifies existing and historic inequality in the U.S. It simultaneously endangers women’s health, autonomy, and dignity.

Little progress in states or Congress

There’s a clear path out of this mess, but it would require Congress to act.

In December 2024, Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced a bipartisan bill, Closing the Contraception Coverage Gap Act, which would eliminate cost-sharing for contraception in the Medicare program. Evidence shows that similar changes to private insurance plans made under the Affordable Care Act increased contraceptive use.

But the bill died with the end of the last legislative session. To advance, the legislation must be reintroduced then scheduled for a hearing before a full-Senate vote by the Senate Finance Committee —a stage that roughly ten percent of introduced bills reach. Advocates are contacting their congressional representatives to push for action, but the current Congress seems more focused on stripping people of their health insurance than improving it.

In the shorter term, the Department of Health and Human Services could update the list of prescriptions covered by Medicare to eliminate copays and coinsurance for hormonal birth control pills and other prescription contraceptive methods, with changes going into effect within 60 days without a state approval process. Meanwhile, states could extend their own contraceptive care safety nets, for example by expanding Title X clinics, although that, too, is difficult given recent Republican cuts to Medicaid and Planned Parenthood.

These reforms expanding contraceptive access to 1.5 million more Americans were important before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. They are urgent now.",https://rewirenewsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicare-Contraception-Web.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-24 12:56:11.915247

Understanding your benefits can be challenging, especially during a time when finding help feels urgent. The short answer is yes — TRICARE does provide coverage for inpatient rehab, but it’s important to understand how it works, what’s included, and the steps to access treatment.

In this insightful resource, Downbeach reviews TRICARE’s inpatient rehab benefits, the requirements you’ll need to meet, and what you can expect when seeking treatment in Orange County.

Understanding TRICARE and Eligibility

TRICARE is the health care program for active duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, and eligible family members. It also covers certain survivors and former spouses. The program offers comprehensive medical benefits, including behavioral health and substance use disorder treatment.

For those in California, TRICARE operates through regional contractors who manage provider networks and authorize care. If you live in Orange County or are stationed nearby, you may be able to use TRICARE benefits at approved rehab facilities in the area.

Eligibility is determined by your status and plan type—TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, TRICARE Reserve Select, and others each have different referral and authorization processes.

Does TRICARE Cover Inpatient Rehab?

TRICARE covers inpatient rehab for substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions when treatment is deemed medically necessary. Inpatient rehab, also called residential treatment, means staying at a facility for round-the-clock care and structured therapeutic programming.

Services covered under inpatient rehab may include:

Medically supervised detoxification

Individual, group, and family therapy sessions

Medication-assisted treatment when appropriate

24-hour clinical monitoring and support

Aftercare and discharge planning

Length of stay depends on clinical assessments and ongoing reviews. Pre-authorization is typically required, except in emergencies where stabilization must occur before formal approvals.

TRICARE’s Requirements for Coverage

To use TRICARE benefits for inpatient rehab, several conditions must be met:

Medical Necessity

A licensed provider must confirm that inpatient care is clinically necessary. This is often determined when outpatient care is not enough to ensure safety or effective recovery, such as in cases of severe withdrawal risk, repeated relapses, or co-occurring mental health conditions.

Authorized Facilities

Only TRICARE-approved facilities qualify for coverage in the area, including an accredited treatment facility in Orange County. Some local rehabs may be out-of-network, which can affect costs and require additional approvals. It’s important to verify network status before admission.

Referral and Pre-Authorization

Depending on your plan, you may need both a referral from your primary care manager (PCM) and pre-authorization from TRICARE. Emergency situations may allow admission without prior authorization, but follow-up approval will still be needed.

Inpatient Rehab in Orange County

Orange County is known for its high-quality treatment programs and access to specialized services for military families. Some centers in the region focus on evidence-based care and offer dual diagnosis treatment for those dealing with both substance use and mental health challenges, including a trusted treatment center that takes TRICARE.

Inpatient rehab typically begins with a comprehensive intake and medical assessment, followed by detox if necessary. After stabilization, clients engage in daily therapy, structured activities, and holistic support designed to promote recovery.

Program lengths vary, but many run 30, 60, or 90 days depending on clinical progress and TRICARE authorizations.

Costs and Out-of-Pocket Expenses

While TRICARE covers most inpatient rehab costs, your exact out-of-pocket expenses depend on several factors:

Plan type: TRICARE Prime usually has lower costs compared to TRICARE Select.

Network status: In-network facilities typically reduce your share of the cost, while out-of-network care may involve higher cost-sharing or balance billing.

Status (active duty vs. retiree): Active duty members generally have minimal or no cost-sharing obligations.

Confirming benefits ahead of time—through both TRICARE and the facility—helps prevent unexpected costs.

Coordinating Care Through TRICARE

To make the process smoother, take these steps when seeking inpatient rehab:

Verify that the facility is TRICARE-authorized.

Obtain any required referral or pre-authorization.

Confirm your cost-sharing responsibilities and covered services.

Coordinate aftercare plans for continued support following discharge.

Admissions staff at many Orange County rehabs are familiar with TRICARE’s processes and can assist with documentation and approvals.

Coverage for Co-Occurring Mental Health Conditions

Many people with substance use disorders also experience mental health conditions such as PTSD, depression, or anxiety. TRICARE covers integrated treatment for these co-occurring conditions, often referred to as dual diagnosis care.

Receiving treatment for both substance use and mental health issues at the same time is considered best practice, and TRICARE often authorizes this approach when medically necessary.

Alternatives to Inpatient Care

If you do not require 24-hour supervision, TRICARE also covers other levels of behavioral health care, including:

Partial hospitalization programs (PHP): Intensive day programs with structured therapy but no overnight stay.

Intensive outpatient programs (IOP): Multiple therapy sessions each week, often used as step-down care after inpatient treatment.

Standard outpatient therapy: Weekly or biweekly sessions for ongoing recovery support.

These options can be effective for individuals with stable living environments and lower clinical risk.

How to Get Started

If you’re ready to begin the process:

Contact your PCM or military treatment facility to discuss your situation and request a referral.

Call TRICARE or your regional contractor to verify coverage, confirm network facilities, and check authorization requirements.

Speak with Orange County rehab centers that accept TRICARE to learn about program availability and admissions steps.

Taking these actions can help ensure a smoother path to treatment and recovery.

Using TRICARE for Inpatient Rehab Care in Orange County

By understanding your plan’s requirements, confirming facility authorization, and coordinating referrals and pre-approvals, you can access high-quality care with minimized out-of-pocket costs.

,,2025-07-23 20:37:27+00:00,DVIDS,He was Given 6 Weeks to Live. That was in 2019. - DVIDS,Not Available,,,,,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/543657/he-given-6-weeks-live-2019,"It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.
“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said.
“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said.
Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.” Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition.
That’s reality.” Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.","U.S. Army Master Sgt. Jerry Millan lives life by two promises:

“I’m not done yet,” was his vow when Military Health System doctors gave him a lifechanging diagnosis—a rare cancer in his abdominal area, the “most aggressive cancer they've ever come across,” he said. It was 2019, and Millan was given six weeks to live.

The second, “I got you,” is his assurance to fellow service members he mentors that he’ll be there to support them and his fellow athletes as they prepare for the 2025 Department of Defense Warrior Games.

Millan’s cancer has been in remission for over five years, and he shares his story of survival to encourage and lift up others facing difficult odds.

A Sudden Pain, A Grim Diagnosis

Millan, a special operations forces soldier, was participating in pre-deployment training in the woods of Fort Polk, Louisiana, when he hit the ground and felt a sharp pain in his gut. He thought it was just a hernia. A medic agreed and ordered a scan. The scan confirmed an umbilical hernia, but the military radiologist saw more.

“I just had this pain in my navel. It wasn’t a typical pain from exercise or indigestion; rather, something unfamiliar” Millan recalled. “But thanks to the radiologist—they saw multiple masses inside my abdomen.”

He was immediately sent to the Murtha Cancer Center at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, where specialists identified Burkitt’s Lymphoma, an aggressive growing type of cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. He waited with his parents to find out the prognosis.

“When the doctor came in and said, ‘six weeks,’ my mom ran out the room, bawling her eyes out,” Millan said. “I'm just sitting there looking at like the floor, my dad's sitting at the edge of the bed, and I started saying to myself, ‘I'm not done yet.’”

“It was just a decision to live.”

MHS and NIH Partner to Save his Life

Because Burkitt’s Lymphoma is rare, Walter Reed oncologists quickly linked Millan with doctors and researchers at the NIH who study the disease. The partnership gave him access to an experimental, high-dose chemotherapy protocol for six cycles.

“From the day that they told me chemotherapy was my only option, I started the following Monday,” he said. “At the time, three doctors in network in the United States were trained on that type of cancer.”

Like the cancer, the treatment was aggressive.

“You’re given a massive dose of chemotherapy—I was on a 96-hour drip at first,” he said. “It was the harshest form of chemotherapy that has been developed. But you had to do it because the cancer, by that time, grew over 1000%. My gut was extremely distended.”

Besides the side effects of cancer treatments, he found the isolation to be an additional challenge. He was diagnosed just before the pandemic in 2020. Due to his severely compromised immune system and COVID-19, he was unable to be around people for the better part of a year. On top of that, the unit he trained so hard with deployed without him.

“My friends were deployed; I couldn't see my family. I couldn't have conversations face to face, it was: Wash your hands, wear your face shields, don’t touch each other,” he said.

His mental resilience was one of the key factors to his recovery. Millan said it was a “direct contribution to my surviving.”

Millan also connected with the U.S. Special Operations Command Warrior Care Program - Care Coalition. They gave his mother a place to stay during treatment, arranged flights, and later linked him to educational resources and a staff position to let him continue serving while he healed.

They made sure his mother could focus on him and not on logistics. “She didn’t have to worry about anything,” Millan said. “She could just focus on me.”

After his chemotherapy rounds, doctors declared him cancer-free.

Finding New Strength Through Sports

Millan looked for what was next and returned to serving—yet struggled to navigate what his new duty looked like while in recovery.

“I felt like they really had no use for me. They had people that were deployable and ready to go. And I can’t. That’s reality.”

Through his experience with WCP-CC, he decided to join the USSOCOM Warrior Care Program’s Military Adaptive Sports team.

“The Military Adaptive Sports program provided me the opportunity to find a new purpose in life by helping others going through similar situations,” he said. “They helped me find a new community.”

He trained for powerlifting, rowing, sitting volleyball, track and field, and precision air sports. At his first DOD Warrior Games in 2022, he balanced competition with duty, commuting between his events in Orlando and his assignment at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. The camaraderie hooked him.

“Once I got to participate and train with the other athletes that were there, I learned about their stories and the things they’re going through,” he said. “It's like, wow, you know, there are other people out there in the military community … that all have their struggles, and they are facing their adversity.”

“Then I ended up finding this new community,” Millan added, “I didn’t realize how badly I needed that.”

He was invited to participate in the 2025 Invictus Games, where he took Gold in rowing. The togetherness, teamwork, and community inspired his second promise.

‘I Got You’

In the 2025 games, Millan will again wear Team SOCOM colors. He qualified for the “Ultimate Champion” category, a grueling slate of every individual event: powerlifting, cycling, swimming, archery, shooting, rowing, track and field, and volleyball. He uses his experience to help service members who are struggling, recruiting new athletes, visiting recovery units, and offering virtual coaching to anyone who needs it. He shares his message of recovery and support to uplift others.

“If you’re a teammate of mine, I got you,” he stresses. “I will come to you and walk you through the things that helped me. I’ll do this with you. I’ll tell them this is what I did that helped me. I didn't follow a guided path. I didn't have someone walking me through it. But if you're in my community … I got you.”

Health and Fitness Key to Recovery

As the WCP-CC East Region noncommissioned officer in charge, he is a liaison to U.S. Army Special Operations Command and visits the Soldier Recovery Unit twice a week. He demonstrates workouts, shares nutrition tips, and, most importantly, listens.

“I learn about their stories and the stuff they're going through,” Millan said. “I say, ‘here are the things that helped me to get through what I was going through.’ Maybe what I've learned in my own journey that could possibly help.”

“I just embrace it, and they embrace. That helps amplify any type of recovery,” he added.

To continue to keep his own health in check, he trains. He believes movement builds mood and resilience. A chemotherapy-induced heart issue demands top fitness, so he lifts, rows, and runs often.

“To build resilience, you have to build a routine,” he said. “Maybe you start with walking 20 minutes a day. Then it builds from there. Your body is meant to move.” For him, exercise helps his mental health. “My mood and my attitude are directly tied to how I feel.”

Millan maintains annual needed checkups through the care of his MHS team.

“I get labs and then I have specialty care for my heart,” he said. “I'm able to use these specialty clinics to help with issues I'm having from chemotherapy right on base.”

Millan refuses to let cancer define him, but it does define his new outlook—living by a new mantra:

“There’s more I want to do in life,” he said. “And I’m not done yet.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2502/8874038/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 17:56:12.075703

“At the 174th Medical Group, we are a non-treatment facility,” said Maj. Karen Marshall, a physician’s assistant assigned to the 174th Medical Group, 174th Attack Wing, New York Air National Guard.","Thirty-six New York Air National Guard Airmen, the majority hailing from the Syracuse, NY, headquartered 174th Attack Wing, completed a two-week medical facility annual training overseas in Italy at U.S. Naval Support Activity Naples, May 10-24.

The medical facility annual training, or MFAT, is a unit-funded National Guard program that enables service members to maintain their mission-essential medical skills proficiency and clinical readiness tasks that Airmen are unable to complete at their home station.

Every year, medical groups from across the Air National Guard are ranked on their performance and bid on locations to complete an MFAT.

During the two-week event the Airmen honed their medical skills while serving alongside U.S. Navy Sailors and civilian medical providers at U.S. Naval Hospital (USNH) Naples, a Defense Health Agency facility which provides routine and emergency medical care for U.S. service members and their dependents stationed in the Mediterranean.

“This training event lets us vault our readiness,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Matt Murray, the 174th Medical Group’s medical administrative officer. “It also demonstrates our interoperability with another service.”

Located in southern Italy on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea, NSA Naples it is home to U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Africa and the U.S. Sixth Fleet. USNH Naples provides medical care for approximately 15,000 U.S. service members and 9,000 dependents and retirees.

“We don’t have a lot of visiting providers from other units coming in, so this is a change,” said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Claire-Marie Gould, the director of human resources for USNH Naples. “Most of our visiting providers are from the Navy, so this is a change.”

During the two-week MFAT, the New York Air National Guard Airmen augmented USNH Naples staffing levels which resulted in increased patient care capabilities.

New York Air National Guard physician assistants conducted surgical procedures, bio-environmental engineering conducted air and water quality testing, and dental teams performed exams and oral treatments.

“We only have one optometrist, so we have very limited access to care for optometry,” Gould said. ""With an Air Force optometrist here seeing patients, we could see patients that we would normally have to refer to the community network.”

In addition to providing increased patient care at USNH Naples, the Airmen conducted hands-on medical training they aren’t normally able to accomplish during drill weekends.

“At the 174th Medical Group, we are a non-treatment facility,” said Maj. Karen Marshall, a physician’s assistant assigned to the 174th Medical Group, 174th Attack Wing, New York Air National Guard. “We’re there to make sure that members are ready for duty mobility and fitness.”

Because the 174th Attack Wing doesn’t possess a treatment facility, the Airmen assigned to the 174th must work in other facilities to obtain their mandatory clinical hours.

“Everyone has been able to do their job, which has been amazing, because as a DSG or a traditional guardsman, we don’t always have the opportunity to get this type of training,” Murray said. “We’re very much focused on the readiness of everybody else but this is an opportunity to focus on us.”

In addition to working at USNH Naples for two weeks, the Air National Guardsmen also had the opportunity to experience some of the rich history and culture of Naples, Italy.

“These are the types of events that build morale,” Murray said. “They build camaraderie and they build teamwork. We’re very grateful to have the opportunity to come here and we’re grateful for NSA Naples for welcoming us.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2506/9115189/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 19:56:08.497414

Pharmacy Patient Info & FAQ

Pharmacy Issues, Databases & Uploads

Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency (PUTT) is a non-profit advocacy organization founded by independent pharmacists and pharmacy owners devoted to exposing the truth about the anti-competitive tactics of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs – aka pharmacy benefit companies or PBCs ). Known to most Americans as their “prescription drug benefit plan” provider, PBMs are in reality a $300 billion industry – giant corporate middlemen driving up the cost of medications with huge mark ups and commissions on every prescription covered under their “benefits plan.”

​

Working with local and national traditional and digital media that includes The New York Times, USA Today, CBS News, Bloomberg, NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and Business Insider, PUTT seeks to educate patients, lawmakers, health plan sponsors and the public about the deeply negative effects of the PBM industry on U.S. healthcare and the escalating price of prescription medications.

PUTT serves as an industry watchdog, collecting evidence of PBM fraudulent practices and abuse and using this information to educate and inform consumers, taxpayers, employers and health plan sponsors of the truth about the unregulated, unmonitored PBM industry. Through PUTT’s efforts, PBMs have begun to experience greater public awareness and scrutiny of their actions and come under fire for questionable practices including the use of gag clauses at the pharmacy counter, gross over-billing of health plans (called “spread pricing”), forcing patients to use PBM-owned pharmacies instead of allowing patients to choose their own pharmacies and interjecting unnecessary bureaucratic practices such as prior authorizations between patients and their doctors in the matter of prescription refills.

June 7, 1956

What: President Dwight D. Eisenhower signs the Dependents’ Medical Care Act of 1956.

So What: The law codifies the eligibility for space-available military treatment facility (MTF) care for active duty family members, retirees and their families, and survivors. It also establishes coverage for civilian medical care (with cost sharing) for active duty families. Eisenhower supported the legislation as part of his push to “strengthen the career service.”

Sept. 30, 1966

What: Congress approves the Military Medical Benefits Amendments, which provides civilian care coverage (with cost sharing) for working age retirees and would lead to the creation of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS).

So What: After Congress passed legislation creating Medicare in 1965, working age uniformed services retirees were the only beneficiary segment without coverage for civilian medical care. Congress responded with the Military Medical Benefits Amendments that extends civilian coverage to non-Medicare eligible retirees and their dependents. The amendments also allow DoD to contract with civilian facilities, greatly expanding care options for beneficiaries. In the mid-1990s, CHAMPUS would become TRICARE Standard.

Introduction

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a prevalent musculoskeletal condition that significantly affects the health and operational readiness of military service members. Despite its widespread impact, available evidence supports that education on TMD screening, diagnosis, and management is insufficient across medical, dental, and allied health professions. Most health care providers receive little to no formal training in TMD, and existing continuing professional development programs often promote nonevidence-based approaches. This gap in education can contribute to frustration among clinicians and patients, leading to undertreatment, overtreatment, and/or iatrogenic harm.

Materials and Methods

To address this educational deficit, we developed an online, interactive curriculum designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of initial care clinicians in managing TMD. This curriculum is based on Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning and incorporates principles from the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. The course includes four topical modules covering TMD pathophysiology, screening and assessment, diagnosis, and management. Each module features brief, engaging Technology, Entertainment, Design-style videos and interactive case-based scenarios with built-in feedback to reinforce learning. The curriculum also provides ready-to-use clinical assessment tools and patient education resources to facilitate immediate application in clinical settings.

Results

A pilot study was conducted with 30 initial care clinicians from various health care disciplines to assess the course’s impact. Results showed significant increases in knowledge and perceived competence across all four modules (P < .01), with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 0.8). The curriculum is scalable, asynchronous, and adaptable for various learner groups, from health care students to practicing clinicians seeking continuing professional development. Additionally, the course has been made accessible to military clinicians through Joint Knowledge Online and is available as open-access content on MedEdPORTAL for broader use in health professions education.

Conclusions

By improving TMD education, this curriculum aims to equip health care providers with the skills needed to deliver effective, evidence-based care, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and operational readiness in military settings.

THE BURDEN OF TMD

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are a public health issue that impacts the health and operational readiness of our service members. A lack of TMD education and training across the health professions currently exists which may put our service members at increased risk for disability and place our military units at an increased risk for operational mishap or mission failure.1,2 Addressing this gap in education and training will allow military medicine to continue to produce a medically ready force for future operations.

TMD is a group of over 30 musculoskeletal diagnoses related to the temporomandibular joint, masticatory muscles, and associated structures.2 TMDs are the second most prevalent musculoskeletal disorder after chronic low back pain, with 5%–19% of the general population experiencing one or more TMD diagnoses. Chronic TMD occurs at a significantly higher rate in women, particularly between the ages of 18 and 45 years.3,4 While large-scale epidemiological studies in U.S. active duty military populations are lacking, current literature suggests that 8%–36% of service members (SMs) suffer from TMD at any given time.1,5,6 Veterans also commonly experience jaw pain, often rating it as their most severe pain complaint.7

TMD often leads to significant disability and reduced quality of life due to its anatomic location.2 TMD can impair speaking, eating, breathing, physical intimacy, and facial expression.2 In a military context, TMD may impact both physical and cognitive functions that likely increase the risk of warfighter and unit harm. TMD may hinder the wear of protective head and neck equipment that allows the warfighter to function in operational platforms. Additionally, it may impair the ability to chew Meals Ready to Eat (MRE) and other nutrient-dense foods that provide energy to our combatants. Furthermore, TMD may diminish focus and mental acuity through increased cognitive load and altered neural processing associated with central sensitization, thereby potentially increasing the risk of operational mishaps. TMD may also reduce the ability and desire to speak, likely impacting leadership capabilities and critical communications. Cumulatively, temporomandibular joint often leads to missed workdays, deteriorated work performance, high health care costs, and elevated health resource utilization.8

Many TMD patients also suffer from chronic overlapping pain conditions like headache, irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic pain, low back pain, and fibromyalgia.9 TMD is also commonly associated with mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.6,10 This combination of TMD and mental health difficulties increases TMD disability and the risk of suicidal behavior.11 Furthermore, traumatic brain injury and sleep disturbances are common in TMD patients, complicating management and posing a significant threat to operational readiness and health.4,12 Based on this complex nature of TMD and its comorbidities, effective management often requires a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach.13

Recognizing the significant burden of TMD, the National Institutes of Health commissioned the National Academies of the Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to conduct a comprehensive review of TMD in the United States, resulting in a landmark report published in 2020.2 This report highlighted several critical challenges regarding TMD, and it recommended the DoD and DVA work alongside other health systems to address these challenges. Key challenges included: (1) the failure to recognize the substantial burden of TMD on patients and health care systems; (2) insufficient research and scientific understanding of the condition; (3) the absence of evidence-based clinical guidelines for TMD management; (4) limited access to specialized care and centers of excellence for TMD patients; and (5) a significant deficiency in TMD education and training for health professionals. Addressing these challenges is essential to improving patient care and ensuring the military is equipped with a medically ready force equipped for future operational demands. This commentary focuses specifically on the fifth challenge—deficient TMD education—and the steps being taken to close this gap.

BETTER EDUCATION FOR BETTER CARE

Despite the prevalence and impact of TMD, there is a significant shortage of board-certified Orofacial Pain specialists with advanced TMD training within the MHS and civilian sectors. Currently, fewer than 15 Orofacial Pain specialists serve the MHS, with fewer than 300 nationwide in the civilian sector. Given this shortage, it is critical that initial care clinicians (ICCs), including primary care physicians, general dentists, physical therapists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and psychological health providers, be equipped to screen, assess, diagnose, and provide initial management for TMD.

Unfortunately, few health professionals currently receive education on TMD. Most undergraduate and graduate training programs across medicine, dentistry, and advanced practice fields have little to no curriculum time dedicated to TMD.2 Furthermore, many continuing professional development courses promote nonevidence-based approaches that can contradict the conservative and reversible care models advocated for by reputable organizations. This educational gap can result in frustration and angst for clinicians and patients alike. Clinicians may feel underprepared and unequipped to help patients with TMD. Patients may feel either undertreated and dismissed by their doctor, or they may be overtreated with subsequent iatrogenic harm and worsening of their TMD.

To address this gap in TMD education, the authors developed an online, self-paced, interactive course aimed at improving TMD care by enhancing ICC knowledge and competence. This curriculum leverages Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning to maximize learning.14 It features engaging Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED)-style videos to convey important topics and interactive case-based scenarios with built-in feedback to reinforce comprehension. Additionally, clinical tools for assessment and patient education tools are provided to facilitate practical, immediate application in a clinical setting.

The 5-hour course is divided into four modules covering TMD pathophysiology, screening and assessment, diagnosis, and management. It is asynchronous, allowing learners to progress at their own pace, and scalable for delivery to diverse audiences. This course can be used for both student education and continuing professional development.

Based on the principles of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, it was important to ensure this curriculum effectively conveyed clinically relevant information to the learner, particularly given the time and effort required from busy clinicians. To evaluate its impact, we conducted a pilot study that assessed 30 ICCs from across various health professions.15 Using data from pre-vs.-post tests, as well as pre–post respective surveys, the results demonstrated statistically and functionally significant increases in both knowledge and perceived competence for each of the four modules (P < .01), with large effect sizes (Cohen’s d > 0.8). Ongoing research is now evaluating the curriculum’s effectiveness among over 100 recent dental school graduates enrolled in postgraduate year-1 dental residencies, a group that will encounter numerous patients with a TMD throughout their career.

TMD has a significant impact on military and civilian health care, and there is a need for more TMD education for health professionals. We have created a broadly accessible, evidence-based curriculum that addresses this need. The widespread dissemination of this curriculum has the potential to make a significant impact on the clinical practices of ICCs and the lives of the TMD patients they treat. Within a military context, increasing clinician knowledge will allow for more effective care, including in deployed environments, and should ultimately benefit military readiness. This curriculum is accessible to military clinicians via Joint Knowledge Online course #1342, which offers 5 hours of continuing education credit. Within a broader health care context, this course fulfills the NASEM call to provide innovative approaches to interprofessional TMD education, ultimately benefitting society at large. This curriculum is also available via a no-cost, open-access downloadable resource through MedEdPORTAL, allowing health professions instructors to incorporate it into their curricula.15

CONCLUSION

Temporomandibular disorders represent a significant challenge affecting millions of patients, including SMs. Historically, insufficient education on TMD has resulted in clinician frustration and at times even patient harm. By providing evidence-based, widely accessible TMD training, we aim to equip ICCs with the knowledge and skills needed to improve TMD patient care and outcomes. Through better education, we can address this public health issue and ensure a medically ready force for the future.

The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH) Act aims to fix that.
As a result, 55 percent of reproductive-age women on Medicaid live in states that deny abortion coverage beyond rape, incest, or life endangerment.
It also prevents lawmakers from interfering with abortion coverage in private insurance plans, including those sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.
Senator Duckworth described the bill as a step toward guaranteeing abortion coverage for millions of Americans.","In the United States, whether or not you can access abortion often comes down to one question: can you afford it? The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance (EACH) Act aims to fix that. Introduced by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA-7) and Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), the bill would end decades of federal restrictions that deny abortion coverage to people based on how they are insured, which disproportionately harms low-income communities and women of color.

Since 1976, the Hyde Amendment has barred federal funds from covering abortion except in limited cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. Passed annually as part of congressional budget negotiations, Hyde has served as the foundation for a patchwork of federal abortion coverage bans that disproportionately affect people with low incomes.

These bans apply to millions of people who receive health insurance through the federal government, including Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, the Veterans Administration, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the Indian Health Service. As a result, those enrolled in public insurance programs are often forced to pay out of pocket for abortion care or carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.

The harm is not theoretical. More than 34 states follow Hyde restrictions in their Medicaid programs, denying coverage for abortion except under the narrowest exceptions. As a result, 55 percent of reproductive-age women on Medicaid live in states that deny abortion coverage beyond rape, incest, or life endangerment. Over half of these women are people of color.

Research from the Center for Reproductive Rights shows that abortion coverage bans force one in four low-income people seeking abortions to continue their pregnancies. Many are pushed deeper into poverty. Others are forced to delay care while trying to gather the money, often hundreds of dollars, they need to access a safe, legal procedure.

This is not a side effect. It is the point. In 1977, Rep. Henry Hyde, author of the amendment, openly said: “I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the Medicaid bill.”

The EACH Act offers a clear solution. It restores and protects abortion coverage for everyone, regardless of how they are insured.

The bill lifts federal restrictions on abortion coverage, guaranteeing that anyone who receives care or insurance through the federal government can access abortion services. It also prevents lawmakers from interfering with abortion coverage in private insurance plans, including those sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. As All* Above All explains, this would help roll back harmful restrictions that currently exist in many states and return control to patients and providers.

The bill aligns with a growing call from reproductive health advocates to center equity in abortion access. As Power to Decide explains, the EACH Act protects people most affected by systemic racism, economic insecurity, and gaps in health care access, ensuring that abortion is a real option, not just a theoretical right. The Center for Reproductive Rights underscores that lifting coverage bans is essential to breaking cycles of financial distress and poor health outcomes that currently trap people denied reproductive choice.

At the same time, the EACH Act faces predictable political resistance. Opponents of repealing the Hyde Amendment have long argued that it protects taxpayers from funding abortion, a position that continues to influence both federal and state-level policymaking. The Hyde Amendment has been renewed annually since 1976, and despite growing support for its repeal, it remains what The Atlantic called “an unassailable fixture of American budget politics.” In early 2024, some members of Congress introduced legislation to make Hyde permanent, arguing that removing it would overstep federal authority and violate conscience protections.

Abortion is health care, but without insurance coverage, that care becomes unaffordable and inaccessible for millions. The EACH Act recognizes that the right to an abortion means little if you cannot afford one. It could bring the country closer to a future where decisions about pregnancy are guided by personal values, not financial hardship or political interference.

When people are forced to carry pregnancies against their will because their insurance does not cover abortion, the consequences ripple through every part of their lives. Economic stability, mental and physical health, and family wellbeing all suffer. As the Center for Reproductive Rights makes clear, abortion coverage bans trap people in poverty and punish them for seeking care. Supporters argue that the EACH Act would help dismantle these barriers and protect the ability of individuals to make decisions that are right for them and their families.

Senator Duckworth described the bill as a step toward guaranteeing abortion coverage for millions of Americans. Power to Decide called it a critical piece of legislation to protect those who are most often pushed to the margins. And All* Above All frames it as central to the fight for abortion justice.

Passing the EACH Act will not undo every injustice in reproductive care, but abortion advocates say it will bring us closer to a future where your zip code, your paycheck, and your insurance card do not determine your access to abortion.",https://feminist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/manny-becerra-327aqhBAfO8-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 15:56:41.397258

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted.
Getting started at a military pharmacy Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy?
Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions: My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication.
If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?","Have you recently filled a prescription at a military pharmacy? If so, you may know that military pharmacies have different procedures than civilian pharmacies. When a provider issues a new prescription to a military pharmacy, you need to activate the prescription before a pharmacist fills it.

Recently, the Defense Health Agency has developed and updated two tools — Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters — to make this prescription pickup process easier and more convenient.

“The Defense Health Agency has integrated Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters into military pharmacies for multiple reasons,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Emily Zywicke, chief of the Direct Care Branch, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the DHA. “This technology reduces traffic in pharmacy lobbies. It also helps you save time by giving you real-time updates on your prescription status and enabling prescription pickup.”

Q-Anywhere

Q-Anywhere is a feature that allows you to activate new prescriptions without physically being in the pharmacy. To activate your prescription, text “Get in line” to your local military pharmacy’s number. Then, follow the prompts to get a Q-Anywhere number. You can also scan the pharmacy’s QR code for web-based enrollment.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to refill an existing prescription?

A: No. Q-Anywhere is for filling new prescriptions. To refill a prescription, use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or call your military pharmacy’s refill number.

Q: Can I text Q-Anywhere in the evening or on the weekends to activate prescriptions?

A: At some military pharmacies, Q-Anywhere is available 24/7, so you may be able to activate your prescription outside of normal business hours. However, the pharmacy staff will process your prescription request during normal business hours.

Q: Will I lose my spot if I’m not present when called?

A: No. If you leave the pharmacy after arriving to pick up your prescription using Q-Anywhere, simply re-text “I’m here” when you return to the pharmacy. Your Q-Anywhere number is only valid on the day it was issued. If you were unable to pick up your prescriptions that day, you’ll have to start a new Q-Anywhere request or pull a number when you arrive at the pharmacy.

(Note: Some pharmacies have a dedicated window you can go to when your prescription is ready for pickup. You can go straight there when you get the text message that your prescription is ready.)

Q: Can I close out the web page messaging system once I get my Q-Anywhere number?

A: Please keep the web page open to get real-time updates from pharmacy staff about your prescriptions and notifications when your prescriptions are ready. However, you can open a new web page to continue using the internet.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to request prescriptions for multiple family members?

A: Yes. Enter the first patient’s Department of Defense Identification Number and wait to get confirmation they’re added. Next, enter the second family member’s DOD ID number. You can add up to four people.

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted. Once you get a text stating “You are now in line,” respond with the name and date of birth of the intended family member and the prescriptions you would like filled.

ScriptCenter

ScriptCenters are automated locker or vending machine-like units. They provide convenient prescription pickup, allowing you to pick up your prescription without interacting with pharmacy staff. The locations of ScriptCenters vary, but many may be available in centralized areas, like the Exchange lobby. Although times vary by pharmacy location, some are available 24/7.

To begin using ScriptCenter, you must complete a one-time in-person enrollment at a ScriptCenter kiosk. You’ll need to scan your Uniformed Services ID card and create a username and PIN. You no longer need to have your prescription number to use ScriptCenter.

“Our military community is incredibly busy, and we understand the struggle of shifting schedules. After-hours prescription pickup helps those who can’t get to the pharmacy during normal operating hours,” added Zywicke. “ScriptCenter decreases congestion in pharmacy lobbies and helps shorten wait times.”

Q: When will my prescriptions be ready in the ScriptCenter?

A: When you request a refill via the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or a refill phone line, the automated prompts will tell you your pickup time.

Q: What if I forget my “login” ID or PIN?

A: You can recover your User ID or PIN by pressing “Forgot ID” or “Forgot PIN.” Pharmacy staff can help you recover your User ID, but not your PIN. Remember: You can use your DOD ID instead of your User ID to make logging in even easier. But you’ll always need to use your PIN, so be sure to choose something you won’t forget!

Q: How long will my prescriptions be available at the ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions are typically left at the ScriptCenter for 7-10 days (this varies by location). After that time, your prescription will be returned to stock and you’ll have to reactivate or refill your prescription again.

Q: Are there any medications that can’t go in ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions that require refrigeration won’t be placed in the ScriptCenter.

Q: How does ScriptCenter integrate with MHS GENESIS?

A: If you refill a prescription through your MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can request to pick up the medication at a ScriptCenter location (if available).

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter together?

A: Yes, if your military pharmacy uses both systems. When you activate your prescription through Q-Anywhere, you can select ScriptCenter as your pickup location. Be sure you’ve registered with ScriptCenter first.

Other things to note

If you have the US Family Health Plan: You can’t fill prescriptions at military pharmacies. USFHP has its own pharmacy coverage.

Know the difference between prescription refills and renewals: If your provider authorizes refills on your prescription, you can fill the prescription and refill it up to the authorized number of times. A renewal is required when your original prescription expires or runs out of refills. A renewal is considered a new prescription.

Give feedback: Share your experience with Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter through your military hospital or clinic’s Interactive Customer Evaluation survey to help improve the systems.

Getting started at a military pharmacy

Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy? If you do, you won’t have copayments for prescriptions, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. You can even have your civilian provider send your prescriptions to a miliary pharmacy.

Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions:

My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication. What is this pharmacy’s name?

If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?

Do you have my medication in stock?

How far in advance should I request refills? (Military pharmacies can’t always process same-day refill requests. Some pharmacies ask for 48-72 hours’ notice.)

“And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.” In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games.
He has mentored adaptive sports athletes and has helped several make Team Air Force.
He shared his journey as an Air Force Wounded Warrior ambassador, speaking at events to fellow service members around the country.
I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”","After U.S. Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Aaron Lin cleared landmines from an Iraqi neighborhood in 2008, a local resident came up and reached out his hand.

“Thank you for making my neighborhood safe for my grandkids,” the man told the explosive ordnance disposal technician.

It was a moment of gratitude and trust that Lin carried with him throughout his deployment.

“I thought to myself, I could do this job for the rest of my life,” he said. “We were disarming 10 improvised explosive devices a day …trip wires, land mines, pressure plates, anything you could think of. I was supremely confident.”

But an attack on his unit during another deployment in Afghanistan took a toll on him.

“All that confidence I had just went to the basement. It just bottomed out.”

He would begin to suffer an injury with no visible scars: posttraumatic stress disorder. It was Lin’s turn to reach out—and his leadership, family, and professionals in the Military Health System took his hand.

Attack on March 30, 2010

Lin and his team were disarming IEDs on foot when an explosion ripped through their patrol. Two of his friends were killed. He felt immense guilt that he survived when others died.

“I got blown up a couple times, but that part didn’t really bother me,” he said. “What bothered me is we had a couple casualties that day. I should have died out there with them.”

Lin said the motto of EOD training, “initial success or total failure,” haunted him as he felt like “a complete failure.”

He returned home, but not the same. Even in joyous moments, he felt nothing.

“I was numb,” Lin said. “I could not feel closeness to my wife. I just couldn’t feel anything.” He deployed again but was “running away from my problems and everything.” When he returned home this time, he experienced depression and detachment, and suffered nightmares.

It was a “a pain that I can't describe,” he said. “But I could feel it in my heart.”

A Sergeant Intervenes

Lin, then stationed at Joint Base Andrews, was struggling as new deployment orders to Syria fast approached.

“I could not handle it. I was not sleeping and having nightmares every other night.”

A unit leader noticed Lin was struggling. According to Lin, he was doing the “first sergeant thing” by simply asking if he was OK.

“I was like, ‘I'm fine, I’m fine. I don’t need any help,’” said Lin.

But the first sergeant could tell he wasn’t fine. At his encouragement, Lin decided to go to the mental health clinic.

That intervention led to six weeks of intensive outpatient treatment at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. There, he was diagnosed with PTSD and started a comprehensive treatment plan under the care of his MHS team.

“They had a schedule for me printed out for the whole six weeks,” he said. “Cognitive processing therapy, yoga, art, sleep classes, group therapy … it helped me to start looking at things differently. It’s basically anything you can think of to help yourself work through it.”

He credits the Fort Belvoir care team with saving his life. “That intensive outpatient truly changed me … I came out of it so much better than I was before.”

Lin was also inspired by the acts of the first sergeant that he applied to be one himself.

“When he pushed me to go to mental health, I decided that I wanted to become a first sergeant so I could pay it forward and help other people,” he said. Like his former first sergeant, he encouraged those who seemed to be struggling to seek help. Yet an attempted suicide in Lin’s unit brought back to negative thoughts of doubt and self-worth.

“All those feelings that I got back while I was deployed: ‘What could I have done different?’ I thought I did everything that I possibly could to prevent that. I began to plummet again.”

‘Warrior Mindset’ and Perseverance

While Lin continued mental health treatment, a friend and fellow EOD technician convinced him to give the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program a chance.

Lin questioned whether he deserved to be in the program. “I’m not missing a limb,” he said. “I don’t think I belong.”

But seeing the other wounded warriors sharing their own stories, Lin decided to try out for Team Air Force. “I found something that helped me reconnect,” Lin said. “Being with other warriors who understood, it gave me a path forward.”

“I found the power of sports, competing, striving for something,” Lin said. “And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.”

In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games. He went on to earn silver medals in wheelchair basketball and rugby.

His new passion for athletics didn’t stop there. At trials and competitions throughout the year, Lin medaled in air pistol, placed in archery, and exceled in discus, shot put, and rowing. In the 2024 DOD Warrior Games, he recalled a moment where he channeled his “warrior mindset” when his rowing team was facing last place in competition.

“When I was in Afghanistan and Iraq, you had to have that warrior mindset,” Lin said. “If your team is down, you still have to push through, whether that’s on the field of sports or the field of battle.”

He leveraged the experience of his own journey to encourage his team to persevere.

“We are not representing the Air Force like this,” he told the team. “We pulled each other up and ended up coming back and getting bronze. That bronze felt like gold.”

Out of competition, Lin gave back. He has mentored adaptive sports athletes and has helped several make Team Air Force. He shared his journey as an Air Force Wounded Warrior ambassador, speaking at events to fellow service members around the country. He encourages fellow service members to reach out to local mental-health clinics, chaplains, or inpatient care, and shares resources like to Military OneSource for support.

Even with all the support from his health care team, the Wounded Warrior program, and friends, Lin stresses his wife has been his strongest form of support, “100%.”

“She’s my caregiver. She reminds me to take my medicine, grounds me when I wake up from night terrors. She’s the reason I can do what I do,” he said. “What’s most important is you and your family. That’s forever.”

He said the warrior mindset is not about perfection, “It’s about heart and perseverance.”

Lighting the Path Forward

Since 2024, Lin has been promoted to senior master sergeant, received his master’s degree, named Air Force Male Athlete of the Year, and is competing in the 2025 DOD Warrior Games, representing his team as a torchbearer—an honor bestowed upon him by his teammates.

“They entrusted me to be the warrior spirit of the team,” he said. “I don’t take that lightly.”

Lin hopes his story encourages others to ask for help and stay the course.

“When you or your team gets knocked down, you got to get back up. Got to do it again. Got to try again.”

Lin said he continues to push forward. Still serving. Still finishing the mission—thanks to the care of his MHS team.

“I wish I had sought help earlier, but I’m here now, and I’m better for it,” Lin said. “Our health care system really didn't turn me away. I'm grateful for that. Even though I didn't feel like I deserved the help, they didn't turn me away. They took care of my concerns and took me seriously. I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”",https://health.mil/-/media/Images/MHS/Photos/warriortorchbearer.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 13:56:09.434248

The new Minnesota statute does not contemplate the collection of state-level civil monetary penalties in connection with a violation of Chapter 609.542.
Expected Impact Unlike other state-level anti-kickback statutes, the new Minnesota statute notably does not expand the protections of the anti-kickback statute to commercial payors.
If a violation of the state statute merely requires intentional action, rather than intentional wrongful action, the requisite mens rea under the state-level anti-kickback statute may be a lower threshold than under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.","On May 23, 2025, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed the Human Services omnibus policy bill into law, which included in part, the addition of a new statutory provision in the state’s criminal code, Chapter 609. Effective August 1, 2025, Section 609.542 of the Minnesota Statutes will essentially inscribe the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (United States Code, title 42, section 1320a-7b(b)) into state law, so that state prosecutors may address fraud against Human Services programs, including without limitation, the state Medical Assistance and Child Care Assistance programs as well as state-funded substance use disorder treatment programs.

The new statute makes it a crime for an individual or entity to “intentionally” solicit, receive, offer, or provide “money, a discount, a credit, a waiver, a rebate, a good, a service, employment, or anything else of value” in exchange for (i) referring another individual for the furnishing or arranging to furnish any item or service; (ii) purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering any good, facility, service, or item; or (iii) applying for or receiving any item or service which is payable in whole or in part under a federal health care program (as defined in United States Code, title 42, section 1320a-7b(f), including without limitation Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE), state behavioral health program (see Chapter 254B of the Minnesota Statutes), or state child care assistance program (see Chapter 142E of the Minnesota Statutes).

Like the federal analog, a violation of the state-level anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the state-level false claims act (see Section 15C.02 of the Minnesota Statutes). But, at the same time, the same exceptions, or Safe Harbors, to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also apply to Chapter 609.542. In addition to the adoption of the federal Safe Harbors, the statute adds an exception for employers enrolled in the Child Care Assistance program. The new statute does not apply to payment from an employer to an employee who provides covered items or services under Chapter 142E in the scope of their employment or to childcare provider discounts, scholarships, or to other financial assistance to families allowable under Section 142E.17, subdivision 7 of the Minnesota Statutes.

The criminal sentence for a violation of this statute varies depending on the value of the kickback at issue. For a kickback that is not more than $5,000, the sentence may include imprisonment for not more than five years or payment of a fine of not more than $10,000, or both. For a kickback that is more than $5,000 and not more than $35,000, the sentence may include imprisonment of not more than ten years or payment of a fine of not more than $20,000, or both. And for a kickback that exceeds $35,000, the sentence may include imprisonment of not more than 20 years or payment of a fine of not more than $100,000, or both. The dollar amounts of any kickbacks provided within a six-month period may be aggregated for the purposes of charging and sentencing under this statute. In comparison, criminal penalties for a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may include imprisonment of not more than ten years or payment of a fine not more than $100,000, or both. The federal statute does not discuss aggregation of claims. But note that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also be subject to civil monetary penalties up to $50,000 per kickback plus three times the amount of the kickback (also known as treble damages). The new Minnesota statute does not contemplate the collection of state-level civil monetary penalties in connection with a violation of Chapter 609.542.

Legislative Background

Section 609.542 appears to be, at least in part, a direct reaction to the recent indictment of Evergreen Recovery and the recent $18.5 million settlement between the United States Department of Justice and NUWAY Alliance. Both Evergreen and NUWAY are substance use disorder treatment program providers in Minnesota that allegedly provided free or subsidized housing for patients in exchange for patients’ attendance at counseling sessions payable by federal healthcare programs. These state investigations serve as a good reminder that prosecutable kickbacks do not always take the form of cash, but can be anything of value, including discounted or in-kind services.

Expected Impact

Unlike other state-level anti-kickback statutes, the new Minnesota statute notably does not expand the protections of the anti-kickback statute to commercial payors. The expected impact of this statute is that, as of August 1, 2025, state prosecutors will be able to file anti-kickback claims that previously were the purview of only federal prosecutors and may ask for additional jail time (20 years instead of ten years) during sentencing for violations. We will have to wait for additional guidance, or new enforcement actions, to fully understand how broadly Minnesota prosecutors and, ultimately, the courts will interpret the mens rea term “intentionally,” as it is used in Chapter 609.542. If a violation of the state statute merely requires intentional action, rather than intentional wrongful action, the requisite mens rea under the state-level anti-kickback statute may be a lower threshold than under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute.[1] Overall, it remains to be seen whether this new statute will indeed significantly increase healthcare fraud enforcement in Minnesota, particularly against individuals and entities that do business with the state.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15401_555.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 13:56:14.295269

To learn more about your TRICARE Pharmacy Program benefit, check out the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook","JULY 23, 2025 – Have you recently refilled a prescription at a military pharmacy? If so, you may know that military pharmacies have different procedures than civilian pharmacies. When a provider issues a new prescription to a military pharmacy, you need to activate the prescription before a pharmacist fills it.

Recently, the Defense Health Agency has developed and updated two tools—Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters—to make this prescription pickup process easier and more convenient.

“The Defense Health Agency has integrated Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters into military pharmacies for multiple reasons,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Emily Zywicke, chief of the Direct Care Branch, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the DHA. “This technology reduces traffic in pharmacy lobbies. It also helps you save time by giving you real-time updates on your prescription status and enabling prescription pickup.”

Q-Anywhere

Q-Anywhere is a feature that allows you to activate new prescriptions without physically being in the pharmacy. To activate your prescription, text “Get in line” to your local military pharmacy’s number. Then, follow the prompts to get a Q-Anywhere number. You can also scan the pharmacy’s QR code for web-based enrollment.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to refill an existing prescription?

A: No. Q-Anywhere is for filling new prescriptions. To refill a prescription, use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or call your military pharmacy’s refill number.

Q: Can I text Q-Anywhere in the evening or on the weekends to activate prescriptions?

A: At some military pharmacies, Q-Anywhere is available 24/7, so you may be able to activate your prescription outside of normal business hours. However, the pharmacy staff will process your prescription request during normal business hours.

Q: Will I lose my spot if I’m not present when called?

A: No. If you leave the pharmacy after arriving to pick up your prescription using Q-Anywhere, simply re-text “I’m here” when you return to the pharmacy. Your Q-Anywhere number is only valid on the day it was issued. If you were unable to pick up your prescriptions that day, you’ll have to start a new Q-Anywhere request or pull a number when you arrive at the pharmacy.

(Note: Some pharmacies have a dedicated window you can go to when your prescription is ready for pickup. You can go straight there when you get the text message that your prescription is ready.)

Q: Can I close out the web page messaging system once I get my Q-Anywhere number?

A: Please keep the web page open to get real-time updates from pharmacy staff about your prescriptions and notifications when your prescriptions are ready. However, you can open a new web page to continue using the internet.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to request prescriptions for multiple family members?

A: Yes. Enter the first patient’s Department of Defense Identification Number and wait to get confirmation they’re added. Next, enter the second family member’s DOD ID number. You can add up to four people.

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted. Once you get a text stating “You are now in line,” respond with the name and date of birth of the intended family member and the prescriptions you would like filled.

More than innovation—a culture shift The Innovation Fellowship Program is designed to improve patient care and streamline operations.
“DHA leaders are investing in frontline staff and the future of military health care.","The Defense Health Agency is making a concerted effort to identify health system innovations from a particular group of the workforce: our frontline staff.

With the launch of the Innovation Fellowship Program, DHA is empowering civilian and uniformed employees at military hospitals and clinics to solve real-world problems they face every day—by offering time, funding, and a network of mentors to help bring their ideas to life.

This program flips the script on other top-down initiatives that may miss critical on-the-ground context. “Far too often, enterprise innovations overlook the lived experience of frontline staff,” said Dr. Rebecca Rough, chief innovation officer of DHA. “This program recognizes true innovations start with those closest to the problem.”

Turning ideas into action

Prospective fellows are invited to submit “pitches” to target specific issues in their daily work. Selected fellows receive financial support to explore and test solutions and are granted twelve months with up to 25% of their work time protected to focus on their projects. Financial backing includes up to $10,000 for training and concept changes, and as much as $150,000 to develop and test prototypes.

But support doesn’t stop at funding. Fellows work with subject matter experts and mentors from across the DHA enterprise to help refine, implement, and potentially scale their ideas.

More than innovation—a culture shift

The Innovation Fellowship Program is designed to improve patient care and streamline operations. More importantly, it fosters a culture where everyday problem-solvers are inspired to lead change.

“DHA leaders are investing in frontline staff and the future of military health care. This program is designed to improve the system and enable to make a tangible difference,” said Dr. Pauline Swiger, the fellowship’s program director.

By providing structure, resources, and a pathway to innovate, DHA hopes to unlock creative potential at all levels of the organization—and demonstrate good ideas don’t need to come from the top to make a big impact.

“This program is just as much about inspiring and engaging the innovators out there on the ground as it is about the innovation itself” said U.S. Army Major Taylor Neuman, acting chief workforce well-being and engagement officer of DHA.",https://www.dha.mil/-/media/Project/Images/News-Images/9082822.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-23 11:57:06.170743

Modeled after a Soldier Medical Readiness Processing event, groups of CGSC students checked-in and completed required paperwork before proceeding through a series of stations.
“Munson Army Health Center is proud to offer a wide range of primary care providers ready to support incoming students and their families,” said Walker.
The Army tracks individual Soldier Medical Readiness (MRC) on a scale of 1 to 4, with MRC 1 indicating full medical readiness for deployment.
“This medical readiness event ensures CGSC students can focus on their demanding studies, confident in their medical preparedness,” said Walker.","FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas – Munson Army Health Center and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College Surgeon Cell conducted the first of three medical readiness processing events for incoming CGSC students July 21 ahead of their rigorous 10-month course.

""Our priority is to support the CGSC Surgeon Cell in ensuring all incoming Soldiers are able to complete any outstanding or expiring medical readiness processing requirements now, before class begins, so they don’t need to miss classroom instruction time later,” said Col. Jolanda L.J. Walker, Munson director, who is responsible for ensuring units on Fort Leavenworth are medically ready.

With an incoming class of approximately 1,000 students, plus additional students from the School of Advanced Military Studies, Munson and CGSC developed a plan to transform classrooms vacant over summer into a comprehensive medical processing hub for the event.

Modeled after a Soldier Medical Readiness Processing event, groups of CGSC students checked-in and completed required paperwork before proceeding through a series of stations. These included medical records review, pharmacy information, lab services, hearing review and scheduling, behavioral health, dental review, and vision screenings.

Medical teams pre-screened records and assigned Soldiers to one of three events, July 21, 23, or 28. They highlighted any requirements Soldiers needed, such as Physical Health Assessments, HIV testing, immunizations, vision, hearing, and dental. Bloodwork was conducted on-site, eliminating the need for students to make an additional visit to the health center.

""Coming to the college is a perfect location because it allows us to spread out and take care of a lot of Soldiers at one time and minimizes overcrowding of clinical operations at the health center where we continue to provide care for our enrolled beneficiaries,” said Walker.

The event also served as an opportunity for Soldiers to learn more about Munson and its services.

“Munson Army Health Center is proud to offer a wide range of primary care providers ready to support incoming students and their families,” said Walker. “We have multiple providers to choose from, high-quality care, and a convenient, on post location.”

Additionally, representatives from the Exceptional Family Member Program, Army Community Service, Child & Youth Services, SHARP (Sexual Harassment/Assault Response & Prevention), Family Advocacy Program, and Military Family Life Counselors participated in the readiness event and provided information about their services on post.

“It was very easy, fast and efficient,” said medical in-processing participant and incoming CGSC student Maj. Benjamin Wheatley.

The Army tracks individual Soldier Medical Readiness (MRC) on a scale of 1 to 4, with MRC 1 indicating full medical readiness for deployment. MRC 2-4 indicate factors that may hinder medical readiness. The goal is for Soldiers to maintain the highest level of medical readiness to effectively support globally integrated operations and mission planning worldwide.

The 10-month Command and General Staff Officers Course develops war-fighting and adaptive leadership skills for military officers to be proficient in Unified Land Operations. The college is an educational center of excellence renowned in the study of leadership, the conduct of joint and combined land warfare, and the application of Joint, Interagency, Intergovernmental, and Multinational organizations to synchronize all elements of power to achieve national objectives.

“This medical readiness event ensures CGSC students can focus on their demanding studies, confident in their medical preparedness,” said Walker.

Getting started at a military pharmacy Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy?
Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions: 1.
If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?
To learn more about your TRICARE Pharmacy Program benefit, check out the TRICARE Pharmacy Program Handbook","Have you recently refilled a prescription at a military pharmacy? If so, you may know that military pharmacies have different procedures than civilian pharmacies. When a provider issues a new prescription to a military pharmacy, you need to activate the prescription before a pharmacist fills it.

Recently, the Defense Health Agency has developed and updated two tools—Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters—to make this prescription pickup process easier and more convenient.

“The Defense Health Agency has integrated Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters into military pharmacies for multiple reasons,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Emily Zywicke, chief of the Direct Care Branch, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the DHA. “This technology reduces traffic in pharmacy lobbies. It also helps you save time by giving you real-time updates on your prescription status and enabling prescription pickup.”

Q-Anywhere

Q-Anywhere is a feature that allows you to activate new prescriptions without physically being in the pharmacy. To activate your prescription, text “Get in line” to your local military pharmacy’s number. Then, follow the prompts to get a Q-Anywhere number. You can also scan the pharmacy’s QR code for web-based enrollment.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to refill an existing prescription?

A: No. Q-Anywhere is for filling new prescriptions. To refill a prescription, use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or call your military pharmacy’s refill number.

Q: Can I text Q-Anywhere in the evening or on the weekends to activate prescriptions?

A: At some military pharmacies, Q-Anywhere is available 24/7, so you may be able to activate your prescription outside of normal business hours. However, the pharmacy staff will process your prescription request during normal business hours.

Q: Will I lose my spot if I’m not present when called?

A: No. If you leave the pharmacy after arriving to pick up your prescription using Q-Anywhere, simply re-text “I’m here” when you return to the pharmacy. Your Q-Anywhere number is only valid on the day it was issued. If you were unable to pick up your prescriptions that day, you’ll have to start a new Q-Anywhere request or pull a number when you arrive at the pharmacy.

(Note: Some pharmacies have a dedicated window you can go to when your prescription is ready for pickup. You can go straight there when you get the text message that your prescription is ready.)

Q: Can I close out the web page messaging system once I get my Q-Anywhere number?

A: Please keep the web page open to get real-time updates from pharmacy staff about your prescriptions and notifications when your prescriptions are ready. However, you can open a new web page to continue using the internet.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to request prescriptions for multiple family members?

A: Yes. Enter the first patient’s Department of Defense Identification Number and wait to get confirmation they’re added. Next, enter the second family member’s DOD ID number. You can add up to four people.

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted. Once you get a text stating “You are now in line,” respond with the name and date of birth of the intended family member and the prescriptions you would like filled.

ScriptCenter

ScriptCenters are automated locker or vending machine-like units. They provide convenient prescription pickup, allowing you to pick up your prescription without interacting with pharmacy staff. The locations of ScriptCenters vary, but many may be available in centralized areas, like the Exchange lobby. Although times vary by pharmacy location, some are available 24/7.

To begin using ScriptCenter, you must complete a one-time in-person enrollment at a ScriptCenter kiosk. You’ll need to scan your Uniformed Services ID card and create a username and PIN. You no longer need to have your prescription number to use ScriptCenter.

“Our military community is incredibly busy, and we understand the struggle of shifting schedules. After-hours prescription pickup helps those who can’t get to the pharmacy during normal operating hours,” added Zywicke. “ScriptCenter decreases congestion in pharmacy lobbies and helps shorten wait times.”

Q: When will my prescriptions be ready in the ScriptCenter?

A: When you request a refill via the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or a refill phone line, the automated prompts will tell you your pickup time.

Q: What if I forget my “login” ID or PIN?

A: You can recover your User ID or PIN by pressing “Forgot ID” or “Forgot PIN.” Pharmacy staff can help you recover your User ID, but not your PIN. Remember: You can use your DOD ID instead of your User ID to make logging in even easier. But you’ll always need to use your PIN, so be sure to choose something you won’t forget!

Q: How long will my prescriptions be available at the ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions are typically left at the ScriptCenter for 7-10 days (this varies by location). After that time, your prescription will be returned to stock and you’ll have to reactivate or refill your prescription again.

Q: Are there any medications that can’t go in ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions that require refrigeration won’t be placed in the ScriptCenter.

Q: How does ScriptCenter integrate with MHS GENESIS?

A: If you refill a prescription through your MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can request to pick up the medication at a ScriptCenter location (if available).

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter together?

A: Yes, if your military pharmacy uses both systems. When you activate your prescription through Q-Anywhere, you can select ScriptCenter as your pickup location. Be sure you’ve registered with ScriptCenter first.

Other things to note

• If you have the US Family Health Plan: You can’t fill prescriptions at military pharmacies. USFHP has its own pharmacy coverage.

• Know the difference between prescription refills and renewals: If your provider authorizes refills on your prescription, you can fill the prescription and refill it up to the authorized number of times. A renewal is required when your original prescription expires or runs out of refills. A renewal is considered a new prescription.

• Give feedback: Share your experience with Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter through your military hospital or clinic’s Interactive Customer Evaluation survey to help improve the systems.

Getting started at a military pharmacy

Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy? If you do, you won’t have copayments for prescriptions, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. You can even have your civilian provider send your prescriptions to a miliary pharmacy.

Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions:

1. My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication. What is this pharmacy’s name?

2. If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?

3. Do you have my medication in stock?

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

--

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It’s exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said. Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you’re doing vigorous exercise where you’re getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you’re still moving quite a bit, and that’s a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it’s also important to recognize that it’s fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don’t achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

“Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,” Franzos noted. “Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.”

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It’s just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We’ve taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzo said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they’re going to reinforce that, and they’re going to want you to prove to them that you’ve taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

--

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

Kitware is proud to return to the Military Health System Research Symposium (MHSRS), the premier scientific meeting dedicated to addressing the unique medical needs of the Warfighter. This year, we’re exhibiting (Booth 518) and presenting five accepted posters that showcase our ongoing contributions to advancing military medical research and technology.

Our work spans a wide range of critical topics—including computational physiology, medical AI, digital twins, synthetic data generation, autonomous systems, and responsible AI. These efforts are tightly aligned with the Department of Defense’s mission to improve Warfighter performance, medical readiness, and return-to-duty outcomes.

Driving Innovation for Government Programs Using Open Source Tools

Kitware develops and maintains a suite of open source platforms designed to accelerate research, enable reproducibility, and support mission-critical applications. One such tool is the Pulse Physiology Engine, a digital twin simulation platform for modeling dynamic human physiology. Pulse is widely used in the MHSRS community for generating synthetic patient data, evaluating clinical interventions, and training AI systems in resource-limited triage scenarios.

This year, we’re also highlighting several ongoing projects that demonstrate our broader capabilities in medical AI, physiological modeling, and injury prevention:

DARPA ITM: Kitware is a key performer on the DARPA In the Moment (ITM) program, which aims to develop AI systems that can make ethically and operationally sound medical triage decisions in high-stakes, resource-constrained environments. Our team is focused on generating synthetic physiology datasets that reflect real-world injury combinations, treatment responses, and physiological trajectories using physics-based simulation. This synthetic data serves as a scalable, privacy-preserving resource to train and validate AI-driven decision support systems for frontline combat care.

DARPA GOLDEVAC: Kitware is participating in DARPA’s GOLDEVAC (GOLDen hour extended EVACuation) program as part of a collaborative team developing next-generation resuscitation and oxygenation technologies for use at the point of injury during prolonged evacuation. The program investigates whether a single intravascular device can provide continuous gas exchange and fluid resuscitation without the complications associated with current extracorporeal methods. Kitware supports this mission by using Pulse to accurately model and evaluate system performance under operational conditions. GOLDEVAC has the potential to revolutionize battlefield care and serve as a medical force multiplier, enhancing the DoD’s ability to stabilize and evacuate casualties in large-scale or resource-constrained scenarios.

AFRL: Advancing Mechanical Ventilation Through Simulation: Kitware is part of a team collaborating with AFRL to advance a prototype all-in-one advanced simulator for training in mechanical ventilation. The technology enables clinicians to deliver care in accordance with current and emerging best practices, as well as comply with ARDSNET and Joint Trauma Clinical Practice Guidelines. Each scenario provides relevant clinical data for the clinician to manage the patient, and allows them to make changes and respond with appropriate physiological responses. It provides real-time feedback and debriefs after each scenario.

Visit us at Booth 518 to discuss these projects in greater detail.

Kitware enhanced the Pulse Physiology Engine to simulate the long-term physiological effects of severe hemorrhage, including metabolic shifts and tissue perfusion changes. Validated against experimental pig data, the model accurately captured key indicators such as cardiac output and blood pressure across extended resuscitation timelines. With less than 10% error across multiple outputs, this open source model provides a reliable, reproducible resource for evaluating resuscitation protocols like fluid therapy, vasopressors, and ECMO. These capabilities support improved clinical decision-making and offer program managers a robust framework for testing interventions in prolonged care and high-fidelity triage scenarios.

Kitware extended the Pulse Physiology Engine to simulate ECMO’s complex hemodynamic and substance transport processes, enabling digital twin modeling of respiratory and circulatory support. The framework integrates key device parameters and simulates multi-organ interactions to evaluate intervention strategies. Validated against empirical data, the model maintained oxygen saturation above 90% while supporting systemic perfusion in multitrauma scenarios. This open source simulation platform supports data-driven ECMO optimization, informs device design, and lays the groundwork for automated control systems, synthetic data generation, and clinical extensions—advancing readiness for respiratory failure in prolonged and resource-constrained care settings.

Aligning a Large Language Model to protocol-based medical triage decision-making

Poster | Poster Session 2 on Tuesday 05 Aug. 2025 1530-1730

Authors: Emily Veenhuis, Aaron Bray, David Joy, Jadie Adams, Ph.D., Rachel B. Clipp, Ph.D., Jeffrey B. Webb, Brian Hu, Ph.D., and Arslan Basharat, Ph.D.

As part of DARPA’s In the Moment program, Kitware evaluated the ALIGN system, which uses large language models (LLMs) to automate medical triage tagging based on Key Decision-Making Attributes (KDMAs). We tested ALIGN’s alignment with START, SALT, and BCD Sieve protocols using a gold standard dataset of 10,000+ synthetic casualties. Results showed over 90% accuracy in LLM-generated tags across all three protocols. This work demonstrates the potential for LLMs to generate protocol-aligned medical decisions with interpretable reasoning, supporting scalable, human-trusted triage in high-pressure or resource-limited environments.

Evaluation of Triage Tagging Protocols Using a Synthetic Dataset Representative of Battlefield Injury Profiles

Poster | Poster Session 2 on Tuesday 05 Aug. 2025 1530-1730

Authors: Rachel B. Clipp, Ph.D., Jeffery B. Webb, Aaron Bray, Emily Veenhuis, Brian Hu, Ph.D., and Arslan Basharat, Ph.D.

Kitware generated a large, open synthetic dataset of over 10,000 battlefield-representative casualties to evaluate triage tagging protocols (START, SALT, BCD Sieve) across time and treatment conditions. Using the Pulse Physiology Engine, we simulated physiological trajectories and assigned tags every 5 minutes post-injury. Results showed that Minimal and Expectant classifications remained stable, while Immediate and Delayed tags varied more significantly over time and intervention. This structured dataset provides a critical resource for assessing algorithm effectiveness, supporting development of automated tagging systems, and enabling future AI applications, including training large language models (LLMs) for triage decision-making.

Large Language Model Regression for Fine-grained and Aligned Decision-Making in Medical Triage

Poster | Poster Session 2 on Tuesday 05 Aug. 2025 1530-1730

Authors: Jadie Adams, Ph.D., Emily Veenhuis, David Joy, Aaron Bray, Brian Hu, Ph.D., and Arslan Basharat, Ph.D.

Kitware developed a regression-based large language model (LLM) approach to improve alignment with human values in complex medical triage decisions. Using ethically ambiguous battlefield scenarios from DARPA’s In the Moment (ITM) dataset, we trained LLMs to match trusted human decision-makers across multiple Key Decision-Making Attributes (KDMAs), including moral judgment and quality of life. The method achieved over 31% higher alignment accuracy than baseline techniques while reducing sensitivity to bias and improving interpretability. This approach enables more traceable, equitable, and controllable AI decision-making in high-stakes environments—supporting the development of responsible AI systems for operational triage support.

“And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.” In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games.
He has mentored adaptive sports athletes and has helped several make Team Air Force.
He shared his journey as an Air Force Wounded Warrior ambassador, speaking at events to fellow service members around the country.
I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”","After U.S. Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Aaron Lin cleared landmines from an Iraqi neighborhood in 2008, a local resident came up and reached out his hand.

“Thank you for making my neighborhood safe for my grandkids,” the man told the explosive ordnance disposal technician.

It was a moment of gratitude and trust that Lin carried with him throughout his deployment.

“I thought to myself, I could do this job for the rest of my life,” he said. “We were disarming 10 improvised explosive devices a day …trip wires, land mines, pressure plates, anything you could think of. I was supremely confident.”

But an attack on his unit during another deployment in Afghanistan took a toll on him.

“All that confidence I had just went to the basement. It just bottomed out.”

He would begin to suffer an injury with no visible scars: posttraumatic stress disorder. It was Lin’s turn to reach out—and his leadership, family, and professionals in the Military Health System took his hand.

Attack on March 30, 2010

Lin and his team were disarming IEDs on foot when an explosion ripped through their patrol. Two of his friends were killed. He felt immense guilt that he survived when others died.

“I got blown up a couple times, but that part didn’t really bother me,” he said. “What bothered me is we had a couple casualties that day. I should have died out there with them.”

Lin said the motto of EOD training, “initial success or total failure,” haunted him as he felt like “a complete failure.”

He returned home, but not the same. Even in joyous moments, he felt nothing.

“I was numb,” Lin said. “I could not feel closeness to my wife. I just couldn’t feel anything.” He deployed again but was “running away from my problems and everything.” When he returned home this time, he experienced depression and detachment, and suffered nightmares.

It was a “a pain that I can't describe,” he said. “But I could feel it in my heart.”

A Sergeant Intervenes

Lin, then stationed at Joint Base Andrews, was struggling as new deployment orders to Syria fast approached.

“I could not handle it. I was not sleeping and having nightmares every other night.”

A unit leader noticed Lin was struggling. According to Lin, he was doing the “first sergeant thing” by simply asking if he was OK.

“I was like, ‘I'm fine, I’m fine. I don’t need any help,’” said Lin.

But the first sergeant could tell he wasn’t fine. At his encouragement, Lin decided to go to the mental health clinic.

That intervention led to six weeks of intensive outpatient treatment at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. There, he was diagnosed with PTSD and started a comprehensive treatment plan under the care of his MHS team.

“They had a schedule for me printed out for the whole six weeks,” he said. “Cognitive processing therapy, yoga, art, sleep classes, group therapy … it helped me to start looking at things differently. It’s basically anything you can think of to help yourself work through it.”

He credits the Fort Belvoir care team with saving his life. “That intensive outpatient truly changed me … I came out of it so much better than I was before.”

Lin was also inspired by the acts of the first sergeant that he applied to be one himself.

“When he pushed me to go to mental health, I decided that I wanted to become a first sergeant so I could pay it forward and help other people,” he said. Like his former first sergeant, he encouraged those who seemed to be struggling to seek help. Yet an attempted suicide in Lin’s unit brought back to negative thoughts of doubt and self-worth.

“All those feelings that I got back while I was deployed: ‘What could I have done different?’ I thought I did everything that I possibly could to prevent that. I began to plummet again.”

‘Warrior Mindset’ and Perseverance

While Lin continued mental health treatment, a friend and fellow EOD technician convinced him to give the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program a chance.

Lin questioned whether he deserved to be in the program. “I’m not missing a limb,” he said. “I don’t think I belong.”

But seeing the other wounded warriors sharing their own stories, Lin decided to try out for Team Air Force. “I found something that helped me reconnect,” Lin said. “Being with other warriors who understood, it gave me a path forward.”

“I found the power of sports, competing, striving for something,” Lin said. “And just being with the Air Force Wounded Warrior community and all my warrior friends who were struggling too, it changed me.”

In March 2024, he earned a spot on Team Air Force at the Department of Defense Warrior Games. He went on to earn silver medals in wheelchair basketball and rugby.

His new passion for athletics didn’t stop there. At trials and competitions throughout the year, Lin medaled in air pistol, placed in archery, and exceled in discus, shot put, and rowing. In the 2024 DOD Warrior Games, he recalled a moment where he channeled his “warrior mindset” when his rowing team was facing last place in competition.

“When I was in Afghanistan and Iraq, you had to have that warrior mindset,” Lin said. “If your team is down, you still have to push through, whether that’s on the field of sports or the field of battle.”

He leveraged the experience of his own journey to encourage his team to persevere.

“We are not representing the Air Force like this,” he told the team. “We pulled each other up and ended up coming back and getting bronze. That bronze felt like gold.”

Out of competition, Lin gave back. He has mentored adaptive sports athletes and has helped several make Team Air Force. He shared his journey as an Air Force Wounded Warrior ambassador, speaking at events to fellow service members around the country. He encourages fellow service members to reach out to local mental-health clinics, chaplains, or inpatient care, and shares resources like to Military OneSource for support.

Even with all the support from his health care team, the Wounded Warrior program, and friends, Lin stresses his wife has been his strongest form of support, “100%.”

“She’s my caregiver. She reminds me to take my medicine, grounds me when I wake up from night terrors. She’s the reason I can do what I do,” he said. “What’s most important is you and your family. That’s forever.”

He said the warrior mindset is not about perfection, “It’s about heart and perseverance.”

Lighting the Path Forward

Since 2024, Lin has been promoted to senior master sergeant, received his master’s degree, named Air Force Male Athlete of the Year, and is competing in the 2025 DOD Warrior Games, representing his team as a torchbearer—an honor bestowed upon him by his teammates.

“They entrusted me to be the warrior spirit of the team,” he said. “I don’t take that lightly.”

Lin hopes his story encourages others to ask for help and stay the course.

“When you or your team gets knocked down, you got to get back up. Got to do it again. Got to try again.”

Lin said he continues to push forward. Still serving. Still finishing the mission—thanks to the care of his MHS team.

“I wish I had sought help earlier, but I’m here now, and I’m better for it,” Lin said. “Our health care system really didn't turn me away. I'm grateful for that. Even though I didn't feel like I deserved the help, they didn't turn me away. They took care of my concerns and took me seriously. I probably wouldn’t be where I am at today if it wasn’t for the military healthcare system and Air Force Wounded Warrior Program.”",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2504/8953663/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-22 17:56:11.763634

After Months Of Work, Schumer Just Secured Language In The Senate NDAA To Address The Longstanding Maternal Healthcare Issues At Fort Drum, Directing The DoD To Develop A Comprehensive Plan & Study Of The OB/GYN Shortage In The Greater Watertown Area

Schumer: Fort Drum’s Military Moms & Families Deserve The Very Best When It Comes To HealthCare

U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer today announced he has secured legislation in the Senate’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) to begin to address the long standing shortage of Obstetrician-Gynecologists (OB/GYNs) at Fort Drum. For years, Fort Drum has faced shortages of OB/GYNs, forcing soldiers and military families in need of maternal health care to seek care from local hospitals off base or to drive for hours when local care is unavailable.

Schumer said if this language passes into the final NDDA it would require the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to immediately begin work to create a comprehensive plan to expand OB/GYN care serving Fort Drum and the surrounding Watertown area.

“Our Fort Drum military moms & families, who serve our nation proudly, deserve better access to vital maternal healthcare. But right now, our servicemembers at Fort Drum and their families often have to leave base to access the basic maternal healthcare they need. The bottom line is that we need to take better care of our brave military moms,” said Senator Schumer. “The North Country already experiences major shortages when it comes to recruiting OB/GYNs, and we can’t be forcing our military families who sacrifice so much to be stuck without the proper care they need when they move to our community in service to our country. That is why I am proud to have secured a provision in the Senate NDAA to put Fort Drum’s military moms & families’ first. This is a massive step in the right direction, and we need DoD to immediately address this urgent need to expand OB/GYN care at military installations and make sure families—both at Fort Drum and around the country—have what they need to be safe and healthy. Fort Drum is woven in the very fabric of the North Country, and our military families, military moms and those on the base deserve only the best when it comes to health care.”

Fort Drum has a history of relying on the civilian healthcare network for primary health care, as well as specialty care provided by OB/GYNs. When Camp Drum became Fort Drum in 1974, the decision was made to not build a hospital on-post, and to instead only have a clinic, in order to integrate Fort Drum families with the local network in Watertown.

Shortages of OB/GYN providers on base force those in need of maternal health care to seek care in the community for a multitude of reasons, which can range in urgency from routine check-ups to emergency childbirth. Samaritan Medical Center and Carthage Area Hospital serve Fort Drum soldiers and families with incredible dedication and top-notch medical care, but when their OB/GYNs are spread too thin, soldiers and families must travel over an hour and a half to Syracuse or farther for care. Schumer said this not only increases the risk to patients unnecessarily, but it also saddles soldiers with expenses that they are not eligible to be compensated for under the Department of Defense’s Joint Travel Regulation (JTR).

To help fix the situation, Schumer proudly pushed for and successfully secured language in the Senate version of the NDAA to develop a plan & study the administrative and cost barriers to expanding OB/GYN care specifically in the Watertown area and to create a comprehensive plan to expand OB/GYN care serving Fort Drum. The provision also directs the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on the plan December 1 of this year to ensure that there is no more delay in providing the Fort Drum community with reliable, high-quality maternal health care close to home.

Schumer said the shortage of OB/GYNs at Fort Drum is part of a nationwide shortage, with particularly low access in rural areas. OB/GYNs have one of the highest attrition rates compared to most medical professions, and increased threats to OB/GYN safety driven by anti-abortion politics. Labor and delivery units, especially in rural areas, are currently closing nationwide due to low reimbursement, and with Medicaid paying for more than 40% of births across the country, even more L&D units are at risk. The recent GOP cuts to Medicaid – the largest in history - will force more units in rural parts of the country to close. This will exacerbate the already dire situation of limited access to critical OB/GYN care for those living on bases in rural America.

Erika Flint, Executive Director, Fort Drum Regional Health Planning Organization, said “Ensuring access to high-quality OBGYN care for military members and their families continues to be a key focus for the local healthcare community. Maintaining this standard of care—locally and consistently—reflects a deep commitment to the well-being of those who serve. We appreciate the support and attention given to this issue by Senator Schumer, which affects our North Country families, both civilian and military alike.”

“It's the people in the Military Health System where we have one of the greatest healthcare teams in America doing the work,” he said.
His visit to Madigan was part of a broader series of visits to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.
He first visited Naval Hospital Bremerton before meeting with leaders at Madigan Army Medical Center and I Corps Headquarters on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, followed by visits to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Eielson Air Force Base, and Fort Wainwright in Alaska.

During an interview after an open forum town hall with staff, Ferrara provided insight into the future of the MHS and the critical role medical readiness has in ensuring maximum lethality of our nation’s warfighters. “It's the people in the Military Health System where we have one of the greatest healthcare teams in America doing the work,” he said. “My top priority, and one that the team is executing on with incredible vigor, is the focus on readiness.”

“Readiness is making sure our warfighters are fit to fight tonight. Whenever the need arises, our people are ready to go. We want to be able to tell a commanding officer in the line community if they have 150 sailors on a submarine or 1,000 soldiers in a battalion, that should they need them, they are all ready to go tonight. Our team is doing an amazing job at that,” explained Ferrara, who deployed four times when he served as an active duty U.S. Navy surgeon.

His visit to Madigan was part of a broader series of visits to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. He first visited Naval Hospital Bremerton before meeting with leaders at Madigan Army Medical Center and I Corps Headquarters on Joint Base Lewis-McChord, followed by visits to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Eielson Air Force Base, and Fort Wainwright in Alaska.

“The biggest take away is a more comprehensive understanding of the mission here, not only the Pacific Northwest, but how it fits into the larger MHS mission and the national defense strategy because every one of these regions is an important piece in the puzzle when we deploy and we fight in a much more joint and distributed manner,” Ferrara said.

He also spoke on strategic partnerships between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs as part of the future of the MHS.

“The DOD and VA partnerships are very important to the success of the MHS. There are already some very robust partnerships,” he said.

For advanced trauma care training, MHS physicians, nurses, medics, and corpsmen are already working in Portland at Oregon Health Sciences University and in Seattle at Harborview Medical Center. These are two world-renowned trauma centers, providing “an excellent opportunity for them to get really high-value sets and reps to keep their skills sharp. I think there's an opportunity to even leverage those partnerships more,” Ferrara said.

He also highlighted the work of Madigan’s interventional pulmonology team and their cutting-edge work with robotic bronchoscopy, taking in more VA patients and offering state-of-the-art, cutting-edge lung cancer treatment for veterans.

“That partnership not only will extend to the patients that have pulmonary issues, but it builds bridges, and it creates relationships that are translatable across the whole medical landscape,” he said.

Ferrara also spoke on the importance of leveraging human and physical infrastructure, assets, and strategic partnerships as part of the MHS mission, “All of the different assets we have inform those decisions. And particularly in a resource-constrained environment, we have to look at where we have our greatest assets and our greatest opportunities to either be able to strongly leverage both human and physical infrastructure where it already resides, and also, again, with where we can leverage partnerships with civilian or with other government agencies,” he explained.

During his visit, Ferrara met with hospital and installation leadership, toured the facility, took questions from staff during a town hall in Letterman Auditorium, and recognized several Madigan personnel at the town hall's conclusion.",https://d1ldvf68ux039x.cloudfront.net/thumbs/photos/2507/9195919/1000w_q95.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-22 15:56:19.218796

The Office of Personnel Management is on track to lose one-third of its workforce by the end of the year. More than 1,000 OPM employees are either already out the door or expected to separate from the agency in the coming months. Of those separations, 129 were employees whose jobs were terminated through reductions in force. The other 80% left through voluntary separation incentives like the deferred resignation program. New OPM Director Scott Kupor, now leading a roughly 2,000-person workforce, says he’ll focus on restructuring and creating work efficiencies at the agency.

Leslie Beavers will step down as the Defense Department’s principal deputy chief information officer at the end of September, after more than 30 years of military and civilian service. In her role, Beavers helped lead efforts such as the Mission Partner Environment and the launch of the Cyber Academic Engagement Office, while also advancing enterprise-wide Identity, Credential and Access Management solutions. She served as acting chief information officer for nine months following John Sherman’s departure in 2024. Beavers returned to her deputy role earlier this year after Katie Arrington returned to the department.

Federal agencies and other organizations are scrambling to address a dangerous flaw in Microsoft’s widely used SharePoint software. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency gave federal agencies until the end of the day Monday to mitigate a critical vulnerability in any on-premises SharePoint. With no security patch yet available for the zero day bug one of the primary recommendations is to disconnect SharePoint from the internet. Threat intelligence analysts have seen thousands of attempts to exploit the remote code vulnerability. The exploit could give hackers access to SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint such as Teams and OneDrive.

President Donald Trump has withdrawn his pick to lead IT operations at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Last month Trump picked Ryan Cote to serve as VA’s assistant secretary for information and technology and chief information officer. But he withdrew Cote’s nomination last week. Cote previously served as CIO of the Transportation Department under the first Trump administration. VA’s Office of Information and Technology is on track to lose nearly 1,200 employees this year through voluntary separation incentives. Those departures will result in a nearly 12% cut to the VA’s IT workforce.

The General Services Administration is getting new acting leadership.

It’s not immediately clear if Rigas will continue serving as both a senior official at GSA and the State Department. This is Rigas’ third time at GSA.

However, the monitoring tool is missing key information and relies on inaccurate and incomplete data. Specifically, the tool does not make key distinctions between facility work time and other time (e.g., deployments) or among personnel categories (e.g., exclusive vs. dual-assigned). Further, the tool relies on inaccurate and incomplete timecard data because DHA does not have a communication strategy, geared toward military medical personnel, that clarifies the importance of filling out timecards accurately, among other things. Until Health Affairs evaluates which activities count as facility work time in the tool and DHA communicates the importance of accurate timecard data, DOD will not have complete information to better monitor military medical personnel staffing at facilities.

The GAO has touted the value of its FraudNet system disclosure of alleged fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement of federal funds, saying the system referred for investigation more than 2,100 disclosures received in fiscal 2024.

The nearly 5,800 allegations received was a five-year high, with the exception of a spike to nearly 10,400 in 2022, of which more than half came from social media campaigns involving form letters on the same topic, it said. Allegations from federal employees, contractors and the public involved issues including mismanagement, waste, or misappropriation of government funds; ethics/conflict of interest/misconduct; false statements/claims; and embezzlement.

Allegations deemed worthy of further investigation were referred to some 60 other entities, including federal agencies, IG offices and state and local entities, the GAO said. In some cases those entities had received similar allegations separately, it added.

“GAO does not independently investigate allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse. However, FraudNet documents all allegations received in its case management system and makes them available to inform any ongoing or future GAO work,” it said.

For example, it said, “FraudNet’s work helped GAO auditors identify practicing providers who had limited credentials, revoked credentials, and were ineligible to work for the TRICARE Network.”

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted.
Getting started at a military pharmacy Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy?
Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions: My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication.
If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?","Have you recently filled a prescription at a military pharmacy? If so, you may know that military pharmacies have different procedures than civilian pharmacies. When a provider issues a new prescription to a military pharmacy, you need to activate the prescription before a pharmacist fills it.

Recently, the Defense Health Agency has developed and updated two tools—Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters—to make this prescription pickup process easier and more convenient.

“The Defense Health Agency has integrated Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenters into military pharmacies for multiple reasons,” said U.S. Navy Capt. Emily Zywicke, chief of the Direct Care Branch, Pharmacy Operations Division, at the DHA. “This technology reduces traffic in pharmacy lobbies. It also helps you save time by giving you real-time updates on your prescription status and enabling prescription pickup.”

Q-Anywhere

Q-Anywhere is a feature that allows you to activate new prescriptions without physically being in the pharmacy. To activate your prescription, text “Get in line” to your local military pharmacy’s number. Then, follow the prompts to get a Q-Anywhere number. You can also scan the pharmacy’s QR code for web-based enrollment.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to refill an existing prescription?

A: No. Q-Anywhere is for filling new prescriptions. To refill a prescription, use the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or call your military pharmacy’s refill number.

Q: Can I text Q-Anywhere in the evening or on the weekends to activate prescriptions?

A: At some military pharmacies, Q-Anywhere is available 24/7, so you may be able to activate your prescription outside of normal business hours. However, the pharmacy staff will process your prescription request during normal business hours.

Q: Will I lose my spot if I’m not present when called?

A: No. If you leave the pharmacy after arriving to pick up your prescription using Q-Anywhere, simply re-text “I’m here” when you return to the pharmacy. Your Q-Anywhere number is only valid on the day it was issued. If you were unable to pick up your prescriptions that day, you’ll have to start a new Q-Anywhere request or pull a number when you arrive at the pharmacy.

(Note: Some pharmacies have a dedicated window you can go to when your prescription is ready for pickup. You can go straight there when you get the text message that your prescription is ready.)

Q: Can I close out the web page messaging system once I get my Q-Anywhere number?

A: Please keep the web page open to get real-time updates from pharmacy staff about your prescriptions and notifications when your prescriptions are ready. However, you can open a new web page to continue using the internet.

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere to request prescriptions for multiple family members?

A: Yes. Enter the first patient’s Department of Defense Identification Number and wait to get confirmation they’re added. Next, enter the second family member’s DOD ID number. You can add up to four people.

Note: If you don’t know a family member’s DOD ID number, enter the sponsor’s DOD ID number and text “DONE” when prompted. Once you get a text stating “You are now in line,” respond with the name and date of birth of the intended family member and the prescriptions you would like filled.

ScriptCenter

ScriptCenters are automated locker or vending machine-like units. They provide convenient prescription pickup, allowing you to pick up your prescription without interacting with pharmacy staff. The locations of ScriptCenters vary, but many may be available in centralized areas, like the Exchange lobby. Although times vary by pharmacy location, some are available 24/7.

To begin using ScriptCenter, you must complete a one-time in-person enrollment at a ScriptCenter kiosk. You’ll need to scan your Uniformed Services ID card and create a username and PIN. You no longer need to have your prescription number to use ScriptCenter.

“Our military community is incredibly busy, and we understand the struggle of shifting schedules. After-hours prescription pickup helps those who can’t get to the pharmacy during normal operating hours,” added Zywicke. “ScriptCenter decreases congestion in pharmacy lobbies and helps shorten wait times.”

Q: When will my prescriptions be ready in the ScriptCenter?

A: When you request a refill via the MHS GENESIS Patient Portal or a refill phone line, the automated prompts will tell you your pickup time.

Q: What if I forget my “login” ID or PIN?

A: You can recover your User ID or PIN by pressing “Forgot ID” or “Forgot PIN.” Pharmacy staff can help you recover your User ID, but not your PIN. Remember: You can use your DOD ID instead of your User ID to make logging in even easier. But you’ll always need to use your PIN, so be sure to choose something you won’t forget!

Q: How long will my prescriptions be available at the ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions are typically left at the ScriptCenter for 7-10 days (this varies by location). After that time, your prescription will be returned to stock and you’ll have to reactivate or refill your prescription again.

Q: Are there any medications that can’t go in ScriptCenter?

A: Prescriptions that require refrigeration won’t be placed in the ScriptCenter.

Q: How does ScriptCenter integrate with MHS GENESIS?

A: If you refill a prescription through your MHS GENESIS Patient Portal, you can request to pick up the medication at a ScriptCenter location (if available).

Q: Can I use Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter together?

A: Yes, if your military pharmacy uses both systems. When you activate your prescription through Q-Anywhere, you can select ScriptCenter as your pickup location. Be sure you’ve registered with ScriptCenter first.

Other things to note

If you have the US Family Health Plan: You can’t fill prescriptions at military pharmacies. USFHP has its own pharmacy coverage.

Know the difference between prescription refills and renewals: If your provider authorizes refills on your prescription, you can fill the prescription and refill it up to the authorized number of times. A renewal is required when your original prescription expires or runs out of refills. A renewal is considered a new prescription.

Give feedback: Share your experience with Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter through your military hospital or clinic’s Interactive Customer Evaluation survey to help improve the systems.

Getting started at a military pharmacy

Are you considering filling your next prescription at a military pharmacy? If you do, you won’t have copayments for prescriptions, as described in the TRICARE Costs and Fees Fact Sheet. You can even have your civilian provider send your prescriptions to a miliary pharmacy.

Each military pharmacy operates slightly differently, so call ahead and ask the pharmacy a few questions:

My provider is going to e-prescribe my medication. What is this pharmacy’s name?

If my civilian provider wants to e-prescribe and they’ve never worked with a military pharmacy before, what can I tell them to make it easier?

Do you have my medication in stock?

How far in advance should I request refills? (Military pharmacies can’t always process same-day refill requests. Some pharmacies ask for 48-72 hours’ notice.)

Do you participate in Q-Anywhere and ScriptCenter? If so, tell me if anything is unique to this location.",https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jul/22/2003758646/1920/1080/0/250625-N-TW242-1006.JPG,N,0.0,2025-07-22 13:05:50.213639

Below are the main provisions of the bill:

Changes to Eligibility for TRICARE Select

The bill makes specific amendments to the eligibility criteria for veterans to enroll in TRICARE Select. Key points include:

It allows covered veteran beneficiaries—defined under the bill as veterans who qualify for enrollment in the patient system of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are eligible for TRICARE— to enroll during the annual open enrollment season of the TRICARE program.

The cost-sharing requirements for these veterans will be calculated as per existing TRICARE Select rules, regardless of when they originally served in the military.

A dependent cannot enroll in TRICARE merely because a veteran beneficiary is enrolled.

Amendments to TRICARE for Life

Adjustments to the TRICARE for Life program are also proposed, stating that:

Veterans can enroll in TRICARE for Life either through the standard provisions or by enrolling under the amendments introduced by the bill.

Impact on VA Health Care Enrollment

The bill stipulates that a veteran beneficiary who enrolls in TRICARE may not be concurrently enrolled in the VA health care system, thus clarifying that these veterans will need to choose between the two programs.

Memorandum of Understanding

The bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Defense to create a memorandum of understanding that includes reimbursement provisions for the costs associated with the enrollment of these covered veteran beneficiaries in TRICARE.

Implementation Timeline

The amendments introduced by this bill will take effect one year after its enactment, allowing time for regulations to be developed by the involved departments. A phased enrollment process will be initiated during the annual open enrollment season of TRICARE, post-regulation establishment.

Reporting Requirements

The bill includes provisions for regular reporting on its implementation. Key reporting requirements include:

Quarterly updates for two years on the implementation of the bill.

Annual reports detailing the number of covered veteran beneficiaries enrolled in TRICARE after the completion of the initial two years.

Definitions

Key terms such as covered veteran beneficiary and TRICARE program are defined within the context of the bill, referencing existing sections of title 10 of the United States Code.

— Mark Shandrow, CEO of Asana Recovery

ORANGE COUNTY, CA, UNITED STATES, July 22, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Asana Recovery, a leading addiction treatment center renowned for its evidence-based and holistic approach to healing, proudly announces its official approval as a TRICARE-authorized provider. This pivotal milestone, secured through its partnership with TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the administrator of TRICARE in the West Region and a key partner in VA Community Care, marks a significant expansion of accessible, high-quality addiction and mental health services for active-duty service members, veterans, and their eligible family members across the Western United States.

For years, Asana Recovery, based in Orange County, California, has been dedicated to restoring lives impacted by substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions. This new authorization under TRICARE, the nationwide healthcare program of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), underscores Asana’s unwavering commitment to serving those who have bravely served our nation, along with their families who share in their sacrifices. The approval means that thousands of military beneficiaries in states covered by TriWest Healthcare Alliance, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and many others in the West Region, will now have direct access to Asana’s comprehensive continuum of care.

“This TRICARE approval is more than just a credential; it’s a profound affirmation of our mission and a direct pathway to extend our healing hand to the military community,” stated Mark Shandrow, CEO of Asana Recovery. “We understand the unique challenges faced by service members, veterans, and their families—from the invisible wounds of trauma and operational stress to the complexities of reintegration. Our team is deeply committed to providing the specialized, compassionate care they deserve, ensuring they receive the highest standard of treatment on their journey to lasting recovery.”

TRICARE is a critical lifeline for millions, providing comprehensive healthcare benefits to uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide. TriWest Healthcare Alliance plays an indispensable role in this ecosystem, managing the TRICARE West Region and administering vital components of VA Community Care. This partnership with TriWest is particularly impactful, as it streamlines the process for beneficiaries to access Asana Recovery’s specialized programs, reducing administrative hurdles and ensuring timely intervention.

The need for accessible, specialized addiction and mental health treatment within the military community is more pressing than ever. Service members and veterans often grapple with trauma, PTSD, chronic pain, and the pressures of military life, which can significantly increase the risk of substance use disorders. Asana Recovery’s programs are meticulously designed to address these complex co-occurring conditions through a trauma-informed lens, offering individualized treatment plans that integrate evidence-based therapies, holistic modalities, and a strong focus on relapse prevention and long-term wellness.

Beneficiaries seeking care at Asana Recovery can expect a full spectrum of services, including:

• Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) – Step-down care offering robust clinical support with increased flexibility

• Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) – Flexible treatment options allowing individuals to integrate recovery into their daily lives

• Outpatient Programs (OP) – Individual and group therapy sessions providing ongoing support for long-term well-being

• Dual Diagnosis Treatment – Integrated care for co-occurring mental health disorders, such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression

• Trauma-Informed Therapy – Specialized approaches to address the root causes of addiction, particularly relevant for military personnel

• Family Therapy and Support – Engaging loved ones in the healing process to foster a strong support system

“Our clinical team is extensively trained in understanding the nuances of military culture and the specific stressors that can contribute to addiction,” added Jonathan Hagen, Executive Director. “We are proud to offer a safe, confidential, and empathetic environment where TRICARE beneficiaries can heal, rebuild, and reclaim their lives with dignity and respect. This approval significantly enhances our ability to reach those who need our help most.”

Asana Recovery’s commitment to excellence is reflected in its personalized approach, small client-to-staff ratios, and serene environment conducive to healing. The facility is equipped to provide the highest level of care, ensuring that each individual receives the tailored support necessary for sustainable recovery. This TRICARE authorization represents a pivotal step in bridging the gap between the critical need for specialized addiction treatment and the availability of high-quality services for our nation’s heroes and their families.

Walter Reed National Military Medical Center’s Pediatric Primary Care and Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Medicine clinics are here to help with routine wellness visits and acute care needs for patients from birth through age 25. These clinics offer flexible appointment options, including early bird, evening, Saturday, and virtual visits – making it easier for busy families to fit in the care their children need.

Support a Healthy School Year

For a smooth transition into the classroom, it’s important that children and teens are up to date on wellness exams and immunizations. It is just as critical to make sure they are getting adequate sleep, nutritious meals, regular physical activity, play time, and healthy limits on screen time.

“Plan healthy lunches that include proteins, fruits, veggies, and most importantly, foods your child likes to eat!” said U.S. Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Elizabeth Simmons, chief of Pediatric Primary Care at Walter Reed.

Simmons also encourages families to explore the Healthy Habits program designed for children ages 6-18 who may benefit from support developing weight-management routines.

“Although the focus is on the child, the program is an all-inclusive effort to help the entire family become healthier. Healthy Habits are changes for life!” she said. “We encourage kids to keep regular routines to minimize back-to-school anxiety. We have behavioral health psychologists on staff who can help if there are any concerns.”

Caring for Teens and Young Adults

The AYA Medicine Clinic sees patients from ages 12-25 and helps bridge the gap between pediatric and adult care.

U.S. Army Maj. (Dr.) Saira Ahmed, service chief for Walter Reed’s AYA Medicine Clinic, highlights the importance of helping teens take charge of their health.

“[We recommend] promoting medical autonomy for adolescents and young adults — getting them ready for adulthood when they must start managing their own health care. We can also help with issues related to academic performance, screen time, and safety and injury prevention,” Ahmed said.

If your child has had a well visit in the past 12 months, school forms can be submitted through the patient portal without scheduling an additional appointment. It is advised, however, to check with your child’s school as some paperwork may require updated immunizations or physicals.

What to Cover Before School Starts

Well visits are a good time to check on your child’s:

Growth (height, weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol)

School and sports readiness

Mental and emotional well-being

Medications and refills

Healthy habits and nutrition goals

For teens and young adults, providers may also cover:

Puberty and development changes

Cervical cancer screenings (females ages 21-25)

Birth control and reproductive health

Immunizations by age:

Age 4: DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis), IPV (polio), MMR (measles-mumps-rubella), Varicella (chickenpox)

Age 9: HPV series (human papilloma)

Age 11: HPV, Men ACWY #1 (meningitis), Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis)

Age 16: Men ACWY #2 (meningitis booster)

Ages 16-18: Men B series

ORANGE COUNTY, CA, UNITED STATES, July 22, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Asana Recovery, a leading addiction treatment center renowned for its evidence-based and holistic approach to healing, proudly announces its official approval as a TRICARE-authorized provider. This pivotal milestone, secured through its partnership with TriWest Healthcare Alliance, the administrator of TRICARE in the West Region and a key partner in VA Community Care, marks a significant expansion of accessible, high-quality addiction and mental health services for active-duty service members, veterans, and their eligible family members across the Western United States.

For years, Asana Recovery, based in Orange County, California, has been dedicated to restoring lives impacted by substance use disorders and co-occurring mental health conditions. This new authorization under TRICARE, the nationwide healthcare program of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), underscores Asana’s unwavering commitment to serving those who have bravely served our nation, along with their families who share in their sacrifices. The approval means that thousands of military beneficiaries in states covered by TriWest Healthcare Alliance, including California, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and many others in the West Region, will now have direct access to Asana’s comprehensive continuum of care.

“This TRICARE approval is more than just a credential; it’s a profound affirmation of our mission and a direct pathway to extend our healing hand to the military community,” stated Mark Shandrow, CEO of Asana Recovery. “We understand the unique challenges faced by service members, veterans, and their families—from the invisible wounds of trauma and operational stress to the complexities of reintegration. Our team is deeply committed to providing the specialized, compassionate care they deserve, ensuring they receive the highest standard of treatment on their journey to lasting recovery.”

TRICARE is a critical lifeline for millions, providing comprehensive healthcare benefits to uniformed service members, retirees, and their families worldwide. TriWest Healthcare Alliance plays an indispensable role in this ecosystem, managing the TRICARE West Region and administering vital components of VA Community Care. This partnership with TriWest is particularly impactful, as it streamlines the process for beneficiaries to access Asana Recovery’s specialized programs, reducing administrative hurdles and ensuring timely intervention.

The need for accessible, specialized addiction and mental health treatment within the military community is more pressing than ever. Service members and veterans often grapple with trauma, PTSD, chronic pain, and the pressures of military life, which can significantly increase the risk of substance use disorders. Asana Recovery’s programs are meticulously designed to address these complex co-occurring conditions through a trauma-informed lens, offering individualized treatment plans that integrate evidence-based therapies, holistic modalities, and a strong focus on relapse prevention and long-term wellness.

Beneficiaries seeking care at Asana Recovery can expect a full spectrum of services, including:

• Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) – Step-down care offering robust clinical support with increased flexibility

• Intensive Outpatient Programs (IOP) – Flexible treatment options allowing individuals to integrate recovery into their daily lives

• Outpatient Programs (OP) – Individual and group therapy sessions providing ongoing support for long-term well-being

• Dual Diagnosis Treatment – Integrated care for co-occurring mental health disorders, such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression

• Trauma-Informed Therapy – Specialized approaches to address the root causes of addiction, particularly relevant for military personnel

• Family Therapy and Support – Engaging loved ones in the healing process to foster a strong support system

“Our clinical team is extensively trained in understanding the nuances of military culture and the specific stressors that can contribute to addiction,” added Jonathan Hagen, Executive Director. “We are proud to offer a safe, confidential, and empathetic environment where TRICARE beneficiaries can heal, rebuild, and reclaim their lives with dignity and respect. This approval significantly enhances our ability to reach those who need our help most.”

Asana Recovery’s commitment to excellence is reflected in its personalized approach, small client-to-staff ratios, and serene environment conducive to healing. The facility is equipped to provide the highest level of care, ensuring that each individual receives the tailored support necessary for sustainable recovery. This TRICARE authorization represents a pivotal step in bridging the gap between the critical need for specialized addiction treatment and the availability of high-quality services for our nation’s heroes and their families.

I’m adhering to my military branch’s instructions on keeping physically fit and eating nutritiously, but I’m having trouble getting rid of some excess pounds from my last duty station, where I mostly sat at a desk. How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way?

Sincerely,

U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon

--

To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you’ll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage.

That’s the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health.

--

“Lifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect—move more, eat less, and sleep well,” Franzos said. Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes “at least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,” said Franzos. “If you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.”

“Regular, vigorous exercise where you can’t carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.” Franzos. “It can even include walking if you walk briskly.” This weight-bearing exercise helps “maintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,” because you want to “avoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.”

“Diet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,” for the warfighter, said Franzos.

The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off

Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said.

When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status.

""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes.""

‘Trust in Your Military Health System’ and Don’t Go It Alone

Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access.

“It's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,” Franzos said, but instead, “it may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.”

“I would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it’s a good option for you.” Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted.

“We've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,” Franzo said.

“But I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor’s mouth is going to be, ‘Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,’ and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.”

--

Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time.

Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

For more information, check out these resources, and remember, stay safe out there. We want you and your teammates to stay fit and in fighting shape.
