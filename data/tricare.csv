When service members are deployed, their safety depends on much more than their personal protective equipment and extensive training. Safety starts with what’s on their plate.

Behind every meal served to a soldier, sailor, airman, Guardian, or Marine, the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps is working hard to make sure that food is safe to eat, whether in the field or at the installation dining facility.

The mission of the veterinary corps goes beyond taking care of animals. Its expertise plays a vital role in ensuring food safety and public health protection across the Department of Defense.

Food Safety Starts Long Before the First Bite

Specialized Medical Detachment (Veterinary Service Support) teams, or MDVSSs, evaluate food safety in the field and at military bases, said U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer 5 Oscar Carrión, Interagency Integrator (Food Protection) at Defense Health Agency Veterinary Services Division in Falls Church, Virginia. These detachments work under defined guidelines based on troop numbers and operational scope, providing scalable support whether the mission involves 60,000 troops in combat or 12,000 in humanitarian-support roles.

The veterinary corps accomplishes these actions not only with active duty assets, but the U.S. Army Reserve constantly supports the global combatant commands as well, said Carrión.

“Our USAR MDVSSs fill constant rotations to U.S. Central Command and support U.S. Southern Command,” he said. “Without the USAR VC component, the active duty VC assets would be stretched thin.”

These teams support high-profile training exercises, overseas deployments, disaster relief operations, and U.S. Navy resupply missions, said Carrión. Their role is crucial in maintaining food safety whether at sea, on the ground, or in the air.

“We are key participants in pre-deployment activities and high-visibility exercises around the world,” said Carrión

The MDVSSs not only evaluate the quality of food upon arrival, but they also inspect and test items for signs of spoilage, contamination, and storage issues, said Carrión. Their inspections include visual checks and rapid-diagnostic tests to catch threats early. These checks ensure all food received is safe and originates from DOD-approved sources.

“We’re focused on food safety for all service members,” said Carrión. “MDVSS teams conduct sanitation audits of food vendors and facilities to ensure compliance with military food safety standards. Field units often rely on local suppliers, so these audits are essential to avoid introducing unfamiliar or unregulated risks into the supply chain.”

Battling Invisible Enemies

U.S. Army Lt. Col. Melissa Hehr, deputy chief, DHA Veterinary Services Division, says the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps treats bacteria and viruses like an enemy force.

“If we think of foodborne pathogens as an enemy force, with the capability to move virtually undetected throughout the operational environment, then the connection between illness prevention and warfighter lethality becomes much clearer,” she said.

The enemy in this case includes norovirus, salmonellosis, listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, campylobacteriosis and infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli. Some of these pathogens are common at home and in base or garrison environments, while others, such as cholera or brucellosis, and intestinal parasites are more likely to be encountered overseas.

“The veterinary corps’ deterrence strategy is to deploy capabilities that will disrupt pathogen freedom of movement from the environment to a food source, whether it’s an animal intended for food, or a fresh fruit or vegetable,” said Hehr. “We do this by inspecting food sources for evidence of disease or contamination, then neutralizing any detected threats.”

The food safety management system uses hazard analysis and critical control points, or HACCP, to ensure that even if a pathogen does infiltrate food-processing operations, it is still denied access, said Hehr. By setting up layered safety mechanisms such as temperature controls, secure transport, and facility sanitation audits, the veterinary corps helps intercept these threats before they can reach a service member’s tray or mess kit.

“Pathogens that make it through are met with control points we monitor vigilantly, and if needed, we destroy them with heat or chemicals,” she said. “Essentially, the veterinary corps’ offensive posture towards foodborne illness enemies enables the warfighter to focus on being G.I. Joe, without the threat of GI flow!”

Food safety Critical to Warfighter Lethality

A foodborne illness can shut down a unit faster than an ambush.

It doesn’t matter how advanced U.S. warfighting technology is—or even how robust U.S. military healthcare capabilities are—food safety is an essential requirement for combat effectiveness, said Hehr.

The dangers of contaminated food range from minor gastrointestinal distress to full-blown outbreaks that can leave dozens of personnel unable to perform their duties.

“Without life-sustaining food, warfighters are 100% combat-ineffective,” she said. “Protecting the food supply is paramount to maintaining force health and combat readiness. That’s why the veterinary corps works tirelessly around the globe to lead DOD’s food protection mission, diligently defending the food supply from threats, expertly ensuring food safety, and resolutely enabling lethality.”

Creating a Culture of Clean and Safe Meals

Food safety isn’t a one-person job. It requires training, teamwork, and leadership support.

“A culture of food safety is a team effort,” said Carrión. “It depends greatly on the unit’s leadership and combatant commanders to support it just as much as any other safety measure critical to the DOD mission.”

The veterinary corps partners with culinary specialists, preventive medicine teams, and unit field sanitation crews to build that culture, said Carrión. From handwashing stations to kitchen audits, every piece matters. Field sanitation teams are particularly important for teaching troops how to maintain personal hygiene in austere environments.

“We eat at least three meals every day,” said Carrión. “So, the safety of our food, the cooking process, and sanitation at our dining facilities are critical, especially during deployments.”

Creating a strong food safety culture also involves education. The Joint Culinary Center of Excellence and U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence provide training for food service personnel and public health specialists. This training reinforces the idea that preventing illness is just as important as preparing tasty meals.

The Quiet Professionals

Service members may not see the behind-the-scenes work the veterinary corps does every day, and that’s okay with Carrión. Their goal is to prevent problems before they start. Even small actions such as checking the temperature of food, ensuring clean water sources, or inspecting local vendors can have a major impact on the health of deployed forces. When illnesses do occur, these teams are ready to assist preventive medicine assets in investigating outbreaks, tracing sources, and implementing corrective actions immediately.

“Our silent public health and culinary service assets are always on duty protecting the force,” he said.

So, the next time you unwrap an MRE or head through the chow line, remember that your meal is not just food—it’s fuel—and the Army Veterinary Corps’ professionals are there to ensure you can consume it safely.

Protecting Yourself from Tick Bites Preventing tick bites is crucial to minimizing the risk of contracting Lyme disease, babesiosis, and other tick-borne illnesses.","By Doug Holl, Defense Health Agency-Public Health

It’s almost a rite of passage for service members conducting field training during the spring and summer months in Maryland—the tick check. This careful, whole-body scan can help prevent serious infection from deer ticks, which carry Lyme disease and now also carry the risk of co-infecting their victims with babesiosis.

Military public health experts warn the rise of babesiosis could lead to more complicated infections and diagnostic challenges.

""One tick can carry many pathogens and can actually vector more than one of them at once,"" said Robyn Nadolny, chief of the Defense Health Agency-Public Health vector-borne disease branch in Aberdeen, Maryland. ""You'll often see co-infected ticks that have both the agent of Lyme disease and the agent of babesiosis."" This means that a single tick bite can potentially transmit both, leading to more complex symptoms and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment.

Babesiosis is a malaria-like disease that is more commonly found in the Northeast and upper Midwest of the United States. However, researchers found that the disease is spreading in the mid-Atlantic states, including Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Delaware, due to a number of factors including changing weather patterns in recent years. It can cause flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, and fatigue, which can easily be mistaken for other illnesses, especially during the summer months, said Nadolny.

""I think the public health priority is simply getting the information out there to our providers and physicians, especially for clinicians seeing people that may or may not even know that they were bitten by a tick,” she said. ""If they see flu-like symptoms in the summer, having an understanding of what the risks are in the area is important so that they don't miss something.""

Nadolny was one of the lead authors of a newly published study in the Journal of Medical Entomology providing critical insights into the emergence of babesiosis in the mid-Atlantic region and documenting human cases and the presence of the causative agent “Babesia microti” in local tick populations.

""We know that the blacklegged tick (or the deer tick), which is the vector of babesiosis, has been in this area for a long time,"" explained Nadolny. ""Babesiosis tends to follow in the shadow of Lyme disease by a number of years. Lyme gets established first, and that paves the way for babesiosis to come in after it.""

Benefits of Collaboration

This trend highlights the importance of collaborative studies involving local, state, military, and academic experts.

""We collaborated with state health departments, local health departments with other federal agencies, and with academic groups that are conducting research,” said Nadolny. “It's really helpful to have everybody bring their own information to the table and look at it all to understand: Are we seeing something that's a one-off, or are we seeing something that's a trend?""

Nadolny also mentioned the importance of the Mid-Atlantic Tick Summit, an annual regional conference focused on sharing information and fostering collaboration on tick-borne diseases and tick research within the mid-Atlantic region.

“This has been a real goldmine for collaborations because you get everybody that's working on the same issues in the same geographic region together for a day,” said Nadolny. “I think that making sure people can connect with other researchers and scientists and public health practitioners in their area of study is absolutely critical. We’re exposing new folks in the public health community to these opportunities as early as possible. I try to make sure everyone on my team gets to go to these regional meetings, especially since they're free.”

The impact of tick-borne diseases extends beyond individual health, particularly for military personnel and their families.

""Even young folks and healthy folks can get quite sick with babesiosis,"" said Nadolny. ""For our service members, this can lead to reduced readiness or not being able to deploy because they're sick, or missing training exercises because they're sick, or their spouse or child is sick.""

To combat this growing threat, DHA-PH offers the Military Tick Identification/Infection Confirmation Kit, or MilTICK, program.

""Our flagship program is the MilTICK tick-testing program,"" said Nadolny. ""Anybody that's under the Department of Defense umbrella can submit ticks that have been found biting a person or a family member to our lab. We identify and test those ticks, and then we report that result back to the person so they can have some actionable evidence to take to their physician.""

The MilTICK program, now in its 30th year, serves a dual purpose: providing individuals with valuable information for diagnosis and treatment, and gathering data to track and understand changing tick-borne disease threats.

""Having this sort of passive surveillance program through MilTICK allows us to have a detailed and granular understanding of what's happening at military installations across the country,"" said Nadolny.

Protecting Yourself from Tick Bites

Preventing tick bites is crucial to minimizing the risk of contracting Lyme disease, babesiosis, and other tick-borne illnesses. Nadolny recommends several strategies for those living in or visiting tick-prone areas:

• Treat clothing with permethrin. ""It's always nice to reference the DoD Insect Repellent System, which is designed for military folks wearing uniforms, but it really applies to anybody,"" said Nadolny. ""If you know that you're going to be out hiking or gardening in a tick habitat, I recommend treating those clothes with permethrin."" Permethrin is a tick-killing insecticide that can be sprayed on clothing and remains effective for several washings. ""You can buy a spray can of permethrin at any outdoor store,"" she continued. ""Spray it all over the clothing, wait for it to dry, and then it's good for several washings. It's basically a poison for the ticks, but it doesn't affect mammals like us.""

• Use insect repellent. Apply insect repellent containing DEET to exposed skin, following the manufacturer's instructions carefully.

• Wear protective clothing. When possible, wear long sleeves, long pants, and tuck pants into socks or boots to prevent ticks from accessing your skin.

• Wear light-colored clothing. This makes it easier to spot ticks crawling on your clothes.

• Carry tape for tick removal. If you find the ticks crawling on you, simply stick them to a piece of tape and fold it over so they can’t bite you, then throw it away.

• Perform tick checks. After spending time outdoors, thoroughly check yourself, your children, and your pets for ticks. Pay close attention to areas such as the hairline, ears, armpits, groin, and behind the knees.

""If you are wading through hip-high grass, all those ticks are going to be coming on your legs and they're going to be crawling up you,” said Nadolny. “If your shirt's tucked in and your pants are tucked in, then you have a much better ability to actually spot that tick crawling on your clothes and grab it.""

Nadolny, who received her doctorate at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, plans to continue her study of babesiosis in partnership with her former professor, Dr. Holly Gaff, who runs the ODU Tick Research Team.

“We got a grant together looking at babesiosis hot spots along the Eastern Shore and right here on the ranges at Aberdeen Proving Ground,” said Nadolny. “We're going out here on the ranges at APG, catching small mammals and taking tissue samples from them to determine if they're infected with the tick-borne disease.”

Nadolny explained that by picking ticks off these animals, they see the species of ticks that are feeding on them and who's involved in what's called the zoonotic cycle of babesiosis.

“Once you understand the cycle, then you can understand how to come into the cycle and break it.”

Your baby’s health is probably one of your top priorities, so you may be wondering how to get TRICARE coverage for your child.

The first thing you should do is register your child in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.

“Your child can’t have a TRICARE plan until you’ve added them to DEERS,” said Cristina Flores, health systems specialist for Healthcare Operations at the Defense Health Agency.

Your child’s date of birth and their sponsor’s status affect what you should do next.

“Children of active duty service members will be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan once they’re registered in DEERS,” Flores said. “But enrollment isn’t automatic for children whose sponsors are retirees or have TRICARE Reserve Select or TRICARE Retired Reserve.”

Keep reading to make sure you know the important next steps and deadlines for getting TRICARE coverage for your child.

Q: When do I need to add my child to DEERS for them to get TRICARE coverage?

A: This depends on where your child was born:

In the U.S.: You have 90 days from your child’s date of birth to add them to DEERS.

Overseas (including U.S. territories): You have 120 days from your child’s date of birth to add them to DEERS.

Q: How do I add my child to DEERS?

A: Your child’s sponsor will need to visit a Uniformed Services ID card office to complete the registration. (If both parents are service members, choose one to be the child’s sponsor in DEERS.)

Bring your child’s official birth certificate or SF-240 Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

You don’t need to wait for your child to receive a Social Security number to start the registration process. But you do need to update your child’s DEERS record when your child is assigned a Social Security number.

Go to milConnect to learn more about adding a newborn to DEERS.

Q: What do I need to do after my child is in DEERS?

A: The next step depends on your child’s sponsor’s status.

If your child’s sponsor is an active duty service member:

Your child will be automatically enrolled in a TRICARE plan after you add them to DEERS. Where your child lives determines whether they’ll have TRICARE Prime, TRICARE Select, or TRICARE Select Overseas.

Contact your regional contractor to confirm your child’s enrollment in a plan.

You have 90 days from the automatic enrollment date to change to a different plan. Use the Plan Finder to see what other plans your child might be eligible for.

If your child’s sponsor is a retiree:

Your child won’t be automatically enrolled in a plan after you add them to DEERS.

In the U.S., you must enroll your child in a TRICARE plan within 90 days of your child’s birth so that their coverage effective date is their date of birth.

Overseas (including U.S. territories), you must enroll your child in TRICARE Select Overseas within 120 days of your child’s birth so that their coverage effective date is their date of birth.

If your child’s sponsor has TRICARE Reserve Select or TRICARE Retired Reserve:

Your child won’t be automatically added to your plan after you add them to DEERS.

In the U.S., add your child to TRS or TRR within 90 days of your child’s birth so that their coverage effective date is their date of birth.

Overseas (including U.S. territories), add your child to TRS or TRR within 120 days of your child’s birth so that their coverage effective date is their date of birth.

Q: Can my other family members change their TRICARE plan?

A: Having a baby is a TRICARE Qualifying Life Event. A QLE for one family member creates a chance for all eligible family members to change their TRICARE health plan within 90 days of the QLE date, as noted in the TRICARE Qualifying Life Events Fact Sheet. (This doesn’t apply to TRS or TRR.)

Q: What happens if I don’t add my child to DEERS or enroll them in a plan by the deadline?

A: If you don’t add your child to DEERS, they won’t be eligible for DOD’s military or civilian health care coverage.

If your child’s sponsor is on active duty or retired, TRICARE won’t pay on any claims starting when your child is 91 days old (121 days old overseas). If your child’s sponsor has TRS or TRR, TRICARE won’t pay on any claims starting on day 1.

You can still add your child to DEERS after the deadline. However, the sponsor’s status determines:

If and when your child can enroll in a TRICARE plan

Your child’s coverage effective date and if TRICARE will reprocess any denied claims

Go to Getting TRICARE for Your Child to learn about these scenarios.

Once your child has a TRICARE plan, make sure you take advantage of TRICARE-covered services to keep your child healthy. TRICARE covers well-child care from birth through age 5. This includes routine services, like newborn care, immunizations, and more. You can also learn more about how TRICARE covers breast pumps, supplies, and breastfeeding counseling.",https://www.militaryspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TRICARE-baby.png,N,,2025-07-09 17:56:51.589004

We also have some claims being denied and we can’t speak to anyone. The clients show an active Tricare policy. It’s been almost an 8 month fight and things are getting worse. We aren’t accepting any new Tricare clients because of this. It’s frustrating.

Sounds like you're Prime.

Get a referral from your PCM to a non network provider. With a non net referral, claims process with network benefits.

TRICARE won't approve without rationale, have the PCM include information that there are no network providers within 50 miles.

MAKE SURE that you have ALL SERVICES listed on that referral. Things that don't need approval in net, will require approval for non net.

I was on my 5/6 call today, and the first person said that they can’t transfer me to a supervisor. Then they played the game of placing me on hold. I had to call back, and asked to speak to a supervisor again, it took some prodding, but I was finally transferred to one, and they stated it is absolute policy that when we ask to be transferred to a supervisor, they are to do so.

I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I worked Tricare west customer service, they are absolutely vile thugs who get paid to hurt veterans.

The Go Clear Award recognizes USNH Rota’s completion of AORN-mandated staff training, acquisition of smoke evacuation equipment, and a successful three-month audit of compliance and performance. Surgical smoke, generated during procedures using energy-based instruments, poses documented risks to surgical teams, including respiratory issues, exposure to toxic chemicals, and long-term health complications. Eliminating this hazard enhances not only the clinical environment, but also the operational longevity of healthcare personnel.

""This initiative directly supports our mission to maintain a ready medical force,"" said Cmdr. Amber Neal, Main Operating Room Department Head. “By addressing a known occupational hazard, we've improved the safety of our workspaces and strengthened our ability to provide uninterrupted care in any operational setting.""

This milestone sets a new standard for perioperative safety across the EUCOM theater and exemplifies how overseas MTFs can lead in implementing evidence-based practices that directly contribute to mission readiness and capability. These practices not only improve patient health outcomes, such as reducing surgical complications, shortening recovery times, and increasing patient satisfaction, but also enhance support for surgical teams through standardized protocols and better resource utilization.

By earning the Go Clear Award, USNH Rota reinforces the essential connection between healthcare excellence and operational effectiveness by ensuring patients and medical professionals alike are protected, prepared, and mission-ready.

The ResMed AirSense 11 AutoSet CPAP Machine with Heated Humidifier is a cutting-edge device designed to enhance sleep apnea therapy. With its advanced settings and user-friendly features, it offers personalized comfort and effective treatment. This blog delves into the key functionalities that make the AirSense 11 a top choice for CPAP users.

Auto-Adjusting Pressure for Personalized Therapy

The AirSense 11 AutoSet stands out with its auto-adjusting pressure technology, which adapts to your breathing patterns throughout the night. The AutoSet algorithm monitors your breathing and adjusts pressure breath-by-breath, ensuring the lowest effective pressure to maintain an open airway. It also differentiates between obstructive and central apneas, providing tailored therapy. The ""AutoSet for Her"" mode, designed specifically for women, offers gentler pressure adjustments to improve REM sleep, making it ideal for those with unique respiratory needs.

Integrated Heated Humidifier and Climate Control

Dryness and irritation are common CPAP therapy challenges, but the AirSense 11 addresses these with its built-in HumidAir humidifier. Users can adjust humidity levels from 1 to 8 or turn it off entirely for personalized comfort. When paired with the optional ClimateLineAir 11 heated tubing, the Climate Control Auto setting maintains consistent temperature and humidity, preventing rainout and ensuring a comfortable experience, even in cold or dry climates. The humidifier tub is removable for easy cleaning and refilling, enhancing user convenience.

AutoRamp for Comfortable Sleep Onset

The AutoRamp feature eases users into therapy by starting with a low pressure to help you fall asleep, then gradually increasing to the prescribed level once sleep is detected. This is particularly beneficial for first-time CPAP users or those sensitive to higher pressures. Additionally, the Expiratory Pressure Relief (EPR) feature reduces pressure during exhalation, making breathing feel more natural and comfortable.

Intuitive Touchscreen and myAir App Integration

Navigating the AirSense 11 is effortless, thanks to its sleek touchscreen interface and large start/stop button. The myAir app enhances the experience by providing real-time sleep data, daily sleep scores, and personalized coaching. The Personal Therapy Assistant offers voice-guided setup instructions and troubleshooting tips, while Care Check-In provides tailored support during the first month of therapy. With built-in cellular and Bluetooth connectivity, your data syncs automatically, allowing healthcare providers to monitor progress remotely.

Travel-Friendly and FAA-Compliant Design

Weighing just 2.5 pounds, the AirSense 11 is compact and travel-friendly. It’s FAA-approved for in-flight use (in airplane mode, with the humidifier emptied), making it a reliable companion for travelers. The device supports over-the-air software updates, ensuring it stays current with the latest features without manual intervention.

The ResMed AirSense 11 AutoSet combines advanced technology with user-centric design, offering auto-adjusting pressure, climate control, and digital support for a seamless CPAP experience. Whether you’re a new or seasoned user, its features promote comfort, compliance, and better sleep quality.

I am from the east coast but we are currently stationed and living on the west coast. We have had a unique experience I would say. I’m very close to my family, and so I was traveling back and forth every other month to be back home with them and then coming back to where my partner is. My partner and I got married pretty young, after we got married and I was signing up for the insurance and everything I decided to enroll in tricare east to be able to go to all of my specialists and doctors I’ve had since I was younger and who knows all of my health history. I have a few major health issues and conditions that I wanted to make sure I still got to go to the people I already knew and was comfortable around. As of this year I haven’t been able to go home back and forth as much and have needed to go to the hospital a couple times due to scares and not having my actual doctors here where were stationed. Does anyone know if it’s possible for me to use my tricare select east here in the west? I had read somewhere once that it said I should be able to but I never found any direct answer. I want to keep my insurance east incase I ever need to have a major (planned) surgery I would like to have it back home, I really don’t want to change it to west for that reason and also because we shouldn’t be living where we are for too much longer. If anyone has any information or an answer I would be so appreciative and grateful

More than 1.5 million TRICARE users in six states – Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wisconsin – moved from the TRICARE East Region to the West Region, while all West Region beneficiaries changed contractors, from HealthNet Federal Services to TriWest. Humana Military retained the redefined East Region but changed claims processors.

[UPDATED MONTHLY: MOAA's TRICARE Toolkit]

Since January, MOAA has provided direct assistance to our members, other beneficiaries, and medical providers who contacted us regarding access challenges and other transition-related problems. More recently, we have escalated issues related to inaccurate reports of other health insurance (OHI) that prevent claims from processing properly, copay calculations, and claims being improperly processed as non-network.

End of Referral Waiver Extensions

The Defense Health Agency will not extend the TRICARE West Region referral approval waiver, which expired June 30.

* If a beneficiary received a primary care manager (PCM) referral waiver prior to that date, they may continue seeing their specialty care provider without a point-of-service charge through Sept. 30, at which point they will need a referral from their PCM to continue treatment.

* If a beneficiary did not receive a referral waiver, they must follow standard referral practices as of July 1. More information is available at the TriWest website.

MOAA meets regularly with the managed care support contractors – TriWest and Humana Military – as well as new leadership at the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to address the numerous problems the T-5 transition has created for beneficiaries and providers. At MOAA's urging, TRICARE issued policy waivers to facilitate access to care as the contractors worked through systemic problems and continued to build a functional network in the West Region.

What's Next

Congress provides vital oversight on the multibillion-dollar TRICARE contracts, and MOAA has taken this issue to Capitol Hill, assisting lawmakers' offices with their oversight efforts.

Thanks to legislation included in the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is required to conduct an evaluation of each TRICARE contract transition. The GAO has already started its T-5 assessment, but the breadth, magnitude, and duration of T-5 problems demand a more detailed analysis than what's required by statute.

MOAA has outlined recommendations for detailed report requirements addressing beneficiary continuity of care, network adequacy, the impact of transition problems on access to care, and DHA's oversight role leading up to the transition. We are urging members of Congress to ensure these requirements are included in the FY 2026 NDAA.

Among them, the Lifestyle Coordinator plays a vital role in promoting senior wellbeing, fostering community, and creating meaningful moments. But what does a typical day look like for a lifestyle coordinator in residential aged care?

Morning: Setting the Tone for the Day

The day begins early with a warm welcome to residents. The lifestyle coordinator checks in with the care team to understand any changes in residents’ health or preferences. This ensures that activities are tailored to meet individual needs.

After breakfast, it’s time for the first group activity—often something gentle and engaging like chair yoga, morning stretches, or a music therapy session. These activities are designed to boost mobility, mood, and mental alertness.

Midday: Connection and Creativity

As the day progresses, the focus shifts to social engagement and creative expression. Lifestyle coordinators might lead a craft workshop, facilitate a book club, or organise a gardening session in the courtyard. These activities not only stimulate the mind but also encourage residents to connect with one another.

Lunch is a social affair, and the lifestyle coordinator often joins residents to foster a sense of community and observe how everyone is feeling.

Afternoon: Tailored Experiences and One-on-One Time

In the afternoon, the coordinator may run individual sessions for residents who prefer quieter or more personalised experiences. This could include reminiscence therapy, digital storytelling, or simply a friendly chat over tea.

Special events like birthday celebrations, pet therapy visits, or cultural days are also common, adding variety and excitement to the week.

Evening: Reflection and Preparation

As the day winds down, the lifestyle coordinator updates records, reflects on the day’s successes, and begins planning for tomorrow. Feedback from residents and staff helps shape future programs, ensuring they remain relevant and engaging.

Why Lifestyle Coordinators Matter in Aged Care

Lifestyle coordinators are more than activity planners, they are advocates for joy, connection, and purpose in aged care. Their work supports emotional, physical, and cognitive health, making a profound difference in the lives of older Australians.

Whether it’s through a shared laugh, a creative project, or a moment of quiet companionship, lifestyle coordinators help transform aged care from a place of residence into a vibrant community.",https://www.tricare.com.au/app/uploads/2025/07/e336fd51-bcf7-4c05-9fba-3c6dcdd94392.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 06:57:22.244151

-- Ona Treatment Center now provides updated rehabilitation services for active military members seeking alcohol treatment through TRICARE insurance in Northern California. The facility offers specialized inpatient care for military personnel facing alcohol and substance use disorders.

For more information, visit https://onatreatmentcenter.com/tricare-approved-alcohol-rehab-facility/

Recent data shows more than 20% of active service members report heavy drinking patterns, creating urgent demand for specialized treatment programs. Military health officials recognize alcohol use disorders as the most prevalent substance use challenge facing service members across all branches.

""Active military members face unique challenges with alcohol use disorders, and our TRICARE-approved programs deliver evidence-based care that addresses both addiction and underlying trauma,"" said Clinical Director Tiffany Komba. ""Our dual-diagnosis approach ensures service members receive comprehensive treatment for alcohol addiction while addressing co-occurring mental health conditions common in military populations.""

The facility's evidence-based ""Living in Balance"" curriculum provides structured treatment through individual counseling, group therapy, and family therapy sessions. Program Director Jaime, a California licensed CADCII and International Certified Drug and Alcohol Counselor, oversees specialized programming that includes cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and trauma-informed care approaches.

As a TRICARE-approved provider, Ona Treatment Center reduces out-of-pocket expenses for military members needing addiction treatment. The facility maintains certification from the State Department of Health Care Services and has earned Gold Seal accreditation from The Joint Commission.

""Military service members deserve access to premier alcohol addiction treatment that understands their unique experiences,"" Komba added. ""Our TRICARE-approved programs combine medical excellence with military-focused care approaches that support long-term recovery and successful return to duty.""

The facility's treatment approach corresponds with TRICARE coverage guidelines for substance use disorders, which typically include detoxification services, residential rehabilitation, outpatient treatment options, medication support, and therapeutic interventions. This alignment helps service members access care with minimal financial barriers.

About Ona Treatment Center

-- Addiction Resource Center is pleased to announce expansions to its TRICARE-approved addiction rehabilitation services, created for active duty military members struggling with substance abuse.

Further details can be found at https://sayarc.com/services/tricare-approved-iop/

According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), nearly 1 in 10 active-duty military service members report problematic alcohol use, and the need for specialized treatment is more critical than ever. Active duty personnel often face unique stressors that increase the risk of substance abuse, including deployment, combat exposure, and the pressure of balancing military and personal life.

At Addiction Resource Center, the team helps these service members overcome addiction while providing the support necessary to continue fulfilling their duties at home and within their units.

“Our goal is to provide a safe, non-judgmental space where military service members can heal from substance abuse and return to their duties feeling better equipped to manage the stresses of military life,” said a spokesperson from Addiction Resource Center. “Our TRICARE-approved programs are designed with their specific needs in mind, combining evidence-based treatment with a deep understanding of the challenges they face.”

The center's residential rehabilitation program offers a structured, supportive environment where active duty service members can receive comprehensive treatment for substance use disorders. This includes detoxification services, one-on-one counseling, group therapy, and education focused on the root causes of addiction, as well as long-term recovery strategies.

In addition, the program incorporates trauma-informed care, PTSD support, and military cultural competence into every aspect of treatment, ensuring that the unique needs of military service members are met.

Addiction Resource Center’s residential treatment programs for active duty military members are flexible and tailored to meet the needs of each individual. Service members can attend treatment while maintaining their responsibilities, as the program offers scheduling options that accommodate military duties.

Addiction Resource Center is proud to support active duty service members by providing evidence-based care that aligns with TRICARE requirements, ensuring that treatment is accessible and effective. Service members can access treatment with no out-of-pocket costs and are guided through the entire process, from verification of benefits to treatment and post-discharge care.

The visit, coordinated by Cmdr. Mary King, Guam’s previous FHP manager, provided invaluable insights and skill enhancements. It included a comprehensive program overview for the current program manager, Lt. Cmdr. Heather Nelson, alongside practical exercises such as sexual assault medical forensic exams, peer reviews of the Department of Defense Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) Reports (DD Form 2911), and detailed case reviews. The week also featured engaging lectures, collectively offering 37 continuing education units to participants.

Guam's remote location and relatively small caseload—approximately 13 to 15 sexual assault medical forensic exams annually—present unique training challenges. Cordoni's visit directly addressed these gaps, enabling previously trained forensic healthcare examiners to renew their competency and validate their skills according to DHA credentialing standards.

With DHA inspections expanding to include sexual assault response components, this training is more critical than ever. Cordoni's expertise provided invaluable insight for ensuring both exceptional patient care and full compliance with policy requirements.

For those seeking to expand their deployment readiness and contribute to the FHP's global mission, opportunities await by joining the team. Becoming a forensic healthcare examiner requires specific qualifications: licensure as a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife, certified registered nurse anesthetist, clinical nurse specialist, or registered nurse. In limited circumstances, specially trained independent duty corpsmen may also be eligible.

Entry-level training can be achieved through several pathways, including the Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examiner Course at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, Texas, or equivalent DHA-approved training within the Defense Department. Certification with the Commission for Forensic Nursing Certification or other recognized national body, coupled with completion of the SAMFE course, is another option. Completion of the fiscal year 2016 Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery Mobile Training Team and the Army’s Medical Command Headquarters SAMFE Course also fulfills the requirement.

Maintaining annual credentialing and competency is paramount. This involves completing four continuing education units focused on sexual assault and demonstrating clinical proficiency through rigorous retrospective medical record reviews, live proctoring, and the successful completion of four sexual assault medical forensic exams, either simulated or real, all under the watchful eye of a qualified supervisor.

The enhanced training and validation provided by Cordoni's visit underscores USNH Guam’s commitment to providing comprehensive and compassionate care to all service members, ensuring readiness and upholding the highest standards of medical forensic expertise in the Indo-Pacific region. This commitment includes ensuring the availability of skilled professionals capable of conducting thorough and sensitive forensic evaluations when needed.

Mercer U.S. LLC was accused of overbilling the DHA for work done by specific employees and subcontractors billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels should have warranted.

The settlement was announced in a report from the Interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Connecticut, released on Monday.

Ahead of developing and implementing its managed care support and pharmacy services contract, DHA needed subject matter expertise from outside of the Department of Defense to make sure beneficiaries received top notch care.

The report said that DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support, or HPIS, services from vendors under the General Services Administration’s Professional Services Schedule.

Prosecutors noted that around April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a Blanket Purchase Agreement, or BPA, for HPIS services. DHA also awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer.

The BPA included labor categories identifying the education and experience qualifications and associated hourly billing rate for the individuals working under the BPA.

On a monthly basis, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expanded under the BPA at hourly billing rates that were meant to reflect the employees’ or subcontractor employees’ designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with the categories.

However, according to the government, from May 7, 2020, to Aug. 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for work done by 11 employees under the BPA at labor rates for which the employees did not have the necessary education or experience.

To resolve claims that could have arisen under the Contract Disputes Act and common law theories of breach of contract, such as payment by mistake and unjust enrichment, Mercer paid the government a total of $456,796.50.

The investigation was led by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service with help from the Defense Contract Audit Agency Operations Investigative Support Division.

The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.
The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states.","CVS Health's Omnicare has been ordered to pay $948.8 million over invalid prescriptions. The company is a leading American supplier of health products and services, with net sales broken down into medical insurance plan management services, medical benefits management, retail distribution, and other activities.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan, comes after a lengthy legal battle that began in 2015.

The lawsuit, filed by former Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan and joined by the federal government, accused Omnicare of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for prescriptions at long-term care facilities. The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

Judge McMahon imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018, and awarded $406.8 million in damages, representing three times the $135.6 million awarded by a jury in April 2025. The tripling of damages was required under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment. McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying the company in 2015.

CVS Health has announced plans to appeal the judgment. The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed,"" CVS said in a statement.

The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the healthcare industry in ensuring compliance with complex regulatory requirements. It also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent and detect fraudulent activities.

2025 marks 15 years since the National Intrepid Center of Excellence (NICoE) opened its doors and began transforming the lives of service members impacted by traumatic brain injury (TBI). Since the first patient was seen on Oct. 4, 2010, NICoE has led the Military Health System in advancing care, research and education for TBI and associated conditions.

NICoE was founded to address an emerging need for specialized care for service members suffering from TBI and psychological health concerns through delivery of comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatment. With a mission centered on the return of warfighters to active duty and the improvement of quality of life for those affected by the invisible wounds of war, NICoE also contributes to the broader military medical community through professional education, telehealth, and groundbreaking research.

“Over the past 15 years, what started as the NICoE offering an innovative interdisciplinary model of TBI care has expanded into the entire Defense Intrepid Network, which provides state-of-the-art TBI care at 13 sites to thousands of service members each year,” said U.S. Army Col. (Dr.) Shannon C Ford, NICoE director. “It’s a testament to the commitment of all of our supporters that we are able to continue treating these very complicated invisible wounds.”

To commemorate the anniversary, NICoE staff gathered for a celebratory group photo—a tribute to the team of clinicians, therapists, researchers and support personnel who have shaped the center’s success. An official anniversary event will take place on Sept. 8, 2025, welcoming a broader audience to reflect achievements, share knowledge and look toward the future of TBI care.

“I look forward to continuing to build on the excellence and compassion that are the signatures of NICoE’s services to our nation’s warriors,” said Ford. “I am particularly excited by the potential of our cutting-edge research to continue to impact the complex issues relating to TBI and brain health.”",https://cdn.dvidshub.net/images/dvids_logo.svg,N,1.0,2025-07-08 16:56:22.392777

Dear Rusty: I’m a retired Navy veteran who is going to be turning 65 years old this year. My question is concerning mandatory Medicare sign-up requirements. Why do I have to sign up for Medicare coverage at 65 when I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I turn 67? My Social Security benefits will not pay for my mandatory Medicare because I can’t start collecting full Social Security benefits until I’m 67!

I currently pay for Tricare and utilize my local Veterans Administration medical facilities and referrals for my health care. With me turning 65 and having to wait until I’m 67 for my full Social Security benefits, it just seems unfair that I’ll have to pay out of pocket Medicare monthly expenses for two years! Is there any way to avoid this unfair penalty? Signed: Retired Navy Vet

Dear Retired Navy Vet:

First, I want to thank you for your military service to our country. Please know here at the AMAC Foundation we care a lot about our veterans and you may find the “For Veterans” section of our Foundation website interesting (www.amacfoundation.org).

Regarding your question, you should be aware that enrolling in Medicare is not mandatory, but there are consequences if you do not enroll when you become eligible (normally at age 65).

For one thing, if you are a retired veteran on military Tricare, you will lose your Tricare benefits if you don’t enroll in Medicare when you are eligible (Tricare requires you enroll in Medicare when eligible). And, since you are not yet collecting Social Security, you will be required to separately pay the Medicare Part B premium directly to Medicare (they will bill you when you enroll in Medicare).

Another potential consequence is that if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty for enrolling in Part B later.

Something else to keep in mind is there are two “parts” to Medicare - Part A (which is coverage for inpatient hospitalization services) and Part B, which is coverage for outpatient health care services (doctors, medical tests, etc.). Medicare Part A is free to you, but there is a premium for Medicare Part B ($185/month for 2025). Note you will need to pay a Part B premium as long as you are enrolled in Medicare Part B (it doesn’t go away after you are collecting Social Security, but it is taken from your Social Security payment). And there is no way for you to avoid the Part B premium after enrolling, and enrolling in Part B is necessary for you to continue your military TriCare-for-life benefits. Note Medicare Part A and Part B do not include prescription drug coverage, but your Tricare coverage usually does.

It’s important to note Medicare and Social Security are two independent senior programs with different eligibility rules. As you may know, you can collect early (reduced) Social Security at age 65 (and have your Medicare Part B premium deducted from your Social Security payment). But you would be collecting Social Security early and, in addition to a reduced benefit, you would also be subject to Social Security’s annual earnings test if you are still working. The Social Security earnings test limits how much you can earn before some of your Social Security benefits are taken away (if you exceed the earning limit before your full retirement age).

So, is it unfair you must pay for Medicare Part B before you are collecting Social Security? Well, I think not, because the two programs are completely independent benefits (the Social Security Administration merely administers Medicare payments as a convenience). Remember your Medicare Part A is free, but you must pay a premium for Part B, and you must take both to retain your military TriCare-for-Life benefits. You can visit this site to see how to pay your Medicare premiums until it is later deducted from your Social Security payment: www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/pay-premiums/online-bill-pay.

Once again, thank you for your service to our country.

NEW YORK — A federal judge ordered CVS Health’s Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages, in a whistleblower lawsuit claiming it fraudulently billed the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.

In a Monday evening order, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018.

McMahon also awarded $406.8 million of damages, representing three times the $135.6 million that a jury awarded on April 29.

The tripling was required under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

CVS plans to appeal the judgment. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager bought Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare has asked McMahon to throw out the case or grant a new trial.

“This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,” CVS said in a statement on Tuesday. “There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed.”

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Uri Bassan, a former Omnicare pharmacist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined by the federal government in 2019.

Lawsuits Alleged Improper Billing

They said Omnicare improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for prescriptions for tens of thousands of patients in assisted-living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.

Omnicare allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

McMahon rejected CVS’ argument that a $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.

“This was a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct,” the judge wrote.

McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying that company. CVS itself did not submit any claims.

The case is U.S. ex rel Bassan v. Omnicare Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-04179.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.","The $949 million legal judgment against CVS Health for its subsidiary Omnicare's fraudulent prescription practices marks a seismic moment for the healthcare sector. This ruling, which could ultimately cost CVS over $400 million in penalties and treble damages, exposes systemic governance failures and compliance risks that investors must now factor into their valuation of healthcare giants. For CVS, the verdict is not just a liability on its balance sheet—it's a stark warning about the consequences of merging under regulatory scrutiny and failing to address legacy liabilities.

The Legal Judgment: A Blueprint for Corporate Accountability

In April 2025, a federal jury found Omnicare liable for dispensing medications to elderly patients in long-term care facilities without valid prescriptions, resulting in over 3 million false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The damages of $135.6 million could triple under the False Claims Act (FCA), while penalties of up to $28,619 per claim could push total costs toward $949 million. Critically, the jury held CVS liable as the parent company for “causing” these violations by failing to address compliance gaps it knew about for years.

CVS's defense—that state laws permitted the practices and that it lacked direct control—was rejected. The court emphasized that as a holding company, CVS was obligated to enforce compliance under a 2016 Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), which required oversight of Omnicare's operations. This ruling underscores a seismic shift: parent companies can no longer shield themselves from subsidiary misconduct under federal programs.

Regulatory Gaps and Governance Failures

The case reveals two critical governance flaws at CVS:

1. Lax Oversight Post-Acquisition: CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015, but internal audits and compliance reviews from 2016–2018 identified systemic issues, including “roll-over” prescriptions (assigning new prescription numbers to expired ones). Despite these findings, CVS did not mandate corrective actions, violating its CIA obligations.

2. Strategic Ambiguity: In 2022, CVS briefly explored selling Omnicare, recognizing its non-strategic value, but reversed course in 2023. This indecision suggests a lack of clarity about Omnicare's risks versus rewards—a red flag for investors in a sector where regulatory missteps can metastasize.

The Omnicare case also highlights broader industry risks. The jury's focus on “speaker programs” and kickbacks (echoed in a parallel Gilead Sciences settlement) signals that the DOJ is targeting financial incentives influencing prescribing practices—a trend that could expose other healthcare firms to similar liabilities.

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations

The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger. CVS faces:

- Penalties and Litigation Costs: Beyond the $949 million estimate, ongoing appeals and settlements could drain cash reserves.

- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.

- Future Liabilities: Other subsidiaries or acquisitions may harbor similar risks, creating a “liability time bomb” for investors.

For investors, this demands a reevaluation of CVS's valuation multiples. The company trades at a P/E ratio of 12.5x, slightly above peers like UnitedHealth (11.8x) and Humana (14.2x). However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.

Investment Implications: Scrutinize Balance Sheet Resilience

Investors must ask two questions:

1. Can CVS absorb this hit without diluting shareholder value? Its $13 billion cash balance and $5 billion in annual free cash flow may cushion the blow, but sustained legal costs could strain its dividend (currently yielding 1.8%).

2. Is management accountable? CEO Karen S. Lynch has emphasized “operational discipline,” but the Omnicare verdict suggests governance gaps persist.

Actionable advice:

- Underweight CVS until management demonstrates a clear plan to address compliance risks and legacy liabilities.

- Compare to peers: Firms like AmerisourceBergen (ABC) or Cardinal Health (CAH), which face fewer regulatory headwinds, may offer safer exposure to healthcare distribution.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.

Conclusion: A New Era of Accountability

The Omnicare judgment is a watershed moment for healthcare giants. It signals that regulators and juries will hold parent companies directly responsible for subsidiary misconduct—a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences. Investors must now treat corporate governance and compliance rigor as core valuation metrics, not afterthoughts. For CVS, the path to recovery hinges on transparency, proactive risk management, and a willingness to divest businesses with unsustainable liabilities. Until then, the stock remains a cautionary tale of how governance failures can unravel even the largest healthcare empires.

Final note: This case is not isolated. Investors should pressure all healthcare firms to disclose compliance frameworks and legacy risks, lest they face similar reckoning.",,N,0.0,2025-07-08 16:56:45.887129

Dr. Nabih Alem made such an impression during his two decades of service at the U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory as the subject matter expert on whole-body vibration and repetitive jolt. Vibration and jolt are experienced almost constantly by rotary-wing aviators in flight and lead to debilitating injuries over the long term.

Two decades later, to honor the legacy Alem established, USAARL officially named Building 6905 as “Dr. Nabih M. Alem Operational Research Center” in a ceremony hosted by Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi, commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and the Defense Health Agency for Research and Development. The building has been referred to as “Alem Hall” unofficially for years.

Alem had over 40 years of experience as a research engineer and scientist, 20 of those years he spent at USAARL. Although only the last half of his career was spent at USAARL, his legacy will live on for a lifetime.

Lodi noted that naming the building was a great way to honor the past by celebrating “an individual who dedicated an entire career to make a lasting impact upon our force.”

“Dr. Alem contributed significantly to USAARL’s prominence through his research and expertise as a biomedical engineer,” Lodi continued. “He was the laboratory’s subject matter expert in the military operational biomechanics of head-supported mass and body vibration and jolt. Protecting the health and well-being of helicopter occupants was his focus.”

Alem Hall houses the USAARL human vibration research suite that includes the multi-axis ride simulator, one of Alem’s primary research platforms. Dr. Khalid Barazanji, who now leads vibration and jolt research projects, remembers his early career with Alem as a mentor. “Dr. Alem was passionate about the mission,” Barazanji recalls. “He was a perfectionist who had a great heart for everyone. I used to spend days discussing the best analytic method with him.”

Dr. Barclay Butler, Deputy Commissioner for Operations and Chief Operating Officer in the Office of Operations, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was a graduate student with Alem at the University of Michigan. Butler and Alem also worked together at USAARL for almost a decade. “Dr. Alem was the consummate scientist, researcher, engineer and mentor,” said Butler. “He is responsible for saving the lives and preventing injuries of countless numbers of servicemembers through the work he has done.”

A large portion of Alem Hall is also dedicated to USAARL's airworthiness certification and enroute care research programs, which ensure the safety and efficacy of medical equipment used in MEDEVAC.

Alem was born in Beirut, Lebanon, and immigrated to the United States in his early twenties. He earned his doctoral degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan in 1974. Alem then worked at the Highway Safety Research Institute at the University of Michigan, where he authored multiple seminal publications on biomechanics of human injury and tolerance, occupant crash protection, and dynamic impact testing.

Alem began working at the USAARL in 1986. For the next 20 years, he conducted critical and novel research, investigating head-supported mass, body armor, ballistic protection, mine blast evaluation, helicopter restraints and airbags, injury assessments in crashes, and human response to whole-body vibration and repeated shocks in Army vehicles. As a master programmer, he developed computational algorithms integrated into Army-wide software tools for assessing health hazards, survivability and injury.

Alem passed away in 2006, leaving behind a legacy as a renowned subject matter expert on the biomechanical and physiological effects of mechanical shock on humans. He authored over sixty research publications that are still referenced today.

“Dr. Alem was a lifelong theoretical and applied engineer, a collaborator, a researcher, an educator, and a mentor,” said Dr. Carol Chancey, director of the Injury and Biomechanics Protection Group at USAARL.

Chancey said current researchers recall that working with Alem challenged them to think about complex engineering and research questions and that he made them better at their jobs. “I think many of us can say that…” Chancey continued, “…today, Dr. Alem’s contribution and legacy to USAARL, MRDC and the world cannot be overstated, and it will be recognized, reverenced and applied for decades to come as servicemember injuries are prevented and lives are saved.”

TRICARE is a complex insurance plan that can be difficult to navigate without assistance. TRICARE offers a lifeline to millions of military families. However, the major concern is whether it includes coverage for mental health treatments like Spravato.

Spravato is the most trusted treatment nowadays because of exceptionally fast results and the fewest side effects.

This blog will help you clear the fog and break down your coverage options. This ultimate guide will walk you through everything you need to know about TRICARE. Steps to approval and how Neuroglow helps you every step of the way.

What is TRICARE?

TRICARE is a health insurance programme for the U.S. Department of Defence. It provides medical, mental health, and pharmacy benefits to active duty service members up to the age of 64 years. These members include National Guard and Reserve members, military retirees, and their families.

It offers coverage all over the world by combining a network of civilian providers with military clinics and hospitals. It offers a variety of plans, each tailored to meet distinct eligibility categories and requirements under the Defence Health Agency’s (DHA) jurisdiction.

Under stringent medical standards, TRICARE guarantees comprehensive care for specialised treatments like Spravato.

Does TRICARE cover Spravato?

Yes, TRICARE covers Spravato, but with some conditions. It covers mental health inpatient and outpatient care. Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or major depressive disorder (MDD) are treated with it.

While it does cover Spravato for eligible patients, they must meet specific medical criteria to achieve this coverage. It is also necessary that they go through a prior authorisation process.

These coverage approvals are dependent on documentation of prior treatment failures, psychiatric evaluations, and the use of Spravato in a certified facility, like Neuroglow. Coverage is available under the following TRICARE plans:

TRICARE Plan Spravato Coverage Referral Needed Prior Authorization Cost-Sharing Eligibility TRICARE Prime Yes. Covered if the criteria are met Yes Required Low copay with an in-network provider Active duty members, families, and some retirees TRICARE Select Yes. Covered if the criteria are met No Required Deductible and moderate cost-share Retirees, families, non-active duty beneficiaries TRICARE Reserve Select Yes. Coverage is available with authorization No Required Plan deductible and cost-share Selected Reserve members and their families TRICARE Retired Reserve Yes. Coverage is available if the criteria are met No Required Higher cost-share and monthly premium Retired Reserve under age 60 and eligible family TRICARE for Life Yes. As a secondary to Medicare Part B No Required (if Medicare requires) Medicare covers primary, TFL secondary Retired service members age 65+ with Medicare A & B

TRICARE requirements for Spravato coverage approval

TRICARE has special requirements and coverage plans for the Spravato coverage approval. Coverage is not an automatic process. The patient must demonstrate medical necessity through well-documented clinical records.

Understanding and preparing the necessary documentation in advance is key to avoiding delays and ensuring a smoother approval process.

The details of these requirements are given as follows:

Requirement Details Diagnosis Confirmation Documented diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) or MDD with suicidal ideation. Failed Treatment History Proof of a failed response to at least two oral antidepressants from different drug classes. Current Antidepressant Use The need for the name, dosage, and start date of the oral antidepressant to be used alongside Spravato. Age Verification Patient must be 18 or older; confirm via ID or medical record. REMS Certification Confirmation that both the provider and facility are registered in the Spravato REMS programme. Prescribing Provider Info It must include the provider’s name, credentials, NPI, and clinic contact information. Treatment Plan Overview The outline of the proposed dosing schedule (e.g., induction and maintenance phases). Monitoring Commitment Attestation that the patient will be monitored for 2 hours post-dose as required by REMS. Letter of Medical Necessity It is optional but recommended. If coverage is complex or denied, it must include the clinical rationale.

What does TRICARE cover for Spravato?

TRICARE gives full-fledged coverage for the Spravato treatment. These benefits help people to get the Spravato therapy without any financial burdens.

However, the beneficiaries may still be responsible for certain out-of-pocket expenses like copays or cost-shares based on their specific TRICARE plan. Factors like the deductible status and whether the provider is in-network affects the final costs. These coverage benefits are mentioned as:

Step-by-step guide for Spravato treatment with TRICARE

Spravato treatment under TRICARE is not a lengthy procedure, but without guidance, it can be complicated. Certified clinics across the country can assist you in navigating coverage and treatment approval efficiently.

Below is a simple step-by-step breakdown to help you understand what to expect.

Contact a REMS-certified clinic for an insurance benefits check

Schedule a psychiatric evaluation to assess eligibility for Spravato.

Have the clinic submit prior authorization to TRICARE with the required documentation

Receive approval and coordinate your treatment start date.

Begin Spravato sessions under supervision, with 2-hour post-dose monitoring at the clinic

Spravato costs with the TRICARE insurance.

TRICARE is known to typically follow the CMS billing guidelines for Spravato administration. The whole cost includes the medication, observation, and provider services. Most beneficiaries only pay copays or cost shares. These advantages vary by plan and whether your clinic is in-network.

In order to reduce out-of-pocket expenses, TRICARE also establishes payment rates that correspond with Medicare’s permitted charges. Some support programmes offer eligible commercially insured patients the medication at approximately $10 per treatment.

But these benefits are not available to TRICARE (a federal plan) enrollees.

Spravato costs without TRICARE insurance.

The cost of Spravato treatment without TRICARE or any insurance coverage can be substantial. The cost can vary based on the phase of treatment and dosage schedule. These figures are averages and may vary based on clinic location, provider fees, and other facility-specific factors.

Treatment Phase Frequency Estimated Monthly Cost Induction (Month 1) 2 treatments per week $5,600 – $8,100 Month 2 1 treatment per week $2,800 – $4,200 Maintenance (Ongoing) Weekly or biweekly $1,400 – $4,200

Yes, TRICARE covers Spravato for eligible patients who meet specific clinical criteria. It includes a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression, failure of at least two oral antidepressants, and administration at a REMS-certified facility.

How difficult is it to get TRICARE to approve initial and maintenance Spravato sessions?

Patients and providers often find the approval process to be complex and time-consuming. Success often depends on having thorough documentation and working with experienced providers who understand the insurance process.

What documentation is required for TRICARE authorization?

TRICARE requires documentation that includes proof of a diagnosis of treatment-resistant depression, evidence of failed responses to at least two oral antidepressants, concurrent use of an oral antidepressant, confirmation that the patient is over 18, and that treatment will occur at a REMS-certified clinic.

Will TRICARE cover observation and administrative fees?

Yes, TRICARE generally not only covers the Spravato medication itself but also the required two-hour post-administration monitoring and associated provider and facility fees.

Can private clinics coordinate Spravato treatments with TRICARE?

Yes, many private clinics accept TRICARE and handle the entire coordination process, from verifying eligibility and submitting prior authorizations to billing and follow-up scheduling.

Since January, MOAA has provided direct assistance to our members, other beneficiaries, and medical providers who contacted us regarding access challenges and other transition-related problems. More recently, we have escalated issues related to inaccurate reports of other health insurance (OHI) that prevent claims from processing properly, copay calculations, and claims being improperly processed as non-network.

MOAA meets regularly with the managed care support contractors – TriWest and Humana Military – as well as new leadership at the Defense Health Agency (DHA) to address the numerous problems the T-5 transition has created for beneficiaries and providers. At MOAA’s urging, TRICARE issued policy waivers to facilitate access to care as the contractors worked through systemic problems and continued to build a functional network in the West Region.

Some — but not all — TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for weight management.
But as Wegovy, insurance plans typically only cover it for weight loss.
How to get approved for Wegovy If your TRICARE healthcare plan does not initially cover Wegovy, you still have a few options for getting approved.
If TRICARE will not cover Wegovy for you, consider enrolling in a clinical trial for Wegovy.","Approximately 4 in 10 U.S. adults have obesity. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes, but there are also drug treatments like Wegovy (semaglutide), an injectable GLP-1 medication that is FDA-approved for chronic weight management due to its effectiveness in lowering blood sugar and decreasing appetite.

Like most brand-name prescription drugs, Wegovy isn’t cheap. Many patients wonder if health insurance will help offset their out-of-pocket costs. There’s no definitive answer because insurance coverage depends on your specific health plan. Here’s what you should know about Wegovy coverage if you have a policy from TRICARE, the U.S. Department of Defense’s healthcare program for active duty and retiree service members, some National Guard and Reserve members, and their eligible family members.

Does TRICARE cover Wegovy?

Some — but not all — TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for weight management. According to the TRICARE website, coverage depends on whether your reason for taking Wegovy meets certain criteria and if you have a prescription from a licensed medical provider. TRICARE coverage of Wegovy typically requires prior authorization unless you are also taking other medications for diabetes management.

Reason for taking Wegovy

With the same active ingredient as Ozempic – semaglutide – Wegovy effectively lowers blood sugar. But as Wegovy, insurance plans typically only cover it for weight loss. This brand-name form of semaglutide is not approved for treating diabetes.

However, semaglutide injections, such as Ozempic, are FDA-approved for blood sugar control in Type 2 diabetes. TRICARE is much more likely to cover Ozempic for a person with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, though coverage still depends on the plan.

Getting a prescription from a licensed provider

TRICARE coverage for Wegovy also requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider.

Michelle Lin, DO, a board-certified doctor of osteopathy at My Family Doc in Las Vegas, Nevada, describes her approach to prescribing obesity drugs: “If the patient is overweight to any degree with failure of diet and exercise, or has the inability to exercise plus metabolic disease, inflammatory musculoskeletal flares, and pain related to carrying more weight, I would consider prescribing Wegovy.”

Prior authorization

Finally, TRICARE requires your healthcare provider to complete a prior authorization form for Wegovy. Prior authorization is a process intended to determine a drug’s medical necessity. In the form, your provider must provide reasoning for why Wegovy is necessary. If TRICARE approves the prior authorization, your Wegovy will be covered. If not, you may need to pay for Wegovy out of pocket.

According to the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), the 2024 TRICARE prior authorization requirements stated that adult patients must meet the following criteria:

Have a body mass index (BMI) of >30 or a BMI of at least 27 with weight-related risk factors such as high blood pressure or sleep apnea

Have attempted lifestyle changes, including a reduced-calorie diet, for at least 6 months and still failed to achieve the desired weight loss

Have tried (or are contraindicated to try) another prescription weight loss drug. (Requiring patients to try a lower-cost drug before an expensive brand-name medication is known as step therapy.)

Be committed to lifestyle changes, including a reduced-calorie diet, while on Wegovy

Bottom line: Some TRICARE plans cover Wegovy for eligible enrollees, but there are strict criteria for getting insurance coverage for this particular drug.

How to get approved for Wegovy

If your TRICARE healthcare plan does not initially cover Wegovy, you still have a few options for getting approved.

Send an appeal letter to TRICARE. You can talk to your healthcare provider about ways to state that the drug is medically necessary. Novo Nordisk offers a sample letter that some healthcare providers use as a template. Even if your provider offers to write an appeal letter, you might need to submit the letter to TRICARE yourself.

Enroll in a clinical trial. If TRICARE will not cover Wegovy for you, consider enrolling in a clinical trial for Wegovy. If you qualify for a plan currently enrolling trial participants, you can get Wegovy for free or at a steeply discounted price.

Switch to a different weight loss drug. Saxenda and Zepbound are two Wegovy alternatives that might be covered by insurance. Other GLP-1s like Ozempic and Mounjaro are sometimes prescribed off-label to insurance, though off-label prescriptions are unlikely to be covered by insurance.

How much does Wegovy cost?

Wegovy is a costly weight loss medication. The average retail cost is $1,844 per four injection pen, which is a one-month supply. For people with insurance coverage, the out-of-pocket copay for Wegovy varies by plan. According to MOAA, TRICARE beneficiaries paid about $38 for a 90-day Wegovy supply via home delivery in 2024.

How to check whether your TRICARE plan covers Wegovy

You can check your insurance coverage with this web tool from Novo Nordisk, Wegovy’s manufacturer. You can also use the TRICARE formulary search tool to view the TRICARE formulary (list of covered drugs).

That said, the best way to get a definitive answer about drug coverage is to contact your TRICARE representative. In most cases, you can call the number on the back of your insurance card or prescription card.

HARTFORD, CT — A financial consulting firm with a prominent Hartford office has paid back hundreds of thousands of dollars in connection with overbilling allegations against the military.

David X. Sullivan, U.S. attorney for Connecticut, said Monday that Mercer LLC, a consulting company with an office in Hartford, entered into a civil settlement agreement.

Sullivan said Mercury paid more than $450,000 to resolve allegations it overbilled the Defense Health Agency for work performed by certain employees and subcontractors.

According to Sullivane, clients were billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels permitted.

The Defense Health Agency manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for service members and their families.

Before developing and implementing DHA’s managed care support and pharmacy services contracts, DHA sought subject matter expertise from outside the Department of Defense to ensure that beneficiaries receive high-quality care, Sullivan said.

Specifically, DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support services from vendors.

In approximately April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a ""blanket purchase agreement"" for HPIS services.

DHA also awarded a contract to Mercer.

Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs.

This included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, as well as the associated hourly billing rate, for personnel working under the contract.

Each month, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expended under the BPA at hourly billing rates commensurate with the employees’ (or subcontractor employees’) designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with those labor categories, according to Sullivan.

The government contends that, from May 7, 2020, through Aug. 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for the efforts of 11 employees working under the contract at labor rates for which those employees did not have the requisite educational background or experience levels.

Mercer investigated and disclosed to the government these incorrect contract billings.",https://patch.com/img/cdn20/shutterstock/25990360/20250708/070525/styles/patch_image/public/shutterstock-268850816-1___08070425179.jpg,N,0.0,2025-07-08 09:56:40.506773

During the ceremony Col. Michael D. Ronn relinquished command to Col. William F. Bimson.

The presiding official of the ceremony was Brig. Gen. Deydre Teyhen, commanding general, Medical Readiness Command, Pacific, and director, Defense Health Network Indo-Pacific.

“Tripler to me is more than a hospital, it is a symbol of military medicine’s might across the Indo-Pacific, and today it is a celebration of continuity, growth, and leadership,” Teyhen said. “President Dwight D. Eisenhower once said, ‘History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak and the timid’ and Tripler’s legacy is entrusted to the strong and the bold and that is what we celebrate today,” said Teyhen. “Change of Command Ceremonies are always significant. It reminds us that people may come and go, but the mission endures. In that continuity defines strength. But today is more than a transition of authority, it is a celebration of the people who have shaped this Ohana through grit, compassion, and vision. Mike, thank you for your steady, humble and people-focused leadership you’ve brought to Tripler the last few years.”

Ronn, who assumed command of Tripler Army Medical Center July 7, 2023, was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious service while serving as the commander and director, Tripler Army Medical Center. According to his award citation, Ronn epitomized exceptional leadership and service, strengthened the Military Health System, and enhanced the readiness of the joint force. He has been assigned to serve as the Training and Exercises (J7) Deputy Surgeon at U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Hawaii.

Ronn offered words of encouragement to incoming commander Bimson. “Will, you are taking command of an amazing organization with an extraordinary team and a critical, no-fail mission. I am excited for where you will take them, and I know they will give you everything they have just as they’ve done for our patients and our community these past two years that I have been here.”

As the 59th commander of Tripler Army Medical Center, Bimson’s first act in command was the ceremonial passing of the colors to Command Sgt. Maj. Omar J. Bond, the medical center’s most senior enlisted advisor.

“To the entire Tripler Ohana, thank you for your commitment to our patients, our partners, and our mission. In the short week that I’ve been here, it has been extraordinary to see your love for each other and your obvious dedication to our mission. I am excited to meet each of you and continue the extraordinary culture that you all have fostered,” Bimson said.

Bimson previously served as command surgeon and U.S. Army Central (USARCENT), Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. He attended Truman State University, earning a Bachelor’s in Science degree in chemistry, and received his commission through the Army ROTC program in 1997. He earned his Doctor of Osteopathy degree in 2011 from A.T. Still University of the Health Sciences, formerly Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, using the Army Health Professions Scholarship Program. He completed his Internal Medicine residency in 2004 and his Cardiology Fellowship in 2007 at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. He graduated from the U.S. Army War College with a master’s degree in strategic studies. He has served in various hospital leadership roles, from clinic chief to officer in charge to deputy commander for clinical services, and in several operations medicine positions including surgeon for the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade, the 82nd Airborne Division, and the XVIII Airborne Corps, as well as chief of clinical operations and professional services for the 44th Medical Brigade. He commanded the 531st Hospital Center at Fort Campbell.

Bimson’s awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal with five oak leaf clusters, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Army Commendation Medal with three oak leaf clusters, the Army Achievement Medal with one oak leaf cluster, Armed Forces Service Medal, Combat Medical Badge, Parachutist Badge, Air Assault Badge, and the Ranger Tab. He is also a member of the Order of Military Medical Merit (O2M3).

While many grieve the loss of their loved ones, there is some good news for those in need of emergency medication.

The Defense Health Agency announced Monday that TRICARE beneficiaries in 21 Texas counties can receive emergency prescription refills through July 17 in flood-impacted regions.

How to obtain emergency refills:

1. Locate a TRICARE retail network

Beneficiaries can locate network pharmacies by calling Express Scripts at 1-877-363-1303 or using the network pharmacy locator tool. The agency suggests visiting the pharmacy where the prescription was originally filled when possible, noting that prescriptions filled by retail chains may be filled at other stores within that chain.

If available, beneficiaries can also ask their prescribing clinician to call in a new prescription to any network pharmacy.

2. Bring prescription bottles to your local TRICARE retail network

TRICARE beneficiaries should bring their prescription bottles to any TRICARE retail network pharmacy. For those whose bottles are unavailable or have damaged or missing labels, the agency recommends contacting Express Scripts, Inc., or their retail network pharmacy for assistance.

3. Obtain urgent care if possible

The Defense Health Agency reminded beneficiaries that TRICARE members, except active-duty service members, may receive urgent care from any TRICARE-authorized urgent care center or provider without requiring a referral. This provision ""allows beneficiaries to seek nonemergency care for illnesses or injuries if their primary care provider is unavailable because of emergencies.""

The agency emphasized that ""any TRICARE beneficiary who reasonably believes they have an emergency should always call 911 or, go to the nearest emergency room.""

Beneficiaries are encouraged to check Express Scripts' Weather Notices page for ongoing updates regarding the emergency provisions.

The BPA included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, and associated hourly billing rate, for the personnel working under the BPA.
This investigation was conducted by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service with assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency Operations Investigative Support Division.","David X. Sullivan, United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, today announced that MERCER (US), LLC, a consulting company with an office in Hartford, has entered into a civil settlement agreement and paid more than $450,000 to resolve allegations that it overbilled the Defense Health Agency for work performed by certain employees and subcontractors billed at rates higher than their educational backgrounds or experience levels permitted.

The Defense Health Agency (“DHA”) manages TRICARE’s health benefits program for servicemembers and their families. Prior to developing and implementing DHA’s supporting managed care support and pharmacy services contracts, DHA sought subject matter expertise from outside of the Department of Defense to ensure beneficiaries receive high quality care. Specifically, DHA competitively sought offers for Health Plan Innovative Support (“HPIS”) services from vendors under the General Services Administration’s (“GSA”) Professional Services Schedule (“PSS”).

In approximately April 2020, DHA and Mercer entered into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (“BPA”) for HPIS services. DHA also awarded HPIS Task 1 to Mercer. Under this task order, Mercer would provide qualified personnel with subject matter expertise relevant to the design of TRICARE programs. The BPA included labor categories that identified the education and experience qualifications, and associated hourly billing rate, for the personnel working under the BPA. Each month, Mercer invoiced DHA for labor expended under the BPA at hourly billing rates commensurate to the employees’ (or subcontractor employees’) designated labor categories and the education and experience associated with those labor categories.

The government contends that, from May 7, 2020, through August 2, 2023, Mercer billed DHA for the efforts of 11 employees working under the BPA at labor rates for which those employees did not have the requisite educational background or experience levels. Mercer investigated and disclosed to the government these incorrect contract billings. To resolve claims arising under the Contract Disputes Act and the common law theories of breach of contract, payment by mistake, and unjust enrichment, Mercer paid the government $456,796.50.

This investigation was conducted by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service with assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency Operations Investigative Support Division.

I’m trying to decide between enlisting in the Air Force Reserves now or waiting to apply to OTS as a civilian reservist. My interest is primarily benefit-driven. Not aiming for a 20-year military career.

Background: • 26 year old, single male (27 this fall)

• BS in telecommunications (non-STEM, 3.3 GPA, some volunteer experience) • Working in tech, earning ~$80K now with potential to hit $150K+ (currently at 5 yrs experience) • Plan to do 6 years in the Reserves (not a full career) • Want to pursue a master’s in electrical/ computer engineering to open future doors (~$20K cost)

My Goals: 1. Use the VA loan to buy to house hack for about ~10 years or so and eventually get my dream house

2. Get a TS/SCI clearance to open up higher-paying defense jobs for long-term job security (tech market is sort of trash still, but I already have 5 years of experience so would like to keep the momentum going in the civilian world) 3. Access TRICARE Reserve Select 4. Use Tuition Assistance to pay for grad school

Options: • Enlist now and possibly submit an OTS packet later → benefits start sooner (school paid for, go on active orders to get access to VA loan quicker, clearance, etc… )

• Wait for OTS → stronger officer app over time, but delay access to VA loan, clearance, TRICARE, (would have to start paying for masters out of pocket or put it on hold until I got in (if that even happens, given how competitive it is for civilians)) (could be 1-3 yrs waiting and I’ll be close to 30 at that point)

Anyone been in a similar spot? Is enlisting smart if I mainly want benefits, not a long-term military career? I’ve heard people say I’ll regret enlisting if I have a degree, but to kickstart benefits immediately it seems like the only way. Appreciate any advice.",,N,0.0,2025-07-07 17:56:15.492465

We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community.
“Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff.
Prior to the ceremony, Lodi presented Hoefer with a Legion of Merit medal for his accomplishments during his service at USAARL.","The Fort Rucker community welcomed Col. Thomas A. Summers as U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory commander, and bid farewell to outgoing commander, Col. Matthew H. Hoefer, during a Change of Command ceremony at the U.S. Army Aviation Museum June 25, 2025. Maj. Gen. Paula C. Lodi, U.S. Army Medical Research & Development Command and Defense Health Agency Director for Research and Development commander, welcomed attendees and thanked family members for their support. “What USAARL does is truly important, groundbreaking and impressive,” Lodi said. “The audience in attendance is a testament to that.” Lodi recognized senior leaders not only from across the Aviation Center of Excellence and Fort Rucker, but also Army Futures Command, other MRDC laboratories, and the surrounding community. She said Summers brings a wealth of medical expertise to USAARL and described him as a transformational leader. “He is known for his rare combination of strengths in strategic planning and operations,” Lodi said. “In addition to being a highly accomplished, highly intelligent, and extremely capable leader, Tom has an innate ability to make all things fun, which is why he is a welcome addition to every assignment.” Summers arrives at USAARL from his most recent duty position as the Assistant Chief of Staff, Support Operation, Medical Readiness Command East and Chief Medical Officer, Defense Health Network East. Among his previous assignments, he served as a Staff Pathologist, Hematopathologist, Pathology Residency Program Faculty, Director of Immunohistochemistry Section, and Director of the Murtha Cancer Center Biobank at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center; Brigade Surgeon, 210th Field Artillery Brigade, Camp Casey, ROK; Medical School Faculty, Uniformed Services University; Chief, Department of Pathology, Fort Belvoir Community Hospital; Command Surgeon and Senior Medical Officer, United States Army Cadet Command; and Chief Surgeon, Army Recovery Care Program, MEDCOM G-3/5/7.

Summers is a member of the College of American Pathologists International Accreditation Committee. Summers has been awarded multiple awards and decorations throughout his career plus the Expert Field Medical Badge, the Flight Surgeon Badge, and the Parachutist’s Badge. He welcomed and thanked attendees, family, soldiers, and those who participated in the Change of Command ceremony and made it possible. “Every day,” Summers said as he addressed the USAARL staff, “your research saves lives, improves readiness, and ensures our servicemembers have the best possible protection as they carry out their missions. As we look to the future, I am committed to building upon the strong foundation laid by those who came before me,” he said. “We will continue to foster a culture of scientific rigor, innovation, and teamwork. We will remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs of Army aviation and the broader medical community. Above all, we will never lose sight of our mission,” Summers concluded. Lodi praised Hoefer’s service to the Army and aeromedical research as he prepares to transition to his next assignment as the Medical Corps, Deputy Corps Chief, at Defense Health Headquarters, Falls Church, Va. “As commander, Matt not only led the team to advance USAARL’s mission,” Lodi said, “but also guided the organization through a period of significant transformation and change that accompanied MRDC’s alignment with the Defense Health Agency.” Lodi said Hoefer “is recognized for his calmness under pressure and his forward-thinking management style, as well as his ability to unite diverse teams. Your ability to drive progress will be an asset in your upcoming assignments” Lodi said. “This lab’s future is bright because of your focus on delivering whatever the DOD needs to make our warriors safer, more lethal and more capable on the battlefield,” Hoefer said in a farewell message to USAARL. “Keep innovating, keep looking for new ways to support our teammates, and keep up this great USAARL culture.” Hoefer asked the USAARL staff to stand for a moment during the ceremony. “Continue to fight for the opportunities that make Army aviation more lethal, accelerate us into autonomy and save American warriors,” Hoefer challenged the USAARL staff. “Your work has been essential for aviators over the past 60 years and I’m excited to see what you deliver for Army aviation in the future,” Hoefer said.

This elite designation places the hospital among an exclusive cadre of high-performing military treatment facilities (MTFs), becoming only the 4th MTF within the Defense Health Network-Europe and the 8th Navy MTF across the enterprise to achieve this level of cybersecurity maturity.

Earning an ML 4 designation requires expertly managed cybersecurity operations and processes. This means the organization has measured and controlled cybersecurity activities; its systems are data-driven with quantitative performance improvement objectives that are predictable and aligned to all Department of Defense and Defense Health Agency (DHA) guidance, as well as industry best practices.

The IMD team led a months-long, all-hands effort to prepare for the assessment, executing enhanced security protocols, comprehensive system hardening, user education, and remediation of vulnerabilities across the hospital’s digital ecosystem. Their work ensures that health information systems remain secure in the face of evolving cyber threats while maintaining seamless support to operational missions.

“This level of cybersecurity readiness doesn’t happen overnight,” said Lt. Willie Williams, the Information Management Department Head. “It’s the product of disciplined planning, enterprise collaboration, and an uncompromising standard of excellence in protecting our network and the mission it supports.”

The hospital’s strong cybersecurity posture not only protects patient data and medical systems, it directly enables warfighter readiness. By safeguarding the digital infrastructure that supports healthcare delivery, USNH Rota ensures continuity of care during real-world contingencies, keeping service members medically prepared to operate in any environment.
