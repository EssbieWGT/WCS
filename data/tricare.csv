“All military hospitals and clinics have transitioned to MHS GENESIS. We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions,” Navy Rear Adm. Tracy Farrill from the Defense Health Agency said in a Tricare news release.

The online change comes as the Defense Health Agency transitions from the Tricare Online patient portal to the MHS Genesis electronic health record. Embracing the MHS Genesis system “eliminates the need to maintain two systems and streamlines [electronic health record] management,” according to the news release.

Parents can view complete health data for children under 12 and limited health data for children ages 12–17, according to the news release. Providers will still have access to patients’ complete health records.

Service members and veterans who are planning to file a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs will not be affected by the decommissioning of the Tricare Online patient portal, as providers will still have access to patients’ complete health records, according to the news release.

After April 1, patients can request a physical copy of their health records from the records management office at their military hospital or clinic.

“Your medical history is a valuable resource for managing your health, and saving your records now ensures you have access if you need it,” Farrill said in the release.",https://www.ausa.org/themes/custom/ausa/favicon/favicon.ico,N,0.0,2025-03-24 10:56:17.711697

In conjunction with the Floral Association’s Homefront Judging, which takes place March 28-30, Emerald Keepers will be recognizing earth-friendly home fronts. Homes can receive both Floral Association ribbons and green Emerald Keepers ribbons.

Volunteers are still needed for earth-friendly home front judging. No experience or knowledge needed. Sign up online and include Emerald Keepers in the comment box.

Considerations to earn an earth-friendly green ribbon include:

Limited to no lawn. Grass is water and energy intensive and provides limited benefits to our local biodiversity. Home fronts should be no more than 25% grass.

Limited to no artificial grass. Fake grass should be avoided. Made out of plastic, it harms the soil, wildlife, and human health. The benefits from using less water with artificial grass are far outweighed by the environmental harm caused by this plastic ground cover. No more than 10% of a garden should be covered with artificial grass.

Majority native or low-water plants. Support bees, birds, and butterflies with low-maintenance native and drought-resistant plants that thrive in Coronado’s soil and climate.

Natural mulches covering soil. Mulches such as bark, rocks, sand, and decomposed granite retain moisture, limiting the need for watering. They also inhibit the growth of weeds and therefore the need for chemical weed killers.

Majority ground surface non-paved. Permeable, non-paved ground surfaces allow for water absorption into the soil rather than runoff. Patios are acceptable if there is permeable space between pavers.

Green ribbon home fronts must also meet the Coronado Flower Show requirements for obvious effort, good maintenance, and curb appeal.

Home fronts include the parkway strip between the sidewalk and the street. While the strip is city property, homeowners are responsible for its maintenance. This visible space presents another opportunity to expand your earth-friendly impact.

In 2024, 319 homes were recognized for their earth-friendly landscaping. The winner was 801 Country Club Lane; 931 J Avenue took second place; and 1001 E Avenue came in third place. The winners exhibited an attractive and thoughtful combination of drought-tolerant plants and permeable hardscape that extended to the parkway strip.

TriCARE Buyback programs can significantly enhance the benefits for military veterans transitioning to federal civilian jobs, allowing them to count military service towards their federal retirement.

Understanding how military benefits like TriCARE integrate with federal retirement systems such as FERS can open up valuable opportunities to boost your retirement income and healthcare coverage.

If you’re a military veteran transitioning to a federal civilian career, you may already know that your military service can impact your federal retirement benefits. What you may not realize is how integrating military benefits like TriCARE with federal retirement systems such as the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) can be a game-changer. A key opportunity in this transition is the TriCARE Buyback option, which allows you to count your years of military service toward your federal retirement. Understanding how this buyback option works, and how it fits into your overall retirement strategy, can help you maximize your benefits and secure a financially comfortable retirement.

What Is TriCARE Buyback and Why It Matters

The TriCARE Buyback option allows military veterans who become federal employees to “buy back” their years of military service so that those years count toward their federal retirement under FERS. This can significantly increase your pension benefits by allowing you to add your military service time to your civilian service years.

For instance, if you served 10 years in the military and then transition into a federal civilian job, buying back your military service could add those 10 years to your federal service time. This means you could potentially retire earlier or receive a higher pension payout. However, the buyback process isn’t automatic—it requires a financial investment upfront, and the cost depends on your base pay during your military service. While this can be a considerable expense, the long-term retirement benefits often outweigh the initial cost.

How TriCARE Fits Into Your Healthcare in Retirement

Military retirees who are eligible for TriCARE have a unique advantage when it comes to healthcare coverage. TriCARE can serve as a key component of your retirement healthcare, especially when integrated with the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program.

For many veterans, TriCARE covers much of their healthcare costs, but when you transition into a federal job, you become eligible for FEHB as well. At that point, you need to decide how to coordinate these two healthcare programs for maximum benefit. One option is to use TriCARE as your primary insurance and FEHB as secondary coverage, which can help lower your out-of-pocket costs by covering services that TriCARE may not fully cover.

The real advantage comes when you retire. Retired federal employees often rely on FEHB as their primary healthcare coverage, but military veterans have the option to keep using TriCARE, which can be a more cost-effective solution. By combining TriCARE with FEHB, you can ensure comprehensive coverage that meets all your healthcare needs in retirement while keeping costs manageable.

Navigating the FERS Retirement System with Military Service

If you’re a military veteran working under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), your military service can play a crucial role in boosting your retirement benefits. FERS is a three-part system that includes a civil service pension, Social Security, and the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). By buying back your military service, you can add your years of military service to your federal civilian service, increasing your overall pension.

The formula for calculating your FERS pension is based on your years of service, your “high-3” salary (the average of your highest three consecutive years of basic pay), and a multiplier. For most employees, this multiplier is 1%, but it increases to 1.1% if you retire after age 62 with at least 20 years of service. Buying back your military service adds those years to your total service, allowing you to reach this 20-year threshold sooner, which can substantially increase your pension.

However, it’s important to note that while buying back your military service enhances your FERS pension, it may affect your eligibility for other benefits, like military retirement pay. If you’re receiving military retirement pay, you may need to waive it in order to buy back your military service for FERS. This is a decision that should be carefully considered based on your individual financial situation.

Weighing the Cost of Military Service Buyback

One of the key questions veterans face when considering the TriCARE Buyback is whether the cost is worth the added retirement benefits. The cost of buying back your military service is based on a percentage of your base pay during your years of military service, plus interest if you delay the buyback for too long after joining the federal workforce.

While the upfront cost may seem daunting, it’s important to consider the long-term financial benefits. Buying back your military service can increase your pension, allowing for a more secure retirement. Additionally, it may enable you to retire earlier, giving you more years to enjoy your retirement. In many cases, the pension increase far outweighs the initial cost of the buyback, making it a worthwhile investment for those planning for a long retirement.

Combining TriCARE, FEHB, and Medicare

When it comes to retirement healthcare, veterans have a variety of options. Many choose to rely solely on TriCARE, but others may find that combining TriCARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program, and Medicare offers the most comprehensive coverage.

Once you turn 65, you’re eligible for Medicare, and at that point, TriCARE for Life kicks in as your Medicare supplement. By coordinating these three programs—Medicare, TriCARE, and FEHB—you can minimize out-of-pocket healthcare costs in retirement. Medicare will serve as your primary insurance, with TriCARE or FEHB picking up the remainder.

Choosing whether to enroll in FEHB in retirement or rely solely on TriCARE and Medicare depends on your individual healthcare needs and financial situation. Some retirees find that TriCARE and Medicare are sufficient, allowing them to save on FEHB premiums, while others prefer the additional coverage FEHB provides.

Boosting Retirement Income with the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)

In addition to your FERS pension and Social Security, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a key component of retirement planning for federal employees. The TSP operates like a 401(k) and provides a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. For veterans who buy back their military service, those additional years of service also increase the time you have to contribute to your TSP, giving you more time to grow your retirement savings.

The TSP offers several investment options, including stocks, bonds, and government securities, allowing you to tailor your investment strategy to your risk tolerance and retirement goals. As you approach retirement, it’s important to adjust your TSP contributions and investments to ensure that your savings will last throughout your retirement years.

The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Inflated its Revenue and Filed False Claims

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On March 11, 2025, Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military. On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

The National Transportation Safety Board recommended the assessments as a part of its ongoing investigation into the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore nearly a year ago.

This does not mean that the Coronado Bridge is an active collapse risk: Rather, it made the list because it was built prior to guidance established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).

Baltimore’s Key Bridge was almost 30 times above the acceptable risk threshold for critical or essential bridges established by AASHTO when it was struck by a containership on March 26, 2024 and subsequently collapsed.

Now, the NTSB is recommending that 68 bridges that were built prior to AASHTO guidance be assessed for potential vulnerability.

In 1991, AASHTO developed a vulnerability assessment calculation for all new bridges on the National Highway System. Construction of the Coronado Bridge began in 1967 and concluded in 1969. It is owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).

The TRICARE Online Patient Portal, or TOL, will be discontinued in favor of a new system, MHS Genesis.
Healthcare providers will still have access to patients’ full health records.
TRICARE has released instructions for downloading legacy health records.
“We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions.","New law for parking near intersections in effect

Pedestrian fatalities are on the rise, and a new law meant to improve safety is now in effect.

Known casually as the “Daylighting Law,” Assembly Bill 413 prohibits vehicles from parking within 20 feet of the approach of a crosswalk in California. For crosswalks with a curb extension (also known as a bulb out), parking within 15 feet is prohibited.

Although it went into effect in 2024, the law began with a grace period, in which municipalities could issue warnings, rather than citations. The law is now in full effect.

The law does not require that cities mark these 20-feet zones, and instead places the responsibility on driver to comply.

“In preparation for AB 413 taking effect,” said Kelli Maples, Coronado’s senior management analyst, “the city reviewed its streets last year for compliance and identified 13 locations where t-boxes, diagonal parking lines, blue zones, or conflicting markings were within the restricted areas. City staff subsequently removed the conflicting markings and signage in those locations.”

Maples said a review of traffic report found no recommendations related to pedestrian collisions caused by limited visibility, but that the city will continue to monitor reports and adjust intersection and street design if the city deems it necessary.

Curb extensions are another measure meant to enhance pedestrian safety. The city in 2023 installed them along Ocean Boulevard. The United States Department of Transportation reports that bulb-outs and other traffic-calming techniques decrease pedestrian collisions.

Violations of the daylighting law will yield a $65 fine, along with a $12.50 administrative fee.

Currently, 43 states have passed similar laws.

As the law does not require painted curbs, drivers must determine for themselves whether they are parked far enough from a crosswalk. The average car in the United States is 14.7 feet long, according to Cartelligent, so leaving a space of about one and a half car lengths before crosswalks without curb extensions is an easy metric for estimation.

TRICARE Online Patient Portal will decommission in April

The Department of Defense is shifting its online healthcare portal, and beneficiaries are encouraged to download their health records from the former system before it is decommissioned on April 1.

The TRICARE Online Patient Portal, or TOL, will be discontinued in favor of a new system, MHS Genesis. Beneficiaries can sign up for the new system here.

Healthcare providers will still have access to patients’ full health records. However, if patients would like their own copies, they must download them from TOL before April 1.

TRICARE has released instructions for downloading legacy health records. Read them here.

“All military hospitals and clinics have transitioned to MHS GENESIS,” said Rear Adm. Tracy Farrill, Principal Deputy, Assistant Director for Health Care Administration, and Military Health System EHR Functional Champion at the Defense Health Agency, in a statement. “We encourage you to take these important steps to save your personal health records before the TOL Patient Portal decommissions. Your medical history is a valuable resource for managing your health, and saving your records now ensures you have access if you need it.”",https://coronadotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Orange-Ave-crosswalk-2024-06-17.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-22 10:56:29.261845

Notable aspects of TRICARE’s drug rehabilitation services include inpatient and outpatient treatment services, drug detoxification, dual diagnosis treatment, and medication-assisted treatment (MAT).

TRICARE is available to active-duty service members, retirees, and their families. As a government-funded health insurance initiative, it operates differently from the underwriting of conventional private insurance plans, such as indemnity agreements. While private insurers evaluate risks based on age and health, TRICARE eligibility is solely based on military service status without considering individual risk factors. Funded through federal resources, TRICARE generally does not use reinsurance or involve endorsements, umbrella policies, or insurance adjusters, though it may seek subrogation stemming from third parties’ liability.

Insured active-duty service members typically do not incur costs for drug treatment programs. However, other insured beneficiaries may need to manage out-of-pocket costs, including co-payments, premiums, or specific deductibles. The fees, determined by an actuary, will vary according to your policy. To minimize claims expenses, seeking treatment from in-network providers is essential. Some services may require prior authorization before treatment can begin, and unanticipated peril may present risks of loss. Furthermore, TRICARE may have coverage exclusions, such as lavish rehabilitation facilities and new treatment plans.

To secure TRICARE drug rehab coverage for drug rehabilitation in Palm Desert, California, follow these basic steps. First, verify your TRICARE coverage. Next, obtain a referral from your primary care provider (PCP) or secure prior authorization documentation. After that, select a drug treatment center that accepts TRICARE, and ensure you meet all TRICARE’s eligibility requirements.

It’s essential to recognize that your TRICARE plan may involve cost-sharing, copayments, or deductibles, so be aware of your overall expenses before starting drug dependency rehab. You must keep diligent records by saving copies of all submitted documentation. Drug treatment centers that accept TRICARE, like CA Behavioral, can assist you in navigating the approval process. You have the legal right to appeal the decision if your coverage is denied. Additionally, you can present a claim settlement to reimburse expenses if you have already completed your rehab.",https://cabehavioral.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tricare-insurance.png,N,1.0,2025-03-22 11:56:34.860726

(NASDAQ: ZYXI) securities between March 13, 2023 to March 11, 2025 .

The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that Zynex, Inc. (ZYXI) Inflated its Revenue and Filed False Claims

According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that Zynex shipped products, including electrodes, in excess of need; (2) that, as a result of this practice, the Company inflated its revenue; (3) that the Company's practice of filing false claims drew scrutiny from insurers, including Tricare; and (4) that, as a result, it was reasonably likely that Zynex would face adverse consequences, including removal from insurer networks and penalties from the federal government.

On March 11, 2025 , Zynex reported its fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results, revealing a significant revenue ""shortfall"" in the quarter ""due to slower than normal payments from certain payers."" Zynex further revealed ""Tricare has temporarily suspended payments as they review prior claims."" Tricare is the health insurance program for the U.S. military. On this news, Zynex's stock price fell $3.59 per share, or 51.3%, to close at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025 .

What Now : You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Zynex, Inc. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 19, 2025 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here .

The Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) program is a total force program designed to support active duty service members who are struggling with alcohol or other substance use disorders. The program’s goal is to promote readiness, health, and wellness through the prevention and treatment of substance misuse and abuse.

ADAPT provides expert consultation to active duty service members and unit leaders to ensure those in need receive the right guidance and support. The program also provides education and treatment to individuals affected by substance misuse or abuse. By addressing these issues proactively ADAPT helps to maintain the overall health and well being of the Air Force.

Our resource guide from TriCareRehabs.com will highlight central features of this vital program and how to get help for yourself or a loved one serving.

A Guide to Substance Abuse Treatment and Prevention in the Military

The Air Force Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment (ADAPT) Program is a key resource to help service members address substance use issues while staying mission-ready. It’s important to remind patients to take safety measures for in-person visits, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure patient safety.

As part of the Air Force Medical Service, ADAPT provides education, prevention, and treatment for airmen struggling with alcohol or drug-related issues. Whether it’s due to stress, deployment or personal struggles ADAPT ensures those in need get the right support while balancing military responsibilities.

What is the purpose of the ADAPT Program?

The primary objective of the Air Force ADAPT Program is to promote health and readiness by preventing substance abuse and treating those who need it. It follows a structured process that focuses on early intervention, education, and rehabilitation. The program will:

Educate service members on the risks of substance use

Identify airmen with alcohol or drug-related issues

Provide counseling and rehabilitation services

Ensure mission capability is not impacted by substance abuse

Support service members in a substance-free lifestyle

Who is eligible for the ADAPT Program?

ADAPT is available to all active duty Air Force personnel. In some cases, dependents, retirees and civilian employees working for the Air Force may also be eligible for resources and referrals through military medical facilities. Commanders, supervisors or even peers can refer airmen if they notice signs of substance abuse. Self-referral is also encouraged so airmen can get help voluntarily without immediate disciplinary action.

How the ADAPT Program Works

The ADAPT Program follows a structured process to assess, treat, and support airmen with substance-related issues. Here’s how the process works:

1. Referral and Screening

ADAPT referrals can come from multiple sources including self-referrals, command directed referrals, medical referrals or incident related referrals (e.g. DUI incidents). Once referred an airman will undergo an initial screening by a behavioral health specialist. This screening will determine if the airman meets the criteria for substance misuse or abuse.

2. Comprehensive Assessment

After the initial screening a comprehensive assessment will be conducted to evaluate the severity of the substance use issue. This will involve interviews, standardized screening tools and medical evaluations to determine the best course of action.

3. Treatment Planning

Based on the assessment the ADAPT team will develop a personalized treatment plan. This may include:

Education on responsible alcohol use and drug awareness

Counseling sessions (individual or group therapy)

Outpatient treatment programs

Inpatient rehabilitation for severe cases

Aftercare and follow-up support

4. Rehabilitation and Monitoring

Airmen in treatment will receive ongoing counseling, support and education tailored to their individual needs. Regular check ins will ensure progress is being made and adjustments to the treatment plan are made as needed.

5. Completion and Aftercare

Once an airman completes the ADAPT program they may be eligible for aftercare services to ensure long-term success. Follow-ups and support groups may be available to help maintain sobriety and prevent relapse.

Abuse Prevention

Abuse prevention is a key component of the ADAPT program, focusing on educating service members about the risks of substance abuse and promoting healthy behaviors. The program offers a range of outreach and prevention services to raise awareness and prevent the onset of substance misuse. For those already affected ADAPT provides outpatient treatment tailored for active duty personnel and aftercare groups to support ongoing recovery.

In cases where a more intense intervention is needed, the program will facilitate referrals for medical detoxification and rehabilitation at local civilian hospitals. By addressing substance abuse through education and treatment ADAPT aims to mitigate the impact on individuals, families, and the broader military organization.

Mental Health Support

ADAPT is committed to providing mental health support to service members with substance use disorders. Licensed mental health professionals and certified substance abuse counselors will provide comprehensive evaluation and treatment services so each individual will get the care they need. ADAPT also provides consultation services to help service members and unit leaders manage mental health concerns.

By addressing these issues ADAPT will restore function and support service members to return to unrestricted duty or transition to civilian life as appropriate. This holistic approach ensures mental health and substance abuse issues are treated with the seriousness and respect they deserve and promotes overall well-being and readiness.

Overcoming the Stigma of Seeking Help

One of the biggest challenges with substance abuse in the military is the stigma of seeking help. Many airmen fear that admitting to a substance use issue will damage their careers or result in disciplinary action.

However, self-reporting to ADAPT is seen as a proactive and responsible step, not a career-ending decision. The program prioritizes treatment over punishment and wants to help airmen regain control of their lives while remaining valuable members of the Air Force.

Consequences of Substance Abuse in the Air Force

While the Air Force ADAPT Program is for airmen, it’s important to know that substance abuse can have severe consequences in the military. Depending on the severity of the issue and whether it impacts job performance or mission readiness consequences may include:

Loss of security clearance

Administrative action

Disciplinary measures under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)

Separation from the military

However those who seek help through ADAPT will generally be given the opportunity to get treatment and return to duty rather than the most severe penalties.

How to Get Help Through ADAPT Treatment Services

If you or someone you know is struggling with substance abuse getting help through ADAPT is easy. Here’s how to get started:

Self-Referral – Go to the nearest mental health clinic or ADAPT office and request an appointment.

Command Referral – If a supervisor or commander notices signs of substance misuse they may refer the individual for an evaluation.

Medical Referral – If a medical provider suspects substance misuse during a routine health check they may recommend ADAPT services.

Incident Referral – Any alcohol or drug-related incident (e.g. DUI, public intoxication) may result in an automatic ADAPT referral.

Why ADAPT Matters

The Air Force ADAPT Program is key to ensuring the health, well-being and readiness of service members. By providing education, intervention and rehabilitation ADAPT helps airmen address substance abuse issues before they become career ending problems. Seeking help through ADAPT is not a sign of weakness but rather a commitment to personal responsibility and military readiness.

Under current law, educators are given two weeks of paid leave for “catastrophic” sick leave, which parents usually take when they have a baby, Shaver said.
She also said that catastrophic sick leave should be reserved for unusual circumstances.
Besides the catastrophic sick leave, teachers accrue one sick day per month of employment.
Figures said after the bill passed that she was unaware of the lack of parental leave for state employees until her son, U.S.","MONTGOMERY, Ala. — The Alabama House of Representatives Thursday gave final approval to a bill extending paid parental leave to all state and education employees staring July 1, sending the bill to Gov. Kay Ivey.

The House passed SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, 94-2 after substituting it for HB 327, sponsored by Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg.

The bill allows women who give birth, have a stillbirth, or a miscarriage after 12 weeks to receive eight weeks of paid leave. It also allows a father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under 3 years old, either parent may have eight weeks of leave.

“I think the impact will be seen in future years, and the effects of it and how it helps families, and helps to support families and enable them to properly bond with their children and have that time at home to take care of their children,” Shaver said after the bill passed.

Figures carried a version of the legislation that only applied to educators last year, but it died in the Senate in the last week of the session.

“This day has really touched my heart,” Figures said in an interview.

Ivey, who called for the legislation in her State of the State address in February, said in a statement posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, that she would sign the bill.

“Thank you to Rep. Ginny Shaver and Sen. Vivian Figures for carrying this important legislation. I look forward to receiving the bill and getting my signature on it,” she wrote.

Under current law, educators are given two weeks of paid leave for “catastrophic” sick leave, which parents usually take when they have a baby, Shaver said. She also said that catastrophic sick leave should be reserved for unusual circumstances.

“Having a baby is a normal function. The catastrophic leave is for that, catastrophic and for unusual circumstances,” Shaver said in an interview.

Besides the catastrophic sick leave, teachers accrue one sick day per month of employment. Rep. Jim Carns, R-Birmingham, asked Shaver why teachers could not use those sick days as parental leave. He said that if teachers had not used their sick days for years, they would already have time to take off for parental leave.

“That was built for situations like this, in my opinion,” Carns said. “After three years, you have 30 days.”

Shaver said those sick days could be used when the parent, or child, is sick.

“It takes more than 10 days to recover from having a baby,” Shaver said.

Carns and Rep. Ben Harrison, R-Elkmont, voted against the bill. Harrison said he was worried that the benefit would deter people from working in the private sector. Shaver said the legislation will serve as a recruiting tool for state jobs.

“We are using taxpayer dollars from the private sector to recruit employees away from the private sector to fill these jobs,” Harrison said.

Figures said after the bill passed that she was unaware of the lack of parental leave for state employees until her son, U.S. Congressman Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, told her about it while on the campaign trail. She said women deserve to be represented and advocated for.

“Women populate this world. We are the ones who have to conceive that child,” she said. “We are the ones who have to carry that child for nine months, unless you have a health issue or whatever. Then when that child comes into this world, it’s the mother that that child looks to.”

When Figures carried the legislation last year for educators, it was changed to remove male employees’ leave in the case of a miscarriage and stillborn. Former Senate Pro Tem Greg Reed blocked the bill from passage on the 27th legislative day.

Figures said after SB 199 passed the House that she is pleased that the chambers could work together across the aisle to pass legislation for parents.

“It signifies that you can have a bill that means so much to so many people, as well as you can have a bill working with the other party, with someone who’s a member of the other party.”

Shaver said parents should not have to stress about financials when starting a family.",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WZDX/images/1372e5ca-8a0f-4c23-a1de-cdc011ac95d4/20240505T022125/1372e5ca-8a0f-4c23-a1de-cdc011ac95d4_1140x641.jpg,N,0.0,2025-03-21 17:56:23.219167

Case: 1:25-cv-00913

ZYXI investors filed a lawsuit against Zynex for sending excessive supplies to patients and billing insurers to inflate revenue.

After reporting a revenue shortfall and revealing Tricare suspended payments on March 11, 2025, ZYXI dropped 51.3%.

ZYXI investors can join this case to stay updated on potential recovery.

Case Details:

On March 11, 2025, after market close, Zynex ZYXI released its Q4 and full-year 2024 results, revealing that the company had fallen short of revenue expectations due to slower-than-normal payments from insurers. More significantly, Zynex disclosed that Tricare, a major government healthcare payer, had suspended payments while reviewing prior claims. The company confirmed that Tricare represented 20–25% of its annual revenue, and said it was reducing staff by 15% in response to the financial pressure. On this news, ZYXI plunged 51.3%, closing at $3.41 per share on March 12, 2025.

This came just months after STAT News published a report on June 4, 2024, exposing Zynex’s alleged “oversupplying scheme.” According to the investigation, the company shipped unnecessary monthly supplies like batteries and electrode pads to patients, allowing it to bill insurers for far more than necessary. Several patients reported receiving products they never requested—and then being hit with surprise bills.

The report also revealed that insurers had started removing Zynex from their networks, and that Tricare was among the payers scrutinizing the company’s billing practices. Former employees told STAT the oversupply issue was widespread and had already damaged the company’s business. Following the article, ZYXI fell 5%.

Based on these events, ZYXI investors filed a lawsuit against Zynex, claiming the company:

It failed to disclose that this practice had triggered scrutiny from insurers, including a payment suspension by Tricare.

It misled investors by promoting positive financial results while hiding the impact of its billing practices.

Investors believe Zynex misrepresented its financial health and business model.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-03-21 20:56:30.898563

Miles Kelly made seven 3-pointers and scored 23 points, All-American Johni Broome added 14 points and 11 rebounds, and No. 1 seed Auburn beat 16th-seeded Alabama State 83-63 on Thursday in the first round of the South Region.

Pearl's Tigers (29-5) lasted one game in 2024, losing to Yale days after winning the Southeastern Conference Tournament. This time, Auburn came in having lost three of four inside the power-packed SEC with a resume still strong enough to earn the top overall seed among the four No. 1 teams.

“We just weren’t sharp,” Pearl said of his Tigers. “One thing you can control. Our teams always play with great effort and energy too or our system doesn’t really work. I just didn’t think we did today.”

Auburn will play No. 9 seed Creighton, an 89-75 winner over eighth-seeded Louisville, in the second round on Saturday for a trip to the Sweet 16 in Atlanta.

“We won't beat Creighton if we play like we did tonight,” Pearl said.

Alabama State, whose lone lead was 3-0, didn't make it easy in the first half.

The Hornets fell behind 28-15 but scored the next nine points and pulled within 32-31 on a layup by Amarr Knox, the guard whose buzzer-beater gave the Hornets their victory over Saint Francis on Tuesday in the First Four. Fans inside Rupp Arena started roaring for Alabama State, hoping to see a big upset and bringing energy to the tired Hornets.

Alabama State coach Tony Madlock said he was proud of what his team did for Montgomery, their university and all historically Black colleges and universities to get to the Big Dance and win their first tournament game. And yes, they did something in this game to be proud of.

“(We) had some moments in this game where, you know, we made coach Pearl call timeout,” Madlock said.

Knox had a chance to give Alabama State the lead with 1:27 left in the half, but he missed both attempts at the line.

“I should've made those two free throws,” Knox said. “I definitely should’ve made those.”

Broome scored the first of nine straight for the Tigers, who took a 41-31 lead into halftime. Auburn smothered Alabama State in the second half even with Broome picking up a third foul within the first four minutes.

Tahaad Petitford added 16 points for Auburn and Chaney Johnson had 13.

The Tigers improved to 7-0 against Alabama State (20-16) with this the first NCAA Tournament game between the schools separated by about 50 miles in south Alabama. The historically Black school still goes home with its first NCAA Tournament win in its fifth appearance.

Knox led Alabama State with 18 points. TJ Madlock added 11.

Takeaways

Alabama State: The Hornets had nothing to lose. The Southwestern Athletic Conference program came up with 10 steals and forced Auburn into 12 turnovers.

Auburn: The Tigers had a 46-36 rebounding advantage, but their issues at the free-throw line could prove costly in the second round and beyond. They shot 56.3% (18 of 32).

Following months of speculation, President Donald Trump signed an executive order largely dismantling the Department of Education.

Members of the Florida congressional delegation responded with polarized views, categorizing the move as either a monumental misstep or a good start to reform.

For Rep. Frederica Wilson, a former teacher and principal, the administration’s action appeared as executive overreach and a slap at public educators nationwide.

“Closing the doors to the Department of Education is closing the doors to opportunities for our youth. The Republicans’ inability to understand why education is crucial to the future of America is laughable and shows how out of touch they are,” the Miami-Dade Republican said in an extensive statement.

“They are trying to break down our public education system and attack children of color. Public education serves everyone, regardless of the color of their skin: the gifted, students with disabilities, the wheelchair-bound, the mentally challenged, the sick, the shut-in, the orphan, the ungovernable, everyone! Our country will not be an international leader if its government leaves its children behind.”

However, Rep. Greg Steube cheered on the decision and said Congress should take it further.

“Congress has to come behind President Trump and back him up on this 100%,” the Sarasota Republican told Newsmax. “I’ve been on bills for the last three or four congresses that would do away with the Department of Education, but Congress has to act, and we can do that through the reconciliation bill.”

Steube suggested that Congress should keep popular programs like Pell Grants for college students intact but abolish the Department of Education as a concept, leaving education completely to state governments and local School Boards.

Trump’s decision came days after Education Secretary Linda McMahon visited South Florida and discussed education. She toured charter schools in Miami alongside Erika Donalds, the America First Policy Institute’s Center for Educational Opportunity Chair. Donalds is also married to U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Naples Republican.

Notably, the top post on McMahon’s X feed hours after the announcement was a repost of a statement Erika Donalds issued upon news of Trump’s order. It laid out a potential future of education after the agency’s sunset.

“By eliminating federal overreach in education, we can foster an environment where innovation thrives, parents have greater choice and students receive the high-quality education they deserve,” Donalds said. “This move will allow states to tailor educational approaches to their unique needs, free from one-size-fits-all federal mandates, and voters can hold their state and local elected officials accountable for the resulting academic outcomes.”

But the state certainly has skeptics who see Florida paying a steep price for the brash move. The Florida Policy Institute estimates the state will lose $800 million a year for programming for students with disabilities and that Florida’s Title I schools, those serving a high percentage of students in poverty, could miss out on a combined $1 billion in federal support.

“The DOE also plays a crucial role in ensuring civil rights protections at schools that receive federal dollars,” said Institute CEO Sadaf Knight. “Florida’s congressional delegation should be working to promote and fully fund education, not creating uncertainty around crucial supports that foster student achievement, racial and ethnic equity, and shared prosperity in our state.”

Law enforcement love

As Sen. Ashley Moody focuses on her election in 2026, she rolled out early endorsements from Florida’s law enforcement community. Now, law enforcement leaders are showing love for her first major Senate proposal.

This week, the Plant City Republican announced she secured endorsements from every Florida GOP State Attorney and Sheriff. Additionally, several law enforcement leaders, along with several Police Chiefs, gathered in Tampa to publicly back her first piece of prime-sponsored legislation, the Homes for Every Local Protector and Responder (HELPER) Act.

“Law enforcement leaders, deputies and front-line officers from across Florida are backing the HELPER Act. I am humbled to have their support in this important fight as we continue to provide law enforcement the tools, incentives, and support they need to protect and serve,” Moody said.

Before her appointment to the Senate, Moody served more than six years as Florida’s Attorney General, so she has strong connections to law enforcement at all levels. Indeed, she spotlighted ranked officers Mike and Angeliesse Nesterwitz, who relocated to Florida to serve at the Tampa International Airport because of incentives for police in the state.

To watch the news conference, please click on the image below:

“Even before we moved to Florida, we knew that the leadership here was like no other. It’s a major reason why we decided to move,” Angeliesse Nesterwitz said. “My husband and I met Sen. Moody while she was Attorney General. She offered us her full support as we were adjusting to service in the Sunshine State, and we are so excited to continue to support her efforts in Congress to provide even more incentives to service. We are also thrilled to introduce baby Isabel to her.”

The event also saw support for the bill from Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister, Marion Sheriff Billy Woods, Hernando Sheriff Al Nienhuis, Sarasota Sheriff Kurt Hoffman, Sumter Sheriff Pat Breeden and Hardee Sheriff Vent Crawford. Tampa International Airport Police Chief Charlie Vazquez, Treasure Island Police Chief John Barkley, Tampa Major Kim Fruit and Plant City Police Chief Richard Mills also backed the bill.

Moody said she would continue to be a voice for law enforcement in Washington.

“As Attorney General, I fought for pay raises, bonuses, and recruitment tools to keep Florida’s law enforcement the best in the nation,” Moody said. “You better believe I will continue to fight for them as U.S. Senator.”

Stitched in the USA

According to Sen. Rick Scott, American flags should be made in the birthplace of the values behind the stars and stripes.

The Naples Republican filed the Make American Flags in America Act with GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. The bill would require federal agencies to display only American-made flags.

“The American flag represents the pride and joy of being an American and the very values of a nation founded upon freedom, democracy and the American Dream,” Scott said. “Producing an American flag is a privilege that should only be granted to our fellow Americans who believe in the values it represents, not nations like Communist China who seek to destroy the American way of life. Our bill preserves and protects the pride of American-made products and the patriotism of the flag and nation we love. I urge my colleagues to support its quick passage.”

President Joe Biden signed a similar bill last year, but Scott said overseas manufacturers have continued to ship products to agencies by finding loopholes in the law. The Senate said his bill would stop Chinese flag makers from falsely claiming a flag is American-made on labeling, even if the sewing occurs overseas.

TRICARE trouble

Two Northeast Florida members of Congress want TRICARE to do a better job reimbursing active-duty service members.

Reps. Aaron Bean, a Fernandina Beach Republican, and John Rutherford, a Jacksonville Republican, sent a letter to Dr. David J. Smith, Acting Director of the Defense Health Agency, about ongoing failures in reimbursing troops.

“We have heard from countless concerned constituents that the new T-5 contract has had a severe impact on our military families and community medical providers,” the letter reads. “Providers across the nation have reported millions of dollars in unpaid or unprocessed claims. TRICARE beneficiaries are experiencing unfathomable delays. This crisis has put smaller practices at risk of shutting down, jeopardizing access to care for thousands of military families across the country.”

The letter said many in Northeast Florida suffered from reduced access to care, while other providers warned patients that services would soon be significantly reduced. One clinic in the region, where TRICARE beneficiaries make up a third of patients, reported to the lawmakers that the federal carrier owed it $100,000.

“It would be unacceptable for military families to lose access to critical health care coverage,” Bean and Rutherford wrote. “This crisis must be immediately rectified so that TRICARE payment services are restored, and providers can remain operational.”

Forever DOGE

Meanwhile, Bean and two other delegation members want to see efforts to reduce government become a permanent operation in Washington. Reps. Cory Mills, Bean, and Donalds filed legislation (HR 2006) that would codify the Department of Government Efficiency into a federal statute.

“According to the agency themselves, DOGE has already achieved over $115 billion in savings, which amounts to more than $700 in savings per taxpayer,” said Mills, a New Smyrna Beach Republican.

“They are rooting out waste and fraud, including the cancellation of 104 DEI contracts, saving the government more than $1 billion. One of my favorite finds was when DOGE identified that the Biden administration spent $8 million performing transgender experiments on mice. This is the type of wasteful spending that the American taxpayer deserves transparency on.”

Donalds, a Naples Republican, similarly saw value in finding savings.

“$2 trillion annual deficits, $36 trillion in debt, and the Washington Swamp wants to continue to grow — enough is enough,” he said. “We’re taking our country back, we’re putting the American people first again, and under President Trump, the Department of Government Efficiency is doing just that. Now more than ever, it’s critical that we codify this consequential endeavor into federal law.”

Bean, a co-founder of the DOGE Caucus in the House, jumped on as an introducing co-sponsor.

“DOGE’s mission is to improve government efficiency and to stop the abuse of taxpayer dollars — and it’s doing just that,” he said. “As co-chair of the House DOGE Caucus, I am proud to join Congressman Mills in introducing the DOGE Act to codify President Trump’s executive order into law. The American people overwhelmingly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, and we are working to restore accountability to the American public.”

Multiple Medicaid fronts

With Congress out of Session, Rep. Maxwell Frost spent some time away from the national Capitol, visiting the Florida State Capitol instead. The Orlando Democrat headlined a news conference in Tallahassee alongside Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell and state Rep. Dotie Joseph, a North Miami Democrat.

Frost slammed Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Florida Legislature for failing to expand state support of Medicaid, making Florida one of just 10 states that had refused to do so since the launch of the Affordable Care Act. The Congressman said that proposed federal cuts to Medicaid hurt Floridians much more as a result.

“The question I’m here to ask is: If you support cuts to Medicaid, do you not realize that you’re supporting cuts to the Florida budget? That’s how this works,” Frost said. “We give federal dollars to the state of Florida so they can give health care to people that need it — children, pregnant people, and seniors. So, if you’re cheering on cutting Medicaid, you’re cheering on losing money to help Floridians. In the wealthiest country on this Earth, everyone deserves access to quality health care.”

According to Frost’s office, the spending bill passed by Congress last week calls for $2 trillion in spending cuts, and instructions indicate that a substantial portion of that can come from Medicaid. Meanwhile, about 4 million Floridians rely on Medicaid for health coverage.

Unsung heroes

Rep. Vern Buchanan honored more than two dozen Manatee County philanthropists and community leaders at an event in Palmetto.

The Longboat Key Republican cheered the “Unsung Heroes” at the Manatee Community Foundation’s Spirit of Manatee Awards.

“The unwavering dedication demonstrated by the 2025 Spirit of Manatee honorees exemplifies the true essence of community,” Buchanan said.

“In the face of last year’s devastating hurricanes, these individuals and organizations stepped forward, embodying resilience and compassion. Their selfless contributions have been instrumental in our community’s rebuilding efforts, and it is with profound gratitude that I recognize and thank them for their steadfast commitment to the well-being of Manatee County.”

Affordable housing

Federal support for a program to build more affordable housing in West Palm Beach will increase by $1 million.

Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a Miramar Democrat, announced that the city received a grant for the Coleman Park Affordable Housing Project. City officials said the funding will support nine to 18 supportive housing units for families transitioning from homelessness or for those at risk of homelessness, a population largely priced out of the local market.

“Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick’s support in securing $1 million for affordable housing in West Palm Beach is a testament to the effectiveness of federal-local collaboration. This funding serves as a reminder that when we work together — across levels of government — we can make tangible investments that support working families in our community,” said Jennifer Ferriol, West Palm Beach’s Director of Housing and Community Development.

Cherfilus-McCormick put in an earmark request in the budget for the project.

“I secured $1 million in funding for the Coleman Park Affordable Housing Project so that more households across our community can achieve the American Dream,” she said. “This is about more than just developing new housing units — these are beacons of hope that will help families rebuild, grow, and thrive right here in West Palm Beach.”

Expensive housing

According to Rep. Lois Frankel, the resident of a famously expensive home in Palm Beach County is costing local taxpayers. The West Palm Beach Democrat just filed legislation to allow the Secret Service to reimburse law enforcement and fire crews for protecting Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.

“Protecting the President is a matter of national security and should be a federal responsibility to bear the costs,” Frankel said. “Diverting funds for presidential security can strain local governments’ ability to provide essential public services.”

She filed the bipartisan legislation with Rep. Tom Kean Jr., a New Jersey Republican. Kean agreed that the burden of security should not fall on local taxpayers where a President happens to live. “Currently, much of that responsibility falls on small-town taxpayers and local budgets,” he said.

Palm Beach County Mayor Maria Marino endorsed the legislation.

“At the request of the federal government, Palm Beach County has consistently stepped up to ensure that President Trump has the best security protection available anytime he is in residence in our community,” Marino said. “We consider it an honor to serve and protect our President; however, our taxpaying community cannot continue to foot the bill for this very costly service. We need help and relief from this significant local financial impact that is projected to cost over $45 million by fiscal year-end.”

Returning phone calls

Rep. Jared Moskowitz wants the Social Security Administration to pick up the phone.

Following DOGE-driven cuts to phone support at the federal agency, the Parkland Democrat co-led a letter with Rep. Al Green, a Texas Democrat, urging the administration to safeguard call service.

“We strongly urge you to consider the individuals who may be harmed, as eliminating or reducing phone services would create unnecessary barriers for the most vulnerable populations at a time when they already face so many challenges,” the letter reads.

“Social Security benefits are earned entitlements that individuals contribute to throughout their entire working lives, and every American deserves the opportunity to access those benefits in a way that is accessible and equitable.”

Call service manages about 40% of claims processed from Social Security recipients annually. Moskowitz said in his district alone, nearly 160,000 constituents depend on Social Security.

Calling out Rubio logic

The Democratic co-Chair of Florida’s congressional delegation led a fresh effort to allow Venezuelans to keep temporary protected status (TPS).

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Weston Democrat, co-led a letter with Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, demanding Secretary of State Marco Rubio explain the decision to revoke the protections despite ongoing hostility from Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The letter uses several statements Rubio made in the past to counter the administration’s recent logic in withdrawing protections. It also draws on statements Rubio made while serving as Florida’s senior Senator, critical of Maduro.

“On Feb. 5, DHS justified terminating TPS for Venezuelans by citing ‘notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime’ claiming conditions now allow for safe returns,” the letter reads.

“Yet just one day later, on Feb. 6, you contradicted this assessment, stating, ‘I do not know how else to talk about a regime that has forced about 8 million citizens to leave Venezuela. They imprison; they torture innocent individuals.’ You have previously referred to the Maduro regime as an ‘enemy of humanity,’ and on Feb. 26, in an official transcript from the Department of State, you reaffirmed that Maduro remains a horrible dictator and the ‘same threat today that he was two years ago, three years ago, four years ago.’”

Thirty-eight Representatives signed the letter, including every Democrat in Florida’s congressional delegation.

“Venezuelans fleeing horrific, inhumane conditions have received refuge in the United States since the start of the humanitarian crisis through TPS, a program that has enjoyed bipartisan support,” the letter reads. “The Trump administration’s decision to revoke TPS for 348,000 Venezuelans is not just dangerous, it is a betrayal of the Venezuelan American community.”

Deporting Castro loyalists

Meanwhile, Rep. Carlos Giménez pushed the administration to explain why certain Cubans are allowed in the country.

The Miami-Dade Republican sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urging her to investigate and deport more than 100 people who the Foundation of Cuban Rights in Cuba said had ties to Fidel Castro’s regime.

“Like so many in our community, I was forced from my native homeland of Cuba shortly after the Communist Revolution and it is absolutely reprehensible how agents of the murderous Castro regime have gamed our immigration laws to infiltrate our country,” Giménez said.

His own family fled Cuba when he was a child. Today, Giménez is the only Cuban-born member of Congress.

“I applaud President Trump and his administration for the swift action in recently apprehending an intelligence agent of the Cuban dictatorship living in South Florida,” Giménez said, “and I look forward to continuing working closely together to identify, detain, and repatriate these despicable fraudsters living in our country.”

West Point appointments

Trump announced several appointments to the Board of Visitors for West Point Academy, including some prominent Florida figures.

The Board now includes former General and (far right figure) Michael Flynn. The onetime National Security Adviser to Trump, who later received a pardon after a conviction involving the Russian collusion investigation, now lives in the Venice area, where he has been involved in the local conservative movement The Hollow for several years.

Additionally, Trump appointed Maureen Bannon to the Board. The CEO of WarRoom, a media umbrella for her father Steve Bannon’s podcast of the same name, was considering a run in Florida’s 15th Congressional District last year and still lives in Florida.

On this day

March 21, 1947 — “Harry Truman orders loyalty checks of federal employees” via History.com — Congress had already launched investigations of communist influence in Hollywood, and laws banning communists from teaching positions were being instituted in several states. Of most concern to President Truman’s administration, however, were persistent charges that communists were operating in federal offices. In response to these fears and concerns, Truman issued an executive order that set up a program to check the loyalty of federal employees. In announcing his order, Truman indicated that he expected all federal workers to demonstrate “complete and unswerving loyalty” to the United States. Anything less, he declared, “constitutes a threat to our democratic processes.”

March 21, 1965 — “Selma to Montgomery march begins” via The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research Institute — The federally sanctioned march left Selma on March 21. Protected by hundreds of federalized Alabama National Guardsmen and FBI agents, the demonstrators covered 7 to 17 miles daily. Camping at night in supporters’ yards, they were entertained by celebrities such as Harry Belafonte and Lena Horne. Limited by Judge Frank M. Johnson’s order to 300 marchers over a stretch of two-lane highway, the number of demonstrators swelled on the last day to 25,000, accompanied by Assistant Attorneys General John Doar, Ramsey Clark, and former Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall.

Many of us have heard the sobering facts about China’s growing military might. Beyond its rapidly advancing military, China is also becoming increasingly aggressive in the Indo-Pacific region. In the South China Sea, for example, Chinese military ships continue to harass Filipino vessels to bully the Philippines into submission; and in the Taiwan Strait, China regularly sends military aircraft to intimidate Taiwan.

At some point, China could miscalculate and provoke an all-out war or intentionally initiate military action, potentially drawing the United States into a conflict. A war against a technologically advanced adversary like China would almost certainly result in massive numbers of casualties, unlike anything we’ve seen this century. If deterrence fails, we cannot be caught unprepared, and we must have plans to quickly transport and treat injured servicemembers.

Today, the Military Health System is not prepared to respond to casualties resulting from conflict against a military power such as China. It’s something we must address now—both to fulfill our sacred obligation to those who risk their lives for our country and because our adversaries are becoming increasingly aggressive.

This includes modernizing the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), which would be called upon to plan, coordinate, and execute our medical response to a mass casualty event like a war. The NDMS is comprised of multiple federal agencies that partner with civilian health care organizations to create a network to care for civilian or military casualties in crises. For this reason, for the past several years I have authorized and funded a pilot program to improve the NDMS, making it easier for different entities to work together and expanding NDMS’s surge capacity to care for more patients.

Last week, during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, I questioned experts on how we can continue to strengthen NDMS and prepare our nation for an attack that could quickly overwhelm our health system. At the hearing, the experts urged Congress to find a way to take the lessons learned from the pilot program and apply them going forward.

The experts also underscored the importance of the military partnering with civilian entities such as academic institutions. One institution that works closely with the Military Health System is our own University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC). Specifically, UNMC has a leading program for treating patients with highly contagious infectious diseases and on-site training built in partnership with the U.S. Air Force. Military-civilian partnerships like these strengthen the NDMS, while also improving care for both military and civilian patients, by accelerating the exchange of ideas between institutions that would need to collaborate closely if a major war erupted. These partnerships build up future leaders to specialize in medical areas that are relevant to combat.

We all hope that we will never see war against a major military power, but we must live in reality and recognize the growing aggression and capabilities of our adversaries. I’ll be working with my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee to strengthen our national security, which includes improving our Military Health System.

Thank you for participating in the democratic process. I look forward to visiting with you again next week.",https://media-chadronradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/07/Deb-Fischer.jpg,N,-1.0,2025-03-21 12:56:42.045731
