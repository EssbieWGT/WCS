OSLO, Norway (P&GJ) — Carbon-capture company Capsol Technologies has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a major U.S. utility to develop the first commercial-scale gas-fired power plant using the company’s CapsolGT® technology.

The agreement grants the Norwegian firm exclusivity to advance project development for what would mark Capsol’s entry into the North American utility market. The project aims to demonstrate a low-carbon, dispatchable power solution for natural-gas generation using direct carbon capture.

“In the U.S. utility market, decarbonization must go hand in hand with affordability and reliability,” said Philipp Staggat, Chief Product Officer at Capsol Technologies. “CapsolGT® is engineered to be the cost leader for decarbonizing existing gas turbine plants, giving utilities and large power users a practical route to low-carbon, dispatchable power.”

CapsolGT® is designed to capture more than 95% of CO₂ directly from turbine exhaust while reusing waste heat to produce additional electricity—without the need for steam or combined-cycle systems. The company said the solution is well-suited for high-demand applications such as data centers, where energy use is rapidly increasing due to AI and cloud computing.

Natural gas currently accounts for about 36% of U.S. power generation, making it the country’s dominant and most durable hydrocarbon energy source.

Generators 'take advantage' of market Nationally, the Australian Energy Regulator's (AER) last market report found electricity prices were staying relatively high despite increasing renewable generation, which is cheaper.
That's in part because some generators were withholding electricity from the market, which can artificially drive up prices.","The cost of electricity is being driven up by tens of millions of dollars by some Western Australian power producers breaking the rules and charging more than they're allowed, the state's economic watchdog alleges.

In the latest alleged breach, WA's largest privately-owned generator, Bluewaters Power, hiked the wholesale price of electricity by about $30 million over eight months, the Economic Regulation Authority (ERA) claims.

Wholesale costs make up about 40 per cent of the average household power bill.

In WA, the state government shields households from the immediate impacts of spikes in wholesale prices, but the more they happen, the more they can trickle down to bills.

A complex market

The ERA's chair Steve Edwell said the Bluewaters blowout was part of an ""increasing number"" of electricity generators using their power in a concentrated market to charge higher prices than they should.

Such behaviour is not allowed in WA as generators are only allowed to sell electricity to retailers, like Synergy, at-cost.

But the Japanese-owned company said its pricing was necessary to ensure it could reliably power the WA electricity grid, and argues its market impact was only a fraction of the $30 million claimed by the ERA.

""The alleged breaches relate to periods of time when Bluewaters faced coal and water shortages and was managing its generation,"" a Bluewaters spokesperson said.

Supply shortages can lead to reduced production capacity, which is often reflected in the market with higher prices.

Bluewaters claimed the ERA had ""misunderstood the relevant facts"" and incorrectly applied the law.

It follows another case earlier this year, where the ERA found Alinta had increased the cost of generation by $66 million over a similar time span, which the company is also disputing.

One thing both the regulator and industry can agree on is the market, and the rules, have become increasingly complex with the uptake of renewable energy.

Generators 'take advantage' of market

Nationally, the Australian Energy Regulator's (AER) last market report found electricity prices were staying relatively high despite increasing renewable generation, which is cheaper.

That's in part because some generators were withholding electricity from the market, which can artificially drive up prices.

""Participants can take advantage of market conditions to make significant financial returns,"" the report said.

In a statement, an AER spokesperson said the practice of setting higher prices ""cannot be false or misleading"", but was otherwise allowed.

""However patterns of this kind of behaviour could lead to inefficiencies in the market and may not be in the best interests of energy consumers,"" the spokesperson said.

Cost of living concerns

The market behaviour noted by the AER is not allowed in Western Australia, where generators are only allowed to sell electricity to retailers at cost price.

Instead, they are paid to be available on demand, such as in times of high need — a sort of insurance policy in what's called a capacity market.

Mr Edwell acknowledged the energy market was becoming increasingly complex with the onset of renewables, which may be contributing to some market breaches.

But he warned those companies still had to ensure they ""only recover their legitimate costs"".

""It's important that we pay no more than we need to, and that's no more apparent than now with the cost pressures we're all facing,"" he said.

WA Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said it was not appropriate for her to comment on the Bluewaters case while it was being considered by the regulator, and did not respond to questions about reforms to regulation.

""It is my expectation that all generators operate lawfully to ensure customers are not disadvantaged,"" she said.

Griffin uncertainty

Bluewaters' alleged breach comes amid uncertainty about the future of its power plants in WA, as the coal mine that fuels them, operated by Griffin Coal, approaches the end of its government lifeline.

Indian-owned Griffin Coal has been kept afloat by $308 million in taxpayer subsidies since entering receivership in 2022, with debts of about $1.5 billion.

The WA Government has committed to ending its funding of Griffin Coal by June 2026.

Griffin Coal has continued to pay off some of its debt to Indian lenders since receiving the government payouts, raising concerns about WA taxpayer dollars being used to offset the losses of foreign investors.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e69493bce26a00deed71ca6d61beda0?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=574&cropW=1021&xPos=0&yPos=53&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-12-08 10:01:22.645186

I started my career at V.C. Summer, working alongside hundreds of dedicated engineers, technicians and community leaders who believed deeply in the promise of nuclear energy. We believed in what the project could mean for the state — reliable power, good-paying jobs, and a long-term investment in South Carolina’s economic resilience.

Those early years shaped not only my professional path but my commitment to advancing nuclear energy as a force for progress.

Seeing momentum return to V.C. Summer brings both pride and hope.

Pride because I know the caliber of the people who poured their expertise, sweat and heart into the site.

Hope because the renewed attention signals something bigger — a second chance to fulfill the potential this project has always held.

The future of V.C. Summer isn’t just about reactors, concrete, or systems.

It’s about people. It’s about the workforce that will be trained, the families who will thrive on new opportunities, and the communities that will benefit.

When a state commits to developing nuclear infrastructure, it commits to stability, innovation, and economic strength for decades to come.

That’s why events like the 2nd Annual South Carolina Nuclear Summit are so important to our state and industry.

Leaders from across the country will gather here in South Carolina to discuss the future of nuclear energy, the electric grid and the role our state can play in strengthening the energy landscape.

As someone who began his career at V.C. Summer, I see this summit as a powerful opportunity for professionals to come together, share ideas and advance the conversations that will shape our region’s growing need for nuclear infrastructure, reactor development, and reliable clean energy.

New nuclear power plants don’t make sense for South Carolina

South Carolina is uniquely positioned right now.

With the right vision, V.C. Summer can be a catalyst — not only for energy generation but for job creation, technology development, and statewide economic growth.

As someone who has spent nearly two decades in nuclear development, both in the field and through years of research leadership, I’ve seen firsthand what successful deployment requires.

It takes technical excellence, committed leadership, intentional planning, and a shared belief in the long-term value of clean, reliable energy.

It also takes experienced teams who understand the complexities of nuclear development from design to deployment — and who know how to get the work done safely and responsibly.

V.C. Summer shaped the beginning of my career.

Who foots the bill? - CalMatters,"Alejandro Lazo, Alejandro Lazo Climate",,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/12/data-center-energy-san-jose/,"How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?
The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity.
No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers.","San Jose, the symbolic capital of Silicon Valley, is now ground zero in California’s battle over how to govern the rise of data centers used to power artificial intelligence.

The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.

Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.

Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San Jose clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center buildout, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.

Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.

Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.

How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?

The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.

According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.

Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.

“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”

The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised.

“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years – or at all,” the office said in its commentary.

Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.

Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San Jose, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San Jose Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”

What are the environmental concerns around the data center boom?

California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.

Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.

Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.

“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.

Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group..

Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy?

The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.

The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.

State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.

Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.

PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.

Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San Jose’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.

Will data centers raise your electric bill?

California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.

PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.

Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.

“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”

Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills. A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.

“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120425_Edgecloud-Link-Data-Center_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 10:01:00.918424

There is always a risk of the solar energy systems producing energy and not being able to use it all, because of the risk of having the energy banked.","New York is starting one of the largest solar farms in the state’s history, the Cider Solar Farm. This farm will be 3,000 acres, have five hundred megawatts of renewable energy, and one million solar panels. It will be able to power the town of Elba and the village of Oakfield in Genesee County when finished.

This is an important milestone towards New York’s climate goals

According to Greenbacker Capital, Cider Solar Farm is the start of many important milestones toward completing New York’s challenging climate goals. It will allow the state to remain on track to New York’s 2030 goal to have 70% of the state’s electricity come from renewable sources. These large-scale solar farms are becoming the best way to meet these goals.

The farm will be able to provide enough electricity to power 125,000 homes, which will tremendously help to reduce the use of fossil fuels and carbon emissions. New York is becoming one of the leaders in sustainable infrastructure, and the use of solar energy on farms like this will allow it to maintain this leadership role.

The enormity of the Cider Solar Farm demonstrates the market’s need for clean energy sources. The facility will have one million solar panels and will be one of the largest in New York’s Northeast. The farm will also produce energy at a considerable scale and employ hundreds for construction and periodic maintenance.

Maximal solar contact will be achieved through the specific positioning of the panels

The solar farm will also economically benefit the region as well as the local populations through the creation of new jobs and the increased available tax revenue, which will allow for new investments to be made in the local economies.

According to Greenbacker Capital, the Cider Solar Farm complements the independence of the national energy grid and revitalizes economically depressed rural areas.

The farm will also have the positive externality of sequestering hundreds of thousands of metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, the equivalent of removing thousands of cars from the road. It will therefore help to transition the economy to a low-carbon one and mitigate climate change.

The risks of the project: What could go wrong?

While these solar farms do provide a multitude of benefits and are the starting point for greener solar energy in the U.S, these solar farms do not come without challenges. Without a doubt, one of the biggest challenges is land use. These farms take up a lot of land, and in an effort to minimize disruption of the land, including disruption of agriculture and wildlife, developers work with the local authorities to figure out a solution that is suitable for all parties.

Another of these challenges is the requirement of the electrical infrastructure feeding the power to the electrical grid of the state, and the subsequent planning that needs to go into it in order not to adversely impact the electrical grid’s reliability. There is always a risk of the solar energy systems producing energy and not being able to use it all, because of the risk of having the energy banked.

New York is setting an example in the renewable energy sphere

Battery systems are installed to mitigate fluctuations that can occur in solar energy output and ensure a reliable supply. Like Cider Solar Farm, many other solar farms are also the starting point of the use of solar power on a large scale in the U.S, and they are also the beginning of the use of solar power with minimal impact on the economy. The construction of Cider Solar Farm has begun, and with it, New York is starting to show how it can lead other states in the U.S in achieving a high level of sustainability.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/36.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 09:00:27.046127

Final marketing and distribution agreement for renewable ammonia from the Saudi Arabian project (NEOM Green Hydrogen Project) is targeted for the first half of 2026.

LEHIGH VALLEY, PA USA / OSLO, NORWAY (December 8, 2025) - World-leading hydrogen supplier and global industrial gases company Air Products (NYSE:APD) and world-leading crop nutrition and ammonia company Yara International ASA (OSE:YAR) are working to combine Air Products’ industrial gas capabilities and low-emission hydrogen with Yara’s ammonia production and distribution network:

Louisiana Clean Energy Complex: Air Products is developing the world’s largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products’ customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products’ 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project: The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world’s first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara’s unparalleled shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Leveraging complementary strengths to drive value creation in low-emission ammonia

Yara is the world’s largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara’s 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand. Air Products is the world’s largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale. The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.

“We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world’s leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,” said Air Products’ Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

“Air Products’ two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara’s flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. The Louisiana project builds on a proven, capital-efficient model; producing ammonia from externally sourced hydrogen and delivering strong returns,” said Yara’s CEO Svein Tore Holsether.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14. During the visit to the facility, Wilson presented FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Randy Berti with a plaque to commemorate the accomplishment. Berti said the achievement is a testament to the depot’s dedication to environmental sustainability, regulatory compliance and stewardship.

“We have made it a priority to go above and beyond because we understand the importance of taking care of our planet,” said Berti. “We want to do everything we can do be good stewards of the environment and our community. We live, work and eat here and we want to continue to do so safely, well into the future. That is why we do everything we can to protect the health of our workforce and our neighbors, and the natural beauty here on the Crystal Coast.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative recognizes and supports companies and facilities that go above and beyond to reduce their impact on the environment. The program’s mission is to assist organizations in reducing their environmental impacts beyond regulatory requirements and recognize those that achieve and maintain this commitment.

FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative. He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.

“FRC East sets aggressive environmental objectives that go far above the minimum compliance requirements because we are committed to being good stewards of the environment,” said Krelie. “To be able to say we have continued to raise the bar, met all our compliance requirements and gone above and beyond every year for 20 years straight is quite the achievement, one that has taken the entire workforce banding together to accomplish.”

The Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers three member levels: Partner, Rising Steward and Steward. Each level is designed to fit the organization’s needs based on the maturity of its environmental management system and performance success. The Partner level is the beginner level for organizations that are interested in developing a systematic approach to improving their environmental performance, whereas the Steward designation is given to organizations that have mature environmental management systems and are committed to exemplary environmental performance beyond what is required by law.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance. The depot’s current objectives focus on reducing the facility’s energy usage, decreasing how much industrial wastewater it generates, and increasing its landfill diversion efforts, he said.

“This year, we are putting two of our three goals in sustainment, which means we have reached those goals, but need to continue monitoring results to make sure we can maintain them,” said Azok. “In the meantime, we are now looking to establish new goals that are more aggressive. For example, we’re always looking to reduce our solid waste. If we find a way to avoid generating solid waste altogether, then we wouldn’t have to recycle it, which aids our landfill diversion efforts. It’s a harder objective to establish because it involves so many elements but if find a way to do it, we are going to.”

Azok said FRCE exceeded its landfill diversion goal for this year, achieving a 64% rate compared to the 62% target. He said FRCE actively seeks opportunities to donate reusable materials to local businesses and groups, which helps reduce waste and support the community.

“We are always looking for ways we can aid the community,” said Azok. “We reach out to local businesses to see if there’s anything that we generate that we can provide them, such as scrap wood or pallets. At one point, we were even donating our toner cartridges to churches and schools because they could recycle them. We are always looking for those kinds of partnerships. They help the community and help us be better stewards of the environment.”

FRCE aims to use 25% less energy in 2025 than it did in 2024, a target the facility is on track to achieve, said Azok. Krelie said the depot has taken many steps to reduce the amount of energy it uses daily to achieve this goal, many of which have been simple fixes, such as replacing the facility’s old sodium vapor light bulbs with energy efficient LED bulbs. Additionally, FRCE has partnered with Duke Energy to help assess the facility’s energy usage and provide insight to reduce it, he said.

“Part of going above and beyond means doing everything we can to reduce our environmental footprint, even if it’s not required of us by law,” said Krelie. “Replacing the lead-acid batteries with lithium in our battery-powered carts because they are more energy efficient is a great example. With the old batteries, the carts had to be plugged in daily, which constantly used energy. Duke Energy also helped us find that we have lost a lot of energy in our compressed air system. We are working on getting that replaced now. Not having any leaks in our compressed air system will save a significant amount of energy and cost savings.”

Krelie said FRCE has reduced its wastewater generation by 65% this year, nearly doubling its original reduction goal of 36%. He said they were able to achieve such a significant reduction by closely monitoring each building’s usage and identifying areas of overuse.

“One of our buildings was using upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 gallons of processed water a day,” said Krelie. “The clean lines in that building were using a lot of rinse water when cleaning aircraft parts, and the water was running constantly. We were able to reduce that down to less than 10,000 gallons a day by simply analyzing the input and output and implementing simple controls, such as having the artisans shut the water valve at the end of the day. “We smashed our wastewater reduction goal with just the savings in that building,” he continued. “Even though we met our desired end state, we need to stay aggressive. We don’t want to hang our hat on the fact that we met our goal early when we know we can do more. We tweaked that goal a little bit because it became easy once we saw how simple it was to effect change.”

Not only have these changes helped FRCE become more environmentally friendly, but many of them have helped save the depot money, allowing additional funds to be refocused on supporting warfighter readiness, said Krelie. “There’s a huge financial benefit to all of this,” Krelie said. “We received a significant credit on our utility bill when we reduced that 70,000 gallons of wastewater per day to 10,000 gallons. And replacing the lightbulbs with LED meant our electric bill went down. Because we are a working capital fund, these savings go back to our total operating expenses at the end of the year. We remain good stewards of the environment so we can continue to do what we do best, and we love hearing the sound of freedom in this local community.”

Azok said the facility has developed and implemented many workflows and regulations into its operations to mitigate their potential effect on the environment.

“We have strict controls in place in our shops that use these materials to control their usage,” said Azok. “There’s a lot of testing involved to make sure we’re not sending out anything that could negatively affect the wastewater treatment plant. We also have emission control devices, such as the air filtration system in our aircraft paint barn, to help protect our air from any chemicals. All chemicals are strictly managed so that no one can check them out unless they are trained, authorized and have demonstrated that they can maintain positive control over them from the time they are purchased, to when they are used and disposed.”

FRCE also requires employees to complete annual environmental training courses to increase awareness and effectiveness, said Azok.

“Everyone, no matter what they are hired as, has to participate in annual environmental training,” said Azok. “There is the environmental management system training that offers a high-level overview of the environmental regulations that we have here at FRC East, and the hazardous communication course that teaches you how hazardous materials interact with each other, with the environment and how they are managed. There are also many other required courses that many of us take, depending on our job descriptions and the areas we work. Our goal with these is to teach employees about the products we work with and our processes so we can properly identify and mitigate any potential issues and continue to be good stewards of our environment, all while keeping the workforce safe.”

Being a part of the Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers FRCE many benefits, Azok said, including mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other businesses within North Carolina.

“At the Steward level, not only are you at the highest level in the program, but you also have the opportunity to coach those who are in the lower levels and problem solve with other companies at the Steward level,” said Azok. “It opens up the ability to reach out and get information from other members. For example, another Steward reached out to us and asked how we manage our lithium batteries, since we’re one of the few organizations in the state that deal with that amount of those size and type of lithium batteries. We provided that information, along with some of our emergency procedures. It’s a great avenue for networking.”

Krelie said although FRCE has seen many environmental successes this past year, the focus remains on continuous improvement.

“We take a proactive stance because we want to make sure that we are not doing anything that can cause damage,” said Krelie. “Our first priority is to protect and preserve our environment, our workforce and the people in our community. We stay on top of new technology and research because if we can make changes to improve our green procurement of chemicals or find a better way to dispose of something, even if it’s not a regulatory requirement, we want to do that. We don’t want to have to play catch up later on down the road.”

FRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $865 million.

Russel Honoré and Livingston Parish Councilman Dean Coates, Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré",,,,,https://thelensnola.org/2025/12/08/air-products-carbon-capture-risks-lake-maurepas/,"That’s the future that Air Products, the giant industrial gas corporation, has planned for Lake Maurepas.
In 2023, the company was so gung ho about carbon capture that it hired 25 lobbyists to block more than a dozen Louisiana bills related to limiting carbon capture.
Here’s the kicker: now, even Air Products doesn’t seem to want the carbon capturepart of the project anymore.
Air Products is still barreling forward to secure permits for the full project — including carbon capture and storage.
Air Products’ carbon capture project is a bad deal for Louisiana.","At dawn in the Maurepas Swamp, you can see 11 pink Roseate spoonbills rise into daybreak, off to feast on a lavish buffet of Louisiana shrimp and crabs. The swamp is one of the last wild places left in south Louisiana. It’s a place that still remembers what this land once was and still is — a living, breathing estuary.

But this quiet sanctuary could soon be spoiled by injection wells, pipelines and industrial noise. That’s the future that Air Products, the giant industrial gas corporation, has planned for Lake Maurepas.

Within this area, one of the most conservative in the state, the opposition to the project is high. But there’s still a possibility that the governor may approve permits for it. That’s why it’s important to understand what’s behind the scenes, in Air Products board rooms and on the ground in Louisiana community meetings.

In November, hundreds of people packed into a church in St. John the Baptist Parish for a public hearing on the company’s massive “blue hydrogen” and carbon capture scheme.

Air Products calls it clean energy. But there’s nothing clean about building a hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish, capturing some CO₂, and piping it 38 miles for injection beneath Lake Maurepas. It was once touted as the world’s largest carbon-storage project.

In 2023, the company was so gung ho about carbon capture that it hired 25 lobbyists to block more than a dozen Louisiana bills related to limiting carbon capture.

Here’s the kicker: now, even Air Products doesn’t seem to want the carbon capturepart of the project anymore.

Last spring, the company’s CEO told investors that Air Products was “actively working to de-risk” its Louisiana project and was in “ongoing discussions to divest the carbon sequestration and ammonia production elements.”

Let us translate that for you: Air Products wants to offload the liability for its company but has no problem leaving it with Louisiana’s people and wetlands.

If it’s too risky for Air Products, we’re going to venture to say it’s too damn risky for Louisiana.

Air Products is still barreling forward to secure permits for the full project — including carbon capture and storage. But from what the company told its investors, once those permits are issued, the project becomes a hot potato — so dangerous, expensive, and politically toxic that Air Products plans to sell the carbon-capture portion of the project. And with billions in federal tax breaks for so-called “clean energy” on the table, another company might take the bait.

Meanwhile, communities across the five-parish footprint are united in opposition to the entire project.

At a hearing attended by nearly 300 residents, everyone was opposed to the proposed plant, pipeline, and carbon capture scheme except for two paid representatives from economic development groups.

The proposed CO₂ pipeline could run just half a mile from Sorrento Primary School, a mother told the crowd, describing her fears. “Imagine your child playing on the playground within feet of that [CO2] pipeline, with flares from the facility in the background,” she said. “No child deserves poison in their playground.”

She’s right to worry! If this pipeline were to rupture so close to her son’s elementary school, 660 students could be enveloped by CO2 in minutes, according to a recent report.

In 2020, a CO₂ pipeline ruptured near Satartia, Mississippi, sending a suffocating cloud of CO2 through the community. Forty-five people were hospitalized; some were found unconscious more than a mile away. People gasped for air on the side of the road after their cars stalled — CO₂ had displaced oxygen in their lungs and their combustion engines.

When Yazoo County emergency director Jack Willingham arrived, he was stunned: “It looked like you were going through the zombie apocalypse,” he said.

We’ll say it again: it’s too damn risky for Louisiana.

At least six elected officials — a mayor, two parish councilors, two state representatives and a state senator — spoke against Air Products’ plan to invade Lake Maurepas and the surrounding swamp. Because they have watched industry in Louisiana, they know how this story ends: once one company drills, others follow. Soon, the serene waters could echo with compressors, barges and drilling rigs — all in the name of “clean energy.”

Carbon capture and storage is being sold as a climate solution. But the reality is clear to climate groups across Louisiana: this new technology is a costly distraction that prolongs pollution rather than stopping it.

Public opposition to carbon capture is spreading fast from Republicans and Democrats alike, driven by communities who refuse to be sacrificed for a corporate experiment. And leaders are listening.

In October, Councilman Coates proposed a resolution opposing carbon sequestration wells and pipelines in Livingston Parish and the Council passed it unanimously. Altogether, the Council represents more than 152,000 people!

On October 15th, Gov. Jeff Landry — no stranger to siding with industry — showed that he, too, is feeling the political pressure, as he declared a temporary moratorium on new carbon capture injection well applications.

Gov. Landry’s moratorium was lifted last Sunday, but the fate of Air Product’s project still rests with the Governor and state agencies. Our experience tells us that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will likely follow the state’s lead in deciding whether Air Products gets the green light to break ground in our quiet swamp.

Since he’s taken office, Gov. Landry often talks about protecting Louisiana’s way of life. Well, this is his chance to protect this part of Louisiana, by denying the permits for this project.

In this matter, the governor has a choice: side with the people of Louisiana, or with corporate interests trying to bury their waste beneath our land and public waters.

Instead of energy that relies on hydrogen and ammonia and requires a PR campaign and dozens of lobbyists to hide its true impacts, Louisiana deserves real clean energy — solar, wind and efficient power.

Louisiana can’t afford to get stuck on stupid again, as Gen. Honoré often says.

Air Products’ carbon capture project is a bad deal for Louisiana. Now Air Products — the company that dreamed it up — wants to walk away. Doesn’t that tell us everything we need to know?

Nobody wants carbon capture. Not the public. Not the parishes. Not even Air Products itself.",https://i0.wp.com/thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/pexels-photo-10885355.jpeg?fit=1880%2C1253,N,,2025-12-08 10:02:03.750832

Read the full report Australian graphite: A path to a global battery market opportunity PDF (1 MB),","Australia stands on the brink of a significant opportunity in the global battery market, driven by the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems.

At the heart of this opportunity lies graphite, a critical material for lithium-ion batteries. As the world moves to cleaner energy solutions, graphite is becoming all the more important.

In our new report, Australian graphite: A path to a global battery market opportunity PDF (1 MB), co-authored by CSIRO, Geoscience Australia and Stanford University, we highlight the immense potential of Australia's graphite resources and the strategic importance of developing a robust graphite industry.

The strategic importance of graphite

Graphite is the primary anode material for lithium-ion batteries, which are essential for the rapidly expanding EV market. Graphite's unique properties, including high conductivity, mechanical stability and compatibility with battery cathodes, make it indispensable in battery production.

Despite holding substantial natural graphite resources, Australia currently lacks large-scale production capability for battery-grade graphite. Thus, we have a significant opportunity to establish domestic manufacturing capabilities and become a preferred supplier of graphite in the global market.

Australia's graphite resources

Geoscience Australia data, as of December 2023, ranks Australia 8th in the world for natural graphite with around 4% of the world's resource. Our graphite is predominantly located in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, with recent discoveries in the Northern Territory expected to add to the resource base.

However, Australia's current lack of large-scale production capability for battery-grade graphite shows the need for strategic investment and development.

Economic and market opportunities

The substantial price jump from graphite concentrate to anode materials highlights the economic potential of downstream processing. Developing domestic processing capabilities could add significant value to Australia's graphite resources.

Moreover, global market dynamics present a unique opportunity for Australia. China currently dominates 95 per cent of the downstream processing market for anode materials, posing a risk to supply chain stability.

So, enhancing our processing capabilities, international collaborations, support by targeted government initiatives, and industry-research partnerships will be essential to building a resilient and sustainable graphite supply chain.

Environmental and technological advancements

Integrating renewable energy into graphite processing could pose a competitive advantage for Australia. Technologies such as solar, wind and thermal storage could drive down the cost of the energy needed for graphite processing and deliver 'emissions-free' graphite. Additionally, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning could help identify graphite deposits, improving the efficiency and yield of mining operations. These innovations could not only make the graphite industry more sustainable but also position Australia as a leader in environmentally responsible mining practices.

A timely opportunity for action

In the report, we're encouraging industry leaders across Australia to recognise the strategic importance of developing a robust graphite industry. By investing in domestic processing capabilities, leveraging technological advancements and fostering strategic collaborations, Australia could secure a stable supply of critical battery materials. We’d be able to better support the growing energy storage systems and EV industries and position ourselves as a key player in the global battery anode market. Potential benefits include increased energy security, job creation and technological advancements in battery manufacturing.

In conclusion, the development of a graphite industry in Australia represents not just an economic opportunity but a strategic investment in a secure domestic supply chain and national resilience. The opportunity is here for the graphite industry to contribute to a sustainable and secure energy future.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14.
FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative.
He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.
Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance.","Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) recently reached a milestone, marking 20 consecutive years of participation in the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative and demonstrating a long-standing commitment to environmental conservation and protection efforts.

Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality D. Reid Wilson recognized FRCE for its 20th year as an Environmental Steward in the program Oct. 14. During the visit to the facility, Wilson presented FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Randy Berti with a plaque to commemorate the accomplishment.

Berti said the achievement is a testament to the depot’s dedication to environmental sustainability, regulatory compliance and stewardship.

“We have made it a priority to go above and beyond because we understand the importance of taking care of our planet,” said Berti. “We want to do everything we can do be good stewards of the environment and our community. We live, work and eat here and we want to continue to do so safely, well into the future. That is why we do everything we can to protect the health of our workforce and our neighbors, and the natural beauty here on the Crystal Coast.”

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Environmental Stewardship Initiative recognizes and supports companies and facilities that go above and beyond to reduce their impact on the environment. The program’s mission is to assist organizations in reducing their environmental impacts beyond regulatory requirements and recognize those that achieve and maintain this commitment.

FRCE Environmental Division Director Andrew Krelie said the depot was one of the earliest organizations in the state to earn the title of Environmental Steward in 2004 and is the only Department of War facility participating in the Environmental Stewardship Initiative. He said maintaining the Environmental Steward title for 20 years has been a collaborative effort among the entire workforce.

“FRC East sets aggressive environmental objectives that go far above the minimum compliance requirements because we are committed to being good stewards of the environment,” said Krelie. “To be able to say we have continued to raise the bar, met all our compliance requirements and gone above and beyond every year for 20 years straight is quite the achievement, one that has taken the entire workforce banding together to accomplish.”

The Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers three member levels: Partner, Rising Steward and Steward. Each level is designed to fit the organization’s needs based on the maturity of its environmental management system and performance success. The Partner level is the beginner level for organizations that are interested in developing a systematic approach to improving their environmental performance, whereas the Steward designation is given to organizations that have mature environmental management systems and are committed to exemplary environmental performance beyond what is required by law.

Stephen Azok, program manager for the depot’s environmental management system, said as a Steward, FRCE establishes at least three long-term objectives to improve its environmental performance. The depot’s current objectives focus on reducing the facility’s energy usage, decreasing how much industrial wastewater it generates, and increasing its landfill diversion efforts, he said.

“This year, we are putting two of our three goals in sustainment, which means we have reached those goals, but need to continue monitoring results to make sure we can maintain them,” said Azok. “In the meantime, we are now looking to establish new goals that are more aggressive. For example, we’re always looking to reduce our solid waste. If we find a way to avoid generating solid waste altogether, then we wouldn’t have to recycle it, which aids our landfill diversion efforts. It’s a harder objective to establish because it involves so many elements but if find a way to do it, we are going to.”

Azok said FRCE exceeded its landfill diversion goal for this year, achieving a 64% rate compared to the 62% target. He said FRCE actively seeks opportunities to donate reusable materials to local businesses and groups, which helps reduce waste and support the community.

“We are always looking for ways we can aid the community,” said Azok. “We reach out to local businesses to see if there’s anything that we generate that we can provide them, such as scrap wood or pallets. At one point, we were even donating our toner cartridges to churches and schools because they could recycle them. We are always looking for those kinds of partnerships. They help the community and help us be better stewards of the environment.”

FRCE aims to use 25% less energy in 2025 than it did in 2024, a target the facility is on track to achieve, said Azok.

Krelie said the depot has taken many steps to reduce the amount of energy it uses daily to achieve this goal, many of which have been simple fixes, such as replacing the facility’s old sodium vapor light bulbs with energy efficient LED bulbs. Additionally, FRCE has partnered with Duke Energy to help assess the facility’s energy usage and provide insight to reduce it, he said.

“Part of going above and beyond means doing everything we can to reduce our environmental footprint, even if it’s not required of us by law,” said Krelie. “Replacing the lead-acid batteries with lithium in our battery-powered carts because they are more energy efficient is a great example. With the old batteries, the carts had to be plugged in daily, which constantly used energy. Duke Energy also helped us find that we have lost a lot of energy in our compressed air system. We are working on getting that replaced now. Not having any leaks in our compressed air system will save a significant amount of energy and cost savings.”

Krelie said FRCE has reduced its wastewater generation by 65% this year, nearly doubling its original reduction goal of 36%. He said they were able to achieve such a significant reduction by closely monitoring each building’s usage and identifying areas of overuse.

“One of our buildings was using upwards of 70,000 to 80,000 gallons of processed water a day,” said Krelie. “The clean lines in that building were using a lot of rinse water when cleaning aircraft parts, and the water was running constantly. We were able to reduce that down to less than 10,000 gallons a day by simply analyzing the input and output and implementing simple controls, such as having the artisans shut the water valve at the end of the day.

“We smashed our wastewater reduction goal with just the savings in that building,” he continued. “Even though we met our desired end state, we need to stay aggressive. We don’t want to hang our hat on the fact that we met our goal early when we know we can do more. We tweaked that goal a little bit because it became easy once we saw how simple it was to effect change.”

Not only have these changes helped FRCE become more environmentally friendly, but many of them have helped save the depot money, allowing additional funds to be refocused on supporting warfighter readiness, said Krelie.

“There’s a huge financial benefit to all of this,” Krelie said. “We received a significant credit on our utility bill when we reduced that 70,000 gallons of wastewater per day to 10,000 gallons. And replacing the lightbulbs with LED meant our electric bill went down. Because we are a working capital fund, these savings go back to our total operating expenses at the end of the year. We remain good stewards of the environment so we can continue to do what we do best, and we love hearing the sound of freedom in this local community.”

Azok said the facility has developed and implemented many workflows and regulations into its operations to mitigate their potential effect on the environment.

“We have strict controls in place in our shops that use these materials to control their usage,” said Azok. “There’s a lot of testing involved to make sure we’re not sending out anything that could negatively affect the wastewater treatment plant. We also have emission control devices, such as the air filtration system in our aircraft paint barn, to help protect our air from any chemicals. All chemicals are strictly managed so that no one can check them out unless they are trained, authorized and have demonstrated that they can maintain positive control over them from the time they are purchased, to when they are used and disposed.”

FRCE also requires employees to complete annual environmental training courses to increase awareness and effectiveness, said Azok.

“Everyone, no matter what they are hired as, has to participate in annual environmental training,” said Azok. “There is the environmental management system training that offers a high-level overview of the environmental regulations that we have here at FRC East, and the hazardous communication course that teaches you how hazardous materials interact with each other, with the environment and how they are managed. There are also many other required courses that many of us take, depending on our job descriptions and the areas we work. Our goal with these is to teach employees about the products we work with and our processes so we can properly identify and mitigate any potential issues and continue to be good stewards of our environment, all while keeping the workforce safe.”

Being a part of the Environmental Stewardship Initiative offers FRCE many benefits, Azok said, including mentorship and collaboration opportunities with other businesses within North Carolina.

“At the Steward level, not only are you at the highest level in the program, but you also have the opportunity to coach those who are in the lower levels and problem solve with other companies at the Steward level,” said Azok. “It opens up the ability to reach out and get information from other members. For example, another Steward reached out to us and asked how we manage our lithium batteries, since we’re one of the few organizations in the state that deal with that amount of those size and type of lithium batteries. We provided that information, along with some of our emergency procedures. It’s a great avenue for networking.”

Krelie said although FRCE has seen many environmental successes this past year, the focus remains on continuous improvement.

“We take a proactive stance because we want to make sure that we are not doing anything that can cause damage,” said Krelie. “Our first priority is to protect and preserve our environment, our workforce and the people in our community. We stay on top of new technology and research because if we can make changes to improve our green procurement of chemicals or find a better way to dispose of something, even if it’s not a regulatory requirement, we want to do that. We don’t want to have to play catch up later on down the road.”",https://www.navair.navy.mil/themes/custom/navy/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-08 09:00:44.659540

He envisioned replacing America’s level of 1975 energy consumption with a 100 percent renewable system that does not replace 100 percent of the 1975 energy.
His view is that we should be substantially reducing per capita energy consumption as an integral element of the energy transition.
This seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying “do a carbon tax,” which is a fine idea, but it isn’t going to make electricity cheaper.
growth, then you clearly want a lot more electricity infrastructure, not just better demand-management.","I had an odd dispute with an energy policy wonk a few months ago in which I was saying that electricity is expensive in California — meaning that the price of electricity is high — and he was saying that it’s cheap, by which he meant the average household’s monthly electricity bill is not particularly high.

His point is true because the average California household uses a below-average amount of electricity compared to residents of other states. That’s in part because of energy efficiency standards, but it’s in part a function of weather and infrastructure.

They don’t use a lot of electricity for air conditioning in California because in large swaths of the state it’s generally not that hot in the summer. In the South, where you might think the mild winters would balance out the incredibly hot summers in terms of relative energy use, people tend to have inefficient, “good enough” electric resistance heaters for the occasional cold snaps (compared to places where it’s really cold, where people tend to burn gas or oil for home heat). So even though electricity is much cheaper in Alabama than in California, the average monthly electricity bill in Alabama is a lot higher.

Why does this matter?

Well, it’s a reminder that influential elements of the environmental movement are driven by their roots as a conservation movement. The core desire expressed here is to shrink the human footprint: to use less energy, build less stuff, and live more humbly and in harmony with a somewhat superstitious conception of “nature.”

You also see this in the Sierra Club’s strange journey on immigration, which they used to be very hostile to because of their degrowth values. They eventually dropped their anti-immigration stance and later became good progressive allies to the immigration advocates because of the awkward coalition politics.

But the Sierra Club and many other environmental groups didn’t drop the degrowth ideology.

They often say that they’ve dropped it, and I think they sometimes genuinely believe they’ve dropped it. But whenever the rubber hits the road, they are fundamentally more interested in learning to get by with less than in developing abundant clean energy.

And this is popping up in a serious way as the movement wrestles with rising electricity demand. Building a clean energy economy is going to require huge amounts of new electricity. That means tons of new generation and tons of new transmission infrastructure — gargantuan projects that will allow us to use electricity to power our cars, to cook our food, to heat our homes, and maybe eventually to ship our freight or provide heat for industrial purposes.

But instead of focusing on how to get all that electricity built as quickly and cleanly as possible, the greens want to impose tighter price controls on utilities, minimize infrastructure investment, and meet household energy needs with rationing.

The long war on utilities

Almost no one thinks that market competition works for electrical utilities. There are too many complexities involving public rights of way, and it’s too expensive to maintain multiple overlapping sets of transmission and distribution infrastructure that compete with each other.

There are a few ways to handle this non-competitive situation. One is public power, like you see with the Tennessee Valley Authority. Another is electric co-ops, of which there are many in the United States, but they’re generally small. A third is a regulated utility, where a private company acts as a monopoly provider but its rates are regulated by the government.

The utility model itself comes in two forms: “vertically integrated,” where the utility also owns power plants (this is most common in the Southeast), and “deregulated,” where, despite the name, the utility is highly regulated but purchases its actual electricity at market prices from competing generators. In both the vertically integrated and deregulated models, though, the utility’s profit margins and rate of return are capped.

What’s not capped is that if you build more infrastructure and sell people more electricity, you make more money. The point, traditionally, of utility regulation was to make electricity abundantly available. You prevent the utility from gouging its customers, but you encourage it to sell them more electricity.

Environmentalists have always hated this model, because they don’t think we should sell people more electricity. Amory Lovins and the Rocky Mountain Institute, for instance, spread the idea that the cheapest and greenest kilowatt-hour is the one you never use. Environmentalists want to promote conservation. They acknowledge that people need electricity, but they think that’s bad. If everyone can switch to different kinds of light bulbs so they don’t need as much electricity, that’s the win. They think the point of utility regulation should be to provide people with an adequate amount of energy to get by. That means there should be a positive financial incentive to get people to use less, rather than a positive financial incentive for the utility to build more and supply more.

Lovins — regarded as an authority by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra, and other major green groups — illustrates this well in his “soft energy path” charts. He envisioned replacing America’s level of 1975 energy consumption with a 100 percent renewable system that does not replace 100 percent of the 1975 energy. His view is that we should be substantially reducing per capita energy consumption as an integral element of the energy transition.

You can’t really make sense of anything these groups do without understanding that as the goal.

And of course it’s great to be less wasteful. But I think this is a fundamentally unappealing vision, which is why the groups that are promoting it tend not to state it as clearly as Lovins does. But with public anxiety about electricity prices rising, the opportunity has presented itself to kill two birds with one stone: if you can force utilities to accept a lower rate of return, you’ll address consumer demand for relief and achieve the long-term goal of handicapping energy infrastructure growth.

As you see greens try to address the political demand for affordability, keep your eyes peeled. There’s a big difference between an agenda to make energy more affordable through abundance and more affordable through rationing.

The soft path to rationing

Leah Stokes’s recent Atlantic article outlining ideas to make electricity cheaper is an example of both the agenda, and the tendency to rhetorically soft-pedal what the agenda actually is.

She writes that you could make electricity prices lower by cutting utilities’ rates of return, and that one benefit of this policy is that it would cause them to invest less.

Legislators could trim these profits directly by more closely aligning utilities’ guaranteed rates of return with their actual costs. Such adjustments could also limit utilities’ endless quest for more infrastructure.

I’m glad she said it so clearly here. Recently, Neale Mahoney and Bharat Ramamurti wrote an op-ed trying to convince people like me to worry less about price controls and see that those controls could be part of a one-two package of immediate consumer relief plus long-term supply-side measures.

And they definitely could be! But to understand the landscape, you have to understand that Stokes (a favorite at Sierra, League of Conservation Voters, Evergreen, and other mainstream green groups) doesn’t see the anti-supply impact of price controls as an undesirable downside — she sees it as a benefit. In their view, utilities are problematically overbuilding infrastructure, and we need to cut their rates of return, not just to save consumers money in the short term but to slow down utilities’ pace of investment.

Stokes offers two other ideas to make electricity cheaper. One is to take the portion of infrastructure costs that can be plausibly related to climate change off the ratepayers’ books, and instead allocate the blame for them to fossil fuel companies who will then be charged a fee. This seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying “do a carbon tax,” which is a fine idea, but it isn’t going to make electricity cheaper.

Then last but not least, she wants utilities to vary their pricing by the time of day.

In places with a lot of solar, including California, some installations are producing more energy than is being consumed, so some power is being wasted. If people shifted more of their electricity use toward the middle of the day, the grid’s overall costs would go down, because demand would decrease in later hours, when prices are the highest. And the easiest way to nudge people toward using that midday power is to make it cheaper — or even free.

Variable pricing seems like a reasonable idea to me (my uncle co-authored a paper advocating this a few years ago if you want a much more detailed version of the case), but it’s disingenuous to act like this is just going to be a case of cheap electricity in the early afternoon. To make this work, you need to have symmetrically higher prices at other times. More to the point, the green wing of the energy wonk community is suddenly buzzing in a frenzied way about responsive demand, as if this is some kind of magic alternative to major new capital investment, in a way that doesn’t make any sense to me.

Imagine if you electrified everything

A tell here, in my opinion, is that these takes often emphasize the question of data centers as drivers of new electricity demand. But imagine everyone decides tomorrow that AI is fake and nobody ever wants to build a data center again.

The climate movement itself has spent years prepping people to replace fossil fuels in cars, stoves, and furnaces with electricity. They want to ban gas leaf blowers and have people use electric ones instead. Electric boats aren’t quite ready for the mass market, but people are working on it. Electrifying heavy construction equipment, trucking, or freight rail seems further off, but one can imagine it happening and, again, it is specifically the climate movement that wants to do this.

Well, that means we’re gonna need a lot of electricity!

A small price nudge to encourage people to charge their electric vehicles at midday rather than in the evening is not going to replace the need for new infrastructure if you imagine a world where 100 percent of the cars are electric. And it’s definitely not going to work if you’re also electrifying home heating and larger and larger swaths of industry.

You of course do want to use infrastructure efficiently rather than inefficiently, but if you want to electrify large parts of the economy in the context of population growth and per capita G.D.P. growth, then you clearly want a lot more electricity infrastructure, not just better demand-management. That’s the appealing, optimistic vision of a modern dynamic approach to climate change.

But people who favor such an approach to climate change need to understand that the Stokes/Lovins vision that the green groups embrace is fundamentally different — they want decarbonization by rationing to avoid new infrastructure.

It’s important to be clear about the goal here because I think the progressive community raises reasonable questions about the whole regulated investor-owned utility model. There’s a lot to be said for the public power alternative!

But how we organize the utility sector is fundamentally less important than to what end we’re organizing it. If we replaced the investor-owned utilities of the Northeast with a T.V.A.-style agency, I think the goal should be to promote emissions reduction by making electricity cheaper and more abundant via a mix of natural gas, renewables, and transmission while hoping to participate in breakthroughs in nuclear and geothermal. And if we stuck with regulated utilities, I think the goal should also be to promote emissions reduction by making electricity cheaper and more abundant. We can debate the best policy mix to promote that goal, but we also need to debate the goal, and it’s one the green groups fundamentally reject.

They’d like you to see their posture as being more hardcore about climate change, but if you have a halfway realistic view of the politics, it’s not even that. People aren’t going to switch to electric cars and electric home heating if doing so raises their fuel costs, and you’re not going to have enough electricity to keep prices low in the context of electrification unless you build the infrastructure.

The case for ambition

Beyond the weeds of utility regulation, I’d like to motivate people to get off the soft path by reminding the world of the potential upsides of truly abundant energy.

One of the really big ones is the ability to do vertical farming.

This is a thing that people get excited about every few years because the benefits would be massive. Not only do vertical farms have a dramatically smaller geographical footprint than conventional farms, they are also wildly more resource efficient in terms of things like water and pesticides. The agriculture sector is responsible for dramatically more consumption of these resources than the overhyped data centers, but obviously people can’t just not eat food. The problem is that, offsetting all these benefits, a vertical farm would require lots of electricity to run, so it’s not within light-years from being cost-effective right now.

Similarly, if we could grow animal protein in a factory rather than raise livestock, we would achieve incredible ecological benefits and a massive reduction in cruelty. Powering such a factory with electricity is also in some sense more energy-efficient than growing crops to manufacture animal feed to give to chickens we then slaughter. But in a more literal sense, it would mean you’d need a ton of electricity.

It would also be nice to be able to actually do carbon removal to mitigate the harms of the global emissions overshoot that the world is all-but-certain to engage in. Perhaps this is doable, but it requires energy.

These somewhat utopian dreams are not policies for 2029 or even necessarily for 2050, but we ought to set high aspirations for a dynamic, cleaner, high-energy future. Sure, we should use our infrastructure as efficiently as we reasonably can. But the future ought to involve dramatically more electricity, which is going to mean dramatically more supportive infrastructure. A vision for utilities that doesn’t support that isn’t going to work.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fBpD!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13c59467-5f25-4182-810e-b283c0133762_8000x5998.jpeg",N,,2025-12-08 10:01:40.640451

The green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress halt the proliferation of energy-hungry data centers, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and for exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.

“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.

The push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new data centers, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 data center projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.

These seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing data centers.

This threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.

However, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”

Yet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming data centers for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a nonpartisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.

“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.

“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”

Hua said the causes of the electricity cost rises are nuanced, with aging transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.

But it is the growth of data centers to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.

More broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.

This focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.

At the current rate of growth, data centers could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars onto the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.

But it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, one of the groups behind the letter to lawmakers.

“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.

“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7487c3a8c1ce3e04080db3f644342c8d03f0a1c9/250_0_7493_5995/master/7493.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1485952012d8787a058afb4ae905f485",N,,2025-12-08 08:01:04.738153

This article was produced in collaboration with the Environmental Justice Oral History Project.

Whitney Parker can’t escape the steady stream of trash that flows into his rural hometown.

From sunrise to sundown, six days a week, heavy-duty garbage trucks rumble past his home en route to the approximately 1,000-acre Sampson County Landfill in Roseboro. The trucks deliver roughly 1.8 million tons of waste each year from 44 counties across North Carolina. The air in the surrounding area is permanently tinged with the odor of rotting meat, sewage, and chemicals that lasts long after the trucks are gone.

“I sit in my yard and watch 18-wheelers full of toxic waste drive by—20 or 30 trucks within an hour,” Parker said. “And people say, ‘That’s just how it is.’”

In addition to the landfill, animal feeding operations and processing facilities have long contributed to environmental challenges in Sampson County, placing a heavy burden on the predominantly and historically Black communities that call the area home.

Decades of advocacy by residents of Roseboro’s Snow Hill neighborhood—plus a lawsuit filed by an environmental legal group—culminated in a landmark cooperative agreement in December 2024 between the Canadian solid waste company GFL Environmental and the local group, Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

Since that deal was inked last year, GFL has updated its pollution and odor monitoring procedures surrounding the landfill and agreed to establish several recycling programs and water filtration systems across the Sampson County School District.

“It’s not to say that the problems have been completely eliminated; residents are still reporting some issues,” said Kyron Williams, the Snow Hill community liaison for the network. “But I think generally speaking, at least as far as has been expressed to me, there’s been pretty good satisfaction between now and last year.”

More recently, the company and community representatives have also begun to establish a new community center and a nonprofit organization. But GFL has missed key deadlines to acquire property for the community center.

And some residents say concerns about the landfill, which are supposed to be handled through a new complaint system, aren’t being meaningfully addressed. The odor from the landfill is still unbearable, locals say.

GFL Environmental did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the cooperative agreement or ongoing community concerns.

“Every time we demand A, B, C, D, we’re told, ‘Calm down, give them time.’ But this is a billion-dollar company,” Parker said. “It’s been a lot of promises and press releases—but if anybody wants to challenge what we’re saying, show us the receipts.”

From Farm to Foul

The last time Paul Fisher saw Snow Hill in its original state was in 1966, when he left to serve in the military. He remembers it as idyllic.

“It was a nice, quiet community. It was clean. Everybody knew everybody,” he said.

In 1970, Sampson County commissioners first allocated funds for a new solid waste program. The original plan called for several smaller municipal dumps scattered throughout the county. However, after a wave of resistance from majority-white neighborhoods, officials quietly shifted direction.

By 1973, with little public notice or community consultation, they selected the rural, predominantly Black community of Snow Hill as the site for a consolidated county landfill. Construction began in 1975, the same year Fisher returned from military service.

Fisher brought his two daughters and built a home on land about a mile away from the landfill that had been in his family since the early 1900s, hoping they could experience a similar childhood. But as they settled in, he noticed many of his former neighbors moving out.

Though ownership and operators of the landfill have changed hands over the years, eventually landing under the management of GFL Environmental, the burden of the county’s decision has remained with Snow Hill’s residents for nearly half a century.

Eventually, Fisher’s children moved away as well. “My children are a little skeptical about retiring and moving back here … and I wouldn’t blame them if they decided not to come back,” he said.

Maia Hutt, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the lawsuit sought to force GFL to address problems stemming from generations of deferred action by the facility.

“Prior to this court-enforceable settlement agreement, community members expressed that complaints of nuisance conditions—odor, vermin, traffic, and garbage truck spills—were going unaddressed,” Hutt said in an email.

According to the original 2024 lawsuit, PFAS, a family chemicals known to accumulate in the human body, have been sent to the landfill for years.

The lawsuit also claimed that significant methane emissions, groundwater and soil contamination, and other nuisances—such as roadway waste and pests attracted to the rotting smells—reduced the wealth and quality of life for residents.

The provisions in the cooperative agreement aim to help make Snow Hill livable again. “This was the product of a multiyear effort by residents, scientists, and local activists,” Hutt wrote.

Fisher says he knows better than to blindly trust GFL. “I think GFL wants to do things for the community—not just because they want to, but because the laws have been changed and they don’t have too much choice,” he said.

The Agreement at a Glance

Williams, who was one of the network’s founding board members and formally joined the staff in November 2024, has been working to ensure GFL lives up to its commitments. According to him, the agreement requires GFL to take action to curb pollution and provide economic and health support for residents. “We used the environmental laws we had access to to bring some relief to the residents of Snow Hill,” Williams said.

The agreement does this by requiring GFL to stop discharging PFAS into nearby surface waters and enacting strict limits and monitoring to ensure that discharges meet Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards. The company also must get state approval to temporarily treat contaminated water discharged from two landfill points. During the first two months, GFL was supposed to remove at least 50% of five key forever chemicals; within three months to a year, it must remove 80%; and after one year, the treated water must meet the EPA’s official drinking water limits for those chemicals.

Additionally, the agreement requires GFL to remove PFAS from its leachate, or the water contaminated when filtered through the facility’s waste, a historical first for North Carolina landfills. The landfill is also required to expand its air quality tracking by deploying methane-sensing drones and hiring an outside consultant to design a continuous monitoring system.

To date, GFL has submitted applications to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality requesting permits to remove the vast majority of PFAS in its wastewater. On September 24, the state responded by issuing a public notice requiring the installation of a groundwater remediation system to reduce PFAS discharge levels by 90%. The order took effect on November 15.

The facility has also begun installing a perimeter odor management system to collect data that the public can use to better understand what’s being emitted in real time. GFL launched a complaint hotline and website where residents can report offensive odors, truck spills, reckless trash truck driving, or any other problem causing harm or nuisance from the facility. GFL must respond to complaints within seven business days and meaningfully address them within 14 business days.

Guarded Optimism

There are signs of progress as the agreement approaches its one-year mark. A public-facing dashboard to monitor odor surrounding the facility went live in November. In addition to the updated pollution monitoring procedures, the landfill has established 10 recycling programs and agreed to implement water filtration systems across the Sampson County School District.

Jamie King, superintendent of the Sampson County School District, said GFL initially approached him about supporting a recycling program at all Sampson County schools, one of the original terms of the settlement agreement. GFL representatives also suggested a composting system, but King told them he didn’t see the purpose.

As a regular attendee of county commission meetings, King was familiar with residents’ concerns about potential water contamination near the Sampson County Landfill. He believed new water filtration systems would provide a far greater benefit for students. “I came across water filtration systems for that area of the county and asked if it was something [GFL] would consider for students,” King said.

Although routine testing had not detected pollutants in the district’s water systems, King said the new filtration systems, currently installed only in Lakewood High School with plans for expansion districtwide if funding allows, provide added assurance for students and staff while serving as a critical environmental education tool on local water quality.

Born from this community agreement will be a new nonprofit organization, the Snow Hill 501(c)(3), whose primary function will be to administer community development projects funded through this community agreement. The agreement requires GFL to establish a community-controlled fund, the Snow Hill Community Fund, to support Snow Hill revitalization efforts and a regular public meeting cadence for consistent updates and feedback.

“This component of the settlement will be what the people of Snow Hill make it, and I am heartened to see the community coming together to start the process,” wrote Hutt.

According to Hutt, the community and GFL have begun the joint process of selecting a site for a new community center and allocating the first round of Community Fund grants.

However, the company has missed key deadlines for property acquisition for the community center, and no architectural plans are available for broader community input. Williams attributes the delay to factors beyond GFL’s and the community’s control.

“I know a lot of the residents were generally concerned that GFL was refusing to be compliant. But it’s actually a question of finding someone in an area with suitable land that they want to sell,” Williams said.

GFL and the lawyers representing the community are currently in negotiations to extend the deadline for land acquisition given the lack of available land. There’s also concern about the cost of remediation and the quality of a center that’s located on polluted land. “This is a landfill, so you’re talking everything from possible contamination to diesel spills from all the trucks. There’s some mess there that just may be cost prohibitive.”

Parker says the community meetings held to date haven’t allowed for accountability, with representatives arriving unprepared to present and providing minimal tangible updates. Although GFL established a complaint system, all responses from the landfill have been limited to explanations of the problem or the odor’s cause; community members say there have been no escalations or meaningful steps to address complaints.

Combined with still-unbearable odors and industrial dump trucks that speed through the neighborhood at the expense of residents’ and children’s safety, many in the community remain skeptical that this agreement will bring change.

“The phrase we keep hearing is, ‘We’re working in good faith,’ but there’s no documentation, no proof,” Parker said. “A year later, we’re still waiting.”

Now in his 40s, Parker has lived in the Snow Hill neighborhood his entire life. While he doesn’t remember a time before the landfill dominated his family’s ancestral land, he does recall when the acrid stench and unending parade of garbage trucks didn’t define daily life in his community.

“We went from thriving and living in technicolor to existing in black and white,” Parker said.

As a child, Parker remembers helping his mother till her garden for their daily produce and riding ATVs through the woods. But he says fresh food and outdoor play were quickly replaced by burning eyes, sore throats, and restless nights that could only be soothed by the constant hum of fans and a rotating collection of air fresheners.

It wasn’t long before daily discomfort turned into health problems; many residents, Parker included, link the landfill to pervasive respiratory illness, cancer, and kidney disease among Snow Hill residents. “Middle school was when we started seeing family with bone cancer, asthma, lung disease,” he recalled. In 2021, Parker’s parents died after years of battling unexplained illnesses.

Williams said Fisher and Parker are not the first nor will they be the last to raise concerns about the agreement, noting that some would have preferred a more aggressive legal approach against GFL in pursuit of reparations for the decades of hardship the community has endured.

“The existing environmental laws and regulations are not really designed to compensate the people that have been harmed. If they want a more aggressive approach, or they’re seeking financial damages … they would need to find outside attorneys that specialize in those types of lawsuits,” Williams said. “There was definitely anger … and even some mistrust, and that’s perfectly understandable and valid.”

After nearly three decades fighting landfill expansion, Fisher continues to attend public meetings convened under the cooperative agreement.

Fisher says he feels especially compelled to stay tuned in to ensure that the money allocated for community use is appropriately spent. “One of my biggest concerns is making sure nobody is doing anything to advance themselves,” he said. “The agreement is for the people.”

Fisher remains hopeful that if this agreement leads to lasting change, his children might return home.

“I feel tied to the property itself and would love to stay around here, pass it on to my children,” he said.

The National Security Strategy (NSS) of the United States, released on December 4, 2025, by the Trump administration, outlines a fundamental reorientation of U.S. foreign policy centered on an “America First” doctrine.

The 33-page document replaces the previous administration’s focus on global competition between democracies and autocracies with a highly transactional approach prioritizing core national interests: homeland security, domestic economic strength, and unilateral action.

Here is a summary of the strategy’s core priorities and shifts:

1. Core Strategic Priorities

Elevating the Western Hemisphere: The strategy declares the Western Hemisphere as the United States’ top priority. It calls for asserting and enforcing a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine to restore American preeminence in the region, focusing on securing the border, controlling illegal migration, and using lethal force to combat drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations.

Economic Reindustrialization: Economic security is defined as national security. The NSS pushes for an aggressive reindustrialization effort, tax cuts, deregulation, and “energy unleashing” to bolster the domestic industrial and manufacturing base, secure supply chains, and protect against predatory trade practices and grand-scale intellectual property theft.

A New Military Focus: The strategy emphasizes building the world’s most powerful military, including a robust nuclear deterrent and next-generation missile defenses dubbed the “Golden Dome.”

2. Realigned Global Posture

Europe and NATO (Burden-Shifting): The document marks a sharp departure from traditional alliances, explicitly tying U.S. support for NATO to a massive increase in defense spending and burden-sharing by European allies. It contains highly critical language, warning of “civilizational erasure” in Europe due to migration and stating the U.S. will focus on “cultivating resistance” to Europe’s current trajectory.

China and the Indo-Pacific: While China remains a key competitor, the strategy redirects focus away from the previous administration’s view of it as the “primary threat.” It calls for containing China’s global ambitions and addressing issues like IP theft and supply chain vulnerabilities. A priority remains deterring conflict over Taiwan by maintaining military overmatch in the First Island Chain and pushing allies like Japan and South Korea to step up their defense investments.

Russia: The document is restrained in its treatment of Russia compared to the previous NSS. It largely positions the U.S. as an arbiter, stating that the U.S. will prioritize “managing European relations with Russia” to mitigate the risk of conflict between Russia and European states.

Middle East: The strategy significantly downgrades the Middle East, stating that the historic reason for U.S. focus (energy reserves) is obsolete due to U.S. energy self-sufficiency. It advocates for accepting the region and its leaders “as they are,” reducing long-term commitments.

“However, high expectations on the latter have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.” The new price target implies 6% downside from current levels.
Lucid Percoco downgraded Lucid from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $10.00, down sharply from $30.00.","Shares of Lucid and Rivian fell more than 3% in early Monday trading after Morgan Stanley cut its price targets and ratings on both electric vehicle makers.

The investment bank — which also downgraded Tesla but raised its price target — cited concerns over slowing EV adoption and the loss of federal tax credits.

Morgan Stanley’s auto research coverage is now led by analyst Andrew Percoco, who took over from Adam Jonas.

Jonas said last August he would switch roles within the firm to focus on physical and embodied artificial intelligence (AI), including autonomous vehicles, electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, space and humanoid robots.

Rivian

Percoco downgraded Rivian from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $12.00 — implying a downside of 33.1% based on the Friday’s closing price.

The analyst said the company faces significant challenges as it prepares to launch its mid-sized SUV R2 into a difficult market environment.

The $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on the last day of September, removing a key purchase incentive for consumers.

“Rivian faces outsized risk heading into 2026 as it launches its lower-priced R2 into a challenging EV market, where slowing adoption, loss of the $7,500 tax credit, and persistent consumer concerns (range anxiety, charging infrastructure, residual values, battery tech, affordability) create headwinds that a mass-market vehicle may struggle to overcome in the near-term,” Percoco wrote.

While the R2 expands the EV maker’s addressable market, the analyst warned of additional pressures on Rivian‘s existing lineup.

“We believe the company will also face residual-value pressure from R1 lease returns and potential demand cannibalization,” he added.

The company founded and led by RJ Scaringe says it will have annual production capacity for more than 150,000 R2 vehicles once ramped up, with an R2 completed on average every two minutes.

Percoco acknowledged Rivian‘s strengths but noted competition from Tesla‘s autonomous driving technology remains a concern.

“Rivian‘s strong design and performance help, but Tesla‘s rapidly advancing FSD will require greater conviction in Rivian‘s AV capabilities,” he wrote, adding that investors should “expect more details at Rivian‘s upcoming AI day on December 11th.”

Over the last few weeks, Tesla has been accelerating the rollout of new FSD (Supervised) versions in the US while starting test rides in several key European markets.

Looking at Rivian‘s financial outlook, Percoco forecasts that auto gross margins excluding credits will remain relatively stable in 2026 as R2 scaling reduces bill-of-materials costs, with software and services contributing incremental high-margin revenue.

The analyst projected a $2.9 billion adjusted EBIT loss for the year.

After approximately $300 million of working capital needs and $1.6 billion of capital expenditures, Percoco expects Rivian to burn $4.2 billion of free cash flow, though he noted the company should receive its next tranche of capital from Volkswagen upon completion of winter testing in the first quarter of 2026.

Rivian ranked first for the third consecutive year in Consumer Reports’ Owner Satisfaction ratings, which evaluates vehicles based on performance, comfort and usability.

According to the survey, 85% of Rivian owners would buy the company’s vehicles again, the highest score among the 26 automakers evaluated.

BMW ranked second with a 71% rate, while Tesla followed closely in fourth place with 69%.

Tesla

Percoco downgraded Tesla from Overweight to Equalweight with a price target of $425.00, up from $410.00.

Tesla shares closed at $455 on Friday and are up 12.7% year to date.

The stock reached its 2025 high at $474 in early November, just $14 below the all-time high of $488.54 registered exactly a year ago.

Following the Morgan Stanley note, shares traded 1.2% lower in Monday’s pre-market session.

Aside from the note, Chief Executive Elon Musk escalated over the weekend political tensions, urging to “Dissolve the EU and return power to the people.”

Morgan Stanley’s analyst said Tesla deserves a premium valuation given its leadership position across multiple sectors but noted the stock has moved closer to fair value.

“Tesla is a clear global leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing, renewable energy, and real world AI and thus deserving of a premium valuation,” Percoco wrote. “However, high expectations on the latter have brought the stock closer to fair valuation.”

The new price target implies 6% downside from current levels.

While acknowledging that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, Percoco cautioned investors to expect volatility ahead.

“We expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,” he wrote.

The analyst said Morgan Stanley conducted a comprehensive review of its Tesla model, adding humanoid robot valuation supported by the firm’s Global Humanoid team’s total addressable market analysis, expanding its robotaxi model with proprietary market research, broadening its Network Services model including Full Self-Driving, and moderating its Auto and Energy forecasts.

Lucid

Percoco downgraded Lucid from Equalweight to Underweight with a price target of $10.00, down sharply from $30.00.

The new target is equivalent to $1.00 when adjusted for the 1-for-10 reverse stock split that became effective in September.

Based on Lucid‘s closing price last Friday, the revised target implies downside of 25.5% and would represent a new all-time low for the California-based EV maker.

The analyst said Lucid‘s premium positioning offers some protection against near-term volatility from the expiration of federal EV tax credits compared to mass-market competitors.

“Lucid‘s premium positioning and higher ASPs help buffer near-term volatility from the loss of EV tax credits relative to other mass-market EV OEMs,” Percoco wrote.

He highlighted the company’s industry-leading battery efficiency, which led to a technology-licensing agreement with Aston Martin, but said long-term success depends on executing its expansion into more affordable vehicles.

“Its path to profitability hinges on successfully scaling its more affordable midsize platform,” the analyst wrote, noting start of production is expected in late 2026 with production ramping in 2027.

Percoco does not forecast Lucid reaching gross profitability until 2028. While operating expenses are expected to remain stable and EBIT losses per vehicle should improve from $216,000 in 2025 to $126,000 in 2026, he projects losses will persist until 2031.

The analyst also flagged significant dilution risk for shareholders, estimating the company will need to raise approximately $2 billion in equity by the second half of 2026 relative to its $4.6 billion market cap.

The bearish outlook contrasts with recent comments from Lucid management.

Chief Financial Officer Taoufiq Boussaid said last week in a fireside chat that the company will register a new sales record in the fourth quarter as new orders trend as expected.

Asked about the usual stronger quarter in the final months of each year, Boussaid said: “There is definitely some seasonality. So we tend to compare versus last year, obviously, versus previous quarter. So as it trends now, I mean, we will see quarter-over-quarter growth.”

The CFO did not provide specific sales or production targets for the quarter, nor did he reference the company’s 18,000-unit annual production guidance.

Meeting that target would require approximately 8,034 units in the fourth quarter — more than double the third quarter’s 3,891 units — based on the 9,966 vehicles produced in the first three quarters.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rivian_R3X_Ext_01.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 07:00:37.281298

The action is a major step on the road to a broad permitting compromise that members of both parties want to pass this Congress. But deep divisions persist between and within parties.

House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-W.Va.), for example, has been looking to secure support for the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776, which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act. It’s scheduled to reach the floor next week.

Many Democrats say it would go too far in cutting oversight of polluters and public participation. Far-right conservatives are now saying it would continue federal incentives for renewable energy.

Bills on the floor agenda this week are likely to pass easily. Some are even expected to advance with broad bipartisan backing under a process called suspension of the rules.

One sweeping measure, H.R. 3898, the “Promoting Efficient Review for Modern Infrastructure Today (PERMIT) Act,” cobbles together several Republican bills to facilitate Clean Water Act reviews.

The bill would limit state authority to block projects like pipelines, would add limits for environmental suits and would restrict EPA’s ability to veto Army Corps of Engineers permits.

The package has the backing of major trade groups. Environmentalists and most Democrats, on the other hand, argue the legislation would tie the hands of EPA and state regulators.

Also on deck this week, H.R. 3668, from Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), would amend the Natural Gas Act to empower the Federal Regulatory Agency Commission to accelerate pipeline reviews.

On the suspension calendar are: H.R. 4503, the “ePermit Act,” which would better digitize the permit process, and H.R. 573, the “Studying NEPA’s Impact on Projects Act,” which would direct the Council on Environmental Quality to publish an annual report.

NEPA bill drama

This week’s legislation includes key Republican demands in the broader permitting discussions. A bipartisan trade-off, in theory, could include a mix of faster reviews, litigation limits, permitting certainty for specific renewable projects, a transmission build-out and perks for mining.

Republicans have succeeded in rolling back NEPA’s reach on Capitol Hill and in the Supreme Court. But they want more. Democrats, for their part, are focused on promoting renewable energy, making sure that green generation can reach population centers and stopping President Donald Trump from attacking projects.

Westerman, trying to corral both sides, is running into trouble with House Freedom Caucus members who say his bill would give Democrats too much. They find a bipartisan committee amendment on permit certainty particularly egregious.

“The last thing we need to do with offshore wind is to tie the administration’s hands in stopping that ridiculously expensive source of energy that enriches foreign companies with American taxpayer dollars,” said Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) last week. “Unfortunately, that’s exactly what the ‘SPEED Act’ would do.”

Last week, Westerman went on the Newt Gingrich’s podcast to talk about the need for NEPA reform, echoing an argument that has been blaring from the White House: affordability.

“There’s probably not any one issue that effects every American more than NEPA other than tax policy,” he said, pointing to its impact on ports, airports, pipelines and the grid. “Some way or another the NEPA process effects all Americans,” he said.

Tom Pyle, president of the conservative American Energy Alliance, said the measure “shouldn’t be controversial since it is seeking to get NEPA back to its original intent.”

But he argued it should not be used as a bargaining chip for socializing the cost of transmission. “That would be a lopsided trade,” he said. “We would need way more than that.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/31/e8/d4341b0a4a118a9e48e27a6f1744/u-s-congress-78047.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 08:01:19.457063

Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip.
Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.","We are told we face a difficult choice: protect our water or secure our energy. This is a false narrative, manufactured by a foreign corporation and its allies to disguise their illegal occupation of our Great Lakes. The real choice before us, and the urgent duty before our state officials, is between upholding the law or capitulating to corporate power.

My remarks are directed to those in Lansing with the power to act.

An orderly, planned shutdown of Line 5 is not a concession; it is an affirmation. It is how we uphold the laws that protect the Public Trust Doctrine enshrined in our state constitution. It is how we defend state sovereignty by enforcing our Governor’s valid revocation of an easement that a corporation continues to violate with impunity. It is how we honor Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, respecting the original stewards of these waters whose survival and culture are non-negotiable.

Critically, moving forward with a shutdown is how we boost jobs and domestic energy security. Since the Snyder administration, studies have confirmed that alternatives exist, but corporate greed has blinded our decision makers. Shutting Line 5 means investing in Michigan labor to build and maintain modern, safer energy infrastructure, not relying on a 70-year-old line in the heart of our Straits to send Canadian oil to foreign markets. True energy independence is built on innovation and resilience, not on doubling down on a risky, outdated conduit.

Yet, we are trapped in a cycle of unreasonable court delays, a strategy employed by Enbridge to run out the clock and amplify their threats to our communities. Every day our state wavers in its political will to enforce its own laws is a day we normalize this illegality.

This moment sets a national precedent. If Michigan, surrounded by the world’s greatest freshwater system, cannot summon the courage to prioritize the Great Lakes over a Canadian oil giant’s profits, what state can? We are signaling to every corporation that they can defy environmental orders, manipulate legal systems, and place their infrastructure above the public interest. As a wave of data centers enters the chat, Enbridge is paving their way for lawlessness. We are telling our citizens and Tribal nations that their rights are secondary to corporate convenience.

We do not need more grandstanding. We need the bold leadership that was promised when the shutdown was ordered. We need leaders who see that enforcing the law is the pro-jobs, pro-sovereignty, and pro-American energy path.

The call is clear. Use every tool of State government to end this illegal occupation and manage a transition that protects our water and our workers. Demonstrate to the nation that when the health of the Great Lakes and the rule of law are at stake, Michigan will lead.

Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip. They are the foundation of our identity, economy, and future. Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.

The political will to act now is the only leadership worthy of this moment and this magnificent trust.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-86/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/dsc_0486-1024x6831765191816.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=ELY9iUS4,N,,2025-12-08 07:01:38.695449

While unconfirmed, various media reports suggest that the battery supply now under negotiation is intended for Mercedes’ mid-range and entry-level electric vehicles.
Korean media, however, reported that the contract was based on 46-series cylindrical cells, which are to be supplied from 2028 onwards.
Here, too, media reports identified the 46-series cylindrical cells as the subject of the contract.
Since the newly announced deal spans similar timeframes as the two aforementioned contracts, it seems logical that Mercedes has not ordered 46-series cylindrical cells again—though this is not yet certain.","Several Korean media outlets report, citing a regulatory filing from LG Energy Solution (LGES), that the new contract provides for the supply of LG batteries to Mercedes-Benz in North America and Europe over a period of seven years, from 1 March 2028 to 30 June 2035. However, LGES stated in its filing that the contract value and duration may still change, and no further details are currently available. For now, it remains unclear whether only battery cells or complete battery packs will be supplied.

The contract value of two trillion won, as reported by Pulse, the English-language edition of Maeil Business News Korea, represents around eight per cent of LGES’s revenue in the previous year. At that time, the company generated 25.62 trillion won. While unconfirmed, various media reports suggest that the battery supply now under negotiation is intended for Mercedes’ mid-range and entry-level electric vehicles. “Considering that the three major supply deals between the companies over the past two years were believed to involve cylindrical 46-series batteries for high-performance, high-end models, analysts view this new deal as targeted toward mid-priced vehicles,” the newspaper report states. No further details—such as form factor or cell chemistries—have been disclosed.

One thing is clear: the ties between both parties are strengthening. As early as October 2024, LG Energy Solution signed a contract with Mercedes-Benz for 50.5 GWh of batteries. Details remained scarce at the time, and it was unclear whether only cells or ready-to-install battery packs would be delivered. Korean media, however, reported that the contract was based on 46-series cylindrical cells, which are to be supplied from 2028 onwards. This September, another major deal covering 107 GWh was announced (75 GWh for delivery to the USA between mid-2029 and the end of 2037; 32 GWh for Europe between mid-2028 and the end of 2035). Here, too, media reports identified the 46-series cylindrical cells as the subject of the contract. If all details are confirmed, the total volume of the two contracts amounts to nearly 160 GWh of large cylindrical cells. Since the newly announced deal spans similar timeframes as the two aforementioned contracts, it seems logical that Mercedes has not ordered 46-series cylindrical cells again—though this is not yet certain.

Incidentally, according to further information from Korean portals, the September contract was only awarded after intense competition with Chinese battery manufacturers such as CATL and Farasis. Both companies, along with LGES, are already regular battery suppliers to the Stuttgart-based automaker. While Mercedes is also involved in a battery manufacturing joint venture, namely ACC, its demand far exceeds the planned output of ACC. This is particularly true as plans for two of the three ACC plants are currently on hold, and the proposed factory in Italy is reportedly on the verge of being scrapped.

Mercedes CEO Ola Källenius is therefore seeking stability in supplier relations: in mid-November, Källenius met with representatives of the LG Group in Seoul to discuss future collaboration in the mobility sector. The Mercedes top executive subsequently stated that Mercedes-Benz and LG share a common vision based on innovation, quality, and sustainability—and that they are working together to set new standards in the global automotive industry.

The bipartisan state law that created the program doesn’t mandate that HUB-certified businesses are granted state contracts, but sets goals that state agencies are encouraged to meet.
West disputed Hancock’s ability to alter the HUB program in such a significant way without the approval of the Legislature.
She credited the HUB program with her success winning government contracts soon after starting her business in 2016 and said she believes the Comptroller’s decision will cause her business to lose money.
Many companies use their HUB certification as a marketing tool, but now they will have to find other ways to attract customers, she said.","Julie Irvin Hartman started her Tuesday with welcome, but confusing news.

The application she had submitted weeks ago to renew her business’s certification as a Historically Underutilized Business had been approved, despite acting state Comptroller Kelly Hancock’s late October announcement that he was freezing the program intended to give businesses owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans a boost when seeking state government contracts.

But hours later, the comptroller’s office emailed Hartman again, notifying her and more than 15,000 other small businesses — nearly 97% of the certified HUB businesses in Texas — that they were being removed from the HUB program entirely.

Then her phone notifications exploded.

The owner of Tomball-based B2G Victory, Hartman has built her business around advising other small businesses about how to navigate the world of government contracting, making her the first call for many of her confused clients who also received the comptroller’s email.

“I’m the expert in this space and I’m charging expert fees, and telling people, ‘I don’t know,” Hartman said. “So what value am I providing? It’s tough right now … I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights.”

Hartman and thousands of other HUB-certified businesses have faced uncertainty since Hancock first announced the freeze of the decades-old program, arguing that it may run afoul of both the state and U.S. constitutions, without pointing to any specific violation. No state or federal judge has ruled the program unconstitutional.

The program launched in the 1990s and is administered by the Comptroller’s office, which certifies HUB businesses that can show a majority of their ownership is “economically disadvantaged” people — including women, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Americans and service-disabled veterans.

The bipartisan state law that created the program doesn’t mandate that HUB-certified businesses are granted state contracts, but sets goals that state agencies are encouraged to meet.

Hancock said it was necessary to freeze and review the program to ensure it complies with Gov. Greg Abbott’s January executive order banning programs that promote “diversity, equity and inclusion” from state agencies. Then the Comptroller’s office announced Tuesday that the HUB program will now only be available to small businesses controlled by veterans with a 20% percent or higher service-connected disability.

That decision excludes the vast majority of the previously HUB-certified businesses while maintaining the status quo for 485 disabled veteran-owned businesses, according to a May comptroller’s report. All 485 are owned by men, according to the report.

“Our nation’s veterans have always stepped up for us,” Hancock wrote in a statement Tuesday. “VetHUB is Texas’ way of stepping up for them — cutting red tape, restoring constitutional integrity and opening doors for the men and women who wore our nation’s uniform. These emergency rules ensure Texas’ state contracting is free from gender or race discrimination and keep the program centered on those who earned this support through their service.”

A frequently asked questions page on the Comptroller’s website assured HUB businesses with current government contracts that those agreements would be honored for the duration of the contract.

Garry Olson, owner of Austin-based IT solutions company Semper Feye Solutions and a service-disabled veteran, had spent weeks fretting over the possibility of losing his ongoing state contracts if the HUB freeze did not end before his certification expires in February.

“I have heard that there were issues with the program before, but I’ve never had any problems with it,” Olson said. “I was thankful to be a part of it, and I’m thankful to still be a part of it.”

Efforts to kill HUB program failed in Legislature

State Sen. Royce West, a Dallas Democrat who co-authored the 1999 bill that created the HUB program, said it’s a necessary tool to correct historical discrimination in government contracting.

“Black businesses, Hispanic businesses, women-owned businesses, all the other categories in the HUB statute were not able to have meaningful participation for procurement opportunities with the state,” West said. “Recognizing quotas would be illegal, we put together a good faith program to look at whether or not agencies are making good faith efforts to bring in those categories that have been historically discriminated against.”

Several Republican bills aimed at killing the HUB program entirely were filed earlier this year in the Legislature. They all died without making progress in either chamber.

West disputed Hancock’s ability to alter the HUB program in such a significant way without the approval of the Legislature.

“If we allow an officer not associated with the legislative body that passed the law signed by the governor to do this to this program, what else will they attempt to do that is outside the scope of their statutory authority?” West said.

Companies scrambling to adjust without HUB

Kate Kossack’s staffing agency, Cedar Park-based HireOps Staffing, was HUB-certified as a woman-owned business and is a subcontractor on a state contract in the health care field. She credited the HUB program with her success winning government contracts soon after starting her business in 2016 and said she believes the Comptroller’s decision will cause her business to lose money.

“In staffing, it’s hard to compete with bigger firms … Not having restrictions from the state will open the door to let (larger companies) do absolutely whatever they want,” Kossack said. “We could just be left in the dust.”

Helen Callier, who owns Kingwood-based BradLink LLC, a HUB-certified architectural design and project management firm, said she knows she will still be able to find work despite losing her HUB status, but her company will have to make changes. Many companies use their HUB certification as a marketing tool, but now they will have to find other ways to attract customers, she said.

“I know some folks that are sweating because they see their certification as the only means of doing business at the state level,” Callier said. “The bottom line is that’s not the case, but you have to suit up and go after it now.”

Hartman, the government contracting adviser, said losing her HUB status is unlikely to put her out of business, but she saw her revenue drop after the Comptroller’s office froze the program.

Hartman’s company is paid by procurement offices and chambers of commerce to host seminars explaining the certification process to other small businesses, and she said many of them have been canceled since the freeze began. Clients have hesitated to renew their contracts with her company after the freeze began, she added, and the company stands to lose as much as 25% of its annual revenue this year alone.

As she fields calls from confused clients and works to interpret the latest guidance from the Comptroller, Hartman has spent the past week driving back and forth between the Houston area and Austin as she moves her father into hospice care.

“I’m having to make a decision between what’s right for my industry, what’s right for my company, what’s right for my clients and what’s right for me as a daughter being there for my family,” Hartman said. “I’ve been an entrepreneur for 23 years … this has been the hardest year.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251204-Julie-Irvin-Hartman-HUB-LS-07.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-08 07:01:16.507030

For us at Rolec and other businesses in the marina sector, it is a mindset and an ongoing commitment that combines ethical responsibility with practical business sense. Done properly, it is about anchoring changes that last and not simply ticking boxes.

‍We all know that the marina sector is closely tied to nature. Coastal and inland waters are delicate ecosystems and those who manage, operate and develop marinas cannot ignore their duty to protect and preserve. Visitors increasingly expect clean energy, waste reduction and sustainable infrastructure and not as optional extras. The challenge is not whether we can afford to act, but whether we can afford not to.

A longstanding commitment

The most responsible companies were already taking steps that aligned with environmental stewardship long before “sustainability” became a boardroom talking point. At the time, many of these decisions weren’t branded as such, we simply viewed them as good practice.

For example, using local supply chains reduced unnecessary transport miles and supported regional economies. Engineering products for durability meant fewer replacements, lower material usage and extended product life cycles. Minimising waste was about efficiency and diligence. On Rolec’s part, these principles were quietly embedded into the company’s operations long before they became part of environmental, social and governance (ESG) checklists.

At its core, sustainability has always been about consciously building for the future. Decisions made in design, sourcing and manufacturing directly affect customers, industry and future generations. ISO 14001 certification - as we achieved in 2015 - can formalise our environmental management systems and give structure to future sustainability initiatives.

The strength of manufacturing control

The strength of manufacturing contro

As UK manufacturers, Rolec maintains full control over the build and development of our core product range. This visibility across the entire life cycle - from concept to creation, delivery and ongoing maintenance - gives us opportunities to implement positive innovations at every stage.

For example, by upgrading our solar array and reducing our consumption of heating oil across the site, we achieved an estimated annual CO₂ saving of 76,410kg. Battery storage can also capture excess solar energy to power factories and charge electric vehicles without drawing from the grid. These steps not only reduce emissions but also improve energy resilience, something that many marinas are equally striving to achieve as energy prices fluctuate and sustainability targets tighten.

Reducing the size of packaging is another simple way that companies can become more sustainable. After we reduced the size of our packaging, we could ship 50 percent more products per pallet, which has cut transport-related emissions by 33 percent and lowered logistical costs. This benefits both our operations and operators who are conscious of supply chain impact. At the same time, we ensured all materials used in preparing products for shipping are certified by the UK’s Forest Stewardship Council and 100 percent recyclable. A switch to water-based inks further reduced our carbon footprint by nearly 40 percent. These measures may sound incremental, but collectively they demonstrate how small, thoughtful decisions build towards meaningful results.

Closing the loop

Waste is another area where continuous improvement can deliver change for sustainability-conscious companies across the marina industry. Not only should manufacturing refuse be diverted to recycling facilities, but any remaining waste can be converted into solid recovered fuel (SRF) to avoid sending things to landfill. At Rolec, at the time of writing, 70 percent of our manufacturing refuse is diverted to recycling facilities, and the remaining 30 percent of waste material is converted into SRF.

This approach reduces environmental burden while supporting a circular economy, meaning one where raw materials are continuously repurposed. For the marina sector, the concept of circularity has particular resonance. Marinas generate waste ranging from packaging and plastics to maintenance residues, and every site has a role to play in ensuring these materials are handled with care throughout multiple life cycles.

ESG beyond compliance

Today, ESG factors dominate the conversation around a green future. But the real test is ensuring that these commitments go beyond compliance. ESG for show does nothing to serve the long-term interests of businesses, communities or natural environments.For marinas, ESG must be genuine and measurable. Coastal protection, biodiversity, energy efficiency and the experience of berth holders all intersect in ways that cannot be managed through surface-level initiatives. Customers are discerning and regulators are watching.

The businesses that will thrive are those that view ESG not as a hurdle, but as an opportunity to enhance operations and work towards an ever more sustainable future.Our role as manufacturers is to align our processes and supply chains with these long-term goals. That means designing durable products, reducing emissions, managing waste ethically and providing infrastructure that helps marinas meet their own sustainability goals.

‍Looking ahead

‍No single company can claim to have “solved” sustainability. The nature of the challenge is that it demands constant progress, adaptation and shared responsibility. The real impact comes from working together, and collaborations across the industry can deliver holistic solutions that help marinas achieve better energy management, more effective solar initiatives, measured resource consumption and long-term strategic development.

As Rolec’s Commercial Director, Holly Brown, put it: “Sustainability in practice is about doing what’s right because we always have and because we always will.” That’s why sustainability efforts should not be a finite project, but instead an ongoing process. Each year brings new opportunities to reimagine, refine, reduce and renew no matter what the industry, and the marina sector is no different. The real measure is not in what one says, but in what one does.

Ottawa, Ontario--(ACN Newswire - December 8, 2025) - Focus Graphite Inc. (TSXV: FMS) (OTCQB: FCSMF) (FSE: FKC0) (""Focus"" or the ""Company""), a leading developer of high-grade flake graphite deposits and innovator of next-generation lithium-ion battery technology, is pleased to announce that it has moved from conditional approval to a fully executed, non-repayable contribution agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Natural Resources Canada (""NRCan"") for funding up to $14,062,500 under the Global Partnerships Initiative (""GPI"").

The Agreement formalizes the federal government's support for Focus Graphite's project titled: ""Transformation of Canadian Flake Graphite into Ultra-High Purity Battery & Advanced Materials Using Electrothermal Fluidized Bed Technology"" (the ""Project""). The Project unites Canadian, Ukrainian, and U.S. partners to produce ultra-high purity graphite for global battery, aerospace, defence, and advanced material markets.

The Agreement provides non-dilutive funding for the development, piloting, and commercial demonstration of Focus's clean electrothermal purification process, enabling conversion of Quebec sourced natural flake graphite into ultra-high purity anode and advanced materials products. The Project also advances broader NATO, G7, and European policy objectives for secure, diversified, and ESG aligned critical mineral supply chains.

Once complete, the demonstration system is expected to produce purified graphite at volumes sufficient not only for downstream qualification, but also scalable to supply meaningful quantities to defence, aerospace, energy storage, and advanced materials markets. This production capability represents a major step toward commercial readiness and supports the Company's downstream strategy by enabling Focus to deliver high purity material for evaluation and early market entry while continuing to advance its mining projects and longer-term processing infrastructure.

""Execution of this Agreement significantly strengthens Focus Graphite's ability to help supply our allies with secure, ESG aligned, high purity graphite,"" said Dean Hanisch, Chief Executive Officer. ""Chinese graphite is currently embedded throughout North American military, aerospace, and energy systems, creating strategic vulnerabilities across the entire allied value chain. The ability to produce ultra-high purity material domestically, and process it using a clean, chemical free purification method, positions Focus to directly support the shift toward reliable, non-Chinese sources of strategic critical minerals.""

""This Agreement unlocks our ability to move qualified graphite samples to international partners at a much faster pace, which is essential for advancing offtake discussions,"" said Jason Latkowcer, Vice President of Corporate Development. ""We will continue to advance our Lac Knife and Lac Tetepisca projects while simultaneously delivering the high-purity material that allied partners require to validate Canadian graphite within their defence, aerospace, energy storage, and advanced-materials supply chains.""

For years, North Carolina did this, taking a broad view on whether isolated and semi-dry wetlands deserved additional protections.
Thus if the proposed EPA rule becomes law, it would strip protections from North Carolina wetlands that previously had to meet more stringent state regulations.","Environmentalists worry the change could increase flooding risks and allow unsafe development in North Carolina.

Supporters of the new rule state it will provide clarity for landowners and reduce regulatory burdens.

North Carolina law now mirrors federal wetland protections, meaning the state will not offer more stringent regulations.

Following a trend that started in 2023 with a U.S. Supreme Court decision, it's been a rough few years for North Carolina's wetlands and their supporters.

Now an announcement by the Trump administration that it could further water down federal protections for certain types of wetlands has raised more red flags among environmentalists, emergency managers, and local officials. They are worried about what losing even more marsh areas could mean in a state that's shown itself to be vulnerable to flooding from heavy storm events like 2016's Hurricane Matthew and 2018's Hurricane Florence − weather events that are expected to increase in coming years and decades thanks to climate change.

Some officials also fear the removal of wetland protections will see development allowed in these historically ""wet"" areas, putting additional people and properties in harm's way.

""Wetlands are an important line of defense in North Carolina’s flood-prone communities,"" said Will McDow, associate vice president with Environmental Defense Fund, in a news release. ""With this ruling, we may see significant decline in healthy wetlands and watch developers build unsafe housing that either floods or increases flooding to neighbors.”

What's new?

Two years ago the Supreme Court released a decision that dramatically reduced the protections offered to wetlands under the federal Clean Water Act. The court said only wetlands that have a ""continuous surface connection"" that make it ""indistinguishable"" from a federally protected waterway should be protected by the law. That meant isolated wetlands or areas that are only ""wet"" during certain times of year could lose their protections.

Prior to the ruling, isolated wetlands and wetlands that are only wet for part of the year, like pocosin wetlands that are common in many areas of Eastern N.C., had been protected in many states, including North Carolina, through a broad interpretation of what constitutes a federally protected wetland.

While the Supreme Court said what the requirement for federal protections of wetlands should be, it didn't define what constitutes a surface connection or what makes one wetland indistinguishable from another.

On Nov. 17, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to float a new rule that ""would establish a clear, durable, common-sense definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act.""

What would be the impact of the proposed rule?

The EPA's proposed new definition would exclude wetlands that abut or touch streams that do not flow during dry periods. It also could exclude ephemeral streams and ponds, which sit dry for much of the year and only fill up only after rains. The National Resources Defense Council has estimated up to 55 million acres of wetlands nationwide could lose federal protections under the new language.

According to an EPA release, the proposal ""will cut red tape and provide predictability, consistency, and clarity for American industry, energy producers, the technology sector, farmers, ranchers, developers, businesses, and landowners for permitting under the Clean Water Act.""

Lee Zedlin, head of the EPA, said the new rule would return control of private property back to landowners and out of the hands of bureaucrats and regulators.

""We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule,"" he said. ""No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.""

For years, farmers and developers have claimed the environmental community has overstated the economic, wildlife, water quality, and flood-control benefits of isolated and ""pocket"" wetlands that aren't part of larger natural systems.

They also said the old interpretation of which wetlands, like manmade drainage ditches, should receive federal protection made life difficult for farmers and limited what property owners could do with their land, hampering economic development opportunities in many communities.

What about flooding?

But environmentalists and others say stripping protections from many inland wetlands will worsen an already worrisome situation.

They say North Carolina has millions of acres of isolated and semi-dry wetlands that will see their protections watered down According to the Southern Environmental Law Center, that includes an estimated 527,000 acres of wetlands in the Cape Fear River watershed. But that number could increase even more if the EPA's narrow interpretation of what wetlands deserve protection becomes law.

From an environmental point of view, scientists say non-tidal wetlands are among Mother Nature's most valuable natural resources. They act like sponges, absorbing floodwaters and allowing the water to seep back into the ground, recharging groundwater supplies and eventually deep aquifers. Wetlands also provide vital habitat for a wide swathe of flora and fauna species.

Because they slow down water flows, wetlands also are very effective in removing contaminants. They also help store carbon in their soils, something that's seen as increasingly important as the world continues to pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change.

“Water moves in ways we can’t always see, and wetlands that look isolated can still be connected to other bodies of water,"" said Dr. Stacy Woods, a research director with the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a release. ""The revised definition will leave these wetlands at risk of further degradation, which could harm the rivers and streams that people in the United States depend on daily for clean water.""

Opponents of the pared-down definition of wetlands said there's also an economic component involved in the EPA's proposal.

McDow with Environmental Defense Fund said the U.S. already spends billions annually responding to disasters created by allowing development in risky areas. This new proposal could see that figure increase exponentially.

Weren't N.C.'s semi-dry and isolated wetlands previously protected?

While federal rules are the minimum requirements, states have the option of adopting additional protections and requirements, something California often does with its environmental regulations.

For years, North Carolina did this, taking a broad view on whether isolated and semi-dry wetlands deserved additional protections.

But the N.C. Farm Act of 2023 limits state protections of “wetlands” to essentially those enshrined in the federal Clean Water Act, and thus now mirrors the watered-down federal protections. Thus if the proposed EPA rule becomes law, it would strip protections from North Carolina wetlands that previously had to meet more stringent state regulations.

After a public comment period and some public hearings, the proposed EPA rule could become law early next year.

When 95% of climate scientists confirm climate change is real, our planet is warming, it seems there would be wisdom in taking the side of caution.","NREL has a rhythmic resonance that won’t be matched by NLR, Colorado’s newly christened National Laboratory of the Rockies. Nearly lost to memory is how the National Renewable Energy Laboratory authorized by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 was preceded by the Solar Energy Research Institute (SERI), which opened in 1977 on the mesa east of Golden. It was Chris Wright, a Colorado oil-and-gas fracking mogul appointed as the Secretary of Energy by the Trump White House, who announced this most recent name change. Originally created in the wake of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, NREL’s research focus has been development of ever more efficient energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Nearly every president during the past 35 years has made at least one visit to this premiere sustainable energy research facility.

It’s apparent more than a name change is now in store for the laboratory. DOE’s announcement explains, “The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL. We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources.” It seems likely this means much of the lab’s current work enabling a sustainable energy future will be mothballed in favor of “clean coal” and petroleum technologies reflecting… the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research.” This policy trajectory from pioneering the search for an environmentally sound energy strategy to a “burn it while you have it” philosophy represents a Republican about-face over the past half-century, both nationally and here in Colorado. It was President Richard Nixon and congressional Republicans who created the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, proudly pointing out the joint origin of the terms conservative and conservation. It was Ronald Reagan who observed, “Preservation of our environment is not a liberal or conservative challenge, it’s common sense.”

In 1979 both chambers of the Colorado legislature, which each enjoyed a two-thirds Republican majority, created the Colorado Energy Research Institute (CERI) located at the School of Mines in Golden. It was another legislative response to long lines statewide at gas pumps resulting from the Arab embargo and was initially focused on conservation measures, including social behavioral programs like carpooling. At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency was focused primarily on pollution clean-ups following the 1969 fires on the surface of the Cuyahoga River in Ohio, and a decade later the Love Canal poisoning of domestic water supplies detected in 1980. At the same time, acid rain destruction of northeastern forests followed by the 1981 Montreal protocol to protect and restore the ozone holes over the poles enhanced the credibility of environmental regulation. This attention was abruptly reversed with the arrival of the Reagan administration and the appointment of another Coloradan, Anne Gorsuch (mother of Supreme Court Justice Neil), as the administrator of the EPA.

Gorsuch cut the agency’s budget by 20% and its staff by 25%. Rita Lavelle, her deputy, so mismanaged the superfund program she would later be sent to a federal prison. Resigning in 1983, Anne Gorsuch was replaced with the original EPA administrator appointed by Nixon in 1969, well-regarded former Republican Congressman Willam Ruckelshaus with a charge to restore environmental competency for the Reagan administration. Although there had been sporadic scientific indications since mid-century carbon dioxide build-up in the atmosphere was likely contributing to climate change and/or “global warming,” it wasn’t until the 1990s national attention turned to this economic and public health threat. Early in the decade, Colorado’s Republican legislators quietly shuttered CERI, although its remnants live on in comparable research efforts at CSU and the University of Colorado. The United Nations began to pay attention in the 1980s to climate issues, convening a periodic policy roundelay that has mostly sounded alarms with little concrete action.

As the public debate between environmental groups and the fossil fuel industry heated up, along with annual average temperatures, congressional Republicans began to migrate toward climate skepticism while Democrats placed renewable energy and sustainable policy as centerpieces of their political agenda. Nonetheless, it was George W. Bush’s administration when EPA identified carbon dioxide as a pollutant shortly after the turn of the 21st century. This designation was affirmed by the Supreme Court, although it is expected to be challenged again now that the Supreme Court has overturned its Chevron precedent. Stripping the EPA of the authority to regulate CO2 in our atmosphere would throw open the door to unlimited fossil-fuel emissions. With a president who labels climate change a hoax and a Democratic “con”, and his Department of Energy claiming, “Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs and help this country meet its energy demand. The National Laboratory of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” We can guess where national energy policy is headed.

I suspect a sizeable share of Republicans harbor doubts about this change in direction. At the same time, some Democrats have begun to question whether voters really care about climate change. That may be a misreading of polls where an overwhelming majority express their concern even if they don’t make it a priority. When 95% of climate scientists confirm climate change is real, our planet is warming, it seems there would be wisdom in taking the side of caution. Even if this prediction proves wrong, there seems to be both logic and prudence in pursuing sustainable energy technologies. NREL and its partners have already driven the cost of renewable energy generation substantially cheaper than fossil-fuel power.

Since 1973, the United States has become the world’s largest petro-carbon producer, so we no longer face the risk of fuel shortages from an embargo. Good for us, we’re now energy independent. My advice to the NLR staff is to save their NREL letterhead. It won’t be long before a new president restores their name and international reputation for excellence.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/e14624bd66e223ef3f050d5b1a37255d.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:39.925027

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has circulated detailed data on India’s installed solar manufacturing capacities to the Finance Ministry and key non-banking financial companies.

The move is aimed at improving the quality of loan assessments for new clean energy manufacturing proposals.

The information has been shared with the Department of Financial Services and major lenders, including PFC, REC, and IREDA. It covers the entire solar photovoltaic value chain, including modules, solar cells, ingots and wafers, and polysilicon. Details of supporting industries, such as solar glass and aluminium frames, have also been included.

Officials say the data will help financial institutions take an informed approach when reviewing loan applications. It is expected to encourage lenders to support manufacturing projects across upstream segments, rather than confining their exposure to module-making units.

The guidance will also make it easier to evaluate proposals for ancillary components essential to the sector’s growth.

The Ministry stressed that it has not instructed banks or NBFCs to halt lending to renewable energy developers or to equipment manufacturers. Instead, the exercise is meant to expand confidence in the sector and guide future financing decisions.

“It is hereby clarified that MNRE has not issued any advisory to Financial Institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities,” said the official statement.

The government has reiterated its goal of building a self-reliant and globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem. Several policy tools support this mission, including the Production Linked Incentive scheme for high-efficiency modules and measures designed to strengthen the position of domestic producers.

These interventions have delivered significant results. India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has grown from 2.3GW in 2014 to around 122GW now listed in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers.

MNRE says it will continue to work with stakeholders to strengthen infrastructure, promote innovation and ensure India remains on track to achieve 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

As of 31 October 2025, the installed capacity from non-fossil sources stands at about 259GW, with 31.2GW added in the current financial year up to October 2025.",https://www.electronicsforyou.biz/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Solar-Panel-880x579.jpeg,N,,2025-12-08 08:00:59.986249

For more than a century, Big Oil lobbying has tyrannized American climate and tax policy, driving climate catastrophe while deepening economic inequality. Lavish tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies help explain why corporate giants like Chevron enjoy single-digit tax rates – lower than what many nurses or firefighters pay. After fossil fuel lobbyists flooded COP30 in unprecedented numbers, outnumbering nearly every other country’s delegation and stalling calls for a rapid fossil fuel phaseout, it’s more transparent than ever how the fossil fuel industry maintains its grip on global climate policy.

In the U.S., aggressive Big Oil lobbying has secured enormous government giveaways so extensive that the largest U.S. oil and gas companies now pay more in taxes to foreign governments than to the U.S. Treasury, finds a recent report by the FACT Coalition.

The report analyzed the financial disclosures of 11 U.S. oil and gas companies with extensive overseas operations and concluded that decades of heavy industry lobbying has engineered a U.S. tax code that pays for a dying fossil fuel industry, specifically for new oil and gas development abroad.

At the report’s launch in D.C. earlier this fall, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) explained how U.S.taxpayers are effectively forced to subsidize fossil fuel production through a tax code highly favorable to Big Oil. The report’s researchers explained that under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) regime, multinational companies that shift operations offshore already receive a 50 percent income tax deduction. But Big Oil lobbying has successfully created special exemptions allowing the largest fossil fuel companies to bypass all U.S. tax on foreign oil and gas extraction income.

As a result, despite producing more oil and gas domestically than in all other countries combined, American multinational oil and gas companies collectively pay more in taxes to foreign governments than to the U.S. While domestic operations account for more than 57 percent of total upstream production among the companies studied in the report, they generate less than a quarter of total taxes due.

ExxonMobil, for example, extracts 31 percent of its global oil and gas domestically, but owes only 10 percent of its total taxes in the U.S. Instead, ExxonMobil reported paying nearly five times as much tax to the U.A.E as to the U.S. in 2023 and 2024. Similarly, in 2023 Chevron paid a combined $6.25 billion to Nigeria, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea, compared to just under $2 billion paid to the U.S. government.

Before Trump’s 2017 tax law, corporate income earned abroad from refining, transporting, and selling oil was taxed immediately at the full U.S. rate. But Trump’s Big Oil tax breaks shifted this income into GILTI. Although the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tried to curtail government subsidies to fossil fuels, the 2025 “One Big Beautiful Bill” expanded 2017-level tax giveaways, including more direct incentives for foreign drilling. To secure the sweeping benefits contained in the 2025 tax law, the industry’s largest players spent nearly $20 million lobbying Congress in the six months preceding the bill’s passage.

The bill adds $30.8 billion per year in existing subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, restores federal royalty rates to their pre-IRA levels of 12.5-16.7 percent, and introduces a new carveout allowing oil and gas companies to deduct intangible drilling costs (IDCs) – which represent 60-80 percent of total well expenses – from income subject to the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) (a 15% minimum tax on corporations earning more than $1 billion in book profits). The president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), said that Trump’s 2025 tax reform “includes almost all of our priorities.”

Allowing the wishes of Big Oil to take precedent over the wellbeing of people and the planet is dooming our shared ecosystem. Today, U.S. taxpayers not only subsidize the fossil-fuel industry by nearly $35 billion every year, they also shoulder more than $100 billion annually in climate-related costs. A Brookings study estimates that climate change now costs the average U.S. household $220 to $570 per year.

Meanwhile, the companies driving these damages continue to profit. Chevron and ExxonMobil rank among the world’s five highest-emitting corporations, and a 2025 Nature study estimates that each is responsible for nearly $2 trillion in climate damages. The report notes that federal handouts to U.S. fossil fuel companies operating overseas are especially damaging. They erode the U.S. tax base, accelerate the climate crisis, undermine American energy independence, and fail to generate well-paying domestic jobs.

Working-class people are paying for the continued life-support of an already dying industry that’s fueling the climate crisis. Erich Pica, President of Friends of the Earth, noted during the report launch that without federal subsidies, 60 percent of U.S. oil and gas production would be economically unviable. This sentiment has been well known by economic and political advisors across the political spectrum for decades. For instance, the report quotes Kevin Hassett, a current Trump top economic advisor, who said in a 2006 article that, “ending subsidies for fossil fuel production would level the playing field among energy sources and shift us from a policy of promoting fossil fuel supply to encouraging a reduction in fossil fuel consumption.” The entrenched government support incentivizing our current extractive economy starves the renewable energy sector of crucial federal investment necessary to curb polluting emissions. And eliminating these tax breaks would save U.S. taxpayers more than $75 billion over the next decade.

The FACT Coalition recommends several essential reforms to counter traditional pro-oil tax policies. Eliminating domestic fossil fuel tax preferences and subsidies that fund oil and gas production abroad, ensuring that multinational corporations cannot shift production overseas to scapegoat domestic tax rates, and strengthening corporate tax transparency policy to include how much companies pay in taxes country-by-country.

“Tax fairness is climate justice,” Whitehouse concluded his remarks at the report launch.

Corporate and political greed deepens multigenerational economic vulnerability by eroding safety nets like SNAP and Medicaid, while financially and politically killing the potential of a thriving renewable energy sector that could create stable, well-paying jobs to replace those declining under Big Oil. Our government continues to prop up oil and gas companies over people and the planet, and is fueling climate disaster at home and abroad. We must refuse to let our paychecks fund the industry that is destroying our homes, our lands, and our loved ones.

Duke Energy has already paid hundreds of North Carolinians to let it tap power from their home storage systems when electricity demand is highest. It’s Duke’s first foray into running a ​“virtual power plant,” in which the company manages electricity produced and stored by consumers, much as it would control generation from its own facilities.

In September, the utility proposed a similar model for its nonresidential customers, asserting that the scheme will save money by shrinking the need for new power plants and expensive upgrades to the grid. The recognition signals a way forward for distributed renewable energy and storage as state and national politicians back away from the clean energy transition.

The initiative now needs approval from the five-member North Carolina Utilities Commission, where the virtual-power-plant model has faced some skepticism. But the apparent merits of Duke’s plan, which has broad backing, may be too enticing for commissioners to ignore — especially when the state is grappling with rising rates and voracious demand from data centers and other heavy electricity users.

“In an era of massive load growth, something that should lower costs to customers while helping meet peak demand — to me, it’s an absolute no-brainer,” said Ethan Blumenthal, regulatory counsel for the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, an advocacy group. ​“I’m hopeful that [regulators] see it the same way.”

Duke’s trial residential battery incentives grew out of a compromise with rooftop solar installers. Like many investor-owned utilities around the country, the company sought to lower bill credits for the electrons that solar owners add to the grid. When the solar industry and clean energy advocates fought back, the scheme dubbed PowerPair was born.

The test program provides rebates of up to $9,000 for a battery paired with rooftop photovoltaic panels. It’s capped at roughly 6,000 participants, or however many it takes to reach a limit of 60 megawatts of solar. Half of the households agree to let Duke access their batteries up to 18 times each year, earning an extra $37 per month on average; the other half enroll in electric rates that discourage use when demand peaks.

The incentives have been crucial for rooftop solar installers, who’ve faced a torrent of policy and macroeconomic headwinds this year, and they’ve proved vital for customers who couldn’t otherwise afford the up-front costs of installing cheap, clean energy.

But the PowerPair enrollees already make up 30 megawatts in one of Duke’s two North Carolina utility territories and could hit their limit in the central part of the state early next year, leaving both consumers and the rooftop solar industry anxious about what’s next.

Duke’s latest proposal for nonresidential customers — which, unlike the PowerPair test, would be permanent — is one answer.

Battery incentives for businesses: ​“A long time coming”

The proposed program is similar to PowerPair in that it’s born of compromise: Last summer, the state-sanctioned customer advocate, clean energy companies, and others agreed to drop their objections to Duke’s carbon-reduction plan under several conditions, including that the utility develop incentives for battery storage for commercial and industrial customers. The Utilities Commission later blessed the deal.

“This was pursuant to the settlement in last year’s carbon plan,” said Blumenthal, ​“so it’s been a long time coming.”

While many industry and nonprofit insiders refer to the scheme as ​“Commercial PowerPair,” its official title is the Non-Residential Storage Demand Response Program.

That name reflects the incentives’ focus on storage, with solar as only a minor factor: Duke wants to offer businesses, local governments, and nonprofits $120 per kilowatt of battery capacity installed on its own and just $30 more if it’s paired with photovoltaics.

The maximum up-front inducement of $150 per storage kilowatt is much less than the $360 per kilowatt offered under PowerPair. But more significant for nonresidential customers could be monthly bill credits: about $250 for a 100-kilowatt battery that could be tapped 36 times a year, plus extra if the battery is actually discharged.

Unlike households participating in PowerPair, which must install solar and storage at the same time to get rebates, nonresidential customers can also get the incentives for adding a battery to pair with existing solar arrays.

“That could be very important for municipalities around North Carolina that have already installed a very significant amount of solar, but very little of that is paired with battery storage,” said Blumenthal.

Duke has high hopes for the program, projecting that five years in, over 26,000 participants will enroll statewide. The company says that level of engagement would help it avoid building nearly 28 megawatts of new power plants to meet peak demand, saving over $13.6 million. That’s significantly more than the cost of providing and administering the incentives, which Duke places at nearly $11.8 million.

“The Program provides a source of cost-effective capacity that the Company’s system operators can use at their discretion in situations to deliver economic benefits for all customers,” Duke said in its September filing to regulators. ​“Importantly, the Company received positive feedback from its customers … when sharing the details of the Program.”

Indeed, the proposal has been met with support not just from the Sustainable Energy Association and other clean energy groups but also organizations like the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income households. It earned praise from local governments represented by the Southeast Sustainability Directors Network and conditional support from the state-sanctioned customer advocate, known as Public Staff, too.

Tipping the scales for more and bigger batteries

The good vibes continued last week, when Duke responded positively to detailed suggestions from these parties on how to improve the program. That included a request from Public Staff that the company raise the per-customer limit on battery capacity to align with the maximum amount of solar that a business or other nonresidential consumer can connect to the grid, which is currently 5 megawatts.

“Larger batteries sited at larger customer sites can help provide more significant system benefits and can reduce the need for incremental utility-owned energy storage installed at all ratepayers’ expense,” the agency told regulators in its November comments. It recommends a cap tied to a customer’s peak demand; for example, a business that consumes more energy at once should get incentives for a bigger battery. Duke agreed in its Dec. 5 comments, calling that limit ​“reasonable.”

Still, questions remain about how to make the incentives most impactful.

Public Staff, for instance, believes Duke should increase its monthly payment to customers for keeping their batteries charged and ready to deploy. This ​“capacity credit” is now set at $3.50 per kilowatt but effectively reduced to $2.48, because the utility assumes that a percentage of users won’t properly maintain their systems, based on its experience with households. The company calls that a ​“capability factor,” but the agency dubs it ​“collective punishment” for all customers and says it should be eliminated or recalibrated for ​“more sophisticated” nonresidential participants.

Raleigh, North Carolina–based 8MSolar, a member of the Sustainable Energy Association, is among the many installers that have been eagerly anticipating Duke’s proposal.

The program on its own likely won’t ​“move the needle unless the incentives get bumped up,” said Bryce Bruncati, the company’s director of sales. However, the scheme could tip the scales for large customers when stacked on top of two federal tax opportunities: a 30% incentive available through the end of 2027 and a deduction tied to the depreciation value of the system — up to 100% thanks to the Republican budget law passed this summer.

“The combined three could really have a big impact for small- to medium-sized commercial projects,” Bruncati said. The Duke program would represent ​“a little bit of icing on the cake.”

Whatever their size and design, the fate of the incentives rests entirely with the Utilities Commission, now that the final round of comments from Duke and other stakeholders is in. There’s no timeline for a decision.

At least one commissioner, Tommy Tucker, has voiced skepticism about leveraging customer-owned equipment to serve the grid at large. ​“I’m not a big fan of the [demand-side management] or virtual power plants because you’re dependent upon somebody else,” the former Republican state senator said at a recent hearing, albeit one not connected to the Duke program.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Duke-Energy-Power-Lines.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=de0aca3f7267ce8e449e408628d4d27e,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:48.895447

BP's decision to pull out of building a hydrogen plant has been described as ""discouraging"" by scientists working on decarbonisation.

Last week, the energy giant backed out of its plans at Teesworks in Redcar following a row with landowners over whether the site would be better suited to housing a data centre.

Prof Simone Abraham, Durham Energy Institute executive director, said the decision raised ""a lot of questions about the commitment to hydrogen development among industry and government"".

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said the government had backed the industry with £500m. BP has been approached for comment.

Prof Abraham said the move was ""discouraging"" but that she still believed hydrogen would play an important role in future energy systems.

BP backed out of the HSTeesside project ahead of a government decision on the plans, citing a ""material change in circumstances"" to the land it had been due to be built on.

At the time, a spokesperson said: ""We continue to move forward with other projects on Teesside, including our investments in Net Zero Teesside Power and the Northern Endurance Partnership, and remain an active partner in the region.""

Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he would continue to work with the BP on that project, which aims to be ""the world's first gas-fired power station with carbon capture and storage"".

'Economic case collapses'

Decarbonisation expert Prof Dawid Hanak, from Teesside University, said BP's decision to pull out of the scheme would make it ""challenging"" to meet the country's goal of producing up to 10GW of low carbon hydrogen by 2030.

Prof Maria Sharmina at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research pointed to the fact that BP had also suggested one reason it pulled out of the scheme was because the companies which it planned to sell its hydrogen to had ""postponed decarbonisation plans"".

She said: ""You can build all the supply infrastructure you like, but if the industrial users who were meant to switch to hydrogen are pulling back, then the economic case collapses.""

A DESNZ spokesperson said the hydrogen industry would ""play a key role"" in delivering its Industrial Strategy and its ""mission to become a clean energy superpower"".

""That's why this government backed the industry with £500m in the summer spending review,"" they said.

""Our ambitious Hydrogen Strategy will set out our vision and clear intentions for the UK's industry, driving clean energy investment and unlocking thousands of skilled jobs up and down the country.""

The reports had surfaced following an office memorandum dated November 28 from MNRE that called for Prudence in Lending for Solar PV Modules. The memorandum had flagged representations made by the All India Solar Industries Association (AISIA), an association of solar manufacturers that claimed a looming overcapacity issue for the sector, especially the module sector. The MNRE, in its memorandum, acknowledged the AISIA representation with key points, and urged relevant stakeholders in the Ministry of Finance and others to exercise due diligence accordingly when evaluating solar module financing. Not a proposal to freeze lending by any stretch.

The AISIA has also made a representation to the Indian Banking Association (IBA) with the same issues. The AISIA focus also seems to have been limited to solar modules, and no cells, wafers or the rest of the constituents of the solar cycle, including projects etc. The AISIA site lists 18 members in the body, with Waaree Energies, Vikram Solar, Emmvee and Goldi Solar among the notable majors, even as it has notable misses like Adani Solar, Solex Energy, Premier Energies etc.

No pause on green energy financing

MNRE stated that it has not advised any bank or financial institution to suspend or restrict lending to renewable energy power projects or solar equipment manufacturing facilities.

It stressed that continued policy support and financing will be essential to maintain the country’s growth momentum and to ensure that India emerges as a major, resilient player across the solar PV manufacturing value chain.

Focus on calibrated, informed lending

According to the Ministry, it has shared detailed data with the Department of Financial Services and key non-banking financial institutions, such as PFC, REC, and IREDA, on existing domestic solar PV manufacturing capacities.

This includes information on modules, upstream stages like cells, ingots-wafers and polysilicon, and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames.

The objective is to enable lenders to adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach while appraising proposals, and to encourage them to diversify financing beyond just module manufacturing to more upstream and ancillary segments of the solar value chain.

Strengthening India’s solar manufacturing ecosystem

MNRE underscored that its policy thrust remains firmly on building India’s self-reliance in solar PV manufacturing and strengthening the country’s role in the global solar value chain.

This is being pursued through a comprehensive set of measures, including the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules and steps to ensure a level playing field for Indian manufacturers. Notably, India’s domestic solar module capacity has expanded from about 2.3 GW in 2014 to roughly 122 GW currently listed in the Ministry’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM).

The Ministry reiterated its commitment to inclusive, competitive and sustainable growth of the solar ecosystem as part of India’s broader goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.

As of 31 October 2025, installed capacity from non-fossil sources has reached around 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year up to October 2025.",https://img-cdn.publive.online/fit-in/1200x675/saur-energy/media/media_files/2025/12/08/mnre-denies-advisory-for-clean-energy-financing-freeze-2025-12-08-13-04-15.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 06:00:14.222084

The combined entity will focus on producing green methanol and carbon-negative sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at scale, using wood-waste biomass sourced from Louisiana. The merger brings together DevvStream’s carbon management expertise and Southern’s low-cost biomass-to-fuel platform, reports Antara News.

The new company aims to support airlines and shipping operators as they face stricter environmental rules worldwide. Its operations will be built around two divisions — one dealing with climate-related solutions and another focused on clean fuels — starting with Southern’s planned biomass-to-fuel project in Louisiana. Management expects that combining both companies’ strengths will help lower production costs and make alternative fuels more competitive. Carl Stanton, who will lead the merged company as CEO, said the merger is intended to position the new entity as a stronger industrial-scale fuels and credits business. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026.

Stanton said the aviation and shipping sectors “are under pressure to cut emissions, and they want practical solutions that they can afford.” He added that renewable fuels “are still far costlier than conventional fuels,” and the merger is meant to “bring down those costs and help companies meet the new rules without slowing their operations.”

Southern Energy Renewables CEO Jay Patel said Louisiana continues to be a key partner for the project. “The state’s access to feedstock, infrastructure and a skilled workforce gives us a strong foundation for long-term growth,” he said, adding that the company expects the partnership with the state to deepen as work progresses.

Nevin Smalls, Chief Strategy Officer at Southern, said the project has been designed to produce clean fuels “on a large scale and at lower cost than many global competitors.” He noted that their production route — converting biomass waste into methanol and then into SAF — uses established technologies and integrated carbon capture, enabling “one of the lowest emissions footprints in the market.”

Stanton also confirmed that Southern has made an initial investment of about $2 million in DevvStream through the purchase of 128,370 shares. He said the investment “shows confidence in DevvStream’s core work and its importance in reducing costs for customers,” while giving DevvStream shareholders meaningful ownership in a larger and more diverse clean-fuel platform.

Final marketing and distribution agreement for renewable ammonia from the Saudi Arabian project (NEOM Green Hydrogen Project) is targeted for the first half of 2026.

LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa. and OSLO, Norway, Dec. 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- World-leading hydrogen supplier and global industrial gases company Air Products (NYSE:APD) and world-leading crop nutrition and ammonia company Yara International ASA (OSE:YAR) are working to combine Air Products' industrial gas capabilities and low-emission hydrogen with Yara's ammonia production and distribution network:

Louisiana Clean Energy Complex: Air Products is developing the world's largest low-carbon energy complex in the state of Louisiana. The complex is designed to produce >750 million standard cubic feet per day of low-carbon hydrogen, capturing 95 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during normal operation.

Air Products is the project developer and once the ammonia plant has achieved agreed upon performance levels, Yara would acquire the ammonia production, storage and shipping facilities for approximately 25 percent of the total project cost (estimated between $8-9 billion). Yara would assume responsibility for related operations and integrate the entire ammonia output into its global distribution network.

Air Products would own and operate the industrial gases production, where approximately 80% of the low-carbon hydrogen would be supplied to Yara under a 25-year long-term offtake agreement to produce 2.8 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia per year. The remaining hydrogen would be supplied to Air Products' customers in the U.S. Gulf Coast via Air Products' 700-mile hydrogen pipeline system. About five million tonnes per year of high purity CO2 captured by the Air Products facility would be sequestered by a third party under a long-term agreement to be announced later.

Final investment decisions by both companies are targeted by mid-2026, and project completion is expected by 2030.

NEOM Green Hydrogen Project: The NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia is more than 90 percent complete and is expected to start commercial production in 2027. Air Products is the sole offtaker of up to 1.2 million tonnes per year of renewable ammonia.

Air Products and Yara anticipate entering into a marketing and distribution agreement where Yara would commercialize, on a commission basis, the ammonia not sold by Air Products as renewable hydrogen in Europe. The model maximizes value for both companies and enables ammonia from the world's first large-scale renewable ammonia plant to be delivered worldwide by Yara's unparalleled shipping fleet. The marketing and distribution agreement is targeted to be completed during the first half of 2026.

Leveraging complementary strengths to drive value creation in low-emission ammonia

Yara is the world's largest trader and shipper of ammonia, currently transporting over four million metric tonnes annually, which is supported by Yara's 12 ammonia vessels and 18 import terminals. In addition, Yara has a significant internal ammonia demand. Air Products is the world's largest supplier of hydrogen and brings leading low-emission hydrogen and ammonia production at scale. The collaboration would enable the companies to meet the increasing demand for low-emission ammonia in the coming years, particularly in Europe both for Yara's internal consumption and other customers.

""We are pleased to be working with Yara, the world's leading fertilizer company, as we advance the global low-emission ammonia market and maximize value from our projects in Louisiana and Saudi Arabia,"" said Air Products' Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Menezes.

""Air Products' two advanced projects are a strong strategic fit with Yara's flexible nitrogen system – enabling energy diversification and profitable decarbonization while aligning with our disciplined capital allocation policy. The Louisiana project builds on a proven, capital-efficient model; producing ammonia from externally sourced hydrogen and delivering strong returns,"" said Yara's CEO Svein Tore Holsether.

Climate lawfare is a Big Business. State, county and city lawyers have filed some 30 lawsuits, alleging that oil companies misrepresented the impacts of their products and caused billions of dollars in climate and weather damages.

After being approached by EarthRights International, Boulder and Boulder County, Colorado joined San Miguel County in April 2018 to sue Suncor Energy and ExxonMobil.

Leaving out the hurricanes and rising seas emphasized by coastal litigants, plaintiffs’ 105-page complaint alleges that the oil companies have severely harmed their property, health and safety, by causing higher temperatures, more droughts and wildfires, and dwindling snowpack that adversely affects water supplies and the farming and skiing industries.

They want a trial by local jurors and seek billions of dollars to compensate their jurisdictions for past and future damages and costs, evaluate and mitigate climate change impacts, abate and remediate its hazards, and compensate them for decreased agricultural and urban property values.

Defendants argue that the case raises major, complicated national and even international issues and therefore belongs in federal, not state courts. But after years of legal wrangling, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled in May 2025 that the lawsuit could indeed proceed in state court.

So now Suncor and ExxonMobil have petitioned the US Supreme Court to review the case. Plaintiffs strongly oppose this. But there are compelling reasons why the Supremes should move it to federal venues, after declining earlier lawsuits that they said did not present a ripe or perfect case for review.

Fifty-plus years ago, I lived in Boulder, Denver and often went downhill and cross-country skiing. We had variable snow seasons: early and long, late and short, great snowpack or rocks. Back then the mantra was global cooling and a new ice age, but it later shifted to “global warming” when average global temperatures rose slightly, and finally to the all-encompassing “climate change” narrative.

I saw the aftermath of Colorado’s worst natural disaster ever, the 1976 Big Thompson flood. I witnessed other monster rainfalls, droughts and dust storms, and multiple wildfires. Decades-long Anasazi droughts underscore Nature’s destructive forces centuries ago.

Plaintiffs cannot possibly make a convincing historical or scientific case that today’s climate and weather are unusual or unprecedented. Nor can they separate natural forces and effects from fossil fuel or other manmade influences.

Team Boulder claims its case involves only local damages, issues, legal claims and remedies. However, ExxonMobil and Suncor production and refining activities, sales, emissions and alleged climate impacts are hardly confined to two counties or even the State of Colorado. The lawsuit’s effects would ripple like tsunamis across the USA and world.

Indeed, current and former county attorneys and officials have said the primary goals of this litigation include imposing “an indirect carbon tax” on defendants’ products; “raising the price” of those products so that they become too expensive for most families; curtailing fossil fuel use; and effecting “systems-level change” to America’s energy, economic and social systems.

The products include transportation fuels for Colorado and US cars, trucks, tractors and aircraft; natural gas to generate electricity for lights, computers, medical equipment, and lifesaving heating and air conditioning; and petrochemical feedstocks for over 6,000 essential products, including paints, plastics, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fertilizers, and skis, ski boots and clothing of all descriptions.

Climate activists have been unable to enact national legislation to curb or eliminate the use of coal, oil or natural gas – or persuade Congress to ratify international treaties that compel all countries to slash their fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions. Climate lawfare, via local and state courts, has thus become a central tactic for imposing their radical agenda, controlling our lives and reducing our living standards.

They know COP30 was an abject failure and overtures to “climate cataclysms” are falling on deaf ears.

They want to avoid federal courts and lawyers that might closely examine their far-fetched claims from national, international, scientific and economic perspectives. They know a US Supreme Court ruling in defendants’ favor would likely end any option for them to circumvent federal legislative and judicial processes.

Climateers also know that US states that enforce wind and solar power mandates have electricity prices at least two times higher than those that have not. Worse, residential prices in climate-obsessed Britain, Germany and other European countries are 2-3 times higher than the US average: 30 to 40+ cents per kilowatt-hour in Europe versus 15 cents in the USA.

They know (but vigorously deny) that German, British and other European electricity prices have caused their industries to lose millions of jobs and left families unable to heat their homes properly, leading to thousands of needless deaths every winter. Iberia’s peninsula-wide blackout in April 2025 proved reliance on wind and solar power can be disastrous, even deadly.

It’s hardly surprising that no other city or county has joined the lawsuit. That Colorado’s governor and former governor have refused to support it. Or that Colorado’s own attorney general joined 14 other state AGs in signing an amicus curiae brief opposing a very similar suit by California cities.

The AGs argued that cities should not be able to use the common nuisance law to “harness the power and prestige of federal courts to remedy global climate change.” They also noted that: “questions of global climate change and its effects … are political questions not suited for resolution by any court.” Indeed, such judicial interference would trample on “Congress’s carefully calibrated process of cooperative federalism where states work in tandem with EPA to administer the federal Clean Air Act.”

These issues are for Congress and the Executive Branch to debate, balance competing needs and interests, and decide at the national level. In dismissing New York City’s similar climate lawsuit, Federal Judge John Keenan made the same points.

Perhaps most importantly, over the past few years, the US Supreme Court has significantly curtailed the powers of federal agencies. In West Virginia v. EPA (2022), it held that, in the absence of clear legislative authority, government agencies cannot unilaterally issue regulations that have “major” economic or political significance.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2023) reversed the “Chevron deference” rule. Silent or ambiguous statutory texts no longer give administrative agencies unfettered power to interpret laws in ways that let them increase control over people’s lives and livelihoods.

Cities, counties and states certainly should not have greater power than federal agencies – or be able to employ common law rulings – to control America’s fossil fuel production, use and products, in a futile attempt to control Earth’s perpetually changing climate. Especially when the vast majority of global greenhouse gas emissions now come from China, India, Russia and other countries.

The climate litigation charade must end.

Let’s hope the Supreme Court agrees that Boulder’s lawsuit is an excellent opportunity to terminate frivolous climate lawfare, expand on the guidance it provided in these two previous cases – and end attempts by climate activists to impose destructive national policies through local and state courts.",https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-121.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 02:58:31.091822

Advt

On Sunday, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said that it had asked the finance ministry to advise lenders to adopt a ""calibrated and well-informed approach"" when evaluating proposals for additional standalone solar photovoltaic module capacity, citing oversupply risks. It added that the advisory was not intended to stop funding for the entire clean energy sector.

""This broad-based caution, if applied without distinction, could hurt solar cell manufacturing,"" said Chetan Shah, the chairman and managing director of Solex Energy.

""Restricting financing now will disrupt under-construction projects and deepen reliance on imported cells,"" he said.

Several Indian firms ramped up module production in recent years, betting on exports to the U.S. But higher American tariffs and tighter scrutiny of Indian shipments for Chinese-origin components have hit exports, raising fears of a glut at home.

India's module capacity is projected to surge by a third to 200 gigawatts (GW) in the next few years, while cell output could quadruple to 100 GW, according to the clean energy ministry.

The ministry remained committed to strengthening solar manufacturing through policy support and infrastructure development, it said on Sunday.>

Batteries are the backbone of America’s technological ambitions. Electric vehicles, drones, aircraft, defense systems, grid storage, consumer electronics—the entire future runs on electrons stuffed into metal boxes. They are so crucial that they may ultimately determine whether the U.S. remains a global technology leader or cedes that advantage to China, which is racing ahead in electrification.

2025 was a massive year on the battery front, packed full of promising breakthroughs and disappointing setbacks. Below, we've compiled some of the biggest battery developments of the year. But first, let's explore how we got to this moment.

Batteries in 2025: A Recap

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a shot of adrenaline for battery projects. It injected hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies into the space, helping sprout sprawling factories (or at least plans for them) nationwide. We all know what happened next.

After President Trump returned to the White House in January, there was immediate whiplash on the policy front. Several battery plants either paused or shut down, jobs evaporated and automakers scrambled to redirect investment into stationary storage systems to soften the blow from the EV slowdown.

Still, 2025 proved that the the ship had already sailed. Projects announced in the Biden era that had come far along marched toward completion. EV prototypes with solid-state batteries hit the road as automakers continued to make bolder promises about the “holy grail” tech.

Meanwhile, today’s lithium-ion batteries continued to improve. Automakers released new or refreshed EVs with more efficient batteries delivering longer range at more competitive prices. We also saw lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology return to America, along with novel approaches such as the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) battery chemistry to address affordability concerns.

The torrent of battery news in 2025 felt like five years compressed into one. And because this industry impacts everything from how we drive to how we power our homes and how we deal with natural disasters, the InsideEVs team covered it all obsessively, with scoops, technical deep dives, factory visits and interviews with industry leaders.

10 EV Battery Stories That Defined 2025

As the year winds down, here are the top battery stories this year from our editors, staff writers and contributors. If you couldn’t keep up with the battery news cycle this year, we don’t blame you. These 10 stories paint a solid picture of what happened in the battery world in 2025—and where it's going next.

How Ford And GM Are Plotting A Battery Breakup With China

General Motors and Ford are working on a breakthrough battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which aims to deliver driving range closer to current nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs at costs comparable to cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. I visited General Motors’ top-secret battery facilities in Warren, Michigan, this Spring to learn how these LMR batteries are made and what their implications are for the EV industry. I also spoke to engineers at Ford who described LMR tech as “LFP of the West” and the answer to “what’s next?”

Mercedes’ Solid-State Battery Prototype Comes Out Of The Lab, Onto The Road

This year, Western automakers inched closer to bringing their solid-state dreams to reality. These batteries promise longer range, faster charging times and improved thermal safety. A Mercedes-Benz EQS equipped with U.S.-based start-up Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery began road tests in Europe this year. BMW seems to have gone a step further, installing an all-solid-state (ASSB) pack from another U.S.-based start-up, Solid Power, in a prototype i7. While their roadworthiness is now being tested, expect more such announcements in the coming months as the technology continues to mature.

Ford’s Affordable EV Comeback Starts Here. But Not Without Controversy

LFP batteries are central to making EVs more affordable, as they’re cheaper to produce and don’t use expensive nickel or cobalt. But most LFP batteries today are made in China. Ford is working hard to change that. The company is building its $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, where it will make LFP batteries for its future EVs, licensing CATL’s tech. Patrick George visited the plant in June and reported that reaching this stage for Ford wasn’t without difficulties or controversy.

GM Is Bringing LFP Battery Production To America

GM had a huge year in the battery department. Not only did it surpass Tesla to become America’s largest battery cell manufacturer, but it’s also planning to bring LFP battery production stateside. The automakers’ two main battery suppliers, LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, will retrofit part of their U.S. plants, originally designed for NMC batteries, to assemble LFP packs. Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Silverado EV have been confirmed to get LFP packs, but local production won’t begin until the end of 2027. Until then, GM will reportedly import LFP batteries from China’s CATL.

BMW Gen6 Batteries May Foreshadow Class-Leading EV

Lithium-ion batteries are advancing so rapidly that one wonders, do we even need chemistries such as solid-state? BMW’s Gen6 batteries will offer up to 620 miles of range (depending on the vehicle type) and 30% faster charging. This pattern of improved batteries was common across the industry this year. Toyota’s 2026 EVs feature batteries that are better than ever. From 2027 onwards, Hyundai’s batteries will be 30% cheaper and 15% more energy dense. And Tesla is working with Panasonic to develop anode-free cells that could boost the Model Y’s range by 90 miles.

We Built Too Many EV Battery Factories. Here’s What Happens Next

Battery plants worth billions were canceled this year as the Trump administration rolled back clean energy programs and tax credits. Still, North America and the rest of the world are staring down a battery manufacturing glut. China's battery production capacity outpaces demand by five times. Europe makes double the number of batteries than its car buyers need. And North America’s capacity-to-demand ratio is 1.9. Mack Hogan explained in his story how battery companies reached this stage and what the future might look like.

The Facts Are In: You Shouldn’t Worry About EV Battery Replacements

Battery replacements may have been common on the first-generation Nissan Leaf or some model years of the Chevy Bolt which had defective packs. But it’s very rare for modern batteries to randomly fail. Experts say there’s really nothing to worry about these days. Tim Levin outlined in his story that the latest EVs have battery replacement rates of just 0.3% and are basically worry-free for at least 15 years on average.

‘Vital To Our Future’: How Lithium-Ion Batteries Are Saving The Grid

Commercial electricity was invented more than a century ago. Yet the process of managing and distribution remains fragile, as heat waves and natural disasters keep knocking the grid off. States and utilities have been using battery energy storage systems as backup for years, but this year more automakers joined the fray to offset lower EV battery demand with batteries for energy storage. BESS allows companies to store and deploy renewable energy more efficiently, so that our lights remain on when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow. I spoke with experts to understand how the economics and engineering of BESS batteries differ from those of EVs.

China’s 100-Second EV Battery Swaps Are Here

Nio’s battery-swapping stations have been around in China for a while, but battery giant CATL has promised to take battery swapping to the next level. The company’s swappable “Choco-SEB” batteries—named after their chocolate bar design—can be swapped in just 100 seconds. So in a little over a minute, you can be in and out of the swapping station. And no, this tech isn’t 10 years away. It’s already launched in China and is now expanding.

CATL’s Sodium-Ion EV Battery Loves The Cold

The same core element that makes your lunch taste better, i.e., salt, is now also powering EVs in China. Research suggests that sodium is 1,000 times more abundant than lithium, but batteries made out of it don’t enjoy the same supply chain advantages and scalability as lithium-ion packs. But seeing potential in the technology for certain applications, CATL created its Naxtra sodium-ion subbrand in Spring. The company has started making high- and low-voltage sodium-ion battery packs in China, which can even operate at temperatures as low as -40 degrees Fahrenheit.

,American Energy,2025-12-08 05:23:44+00:00,Governing,There's More Than One Way to Power Data Centers - Governing Magazine,"Carl Smith, www.governing.com, Carl-Smith.html",,,,,https://www.governing.com/resilience/theres-more-than-one-way-to-power-data-centers,"A report from an energy think tank makes the case for a broader perspective on how to meet data center energy needs.
By the end of 2025, U.S. data centers are projected to need 22 percent more grid power than they did the year before and almost three times more soon after.
Negotiating Power It’s well known that data centers can have serious environmental impacts and require massive amounts of water to cool the servers.
The usual criticism of these sources is that they don’t provide a constant enough supply to power giant data centers.
Energy demand from AI data centers may be enormous, but they don’t operate at peak demand at all times.","In Brief:

AI companies are growing at a rapid pace — and continued growth depends on increasing energy supply.

Data centers are sprouting up all over the country, sometimes facing community backlash thanks to their water usage and the strain they threaten to put on the energy grid.

A report from an energy think tank makes the case for a broader perspective on how to meet data center energy needs.

Hundreds of billions of dollars are pouring into artificial intelligence, driving the U.S. economy. The profits that technology leadership investors seek depend on meeting the electricity needs of data centers, warehouse-sized facilities filled with servers that power the digital world, including AI.

By the end of 2025, U.S. data centers are projected to need 22 percent more grid power than they did the year before and almost three times more soon after. S&P Global puts the 2030 need at over 134 GW (gigawatts). One GW is enough to meet the average annual energy needs of about 700,000 homes.

Eric Gimon, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation, hopes to provide legislators and state officials working to attract data centers with a more nuanced picture of what they can do to fill gaps between energy demand and supply.

“It’s the normal human thing when we’re dealing with complexity to cling to the simplest ideas,” he says. “People have devolved to the thinking that the way to deal with a big new load is a big new generator.”

Through a new report, Gimon hopes to move beyond what he calls “firm fixation.” He makes the case that overemphasis on “firm” power — electricity from sources that are always “on,” such as nuclear reactors or gas-fired power plants — leads to missed opportunities.

It can cause utilities and developers to overlook solutions like energy efficiency, or batteries connected to solar and wind generators, that cost less, can be implemented more quickly and reduce risk from overinvestment in local fixed capacity vulnerable to shifts in demand, he argues.

Negotiating Power

It’s well known that data centers can have serious environmental impacts and require massive amounts of water to cool the servers. Communities have increasingly pushed back on their construction, with complaints about noise and the possibility of increased energy costs. States and localities have the best chance of making deals to address these issues when a data center is first built, Gimon says — when it’s getting permits, authorization to connect to the grid, and when the utility is deciding how much to charge.

This is the time to ensure data center developers make fair commitments to help cover the infrastructure costs that come with their energy needs, and to push them toward solutions that make the most of existing resources and support the energy grid, Gimon argues. These could include energy efficiency requirements, using data center waste heat to generate electricity or flexibility regarding peak use times.

Gimon also points to a report from Rewiring America arguing that household energy efficiency and rooftop solar could potentially free up enough existing grid energy to meet the needs of the biggest data centers. Governments may be able to secure agreements from companies to fund efficiency projects for the rest of the grid to help meet their needs.

They may be better able to get these kinds of commitments from large technology companies like Amazon Web Services or OpenAI, which are building huge data centers to deliver their services. These companies may have a vested interest in gaining community buy-in and have a greater ability to make long-term energy use projections, Gimon argues.

It may be harder to secure these kinds of promises from “co-location” facilities — large warehouses owned by developers and rented out to multiple separate entities. These developers may be hesitant to make any deals that might affect their ability to draw tenants or the long-term value of their properties, Gimon says.

Drawing From Existing Resources

It’s common for conversations about data centers and energy use to focus on giant power sources like gas-fired plants or nuclear energy facilities. And certainly they will have to make use of those existing energy sources.

But Gimon argues that states and localities shouldn’t be afraid of a varied approach to meeting energy demands, leaning more heavily on renewables like wind and solar. The usual criticism of these sources is that they don’t provide a constant enough supply to power giant data centers.

That's not the whole picture, Gimon says. Energy demand from AI data centers may be enormous, but they don’t operate at peak demand at all times. “Depending on what they are doing, they could be running their chips 70 percent of the time, 50 percent of the time or 40 percent of the time,” says Gimon. “They also turn off and on a lot.”

They also tend to be built in phases. “That’s part of what makes it difficult to serve them with one big power plant,” says Gimon. “You can be undersized or oversized depending on where you are in phase in or phase out.”

Using batteries can assuage concerns about the intermittent nature of renewables. According to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, wind and solar account for more than two-thirds of utility-scale electric-generating capacity additions planned for 2025.

If governments can secure agreements with data centers to avoid peak energy use during periods of high demand for other grid users (like the afternoon of a summer day, for example), it can create more flexibility in choosing energy sources that can meet need.

“By exploring the nuanced solutions, policymakers can avoid overcommitting to outdated firm resources and instead adopt strategies that embrace modularity, flexibility, and clean energy,” Gimon writes. This can require a deeper dive in the complexity of energy systems by those in government who have responsibility for regulation or legislation.

The Tip of the Spear

Over the last 20 years, energy use decreased from 60 percent of what was available to users to 40 percent, Gimon says. The emergence of an energy-intensive industry, and cross-sector conviction that the nation’s fate depends on growing it as fast as possible, is a head-spinning reversal of this trend.

Data centers are just the tip of the spear, Gimon says. The dawning era of building electrification and the growth of electric vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, mean load growth will continue even if the data center craze crashes and burns.

“We’re in a new era of demand growth that we haven’t seen in a long time in the U.S.,” Gimon says. “It’s going to require an all-of-government approach to manage that, to manage new facilities, manage new generation and find ways to do a better job of using the infrastructure that we have.”

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF.

“Today I would like to share two major bits of progress first: I will start with the fact that I am proud to announce that the FX Super One First Pre-Production Vehicles Roll-off Ceremony is scheduled for December 21 at our manufacturing facility in Hanford, CA! We have reached a critical state of readiness: the full set of components for the first several pre-production vehicles have arrived on site. With nearly 3,000 parts per vehicle now in hand, we will formally launch production tomorrow.

This milestone carries significance in six areas:

1. It marks the near completion of the Bridge Closure for our Bridge strategy, covering a closed loop of supply chain, testing, logistics, customs clearance and production. This further validates the feasibility and strategic value of the Bridge model, across tariff adaptation, ICTS compliance, cost management, operational efficiency, and so on.

2. It marks that the Hanford factory has entered the FX pre-production phase. Our production, industrialization, supply chain, and Bridge systems are now forming a closed-loop synergy.

3. It could provide a replicable, fast-track mass production framework for the scalable deployment of future FX models.

4. It represents a new breakthrough in the Company’s business and supports improvements in our capital position and capital market expectations.

5. It could empower the global expansion of China's automotive supply chain and unlock its value within the U.S.— the world's highest-value market.

6. It could fill a structural gap, tap the blue-ocean segment in the U.S., and generate incremental value in the U.S. market, including job creation and contributions to manufacturing reshoring.

The second bit of progress is that the Board has conditionally approved FF and FX’s five-year volume production plan, including the target of 400,000-500,000 cumulative production and sales, contingent upon securing the necessary financing, as well as more support and agreements with strategic partners. This could help us build a solid foundation for our strategic advancement and stockholder value maximization.

On EAI flywheel—other FFAI updates this week:

S5 Capital Markets and Finance — FF attended UBS’s Global Industrials and Transportation Conference in Florida — a major platform for global capital, industrial and mobility sectors. During the event, we held in-depth discussions with multiple institutional investors, providing a systematic overview of our strategy and core business progress.

Turning to S6 Middle East — Following the delivery of the very first Super One to global icon Andrés Iniesta — coinciding with the UAE’s 54th National Day — our Middle East team brought FF 91 and FX Super One across all seven Emirates, where the “Twin Stars” shined across the region. Next, the Middle East team will speed up assembly ramp up and keep pushing for the assembly and delivery of the FX Super One AIHER variant and the potential battery electric variant, so that more users can be among the first to experience the unique value of First Class EAI-MPV and have the region truly enter the era of AI-powered luxury mobility.

Finally, our issues, reflections, and solutions — Since the FX Super one Initial Product Launch on July 17, we know that our stockholders, investors, and users have been eagerly waiting updates on our milestones and our business vision for the next few years. Our goal has always been to share a roadmap that is clear and executable. Due to complex review cycles and approval procedures, we have not been able to share these details as quickly as intended. This experience has underscored the need for us to improve our internal synergy and operational efficiency.

With our Five-Year Plan closing in on approval, the path could soon be clear for us to share our key milestone goals and forward-looking business plans. We will begin releasing these updates soon and look forward to your continued attention. That’s it for today. I’ll see you at the Hanford factory on December 21.”

Fresh-cut or fake trees? What experts say is more sustainable might surprise you

At Sullivan Hardware and Garden, Christmas tree sales are already brisk.

“We have a large seasonal business which includes fresh-cut Christmas trees and artificial trees,” said Pat Sullivan, President of the hardware and garden store.

Millions of families buy a tree each year, but the environmental impact varies widely depending on whether they choose real or fake.

“When looking at options, it sometimes seems like the more sustainable option is to get a fake tree that you can use for multiple years, but the real tree is actually the way to go,” said Lizzie Hortviz, a sustainability expert and founder of Finch, a platform that educates consumers on sustainability.

Horvitz tells WRTV the carbon footprint of artificial trees is far heavier than most people realize.

“Real Christmas trees typically carry an average carbon footprint of 3.5 kg of CO2, if disposed of through burning or wood chipping,” she said. “A two m artificial Christmas tree has a carbon footprint of around 40 kg, more than 10 times that of a real tree… then, unfortunately, at the end of life, the only thing we can do is landfill them.”

At Sullivan, both types of trees are popular, but this year, the store says fresh trees are stocked up again on their store shelves.

“There's been a shortage of trees and fresh-cut for the last five years, and it's kind of coming to an end,” Sullivan said. “We're paying big dollars just to try to get trees, so the prices of fresh cut around town should either be stable or drop.”

The National Christmas Tree Association and the American Christmas Tree Association estimate the average fresh tree cost in 2024 was between $80 and $100. Artificial trees ranged from $85 to more than $1,000.

Beyond price, Horvitz says real trees offer environmental benefits long before they end up in someone’s home.

“Christmas trees are also doing all that good tree stuff. They're absorbing carbon, they're providing wildlife habitat, etc.,” she said.

""The most important thing is that we support these Christmas tree farms, because for every tree purchased, farmers plant one to three seedlings in its place. So, this guarantees the future of green space and farmland,” she added.

For those who prefer artificial trees, Horvitz says the key to sustainability is longevity.

The meeting brought together Minister Nicola Willis, Minister Simon Watts, Treasurer Dr Jim Chalmers and Minister Chris Bowen to deepen collaboration on emerging technologies and future-ready energy systems that can support more resilient and affordable pathways to net zero.

The discussions placed strong emphasis on how technology-led climate action and increased investment in renewable energy can relieve pressure on household power costs, improve productivity and reinforce energy security across both countries.

With the global economy shifting towards low-emissions technologies, Ministers highlighted opportunities for industries scaling clean products, digital innovation and climate-aligned investments, noting that updated Nationally Determined Contributions signal new clean-tech development aligned with the Paris Agreement.

They also acknowledged the unique value of trans-Tasman cooperation in generating tangible benefits for businesses and communities, including Māori and First Nations Australians, through innovation partnerships and integrated market design.

Climate pressures are reshaping regional supply chains, infrastructure and local economies, prompting both countries to focus on strengthening resilience and ensuring that economic development remains regionally driven and future-oriented.

Ministers reflected on progress since the previous dialogue, including New Zealand’s second emissions reduction plan for 2026–2030 and its National Adaptation Framework, along with Australia’s national Net Zero Plan and risk assessment initiatives designed to encourage long-term investment in sustainable technologies.

A major area of collaboration centres on harnessing technology to build an affordable and secure trans-Tasman energy system. Both countries are moving to align regulatory frameworks, simplify investment pathways and ensure that sustainable finance systems can interoperate effectively.

New commitments include upgrading the Equipment Energy Efficiency Program, supporting smart EV chargers, aligning Vehicle-to-Grid standards and boosting solar and battery sector collaboration to reduce compliance, enhance savings and expand clean-tech opportunities.

Ministers also highlighted emerging opportunities in sustainable aviation fuel, supported by ongoing work on a trans-Tasman SAF Strategy and Australia’s investment in low-carbon fuel production.

Clearer net-zero pathways and internationally relevant standards were recognised as crucial for attracting climate-aligned finance, with both countries working to develop interoperable sustainable finance frameworks.

Australia’s launch of its national Guarantee of Origin scheme and New Zealand’s alignment through its Hydrogen Action Plan mark important steps toward certifying the emissions intensity of green hydrogen, sustainable fuels and green metals, supporting a trusted market for future clean-energy trade.

Agricultural innovation remains a priority, with both countries investing substantially in technologies that reduce livestock emissions and can ultimately transform farming systems internationally. Ministers committed to deeper technical collaboration to speed up the development and adoption of these climate-smart solutions.

Beyond climate and energy, the dialogue also reinforced the importance of innovation in economic reform. Ministers discussed aligning productivity agendas, reducing business costs and accelerating digital payments, licensing reforms and digital asset regulation.

Agencies are exploring greater alignment in non-financial risk management and regulatory tiering in the banking system, while work will continue on harmonising building standards and product safety settings. A new working group will support collaboration on ensuring long-term accessibility and resilience in insurance markets.

Ministers emphasised their responsibility to support the Pacific amid growing climate impacts, reaffirming commitments to expand renewable energy through joint technical assistance, training initiatives in 2026 and deeper regional cooperation.

New Zealand also welcomed Australia’s agreement with Türkiye on COP31 hosting arrangements, which will help amplify Pacific perspectives and accelerate global clean-energy momentum.

According to official data, as of 31 October 2025, the country’s installed non-fossil fuel capacity stands at around 259 GW, including 31.2 GW added in the current financial year up to October.

Amid reports suggesting that the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has instructed lenders to pause financing of renewable energy projects due to excess capacity concerns, the ministry has issued a clarification refuting the claims.

No Directive to Halt Financing, Says Government

MNRE stated that no advisory has been issued to banks, financial institutions, or NBFCs to stop funding renewable energy power projects or equipment manufacturing units.

The ministry clarified that it has only circulated updated information on existing domestic manufacturing capacities—covering modules, solar cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames—to bodies including the Department of Financial Services, PFC, REC, and IREDA. The intent, it stated, is to enable lenders to take informed financing decisions and encourage support for upstream solar value chain development rather than focusing solely on module manufacturing.

Government Reaffirms Support for Solar Manufacturing Ecosystem

The ministry reiterated the government’s continued commitment to strengthening domestic solar PV manufacturing with the goal of making India a key global player in the solar value chain. This strategy is supported through policy measures such as the PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules and ongoing efforts to provide a competitive environment for manufacturers.

The ministry noted that India’s solar module manufacturing capacity has increased from 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW today as listed under the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM). This growth, it said, highlights the success of coordinated efforts between the central government, state governments and industry stakeholders.

As demand for power, compute and hyperscale data centers surges, Palantir is positioning the platform as a foundational tool for the next era of U.S. industrial growth.

The company says the real bottleneck to AI progress is no longer the models themselves, but the energy and compute capacity required to run them at scale. Chain Reaction is designed to bridge this gap by linking utilities, energy producers, construction firms, and data center operators through a unified system built for unprecedented load and operational complexity.

According to Palantir, the platform is engineered to help transform outdated generation resources into high-uptime systems, stabilize the grid under massive new demand, speed up construction of new generation and transmission assets, and standardize future hyperscale data center design.

“The energy infrastructure buildout is the industrial challenge of our generation,” said Tristan Gruska, Palantir’s Head of Energy and Infrastructure. “But the software that the sector relies on was not built for this moment. We have spent years quietly deploying systems that keep power plants running and grids reliable. Chain Reaction is the result of building from the ground up for the demands of AI.”

CenterPoint Energy Expands Its Partnership

CenterPoint Energy — serving roughly 7 million customers across Texas, Indiana, Minnesota, and Ohio — is one of the platform’s founding partners. After Hurricane Beryl’s impact in 2024, the utility ramped up investments in resilience, selecting Palantir as its software backbone. Now, CenterPoint is leveraging Chain Reaction to accelerate “speed-to-power” and gain deeper operational visibility across its system.

“Never before have technology and energy been so intertwined in determining the future course of American innovation, commercial growth, and economic security. In the Greater Houston region, our energy consumption is projected to increase by nearly 50% in five years and double by the mid 2030s. This exponential growth is being driven by a diverse set of sectors, including high tech, healthcare, energy, industrial, pharmaceutical, and fleet, and is accelerating job creation across the communities we are privileged to serve. We are excited to team with Palantir and our other Chain Reaction partners to enable this future sooner,” said Jason Wells, Chair & Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy.

NVIDIA Partnership Deepens

NVIDIA, already collaborating with Palantir on operational AI systems, is expanding its involvement through Chain Reaction. By integrating NVIDIA’s accelerated computing stack — including Nemotron models, CUDA-X libraries, and Palantir’s AIP and Ontology — the initiative aims to streamline the complex supply chain behind gigawatt-scale “AI factories.”

“A new industrial revolution has begun—one where intelligence is manufactured at scale through an extraordinarily complex supply chain of AI infrastructure, now being built across America to strengthen our economy, workforce and security,” said Vladimir Troy, vice president, AI Infrastructure, NVIDIA. “By partnering with Palantir and our ecosystem, we are accelerating this transformation—powering the engines of the AI age, transforming data into intelligence and securing America’s technology leadership for decades to come.”

A Nationwide Buildout for the AI Era

Chain Reaction sits at the intersection of energy, construction, and digital infrastructure. The platform’s goal is to unify real-time operations, planning, and predictive analytics so that new power plants, transmission lines, and data centers can be built faster and operated with fewer disruptions.

Palantir framed the launch as a turning point for America’s ability to meet future AI-driven electricity demand. With load forecasts climbing rapidly — often by triple digits in fast-growing regions — utilities and developers are looking for tools that help compress timelines and improve reliability.

The company stresses that Chain Reaction is designed for reproducibility, enabling standardized hyperscale builds across multiple locations. By coordinating permitting, supply chains, construction, and grid interconnection in a single system, Palantir says developers can move from concept to megawatts more efficiently.

The announcement also underscores Palantir’s broader push into critical infrastructure, government systems, and industrial AI deployments. As energy systems become more digitally intertwined with compute infrastructure, Palantir is positioning itself as one of the key software players shaping the backbone of America’s AI economy.",,N,,2025-12-08 01:00:36.872858

Wood wants to increase food accessibility among Fort Worth youth through agriculture and environmental stewardship by using the green space at the 150 acres of the now defunct Woodhaven Country Club and golf course.

His environmental nonprofit Econautics aims to use the east Fort Worth site to foster connectivity to nature among children and families.

“That’s the goal,” Wood said. “It could meaningfully increase the quality of life for youth in the neighborhood.”

Crescendo Development, the company that now owns the acreage at the Woodhaven golf course, is one step closer to its vision for agriculture, housing and retail at the site now that Econautics has signed on.

The nonprofit is the first organization to put the land to use after Crescendo received approval from city officials in October for its preliminary plan to create the mixed-use development that faced some pushback from neighbors who worried about the traffic and density it would bring.

“We want to preserve as much green space as possible while having an economically viable project,” Crescendo Development owner and founder Will Northern said. “Econautics will serve as a healthy, holistic draw that will show it is possible to have agricultural-type uses adjacent to development.”

Bridging the gap

Econautics leased out 10 acres of the Woodhaven property in November with plans to use former warehouses and sheds to teach families and youth how to garden and grow quality produce, Wood said.

Fields of crops and greenhouses will also dot the land.

“We want to help bridge the gap in the food safety net in our country and my hometown of Fort Worth,” he said.

Econautics launched in 2012 with the mission of educating the public on how to apply sustainable practices into business operations in response to environmental concerns, such as poor water quality.

Now it focuses on environmental stewardship and teaching youth how to use clean technology to promote sustainable food production. Sustainable agriculture is an approach aimed at producing food while protecting the environment and expanding natural resources.

Plans for Woodhaven will involve assistance from a nurse practitioner and nutritionists to bring Econautics’ “outdoor kitchen” to life, Wood said.

Meanwhile, accessing the green space at the site will help improve the quality of life for east Fort Worth’s youth, he added, noting that Quanah Parker Park is the only park in Woodhaven now.

“Connecting with nature, that’s one of the things we’d like to have on-site,” he said.

Having grown up playing outdoors, hiking, and swimming in ponds, Wood wants other children to have a similar experience as they grow healthy foods, learn about environmental science and become grounded in nature at the former golf course.

“These are all things that promote longevity and address chronic diseases, which is a huge strain on the health care system and especially these communities,” Wood said.

Mixed feelings

Crescendo’s plans to revitalize the area drew mixed reactions from the public. Some neighbors opposed the project saying they worried about the increase in traffic and impact on the environment from building single-family homes, apartments and shops in the area.

Keith Larson, Woodhaven Neighborhood Association vice president, is looking forward to the environmental education Econautics will make available to youth.

“To show people in a not terribly big piece of property that you can actually grow and cultivate food that you can eat is a pretty exciting opportunity,” Larson said.

He finds Crescendo has done an “admirable job” of meeting with nearby residents to learn more about what they want to see at the site, which he said includes the light revitalization of a golf course and trails to access the Trinity River and Quanah Parker Park.

“There’s a lot of opportunity in the plan there, and we hope very much that the vision is going to play out as explained,” Larson added.

However, other residents believe Crescendo’s plans to increase retailers and business would not serve the neighborhood.

Woodhaven resident Erika Graham finds it “inappropriate” to develop a commercial space in a densely populated residential area.

Her concerns also stem from how the neighborhood’s tax increment financing district’s funds will be applied to the redevelopment of the golf course.

“While the apartment owners may be paying into the (TIF), it is ultimately the apartment residents that are out of pocket for it,” Graham said.

She and other residents would have preferred the city purchased the land and lightly redevelop the area with amenities such as an event venue, walking trails and a community center for neighborhood members to meet.

“However this property is developed, it needs to include amenities for all Woodhaven residents,” Graham said.

Envisioning Woodhaven’s future

Econautics’ mission aligns with Northern’s goals of preserving green space and nature while also being business-friendly, he said.

Whatever changes may come for Woodhaven, Crescendo Development wants to incorporate as much nature as possible into the site’s future, Northern said.

Even where new housing will be built, they’ll be designed to maintain green space, he said. While the golf course has not been in operation for several years, Crescendo has identified a large parcel of the area to become a smaller golf course.

Sitting on the left edge of the acreage is potential parkland, Northern said. While development of that parcel relies on public funds, he hopes to one day revamp the land to become a park, amplifying green space in the Woodhaven area.

“I want to … bring out and preserve those beautiful areas that make this place so special,” he said.

There are 27,000 known brownfields, or sites contaminated with pollutants, dotting Michigan. Many of them are locations where factories once stood.

About half are what the state calls “orphan sites,” meaning there’s no responsible party that owns the land and would otherwise have to clean up the pollutants, said Phil Roos, the director of the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.

“Sometimes people don’t even want to touch it if they don’t know the nature of the contamination or can’t address it,” Roos said.

That’s why the state is funding restoration projects, offering developers grants of up to $2 million, he said.

The grants cover assessing what the contaminants are, the best ways of removing them and often helping with the first stage of clean up, Roos said.

“Because we have a lot of these sites around the state, we need to de-risk it by providing some funding that will allow whoever’s developing the site to raise capital to do the development, knowing that it’s safe and they don’t have to address those issues any further,” he said.

The grants stem from the state budget for RenewMI which allocates $77 million. RenewMI is the department’s environmental remediation program.

When brownfields are cleaned up, they can be revitalized and turned into new housing developments, parks, commercial establishments or new industrialization.

The Lugnuts Stadium in Lansing, home to a minor league professional baseball team, is on a former brownfield, Roos said.

Since 2019, the state has been funding brownfield cleanup. The department has done 474 redevelopment projects in 50 communities, leading to $184 million in incentives and creating over 20,000 jobs, he said.

Those projects included the Grayling Northern Market and the Grayling Sawmill in 2018. The Grayling Northern Market used to be a planing mill and lumber yard, while the sawmill was a hotel, saloon and stores.

There have been four brownfield clean-up projects since 2020 in Traverse City. The most recent project in 2025 is Grandview Vision.

The site used to be an ice cream factory, and an antique store is on the property next door, according to Environment, Great Lakes and Energy’s website.

Cadillac has also seen four brownfield projects, including one in 2025 to clean up a former dry cleaners, grocery store and retail buildings.

In the past year, there has been an influx of housing developments built on cleaned-up brownfields. Roos said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has made those projects a priority because of the state’s housing shortage.

“We can, in many cases, make it so there’s no threat to public safety and turn them into beautiful places to live,” he said.

However, not every brownfield site is equal, said Mike Witkowski, the director of environmental and regulatory policy at the Michigan Manufacturers Association.

Some “legacy sites” like abandoned gas stations and factories have contaminated an area to the point where the amount of money needed to clean it for residential development is unrealistic, he said.

There are different standards that dictate what brownfield sites can be used for while helping to prevent human exposure to harmful chemical pollutants, he said.

Those especially contaminated sites can still be cleaned up to meet standards for things like new industrial development.

“If you can come through and say, ‘All right, let’s turn this into a parking lot or another industrial setting and keep it at those standards’ – that’s really not only the best way to handle those contaminants, but it’s also the most economically sound for the state and private investment,” Witkowski said.He said the number of existing brownfields makes it impossible for the state to clean all of them, meaning private developers cleaning up sites is all the more important.

“One of the best things we can do is have a robust and and really well-functioning brownfield redevelopment program that allows these new private investment dollars to come in and say, ‘Hey, we want to build here on this site and not only are we going to provide jobs, but we’re also going to help clean up the the contaminants there and make this space usable property again,’” Witkowski said.

The Michigan Manufacturing Association opposes a bill currently in the Michigan Senate that would add additional clean-up standards, and extend liability for developers, saying it would likely discourage private investment into brownfields, he said.

“It really complicates it in a problematic way, which we feel is going to lead to less cleanups and less investment in our industrial sites and really more expansion into green space developments where there’s never been a development or any industry before,” Witkowski said.

He said the current brownfield program as it stands has been sufficiently vetted by the state and environmental engineers. It’s helped the economy grow across the state and has been successfully cleaning up contaminated sites.

“To try and bring that in a little bit or make change is going to hurt the trajectory of our environmental cleanups and economic growth,” Witkowski said.",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/36911_404499488300_92573353300_4464360_1537553_n_bigger.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 01:58:44.602952

Farmers have experienced multibillion-dollar export declines in some of their largest trading markets, including China.
As farmers were harvesting a crop, many of them didn’t have storage and had to sell at harvest-time lows,” Newton said.
Ethanol Could Fuel Economic Rebound At a time when the farm economy is facing a downward turn, farmers are looking for expanded market opportunities.
Increased biofuel production could be one avenue to boost farm revenue and support the entire rural economy.","U.S. farm income is under immense pressure as input costs have increased dramatically while crop prices have fallen sharply — resulting in margins that have been at or below break-even for several consecutive years.

Farmers urgently need economic assistance, according to a new Market Intel report from the American Farm Bureau Federation.

The key takeaways of the report are:

• Farm financial stress is severe and persistent. Margins are below break-even for many crops, working capital has been eroded, Chapter 12 farm bankruptcies are on the rise and, according to a recent survey of commercial lenders by the American Bankers Association, profits will remain elusive going into 2026.

•​​​​​​​ Trade losses have compounded economic pressures. Farmers have experienced multibillion-dollar export declines in some of their largest trading markets, including China. Trade frameworks have been announced, but increased export volumes have yet to materialize and cash prices remain at or below levels seen in early 2025.

•​​​​​​​ Without action, long-term viability is at risk. Additional financial support is critical to offset trade losses and provide a bridge until farm bill enhancements from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” go into effect. This will stabilize the farm economy, sustain rural economies and maintain affordable food prices.

“Input costs have increased dramatically over the last few years — up in some cases 30%, 40%, 50% — but at the same time, commodity prices have come crashing down. For many crops they’re at historically low levels,” said John Newton, AFBF vice president of public policy and economic analysis.

“Trade has slowed, and the effect is we’ve had margins that have been at or below break-even for many crops and specialty crops for many years in a row, and that’s starting to impact farm financial conditions.”

Trade losses heightened the challenges in an already difficult economic environment.

“As the Chinese backed out of the market, that put further pressure on prices. As farmers were harvesting a crop, many of them didn’t have storage and had to sell at harvest-time lows,” Newton said.

“So, even though we’ve got a framework in place and the Chinese are starting to buy product, for a lot of growers, the economic benefits of these frameworks may come too late.”

While some help was made available in the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed by President Donald Trump on the Fourth of July and the American Relief Act, which was signed by President Joe Biden last December and mainly served as yet another one-year extension of the 2018 farm bill, that assistance won’t reach farmers until some time next year.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged $12 billion in economic support to help offset trade losses, Newton said.

“We hope to see details of that in the next few weeks, but the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill,’ while it made a historic investment in farm bill risk-management programs, those benefits won’t materialize on the farm for over a year,” he said.

Ethanol Could Fuel Economic Rebound

At a time when the farm economy is facing a downward turn, farmers are looking for expanded market opportunities. Increased biofuel production could be one avenue to boost farm revenue and support the entire rural economy.

One simple solution for expanding biofuel demand would be to allow for year-round E15 in American gas pumps.

Most gasoline sold across the country is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly here in the Midwest, where most corn is grown. By the way, E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline.

But the Environmental Protection Agency has previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during that driving season could increase smog.

For the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty — and there’s a straightforward path to make this possibility a reality.

Right now, the ethanol industry relies on the EPA to grant a series of short-term waivers to sell E15 in the summers.

A congressional fix to get year-round E15 that does not rely on those emergency waivers would allow producers to have some stability and know that they will be able to blend ethanol all year.",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/lONFG1BYH-xDXfgrRKMhsqV7Ap0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/S5JV6SGRY5HBZOZMK2NCS2SZ7Y.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 20:58:49.985713

But experts say ERCOT is still in a stronger position than it was during the deadly 2021 winter storm.

The findings come just days before ERCOT's board of directors meets to discuss how large energy-hungry facilities, including data centers and cryptocurrency mines, are reshaping electricity demand across the state.

According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC, winter electricity demand continues to rise across the ERCOT region, driven in part by the growth of 24/7 data centers powering AI systems and other high-tech operations.

NERC's 2025–2026 Winter Reliability Assessment warns that these facilities are ""reshaping"" when Texans use power. Because data centers run around the clock, the report says they are flattening the daily load curve, stretching peak demand periods into longer windows — particularly before sunrise and after sunset, when solar isn't available.

The assessment shows ERCOT has enough capacity under normal conditions, but in an extreme cold scenario, the grid could face tighter reserves, similar to what the state experienced during Winter Storm Uri.

""If a storm comes through like we had in February of 2021, ERCOT estimates a 20% likelihood of rolling blackouts,"" Hirs said. ""That's a lot better than last year's estimate of 80%.""

According to ERCOT's Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy for January 2026, the grid operator's highest-risk hour this winter is around 8 a.m., when cold morning temperatures coincide with little or no solar production. ERCOT estimates just a 1.4% chance of issuing an Energy Emergency Alert during that peak hour under normal conditions — far below the emergency conditions Texans experienced nearly five years ago.

Hirs says the strain on the grid isn't only from data centers. Cryptocurrency mining — another high-power, round-the-clock industry — has become one of Texas' biggest electricity users.

""The cryptocurrency miners now in the past year have used as much electricity as El Paso and the city of San Antonio,"" Hirs said. ""Now, just in 2021, that was up to the level of Austin.""

Many of those companies are planning to bring their own on-site power generation, which could help ease pressure on the statewide grid.

""Most of them are working to bring their own electricity generation with them,"" Hirs said. ""Texas has been fortunate with a huge build-out of wind, solar, and batteries, so we're better able to absorb these new data centers — at least for the time being.""

ERCOT's board will meet Tuesday in Austin to discuss and address the issue of large electronic loads, a category that includes both data centers and crypto mining operations.

Britain's National Energy System Operator will prioritise grid connection for the most viable power generation and storage projects in a huge overhaul of the system, it said on Monday, designed to root out zombie projects clogging up the process.

Britain has a target to largely decarbonise its power sector by 2030 which will require many more renewable power plants such as wind and solar which will need to be connected to the electricity grid.

The government has also said it wants the country to become an artificial intelligence “superpower” which will require grid connection for power-hungry data centres.

The overhaul replaces a first-come, first-served system that had created a queue of more than 700 gigawatts of projects seeking connection - four times the amount Britain needs to meet its 2030 clean power targets.

""These changes will cut grid bottlenecks by prioritising ready-to-build projects, giving certainty about when and where they can connect and unlocking billions in clean energy investment,"" Kayte O’Neill, NESO Chief Operating Officer, said.

Under the new process, projects with planning permission, land rights and alignment with national energy goals will be fast-tracked for connection.

Around 3,000 grid connection applications were assessed, with 132 GW identified as crucial for meeting the government's Clean Power 2030 target and a further 151 GW needed by 2035.

A further 99 GW of projects seeking power from the grid, such as data centres, will also be prioritised for connection, NESO said.

More than 300 GW of projects will not advance, having failed to demonstrate readiness or alignment with national objectives, it said.

Britain's Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government inherited ""a broken system where zombie projects were allowed to hold up grid connections for viable projects.""

The reforms follow months of collaboration between NESO, network operators, industry, regulator Ofgem and government officials, NESO said.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 22:00:13.627836

It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.
Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world.
In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned.
We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.","I’ve been thinking a lot about what it really costs to stay alive in this country. Not in the spiritual sense – in the literal one. The bills. The trade-offs. The quiet math families do when pain meets the price tag.

When I was 20, I broke my ankle. I had insurance. I did everything I was supposed to. Still, I’m paying for it – literally – years later. The surgery cost nearly $50,000. Even with insurance, I owed more than $10,000 out of pocket – payments that stretched on long after my leg healed.

More recently, I hurt my wrist chopping firewood to heat our home. My first thought wasn’t “how bad is it?” it was “can I afford to get this looked at?”

That’s the part people outside this reality don’t understand. It’s not the injury that breaks you, it’s the hesitation. The pause before asking for help because you already know the answer: it depends on your deductible.

Across the Shenandoah Valley where I live, people make this same calculation. Can I afford to get better?

We don’t talk about it much, but the numbers tell the story plain: about four in 10 adults in America carry medical or dental debt, and rural folks are more likely to struggle with it than people living in urban areas. Research shows medical problems and bills are among the leading contributors to personal bankruptcy. And for about seven in 10 adults with health care debt, the bills came from a one-time or short-term medical expense – a single hospital visit, an ER trip, or an unexpected procedure. One broken bone. One bad diagnosis. One stroke of bad luck, and your whole future can tip.

You learn to live smaller after that, to stretch prescriptions, to work through pain, to keep quiet about what hurts. To walk around with the silent fear that your body might betray your budget.

We’ve all become experts at pretending the system is normal, because it’s the only one we’ve ever known. But it’s not normal, it’s a choice.

Other nations – Norway, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, just to name a few – have made different choices about how to care for their people. None of them are perfect, and they’re not all the same. But they’ve each decided on one simple idea: getting sick shouldn’t mean going broke.

These countries pay for it in different ways, some through higher taxes, some through shared insurance systems, but the result is the same: people don’t have to hesitate before calling a doctor when something’s wrong. It’s not socialism. It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.

When I spoke recently with journalists from Norway and Sweden, they told me what care looks like where they live.

In Norway, a hospital stay doesn’t come with a payment plan. Education is free, prescriptions are affordable, and families don’t go bankrupt because a child gets sick.

People still work hard – farmers, factory workers, teachers – but they do it knowing one injury or illness won’t destroy everything they’ve built.

They pay more in taxes, but what they get in return is peace of mind. They don’t hesitate before calling the doctor. They don’t lie awake wondering if this month’s paycheck will cover both medicine and the electric bill.

It’s not a perfect system, none are, but it’s one built on the idea that care is a shared responsibility, not a luxury.

Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world. But access to them depends on what’s in your wallet.

Unfortunately, we also end up paying more for worse results by almost every measure: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and higher rates of chronic illness than other wealthy nations. In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned. We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.

I don’t bring this up as a political argument. This isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong.

It’s about neighbors, parents, co-workers – about the next time you hear someone cough in a quiet room and realize how fragile we all are – how easily health can become debt.

When I think about the future I think about my children and how I want them to inherit something better than this quiet cruelty. I want them to live in a country where care isn’t a privilege you earn but a promise we keep to one another.

Because someday, it won’t just be a headline. It’ll be someone you love sitting in an exam room, staring at a clipboard, doing the math in their head.

Wondering if healing is something they can afford.

We can do better than that.

We have to.

Because in the land of plenty, no one should have to go broke just to stay alive.

Hi there! Welcome to Ed’s Clean Energy & Sustainability Jobs List, where we know climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels such as gasoline, coal, oil, and fossil gas (“natural” gas), and that burning fossil gas in our homes makes us sick.

There are 83 jobs and internships in the full version of the newsletter this week.

Access to jobs that require less than five years experience or that are located outside of the U.S. are and will remain free. There are individual subscriptions ($7/month or $70/year) available as well as career center subscriptions ($300/year). College student? Please ask your career center to sign up for a paid subscription, especially if they pointed you here. Odds are they have not subscribed.

Want to support the jobs list, but can’t swing a subscription? I started an affiliate bookshop on Bookshop.org that will send me a small affiliate bonus if you purchase books using this link (https://bookshop.org/shop/EdsCleanJobs). I also included a selection of books that I’ve enjoyed that address climate change and climate solutions. You can also send me a one-time payment/tip using this link.

What I'm reading this week:

Colorado mandates ambitious emissions cuts for its gas utilities (Alison Takemura, Canary Media).

Cooking with gas gets more expensive as Americans face rising prices into 2026 (Oliver Milman, The Guardian).

Natural gas use for electricity in California falls as solar generation rises (Andrew Iraola, U.S. Energy Information Agency, Today in Energy). The 2025 chart from this article is really interesting because it shows batteries responding to the infamous ‘duck curve’. Not to mention the way solar and batteries are starting to eat fossil gas’s lunch.

A Wildfire Survivors Want to Rebuild All-Electric, but a Utility Is Using Customer Funds to Incentivize Gas Appliances (Hilary Beaumont, Inside Climate News). California residents - the CPUC has an open public comment period on this matter. The article includes a link and details.

Environmental (in)justice articles of the week:

New Analysis Provides More Evidence That Heat Standards Save Lives (Liza Gross, Inside Climate News)

The community has one of the highest rates of food insecurity in Chicago and risks becoming a food desert. Additionally, the area has a 13% unemployment rate, nearly double the Chicago average.

Green Era Campus aims to breathe new life into the community, and Chicago at large, through the transformation of a 9-acre vacant brownfield site into a renewable energy and urban farming campus. The organization envisions creating green energy and jobs, providing fresh produce, offering small business incubation and educational programming on its campus, and bringing community green space to the Auburn Gresham area.

The project uses a unique, closed-loop approach to drive economic development and sustainability initiatives, including tackling the problems of food waste. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, food waste is the largest solid waste stream reaching landfills in the US, with Chicago alone producing 55 million pounds of food waste per month. Green Era has developed an anaerobic digester that will recycle inedible food waste to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) and nutrient-rich compost. The project will provide the compost created by the digester at low cost to farmers throughout Chicago. This compost will also be used on the project’s urban farm, which is expected to grow over 26,000 pounds of produce annually.

“We want to show how closed-loop digester systems benefit the environment as well as the community,” said Jason Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Green Era Sustainability, a partner in Green Era Campus. “Green Era hopes to be at the forefront of what’s next for sustainable, equitable urban development.”

With our experience in low-carbon energy, our lawyers were able to provide pro bono support to Green Era on a range of projects, most notably preparing an RNG offtake agreement that allowed the project to optimize the creation of its anaerobic digester.

Our engagement with Green Era is part of a broader effort to support individuals and organizations advancing sustainability worldwide.

We also assisted Green Era in interconnecting with a nearby natural gas pipeline, where it will inject the RNG created by its anaerobic digester. With this interconnection, Green Era can sell the RNG it generates to create revenue to support its urban food waste recycling and urban farming operations. The interconnection agreement was finalized in December 2023, and Green Era is now able to inject the RNG it produces into the fossil natural gas pipeline system. In further support of the project’s closed-loop system, our lawyers are helping Green Era negotiate a solar power purchase agreement and associated lease. As of April 2025, the self-sustaining anaerobic digester is fully operational.

“By starting from a community-oriented perspective, Green Era is taking a holistic approach to environmental sustainability,” said partner Josh Bledsoe, who oversees the Latham team working with the organization. “Green Era’s approach is truly unique, serving as a model not just for Chicago, but for cities across the United States.”

“Creating a community-centered climate-resilient hub is not only timely as we collectively understand the need for clean and renewable energy, but also the daily need in our neighborhoods for health-affirming food that can be grown by everyone. Most importantly, we hope that through the project our youth see the potential for their participation in green initiatives, as well as career and academic pathways,” said Erika Allen, founder and CEO for Urban Growers Collective, and president of Green ERA Educational NFP.

Following the completion of the anaerobic digester, our lawyers are assisting Green Era with feedstock supply agreements in order for the organization to develop a sustainable and efficient food waste management solution.",https://www.lw.com/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-07 19:02:06.974443

The petition requests that the EPA add microplastics to its unregulated contaminants list, which is a list of emerging contaminants not currently required to be monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.
The rule would allow data to be collected on microplastics and for the development of a monitoring program for drinking water across the country.
Renkoski said the current drinking water treatment systems were not designed for PFAS or for microplastics.
“In the few testings that have been done with drinking water, we are definitely seeing microplastics,” Renkoski said.","Governor Gretchen Whitmer and six other governors have signed a petition urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to monitor and collect data on microplastics.

The petition requests that the EPA add microplastics to its unregulated contaminants list, which is a list of emerging contaminants not currently required to be monitored under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act.

Being added to the list means that microplastics would fall under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR). The rule would allow data to be collected on microplastics and for the development of a monitoring program for drinking water across the country.

The governors said a provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the EPA to place microplastics on the monitoring list because the petitionhas the signatures of seven governors. Michigan’s Whitmer joins governors — all Democratic — from New Jersey, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Wisconsin, and Connecticut.

Tami Renkoski, the co-founder of the Michigan Microplastics Coalition, said she was “thrilled” that Governor Whitmer signed the petition. “We appreciate all the work she has done to protect our Great Lakes and our beautiful state of Michigan,” she said.

Renkoski said the current drinking water treatment systems were not designed for PFAS or for microplastics. “So there would need to be some work done to get systems up to speed to remove those contaminants,” she said.

Renkoski said because microplastics are an emerging contaminant, researchers are still working on determining the maximum amount of microplastics people can consume before it becomes dangerous. “In the few testings that have been done with drinking water, we are definitely seeing microplastics,” Renkoski said. “But how much is too much, we don’t know yet.”

Microplastics are pervasive. Renkoski said they’ve been found in all parts of the human body and in fish in the Great Lakes. “It's like we have the faucet and the bathtub turned on, and it's overflowing,” she said. “It's nonstop. We have created so many plastic products, they're everywhere.”

Research on microplastic health and environmental effects is ongoing. Renkoski said they won’t know the extent of the problem until more data is gathered on microplastics.

Daines Pushes for Repeal",Tristan Scott,,,,,https://flatheadbeacon.com/2025/12/07/as-conservation-groups-rally-support-for-roadless-rule-sen-daines-pushes-for-repeal/,"Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the Roadless Area Conservation Act (RACA) would protect nearly 60 million acres of national forestland.
The legislation would codify the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) as well as the Colorado and Idaho Roadless Rules that collectively protect nearly 60 million acres of roadless national forest land in 39 states, including Montana.
“Senator Daines supports repealing the Roadless Rule,” according to an emailed statement from the spokesperson.
Established under the Clinton administration and enacted in 2001, the Roadless Rule generally prohibits road building and logging in all 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas.
Later that year, President Clinton instructed the agency to undertake a rulemaking process to provide long-term administrative protection for roadless areas.","Despite a growing chorus of conservation advocates calling on Montana’s congressional delegates to defend roadless wildlands through permanent protections, a bill to do so seems unlikely to advance without Republican support, including that of U.S. Sen. Steve Daines.

A Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on which Daines serves held a hearing Dec. 2 to consider a slate of 26 public lands and wildfire bills, among them a measure to enshrine the decades-old Roadless Rule into law. Re-introduced in June by U.S. Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., the Roadless Area Conservation Act (RACA) would protect nearly 60 million acres of national forestland. Although it has failed before, its supporters say this version comes at a pivotal moment as the Trump administration moves to roll back safeguards introduced in 2001.

Hoping to capitalize on the blitz of bipartisan support that last summer helped cleave a public land sale provision out of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — a moment when Montana’s Republican-led congressional delegation stood in uniform opposition to the sale — conservation groups this week mounted a similar pressure campaign on Daines.

“If Daines chooses to stop RACA while supporting the Roadless Rule rollback, he’ll expose how empty his public-land promises are,” according to a statement from Wild Montana Federal Policy Director Hilary Eisen. The nonprofit environmental group was among a coalition of more than 200 organizations to urge committee leadership to support RACA in a Dec. 2 letter.

The legislation would codify the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule (Roadless Rule) as well as the Colorado and Idaho Roadless Rules that collectively protect nearly 60 million acres of roadless national forest land in 39 states, including Montana.

Daines and his fellow Republican delegates from the Treasure State received plaudits from the conservation community after joining ranks with a bipartisan coalition to hobble the land selloff provision. U.S. House Rep. Ryan Zinke even led the charge against the sale in the House before Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, revived the provision in the Senate, putting all eyes on Daines and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy, who both stood firm and eventually wore Lee into submission.

Further burnishing his conservation credentials, Daines recently joined the bipartisan Senate Stewardship Caucus, pledging to “be [a] good steward of the land we’re blessed to live in.”

“This is his moment to prove he means it,” Eisen said. “The Roadless Area Conservation Act is a common-sense, fiscally responsible measure that protects our roadless wildlands by preventing reckless road-building and unnecessary logging, ensuring that our remote, backcountry areas remain intact for wildlife, recreation, and clean water.”

But if Daines was swayed by the political pressure earlier this year, he’s not bending to any calls for him to reverse his position on the Roadless Rule now, particularly after hailing its repeal as “another huge win for Montana and forest management.”

On Dec. 5, a spokesperson confirmed that Montana’s senior senator has not softened his stance.

“Senator Daines supports repealing the Roadless Rule,” according to an emailed statement from the spokesperson. “This action by the Trump administration is a huge win for Montana and will allow us to better manage our forests and protect our communities from catastrophic wildfires.”

The statement from Daines mirrored testimony that committee members heard Dec. 2 from U.S. Forest Service Acting Associate Chief Chris French who said the Roadless Rule has created “barriers to protecting the communities from wildland fire risk.”

“There’s more than 24 million acres of the wildland urban interface that are either within roadless or within a mile of roadless, of which we are restricted from how we treat those areas other than, let’s say, using prescribed fire access,” French said.

When pressed by Sen. Martin Heinrich, the committee’s ranking Democrat from New Mexico, about the “substantial amounts of those roadless areas being treated for fire prevention,” French clarified that the Roadless Rule doesn’t prohibit treatment, but rather “limits the type of activities that you can do” and makes fuels reduction work cumbersome and more expensive.

“Oftentimes, when you’re doing field production work, the actual value that is coming out of those materials is minimal compared to the actual cost of doing that,” French said. “So, in order for us to do more acres and create broader areas of treatments, we need to do the most efficient treatments that we can, providing access and providing the ability to get in there and do that is the way to make that happen. Otherwise, those costs for doing that work are extremely, extremely expensive.”

In northwest Montana, proponents of the Roadless Rule say that framing it as a barrier to active forest management is a mischaracterization, and that, while its value as a conservation tool is unmatched — in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, for instance, eliminating the Roadless Rule would remove critical safeguards against logging and roadbuilding across 9 million undeveloped acres — its genesis was born of utility and agency efficiency rather than an advocacy apparatus to obstruct.

Established under the Clinton administration and enacted in 2001, the Roadless Rule generally prohibits road building and logging in all 58.5 million acres of national forest roadless areas. It makes exceptions to access non-federal land inholdings and pre-existing mineral leases, and it allows some logging to reduce fire risk, improve habitat or aid in the recovery of endangered species, including whitebark pine. The primary thrust of the federal rulemaking initiative was geared toward reining in the scale of road-building activities by the Forest Service, which maintains eight times more miles of road than the Interstate Highway System.

The impetus for the Roadless Rule tracks back to 1998, when former U.S. Forest Service Chief Mike Dombeck saw the agency’s vast and poorly maintained road system as a major environmental and fiscal problem and proposed a temporary moratorium on road construction in inventoried roadless areas across most of the National Forest System. At the time, the agency’s road maintenance and reconstruction backlog had ballooned to $8.4 billion while it received only 20% of the annual funding needed to maintain the existing road system to current environmental and safety standards.

The agency adopted an 18-month moratorium in February 1999, pending completion of an overall road management policy. Later that year, President Clinton instructed the agency to undertake a rulemaking process to provide long-term administrative protection for roadless areas. Over the next 14 months, the Forest Service conducted an extensive public involvement process that produced 1.7 million comments, with the majority favoring a strong national policy protecting roadless areas.

The Flathead National Forest includes an inventoried roadless area spanning 478,000 acres, mostly flanking the Bob Marshall Wilderness Area along the Swan Range, as well as west of the North Fork Flathead River in the Whitefish Range. In the Kootenai National Forest, about 639,000 roadless acres border the Cabinet Mountains Wilderness.

During the committee hearing on Dec. 2, Sen. Cantwell said the U.S. Forest Service’s support of repealing the Roadless Rule seems counterintuitive given that the agency is still struggling to maintain its sprawling inventory of roads and clear a $5.9 billion maintenance backlog.

“Instead of the Forest Service maintaining the existing system this administration wants to rescind the long-standing roadless rule to potentially build more roads that the Forest Service won’t be able to take care of,” Cantwell said.

According to French, the Roadless Rule “doesn’t compel road construction.”

“The primary driver is that there’s more than 24 million acres that are within our wildland urban interface that we can’t effectively treat right now,” French said.

Reiterating the importance of including the public in policy decisions, Heinrich, the senator from New Mexico, encouraged French to “have a robust public process before making these decisions” to repeal the 24-year-old administrative rule. At the time of the rule’s promulgation, more than 600 public hearings were held across the country and 1.6 million Americans expressed public support.

“You called the Roadless Rule a barrier. Do you know what sportsmen in New Mexico call the roadless areas that are protected in our state?” Heinrich asked French. “They call it elk habitat.”",https://flatheadbeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251116_MORAN_CABIN_160.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 17:59:46.495224

There is a cost when culture war narratives are placed at the center of national security doctrine.
National security analysis becomes less coherent when ideological boundaries define the set of acceptable conclusions.
A national security strategy grounded in the realities of the twenty first century would look different from the one offered in 2025.
The US 2025 national security strategy is the document of an empire in decline, thrashing as it fades.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

A national security strategy is supposed to describe the world as it is and explain how a country intends to navigate the constraints and opportunities in front of it. It is meant to be a map, not a message, and certainly not a mirror held up to a single political identity. The 2025 US national security strategy, released on December 4th, tries to present a unified view of American power but the foundation on which it rests is out of alignment with the physical, economic and geopolitical forces that will shape this century. A strategy built on a foundation of illusions becomes more fragile over time. The gap between the world described in this document and the world visible in the data is so wide that it is doomed to fail.

A good strategy begins with a diagnosis of reality. Richard Rumelt has argued for years that strategy is impossible without a sound understanding of the problem a leader is trying to solve. The current document offers a diagnosis that is framed through cultural and civilizational anxieties rather than observable global trends. Electrification, renewable generation, battery storage, demographic diversification, science driven migration flows, the institutional realignment of middle powers, and the emergence of new industrial supply chains are barely acknowledged. These are the forces reshaping global systems. A national security strategy is supposed to engage with these forces directly. Instead, it adopts a posture rooted in defensive cultural narratives that do not match the underlying physics or economics. This is the point where strategic drift begins.

The strategy attempts to anchor American strength in a vision of energy dominance based on oil, gas and nuclear energy. The world is moving in a different direction. Electric vehicles continue to climb in market share. Battery costs continue to fall on learning curves that have proven durable for two decades. Solar and wind generation are the cheapest sources of new electricity everywhere. Countries that rely on fossil imports are trying to replace them because volatility is expensive and electrified systems offer more control. Electricity as a commodity is becoming more central to every economic sector. High voltage transmission, long duration storage, flexible grids and clean industrial heat are the new strategic assets. Oil and gas exporters can still earn revenue during the transition but their leverage over other states diminishes as electrification spreads. Nuclear energy remains part of the mix but its export pathways are slow and capital heavy. A strategy that claims long term dominance through fossil exports is aiming at a shrinking target while the rest of the world invests in the next system.

The strategy’s focus on energy dominance overlooks the internal contradictions created by trying to satisfy both export driven revenue ambitions and the promise of cheap domestic energy for reshored industry. Higher exports pull U.S. oil and gas prices toward global market levels, which raises costs for industry and households at home. The shale sector adds another constraint. Producers have already exploited many of the highest profit sites, and new wells tend to decline faster and cost more to drill. This means the country is at the plateau of economically extractable oil and gas under current conditions. Maintaining high output becomes more expensive over time. Pursuing dominance through exports will therefore push domestic prices upward even as the underlying resource base becomes harder to develop. The alternative pathway, which relies on the continued expansion of renewables that already deliver low cost power in many regions, receives no attention in the strategy. Renewables appear only indirectly as something to be politically rejected under the label of “Net Zero ideology.” A transition to clean electricity would lower long term energy costs and strengthen economic competitiveness. The current policy direction moves in the opposite direction by tying American energy futures to a resource profile that is losing both cost advantage and structural relevance.

The strategy presents reshoring as a straightforward path to renewed industrial strength, but it does not acknowledge the conditions required for that shift to succeed. Large scale manufacturing investment depends on long term policy and regulatory stability because companies commit capital on multi decade timelines. The current environment, marked by abrupt tariff changes, political turnover and unpredictable administrative actions, increases risk for foreign investors who would otherwise finance new plants in the United States. I haven’t spoken to an investor this year who would commit long-term capital to the United States, leaving investments to speculation. Trump’s erratic policies have raised the price of debt and capital in the country, as money providers require greater returns due to the greater risks. Another overlooked constraint is the loss of industrial expertise after forty five years of offshoring. Many of the factories that left the country took with them skilled engineers, production specialists and operational knowledge that now reside in Asia and parts of Europe. Rebuilding advanced manufacturing capacity requires attracting those skills back into the country, which means welcoming foreign talent rather than restricting it. These conflicts were in sharp display at the battery factory where hundreds of South Korean nationals were arrested by ICE. These realities conflict directly with the strategy’s posture toward global investment and migration. A serious reshoring effort needs stable policy, predictable regulation and access to global expertise. None of these conditions are strengthened by the approach described in the document.

Soft power has always been one of the most durable elements of American influence. Culture, political values, stable institutions, scientific leadership and predictable diplomacy—elements of Joseph Nye’s widely accepted framework on soft power—created a reservoir of attraction that made alliances easier to maintain and agreements easier to negotiate. The current trajectory is rapidly eroding these sources. Tariffs on allies signal unpredictability. Cuts to aid programs signal retreat from global engagement and a key source of goodwill and contacts in recipient nations. Negative rhetoric aimed at partners makes cooperation more difficult. Visa tightening and suspicion of foreign researchers make the academic and scientific ecosystem less attractive. Public diplomacy institutions lose their reach when they are reduced in scope. Soft power takes time to build but it can erode faster than many expect when trust is damaged. The Trump Administration’s of the past year have caused significant and in some cases catastrophic decline in every aspect of US soft power. Instead, pandering to Trump is apparently seen as evidence of the existence of soft power, instead of placation of a dangerous and erratic world leader. A strategy that claims unparalleled soft power while acting in ways that radically undermine it is describing an asset that no longer exists in the same form.

Migration and demographic change receive heavy emphasis in the strategy. These themes appear as threats to national character and security. The data does not support this view. Immigrants in the United States, including undocumented immigrants, are less likely to commit crimes than native born citizens. They contribute to economic dynamism by adding skills and entrepreneurial capacity in regions that need both. Population growth driven by immigration has been an important part of American resilience. Demographic diversification supports innovation because different backgrounds and experiences create new problem solving approaches. Half of the US Fortune 500 were founded by immigrants or their children, and they certainly aren’t all white. Treating migration as a cultural threat rather than a policy challenge does not help the country align resources with real needs. Policies grounded in fear instead of evidence struggle to produce effective outcomes. A strategy that presents immigration as a driver of instability ignores the broad record of contribution that newcomers have made for generations.

The strategy misdiagnoses religious freedom and domestic sources of violence by framing Christianity as a besieged identity rather than recognising the real distribution of risk and harm in the United States. Federal threat assessments during the past decade have consistently identified rising violence against religious minorities, especially Jewish and Muslim communities, alongside extremist movements that draw heavily from Christian identity narratives. Domestic violence trends have been shaped by economic strain, gun access and online radicalisation rather than by any decline in the status of Christianity. By reversing these patterns and presenting the majority faith as the primary victim, the strategy directs attention away from the groups that are actually targeted. This framing is likely to produce policies that strengthen surveillance of minority communities and weaken surveillance of the actual sources of violence in the United States, something exemplified by the pardoning of the insurrectionists from January 6th, many of who are already back in jail for more violent offences after release. It will also encourage political rhetoric that deepens division inside the country rather than addressing the conditions that drive violence. A strategy that begins with a distorted diagnosis will struggle to produce coherent action because it focuses on threats that do not match the evidence.

Alliances are a strategic asset that depends on trust. The past few decades show that economic integration and shared democratic institutions create strong partnerships. The behaviour of a country toward its allies signals whether it can be counted on in difficult times. Aggressive tariff measures, public criticism of allied leaders, sudden shifts in diplomatic positions and inconsistent commitments weaken confidence. Countries respond by hedging. They develop deeper relationships with regional partners. They reduce reliance on American supply chains. They negotiate trade agreements without American involvement. Trust is not a soft concept. It is a material component of national security because it shapes the coalitions that determine global outcomes. A strategy that treats alliances as transactional loses sight of the long term value that stability creates.

There is a cost when culture war narratives are placed at the center of national security doctrine. Strategic clarity depends on a willingness to describe the world accurately. When racialized demographic fears or claims of civilizational decline are folded into official policy documents, the result is a distorted view of threats and opportunities. These narratives discourage cooperation with diverse domestic constituencies and with international partners who do not share the same identity framing. They focus attention on symbolic conflicts instead of structural challenges. They create friction in diplomacy because allies perceive the shift in tone immediately. National security analysis becomes less coherent when ideological boundaries define the set of acceptable conclusions.

A national security strategy grounded in the realities of the twenty first century would look different from the one offered in 2025. It would begin by acknowledging the global electrification trend and the rise of energy systems built around renewables, storage and flexible grids. It would frame climate as an operational risk that must be managed to maintain readiness. It would rebuild trust with allies by offering predictable commitments. It would anchor soft power by strengthening democratic institutions, open science and pluralism. It would treat migration as a policy domain where managed integration supports economic and social resilience. It would invest in clean industrial pathways for steel, cement, chemicals and logistics because these sectors will define competitiveness in the next decades. It would align American interests with the broad shifts already underway rather than resisting them.

The map in the current document does not match the terrain. The world is changing and the drivers of strategic advantage are changing with it. The United States has substantial assets that can support a renewed leadership role. For this to happen, the country needs a strategy that begins with an accurate diagnosis of the world as it stands and the world it is moving toward. This strategy then needs to stand for more than election cycle. The past decade has seen the US incapable of holding to and executing strategy past mid-terms, never mind presidential election cycles. The US 2025 national security strategy is the document of an empire in decline, thrashing as it fades.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_xr01jwxr01jwxr01-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-07 16:59:52.666639

Despite this year’s sharp U-turn in federal energy policy, the renewable energy transition continues to branch out in new directions. One emerging factor is the relatively new area of floating solar. The field has already begun to scale up in some regions around the world, and innovative solar firms are carving out new opportunities here in the US as well.

Floating Solar Scales Up To Beat Fossil Fuels

Back in 2018 the US Department of Energy (such as it was back then) assessed the potential floating solar capacity of the US on reservoirs and other human-made bodies of water. After eliminating thousands of unsuitable locations, they still identified over 24,000 potential sites with the combined potential to provide for about 10% of annual US electricity generation at the time.

The appeal of floating solar lies partly in its ability to make space for renewable energy in land-constrained areas. Whether located on reservoirs and other built infrastructure, or on open water, floating PV arrays can also be moored in place with a minimum of site preparation, avoiding considerable expense for developers (see lots more floating PV background here).

Scaleup is already in evidence in some parts of the world, with the Asian Pacific Region (APAC) being a particular focus of attention. Last year the firm Wood Mackenzie surmised that APAC will account for the fast majority — 57 gigawatts — of an anticipated 77 gigawatts in global solar capacity by 2033.

A study published in the journal Energy & Environmental Science this year affirms the focus on APAC. “Offshore floating photovoltaic (OFPV) systems present a promising opportunity to expand global solar energy capacity, particularly for countries with limited land resources but extensive maritime zones,” the authors note.

The researchers modeled offshore floating solar potential based on economic datasets as well as geographic and climatic data. “The analysis reveals that up to 95% of analyzed offshore regions fall within conditions suitable for current FPV technologies, with Southeast Asia—particularly Indonesia and Malaysia—emerging as optimal early deployment zones due to favorable irradiance, bathymetry, and competitive LCOE,” they concluded, referring to Levelized Cost of Energy, a standard of comparison among different forms of power generation.

More generally, the new study found that in 84% of regions around the world, less than 2% of offshore water surface would be needed to meet current electricity demands.

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

The big question, of course, is cost. The floating solar industry has been maturing rapidly, but it is still a relatively new field of endeavor. Costs are expected to drop in the coming years, but even at this stage of the game the technology is competitive, or nearly competitive, with other power generation resources in some regions.

The competitiveness showing was particularly strong in Thailand and Malaysia, where most of the lowest-cost potential surfaced at less than 6 cents per kWh. More broadly, in 53% of the regions studied, the researchers calculated an LCOE below 15 cents per kilowatt-hour.

“As OFPV remains an emerging technology, it is expected that continued research and operational experience will enable optimization across manufacturing, system integration, and deployment, leading to further cost reductions over time,” the researchers concluded.

Meanwhile, Back In The USA

In terms of scale-up, the US has a long way to go. China, of course, has already put down record-breaking stakes in the offshore floating solar industry, having commissioned a 1-gigawatt array off the coast of Shandong Province last year. Meanwhile, the largest existing array in the US sits on a reservoir in New Jersey, clocking in at just 8.9 megawatts.

Still, even at a small scale, floating solar arrays can make a big difference in their host communities.

In New Jersey, for example, the borough of Bernardsville is considering a proposal to float solar panels on the site of a former quarry. As reported by the news organization New Jersey Hills, the project supports the state’s community solar initiative. Electricity ratepayers can voluntarily subscribe to the quarry project and receive a discount estimated at 30%, a significant benefit in today’s environment of skyrocketing energy costs.

NJH reporter Charlie Zavalick also takes note of land use advantages at the site. The quarry sits on private land with no public access and no current recreational use. According to the developer, surrounding communities do not have a view of the site that would be spoiled by the addition of solar panels.

The project could qualify as a community solar project under state law if 51% of its capacity is taken up by subscribers classified as low-income. That’s not a particularly easy benchmark to reach in parts of suburban New Jersey. However, Bernardsville has three affordable housing projects under way and additional projects are in the planning stages, which could help push low-income subscriptions over the goal line.

Floating Solar Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Keep an eye on New Jersey for more floating solar news. Solar developers in the state dodged a bullet on Election Day this year, when the Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill handily beat her Trump-allied opponent, assuring renewable energy stakeholders of a reliable ally in the Governor’s office for at least the next four years, if not longer.

Meanwhile, the prospective developer of the quarry project, Third Pillar Solar, is also pursuing industrial sites elsewhere around the US. Inactive bodies of water are just one opportunity. In Texas, the company has signed on with the firm Diamond Infrastructure Services to assess its portfolio of reservoirs under management for solar potential.

Based on a preliminary assessment, Third Pillar anticipates building a total of 500 megawatts in floating solar under Diamond’s purview. In addition to earning new revenue from existing sites, the projects are expected to save money for Diamond’s clients by preventing excess water evaporation.

Since everything is bigger in Texas, the state is also on track to host the first large-scale floating PV array in the US, at 391 megawatts. The proposed site is a human-made coastal lake under the jurisdiction of Port Arthur, where it is presumably shielded from interference by the Interior Department and other federal agencies.

Next Steps For Floating Solar

The shade from solar panels can help conserve water in natural bodies of water, too, but researchers point out that the array must be designed to minimize if not eliminate other impacts on the aquatic habitat and the wildlife it supports.

Among the recent studies to that effect, last summer a team of researchers at Cornell University assessed that if just 3.5% of the existing bodies of water in the Northeast were deployed for floating solar, they would generate 25% of the solar energy needs in the region by 2050 — with the additional benefit of conserving land for other purposes.

That 3.5% figure includes bodies of water with significant recreation and biodiversity roles. Weeding them out of the pool of qualified sites, the researchers found that floating solar would only contribute 5% of solar energy needs to the Northeast. Still 5% is a fairly substantial figure in a region strapped for open land, potentially reserving thousands of acres for other uses. The researchers also point out that 5% represents an increase of 194% over the current capacity of land-based solar arrays in the Northeast.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/floating-solar-third-pillar.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 14:59:11.052218

Flexible Data Centers: A Faster, More Affordable Path to Power | Camus Energy

Data centers can make grids more reliable, resilient, and affordable if integrated well. A new study out this week sheds light on what that entails::

The answer to the question: can flexibility allows data centers to connect faster? A resounding “yes.” Building on existing “connect and manage” models, our results showed that a small amount of local flexibility could enable loads to connect 3-5 years sooner.

Further, bringing a set of onsite power solutions (including load flexibility, onsite battery, and gas generation), when paired with procured capacity from renewable, battery, or VPP resources, can enable sites to entirely offset the additional system costs of adding new loads.

The result is a better grid - one which can support a lot more load, in which energy and capacity prices both remain stable, and in which there are new sources of system flexibility which can increase the overall resilience of the system.

The full study is linked in the Camus post. I highly encourage anyone interested in this area to spend some time with it. It’s one of the best studies I’ve seen on the topic and likely to garner significant attention, akin to the Duke University demand flexibility study done earlier this year.

The study was co-written by Camus Energy. I talked at lengthen about all these topics with Camus CEO Astrid Atkinson just two months ago:

How do you get them online without tripping into a bunch of necessary capital investments to serve that last few percent of hours where their demand needs to be served? Or can you source flexibility out of the system from somewhere else, like residential air conditioning, or something like that?

That’s a question that’s very important to figure out. People have kind of issue-spotted it but we’ve kind of really yet to solve it in any meaningful way.

The markets like Texas are geared toward solving it in more of a free enterprise premise, other markets seem to be struggling a bit.

So much more good stuff in this one. And to hear my more about using distributed flexibility to lower costs and increase grid reliability, listen to my discussion with Travis:

Home upgrades can power job growth | Rewiring America

Picking up on Travis’ point, permanent residential and small business demand reductions from energy efficiency and demand flexibility can lower consumers’ energy bills and create headroom on the grid for data centers. The classic win-win. But the benefits don’t stop there.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vIq0!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1427092-9b71-41fd-8a51-5e26019f7d98_1600x1056.png",N,,2025-12-07 16:59:44.817207

It is the second factory for Viridi, after the one at their headquarters in Buffalo, New York.
The Richmond facility produces electric generators that have the capacity to power home, industrial, and even larger energy intensive needs.
“We’re a green energy company.
“And we’re like, why don’t we open the door to all these different types of energy, not just coal, gas, and oil.","LEGISLATORS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY gathered inside a new battery factory along Richmond’s waterfront this past week to learn about advances in energy storage technology.

Adjacent to the Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historical Park in Richmond is a 40,000-square-foot battery factory for the industrial manufacturer Viridi, which plans to rapidly expand its workforce as it ramps up production on the West Coast.

Richmond Mayor Eduardo Martinez was present at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the facility in April, but returned Wednesday to speak to legislators who had traveled from as far as South Carolina and Ohio to tour the facility.

“The goal is to strengthen our ability to support clean energy and manufacturing and to provide companies with consistent points of context from day one,” said Martinez. “This service ties with a much larger vision for our shorelines. We are reimagining a working waterfront that honors the Rosie legacy while preparing for a cleaner future and the manufacturing industry and support staff.”

The factory opened after receiving a $9 million grant from the California Energy Commission. It is the second factory for Viridi, after the one at their headquarters in Buffalo, New York. The Richmond facility produces electric generators that have the capacity to power home, industrial, and even larger energy intensive needs.

Viridi president Eric Stein said the facility has the capacity to grow the workforce from the current size of 12 employees to a possible 75 within the next few months. He said the demand for batteries and generators, such as the ones they produce, is rapidly growing and the company can capitalize on using automation to meet demand while also adding skilled jobs.

“… We are reimagining a working waterfront that honors the Rosie legacy while preparing for a cleaner future and the manufacturing industry and support staff.”

Mayor Eduardo Martinez

“There’s a lot of automation that we can bring in, not to displace workers, but to actually expand, to build more products here and bring more people,” said Stein. “So one of the great things about our workforce is when we go to automation, we actually uplift the skill set, because we take people who were assembling product and turning screwdrivers and we train them on higher-end automation and robotics.”

Seeing green

Tess Williams, a project manager with Viridi, proudly spoke into a microphone as she walked backwards leading the tour. She said the company’s most popular product, the RPS150, has been used in hospitals, by emergency responders, and even at the Burning Man music festival. According to Williams, the company is making an effort to minimize their carbon footprint in Richmond during production and when their products reach the end of their service lives.

“We’re a green energy company. We’re not just going to throw these things out when we’re done,” said Williams. “Like anything at the end of its life, there are some parts of it that get thrown out, but 90-plus percent of the unit is reusable, recyclable, or goes to that company that can recycle them at that point, and it’s something we take pride in.”

One of the out-of-state legislators who traveled to learn more about the new technology was Ohio State Rep. Tristan Rader, who represents parts of Cleveland and Lakewood. He said it was encouraging to see many other legislators also in attendance as his home state attempts to address energy affordability issues.

“Both Democrats, Republicans are finally getting together saying we have got to deal with this affordability issue,” said Rader. “And we’re like, why don’t we open the door to all these different types of energy, not just coal, gas, and oil. If it’s cheaper then why not try to bring that to people.”",https://i0.wp.com/localnewsmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LNM-20251205-BATTERYFACTORY-01.jpg?fit=2000%2C1130&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-07 14:00:56.937051

The school announced it will receive a $60 million commitment from the Dallas-based O’Donnell Foundation to create a new interdisciplinary energy studies program and a named honors fund. The gift will seed the Energy Science, Innovation and Enterprise curriculum, help recruit faculty across campus, and underwrite scholarships and career advising for selected students. University leaders say the investment ranks among the largest recent gifts to SMU and is aimed at preparing graduates for jobs across North Texas’s energy economy.

New program and honors fund

According to The Dallas Morning News, the donation will launch SMU’s Energy Science, Innovation and Enterprise program and create the O’Donnell Academic Honors Fund, with offerings set to begin in fall 2026. The program is described as interdisciplinary, pulling faculty from SMU’s business, engineering and humanities and sciences schools to teach technical, entrepreneurial and policy skills. The honors fund will provide four years of seed money to recruit faculty and a career counselor, and scholarships for about 20 students in each initial major.

Why Dallas is the focus

Texas still dominates U.S. energy production and jobs, a reality SMU officials say makes the program timely. Data highlighted by the Dallas Fed and federal energy employment reports show the state supplies a huge share of the nation’s wind and fossil fuel output and supports roughly 990,100 energy related jobs. ""Dallas has all of that, and that's why SMU is really the ideal place to locate a program like this,"" Bruce Bullock of SMU’s Maguire Energy Institute told The Dallas Morning News.

SMU’s fundraising backdrop

The donation arrives as SMU builds on a multiyear fundraising surge. SMU reports that its Ignited campaign topped $1.64 billion earlier this year, giving leaders more flexibility to invest in new academic priorities. The university also points to its new R1 research status and a roughly $2.3 billion endowment as factors that will amplify the gift’s effect. SMU notes that the O’Donnell Foundation previously invested in the university, including a $30 million commitment in 2023 that helped expand data science and engineering programs.

Donor profile and regional investments

The O’Donnell Foundation has been a major funder across North Texas education and research for decades, with a stated focus on math, science and the arts. In October the foundation pledged a separate $50 million investment to bolster college success across Dallas County, a package that directed funds to several local institutions including UT Dallas, according to UT Dallas.

SMU leaders say the program and honors fund are meant to attract students seeking careers in energy and to deepen ties between the university and industry across North Texas. Offerings and scholarships are slated to begin in fall 2026, and university officials say they will use the coming months to recruit faculty and finalize curriculum details.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/dallas-donor-drops-dollar60-million-on-smu-to-supercharge-energy-honors-hub-4.webp,N,,2025-12-07 13:00:16.485279

The federal tax credit for EV chargers will also come to an end in June 2026.
Under the Biden administration, it was announced that Chicago would receive $14.5 million in federal funds to develop nearly 200 EV charging stations.
To date, 38 communities have enrolled in the programme, which has driven up EV uptake in these areas, compared to other parts of the state.
However, several U.S. states and EV-makers see a bright future in EVs, suggesting that the uptake of electric vehicles will continue to increase, even if at a slower pace.","Since taking office in January, United States President Trump has spoken out against electric vehicles (EVs), signing an executive order to scrap the “EV mandate” (despite there being no such federal mandate). In recent months, federal support for EVs has waned under the Trump administration, resulting in announcements of delays for several EV-makers due to the ongoing sectoral uncertainty. However, some states are doubling down on efforts to expand their EV markets, with heavy investments in charging infrastructure and other initiatives.

Trump’s executive order sought to halt federal support for EVs, including a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers, which was established by law in 2022, as well as government support for EV charging infrastructure, and low-interest loans for automakers looking to develop EV and battery plants. Trump also stated plans to eliminate local regulations from California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington to ban the sale of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035.

In September, the government officially halted tax credits on new and second-hand EVs. However, several carmakers, such as General Motors and Ford, have, so far, maintained their highly competitive pricing plans on EVs, to encourage consumers to make the shift from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to electric. The federal tax credit for EV chargers will also come to an end in June 2026.

The CEO of the automaker Ford, Jim Farley, said, “I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” in reference to the scrapping of the EV tax credits.

Price reductions on EVs are expected to help counter the scrapping of the tax credit on electric cars in the short term; however, the growing uncertainty around EV uptake could drive some automakers to stall new EV production, which could slow the pace of uptake in the coming years.

Some EV makers are still betting big on the rising uptake of EVs in the United States. In August, Ford announced $5 billion in financing for EV production as part of its “new Model T moment”. Ford plans to sell an EV pickup for $30,000, supported by the new investment, which would make its EVs highly competitive with alternative ICE models. Other companies also expect to be able to reduce the prices of EV models in the coming years, as production expands and the cost of manufacturing EVs decreases.

Meanwhile, Hyundai said it planned to maintain its EV investments in the United States. The firm’s CEO, José Muñoz, said that it could shift between producing EVs and ICE vehicles at its Georgia plant, which will allow it to respond to market demand.

General Motors CFO, Paul Jacobson, stated, “We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand.” “That’s going to take a little bit of time. We’ll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.” Jacobson still expects a longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit, albeit at a slower pace.

At the state level, several U.S. states are doubling down on plans to expand their EV markets even without federal support. Under the Biden administration, it was announced that Chicago would receive $14.5 million in federal funds to develop nearly 200 EV charging stations. However, Trump announced that this investment would not go ahead, as he suspended the Charging and Fuelling Infrastructure grant programme.

Nevertheless, Chicago is continuing with its EV Readiness programme with funding from the Illinois utility ComEd. Illinois aims to roll out 1 million EVs across the state by 2030, a significant rise from the 160,000 registered vehicles at present. It is making sure it stays on track to meet this goal with the launch of its fourth EV Readiness cohort, supporting representatives of 16 municipalities in upgrading their permitting and zoning processes related to EV charging, as well as raising awareness about EVs and state and local incentives.

To date, 38 communities have enrolled in the programme, which has driven up EV uptake in these areas, compared to other parts of the state. Cristina Botero, the senior manager of beneficial electrification for ComEd, explained, “People sometimes think that the dollars are the only reason people are not transitioning to EVs,” said Botero. “But a big part of it is education.""

The Trump administration has attacked the U.S. EV industry on several fronts, scrapping tax credits for consumers, making it more expensive for manufacturers to produce EVs, and halting the rollout of EV charging infrastructure. However, several U.S. states and EV-makers see a bright future in EVs, suggesting that the uptake of electric vehicles will continue to increase, even if at a slower pace.

Environmental groups say it could make it harder to require older coal plants to install sulfur dioxide and particulate controls.
In the final rule, EPA says Texas evaluated the required statutory ""four factors"" and that monitored visibility improvements and prior control programs helped drive the agency’s conclusion.
As detailed on the EPA’s Regional Haze pages, the program allows alternatives to source-specific Best Available Retrofit Technology controls, such as regional trading programs, as long as they achieve comparable results.
Nonprofits including the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association were involved in earlier regional haze litigation and are expected to mount new challenges, as per the Houston Chronicle.","On Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency approved Texas’ regional haze plans. This decision allows the state to avoid adding new pollution controls at specific sources. The move affects efforts to reduce haze in national parks like Big Bend and the Guadalupe Mountains. Environmental groups say it could make it harder to require older coal plants to install sulfur dioxide and particulate controls.

What the EPA approved

According to the Federal Register, the Environmental Protection Agency approved portions of Texas’ 2009 and 2021 regional haze State Implementation Plans, along with the state's 2014 five-year progress report, finding that together they satisfy applicable Clean Air Act requirements. The rule is set to take effect on January 5, 2026. The Federal Register entry points to a docket packed with monitoring data, modeling and emissions analyses the agency leaned on in its evaluation. In the final rule, EPA says Texas evaluated the required statutory ""four factors"" and that monitored visibility improvements and prior control programs helped drive the agency’s conclusion.

How the agency justified the move

The EPA argues that long-term emissions reductions and visibility gains in Texas mean the state’s existing plans already reflect the improvements the Regional Haze Rule is supposed to deliver, and that states have leeway to choose how they comply. As detailed on the EPA’s Regional Haze pages, the program allows alternatives to source-specific Best Available Retrofit Technology controls, such as regional trading programs, as long as they achieve comparable results. That policy framework, paired with the technical record in the docket, forms the backbone of the agency’s rationale.

Why activists and some scientists say it matters

Environmental groups describe the action as a rollback that leaves parks and downwind communities less protected than they could be. ""Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants,"" Sierra Club campaign manager Emma Pabst told the Houston Chronicle, blasting the state strategies as ""do-nothing"" plans that put public health at risk. Local scientists, including Rice University’s Daniel Cohan, have said the regional haze program is one of the few federal tools available to push the largest sources to install proven pollution controls, so how the rule is used matters far beyond postcard views.

Coal’s role and what it means for Texans

State energy data show coal still provides roughly 10% of Texas’ generation capacity, leaving coal units as a meaningful slice of the power mix even as wind and solar surge. The Texas Comptroller’s energy overview notes that coal’s share has fallen over the past decade but continues to matter in parts of the grid. Whether older coal plants face mandatory federal retrofits or only state-level measures will shape how quickly emissions that cloud vistas and affect lungs actually come down.

Legal history and what comes next

The final rule arrives after a long legal arc. The Fifth Circuit previously vacated portions of EPA’s 2016 disapprovals of Texas’ plans, and the agency notes in the Federal Register that any petitions for judicial review of the new rule must be filed by February 3, 2026. The federal docket’s monitoring and emissions analyses are poised to be central exhibits if challengers head back to court. Nonprofits including the Sierra Club and the National Parks Conservation Association were involved in earlier regional haze litigation and are expected to mount new challenges, as per the Houston Chronicle.

What to watch

In the near term, look for fresh court filings and a fine-tooth-comb review of the technical documents in the EPA docket that helped justify the rule. For Texans who care about clear park views and neighborhood air quality, the real-world outcome will hinge on whether judges send the agency back to the drawing board or the state’s own regulator, TCEQ, chooses to tighten its approach on its own.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/12/epa-lets-texas-coal-off-the-hook-as-park-views-pay-the-price.webp,N,,2025-12-07 14:01:07.932399

He spent two years working out of his garage without a paycheck, building partnerships with potential financiers, locating suitable projects and negotiating land purchases.

Prior to starting Tallbear Seville, LLC, based out of Manhattan Beach, Calif., Westerman’s solar projects were relatively small scale, piggybacking off of the aforementioned career in building interiors, mainly for tribal casinos. Explorations into solar projects for those casinos, and later friends on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians Reservation in California, led Westerman to begin pursuing bigger opportunities in the space.

By 2013, Westerman’s company landed a power purchasing agreement (PPA) with the San Diego Gas & Electric Co. The PPA sparked enough interest from financiers and partners to get the $52 million project — a 200-acre, 20-megawatt solar farm in Ocotillo Wells, Calif. — built by 2015.

One partner was project co-developer Regenerate Energy, whose founder and CEO Reyad Fazzani also served as Tallbear Energy’s president. Others included financing from partners like Duke Energy, whose subsidiary Deriva Energy now helps maintain the solar farm in question, and manufacturing through fabricator Solar First.

These days, Westerman runs the day-to-day operations, alongside an energy consulting firm called Red Power he started last year. “I think I might be the only guy that jumped from a few homes to 20 megawatts,” he said. “But can a tribe do the same thing? I think so.”

Westerman spoke with Tribal Business News to discuss the process he used to build the Tallbear Seville solar farm, hashing out a power purchasing agreement, and surviving energy funding austerity. This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.

How did you first get into the solar industry?

I had a company that did the interiors for casinos. We did a lot of work for a lot of major casinos, as well as some minority contracting with big entities like Disney, Universal Studios, Planet Hollywood. We were called the gingerbread guys — we would fabricate everything and then come out, put signage up, column wraps, things like that, and make everything look nice.

At one point a casino approached us about doing some solar work for them, and I thought well it made sense, because our electricians were already trained by their union to do things like that. It made me start looking at what opportunities were out there, and then a friend of mine on the Morongo Band of Mission Indians’ tribal council asked me to look into solar installations for some of their homes.

I started meeting people in the industry, in particular one company out of San Francisco that was doing renewable energy development called Stellar, and after talking to them for a while they eventually said, “Well, why don’t we hire you for some consulting?” That made me really start looking into opportunities in this space, and that’s when the PPA came up.

What pushed you toward that instead of continuing on casino construction?

Solar is one of the most solid long‑term investments you can make, because the panels are warranted for 30 years. Remember now, which technology is dependable for 30 years that you can invest in? There’s not a lot. Which entities have the longest, best credit and history of making money? It’s the utilities.

So once you have a customer that has a 100‑year history of paying their bills and paying for energy, and you have a contract with them, it works out.

How did you build the San Diego solar project? That’s $52 million in 2010 money — it would have been even more today.

Well, I did it like any other developer. You get some good partners. I made the president of my company a very well‑known, experienced energy professional who had been the vice president of BP Renewables internationally. We got the best engineers. We got the best legal.

What role did the power purchasing agreement play in attracting partners to the deal?

It’s an attractive deal where there can be money made and be paid back. That can bring in people who want to participate.

Of course, getting the PPA isn’t like the golden ticket. Once you get it, you’ve got to prove it. PPAs could be the worst thing that ever happened to you, because you agree to deliver energy. They don’t care how you do it. You’re saying, I’m going to deliver 20 megawatts daily, and you’re signing a contract for that.

What kind of partners got involved once the PPA was in place?

One was the largest infrastructure fund out of Japan. That was our first financing partner. So that was construction finance. We get it built, we get it in operation.

Then you’re looking at a long‑term partner. Our first one was a company out of Canada called Kruger Energy that wanted to own some renewable energy in the United States. Then there was a change in the IRS rules, because they’re an international company, so they had to sell.

We ended up with Duke Energy as our partner to deliver the energy and handle operations and maintenance. So I still am the manager of the day‑to‑day operation.

How did you handle connectivity to the grid?

We used the Sunrise Powerlink, which was a power line from San Diego out to East County, a good 80 miles, and that connected us to the grid out there in the desert, and even provided energy into Arizona. When the Sunrise Powerlink came along, there was a tremendous opportunity east of San Diego in the desert there to interconnect, sell energy back the other way, right into the city.

You’re a 51% owner in the deal, which is part of how it came together, since your business is minority owned, is that right?

That was part of it, yeah - we’re part of the Minority Business Development Supplier Council, and that played into our bid.

What kind of challenges did you deal with along the way?

I got grilled by the California Public Utilities Commission when I was accused of people saying I was just being used as a Native for minority certification. So I had to go and get grilled on what I knew about solar. I had to do a lot of that on my own because they wanted to be sure I was independent, that I really owned and operated my own business.

How did that go?

They told me at the end of it that I am, in fact, an expert in solar. I was completely justified in my contract. But I had to prove that — there’s a lot of things you have to prove as a business owner. A lot of it isn’t just handed to you.

What are your thoughts about building projects like this in the federal funding vacuum created by an administrative policy shift back toward fossil fuels?

Investment tax credits are still there, right? The one I used. Not to mention, I don’t want to give away everything, because I do make money as a consultant too. But there’s new market tax credits, there’s low‑income tax credits. There’s still plenty of tax credits that can be applied to solar that Native American tribes can access. You have to package that up.

You’ve talked a lot about partnerships, too.

I’ve always been lucky in my career, honestly, to meet the right people. I didn’t figure all this out by myself and tribes shouldn’t expect to either.

Everybody goes to tribes and says, “Well, you got to do it all on your own, and you got to learn everything and do it all on your own.” No, they didn’t do that with their other power. You didn’t see them running out making little coal‑fired plants and nuclear plants, did you?

Usually the developer, contractor brings that to the table. For anybody to tell tribes, “You can just go do this” — well, they couldn’t build a million-dollar casino on their own. They got the experts. I don’t see it any different than other development businesses.",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/TallBear_Serville.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 11:02:11.972992

One of the units at the Comanche coal-fired plant operated by Xcel Energy near Pueblo can stay open a year longer than planned to fill the gap while the site’s largest facility, the chronically troubled Comanche 3, remains out of commission.

The Colorado Public Utilities Commission agreed Wednesday to extend the life of Comanche 2, which was scheduled to close at the end of this year. Xcel Energy sought to keep the unit running after coal unit Comanche 3, the utility’s largest power generating source, malfunctioned in August.

Xcel has said Comanche 3 could be out of service until June.

While the PUC approved keeping the smaller unit running, members voted to require more frequent reporting by Xcel on the status of the plant and costs. The regulators warned that the company runs the risk of not being authorized to recover what it spends to repair Comanche 3 if alternatives would have been more cost-effective.

Commissioner Tom Plant said he was bothered by the assumption that “whatever it takes to get Unit 3 running is going to be a good strategy.” Plant and other members pointed out that Comanche 3 has experienced problems and numerous outages since opening near Pueblo in 2010.

The unit, originally forecast to run until 2070, is scheduled to close by the end of 2030. The closure is part of efforts by the state and utilities to cut greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.

Some of the parties weighing in on Xcel’s petition to keep Unit 2 open longer urged the PUC to protect the company’s customers from footing the bill to fix the long-ailing Unit 3. The Colorado Energy Office and the Colorado Utility Consumer Advocate office supported Xcel’s petition.

The PUC expressed frustration with not having more information about what it will cost to repair the unit. Members adopted a proposal by the conservation organization Western Resource Advocates to require Xcel to report its progress each month instead of the two reports the company proposed.

“How do you go into a project like this, a multimillion-dollar project, without even a ballpark estimate of what your costs are going to be and with the assumption that it’s just going to be approved and passed onto ratepayers? I just find that mind-boggling,” Plant said.

All three PUC members want Xcel Energy to identify potential costs before the money’s spent, but didn’t require that at this point. Commissioner Megan Gilman said the PUC’s approval of keeping the smaller unit open for the time being isn’t approval of whatever Xcel might spend to fix the larger unit. “I get that a lot of information may not be available just yet,” Gilman said.

But Gilman said the timing of the reports proposed by Xcel, including a June 1 application that could seek additional variances or approval of resources, is difficult. “We’re not even going to get a filing to assess the path forward until they supposedly already fixed it and spent all the money. That is a backward process of what analysis should be done.”

The PUC adopted another recommendation by Western Resource Advocates that would limit the total, combined power generation of the two units if Comanche 3 is repaired and starts operating in 2026.

“We appreciate the approval to extend Comanche 2 through Dec. 31, 2026, as it provides an essential, reliable resource that will be needed throughout 2026, even after Comanche 3 returns to service in the middle of next year,” Xcel spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said. She said Xcel will wait to see the commission’s written order before responding to the decision’s details. “Maybe now that the Commission has sent a strong message that Xcel risks having to bear the burden of fixing the plant instead of passing the buck to customers, it will find cleaner, cheaper and clearly more reliable alternatives,” Eric Frankowski, executive director of the Western Clean Energy Campaign, said in a statement.

A group that includes the Pueblo County commissioners and the city of Pueblo supports keeping the smaller coal unit open. The group said in a filing with the PUC that Xcel Energy is facing a capacity shortage.

A previous analysis by the PUC staff showed that other coal plants struggled to stay online during the summer. The report highlighted what Xcel called a “code orange” event, meaning there was a realistic possibility of not having enough power to meet the demand for electricity. The utility asked customers to conserve energy Aug. 7 to avoid managed, rotating blackouts.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has proposed replacing the Comanche coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

PHASING OUT COAL

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backward into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

QUESTIONING THE COAL ROLLBACK

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/00/3003b58c-6876-5141-9551-546d5c2e39dc/6932df2eadfc0.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-07 13:00:07.920728

Rather than reducing wildfire and protecting forests, they say the bill is a giveaway to the timber industry that will worsen wildfires and other threats American forests are facing.
“You can’t fix a problem with forests with the same methods that have caused the degradation to begin with.” Why now?
Giving the Feds more freedom to undertake intensive projects will reduce the amount of biomass available to burn and more readily allow for emergency management projects, they say.","A new bill moving through Congress promises a major overhaul in the way federal officials manage public lands in the United States. Lawmakers have framed the Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA), passed by the House of Representatives, as a necessary response to the spate of disastrous wildfires that have burned in the West over the last several years. The bipartisan bill would remove impediments to logging, allowing the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management vastly more latitude to remove what they say is the fuel that drives wildfires.

But critics contend that the bill’s purported solutions are a mirage. Instead of addressing the crisis, this bill would allow federal agencies to push through large management projects indiscriminately, while limiting avenues for public oversight. Though there is broad support for reducing wildfire destruction, some lawmakers and conservationists say FOFA’s effects on public lands would be disastrous. Rather than reducing wildfire and protecting forests, they say the bill is a giveaway to the timber industry that will worsen wildfires and other threats American forests are facing.

“Forests are broken because of the extent of logging that’s happened over the last five or six decades,” said Dominick DellaSala, a biodiversity and climate change scientist with the Conservation Biology Institute who is a critic of the bill. “You can’t fix a problem with forests with the same methods that have caused the degradation to begin with.”

Why now?

The enormity of fire disasters in recent years—including those in Maui, Los Angeles, and Texas—has been impossible to ignore. This is why the bill has garnered broad, bipartisan support, including in the Senate, where the bill passed out of committee but has yet to receive a floor vote. Its cosponsors are Democrats Alex Padilla of California and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, along with Republicans John Curtis of Utah and Tim Sheehy of Montana. FOFA offers provisions that supposedly would help land managers address the fire threat, seemingly oriented around the theory that more actively managing forests—through increased logging—can reduce the potential for large wildfires.

Specific provisions in FOFA allow for this in several ways. These include allowing certain projects to be exempted from the National Environmental Policy Act. Projects under 3,000 acres are typically able to get these exceptions, called “categorical exclusions,” if projects are claimed to pose little environmental risk. But the new law would enable exclusions for projects up to 10,000 acres, which would allow federal authorities to avoid currently required environmental analyses for far more management projects.

If FOFA becomes law, land managers would also be able to log and thin in designated fireshed management areas—fire-prone landscapes up to 250,000 acres—without current levels of environmental review. At the same time, it would give officials leeway to skip Endangered Species Act and National Historic Preservation Act review requirements.

For the public, the bill aims to limit input and reduce transparency by narrowing the timeframe that stakeholders have to challenge newly announced rules. The current allowance of time is six years, but under FOFA, the public would have 150 days, following the announcement of the decision, to mount a challenge.

Failed solutions

Many of the bill’s supporters, such as members of the Congressional Western Caucus, contend that cutting “red tape” is what will make FOFA effective. Giving the Feds more freedom to undertake intensive projects will reduce the amount of biomass available to burn and more readily allow for emergency management projects, they say.

But opponents say that the regulatory burden—already significantly weakened in recent years—is not the cause of worsening wildfires. Rather, they point to abundant data that long-standing patterns of active management are themselves worsening fire risk. This cohort includes DellaSala, who has authored numerous papers on wildfire and testified regularly in Congress on forest health.

He sees at least four components as essential to addressing the wildfire crisis: immediately cutting emissions (including from logging), which exacerbate climate change and make the scale of fires worse; protecting existing natural areas, which he describes as “our best natural climate solution”; focusing on preventing home ignitions by improving home hardening and defensible space in fire-prone areas; and by stopping road construction through wildlands. “Something like 90 percent of all fires nationwide have a human ignition factor built in,” he said. “We can’t stop lightning, but we can reduce the incidence of human-caused fires by having a better transportation management plan, which means closing and obliterating many roads.”

Timothy Ingalsbee, a former wildland firefighter and now wildland fire ecologist, is executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology. He also emphasizes the harms of road building—often falsely characterized as necessary for effective wildland firefighting—agreeing that FOFA on the whole is a dangerous bill.

He does think that, in isolation, some of FOFA’s provisions around wildland firefighting are important, but he worries about the impacts of the law’s overall approach on firefighter morale. “There is a legitimate need for proactive fire fuels management,” Ingalsbee said, pointing to prescribed burning, Indigenous cultural burning, and community fire preparation. Fire is inevitable and necessary in fire-prone landscapes, he said, and the century-plus-long practice of total fire suppression needs to change. “The exclusion of fire is now coming back to haunt us.”

“A treacherous bill”

Critics of the bill are especially alarmed at what they characterize as a power grab, done under the guise of a wildfire emergency, by which stripped-down and unaccountable agencies can undertake whatever sorts of projects they want.

“In the name of improving conditions in the forests and safety for communities, all of which this bill does not actually accomplish, the bill is going to end up taking out a whole lot of other laws and safeguards that have been in place for decades,” said Zack Porter, executive director of the Vermont-based wildland advocacy organization Standing Trees. “Ecological consequences aside, [FOFA] is a treacherous bill for maintaining the fragile democracy that we have.”

Porter is frustrated that the bill has taken on a bipartisan consensus, with Democrats—including those from eastern states, where wildfire has not traditionally been a major issue—signing on. He is especially incensed that his state’s junior senator, Peter Welch, voted yes in October on moving FOFA out of committee in the Senate, despite a July pledge to vote against the bill.

“Some of the same Democratic lawmakers who have rightly pointed out how the Trump administration is using manufactured emergencies to gain control—how are they not seeing through the ways that this bill does the exact same thing under the guise of the wildfire crisis?” Porter asked.

For Porter, DellaSala, and Ingalsbee, the issue is ultimately bigger than FOFA. It’s the confluence of a range of Trump administration policies that are handing even more control of public lands to industry, limiting public insight, and collectively worsening ecological health through a dramatic intensification of long-standing destructive policies. They point to the Roadless Rule rescission, along with Trump’s Executive Order 14225, titled Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production, as a sort of perfect storm of environmental harm that may lead to vastly more logging in some of the nation’s oldest and wildest forests—all more or less undertaken under the guise of so-called responsible land management.

DellaSala said he sees the same arguments playing out as when he first testified in Congress in the early 1990s—even as, 30 years later, so many protections have already been rolled back.

“It’s been an accumulation of eroding our nation’s protections and forest regulations to the point where, if FOFA gets through, it’s going to be a house-of-cards thing for forests, where the public has very little say in outcomes,” he said. “You’re going to get very simple environmental assessments that look to bypass regulations and push through these destructive projects that are only going to make the problem worse in the long run.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-07 11:02:56.055152

This rapid expansion underscores the success of India’s solar manufacturing journey, driven by strong collaboration between industry stakeholders, State Governments, and the Central Government.","New Delhi : The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) has called for a calibrated and well-informed financing approach across the solar manufacturing ecosystem to ensure sustainable and balanced growth of the renewable energy sector. The Ministry also reaffirmed that no advisory has been issued to financial institutions to pause or halt fresh lending to renewable energy (RE) projects.

India continues to strengthen its clean energy footprint, having already achieved 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources—a milestone reached five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement. As of 31 October 2025, the country’s installed non-fossil capacity stands at 259 GW, with 31.2 GW added in the current financial year alone.

In response to reports claiming that MNRE had urged lenders to stop financing RE projects due to concerns over overcapacity, the Ministry issued a clear clarification. MNRE confirmed that no such advisory has been issued to banks or financial institutions regarding lending restrictions on renewable energy power projects or equipment manufacturing facilities.

However, MNRE has shared updated data with the Department of Financial Services and key NBFCs—including PFC, REC, and IREDA—regarding the current domestic manufacturing capacities across the solar PV value chain. This includes solar modules, cells, ingots-wafers, polysilicon, and ancillary components such as solar glass and aluminium frames. The objective is to help institutions make strategic, informed investment decisions and encourage them to diversify lending across upstream and ancillary segments, rather than concentrating mainly on module manufacturing.

The Government of India remains committed to building a self-reliant, globally competitive solar manufacturing ecosystem. Backed by initiatives such as the PLI Scheme for High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules, India’s manufacturing capacity has witnessed remarkable growth—from 2.3 GW in 2014 to nearly 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) today.

This rapid expansion underscores the success of India’s solar manufacturing journey, driven by strong collaboration between industry stakeholders, State Governments, and the Central Government. It also reaffirms India’s pledge to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, significantly contributing to global decarbonisation efforts.",https://impressivetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/THE-IMPRESSIVE-TIMES-48.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 15:59:55.442272

Because action on climate is action on biodiversity and land; because action on land is action on climate; because action on chemicals, pollution, and waste is action on nature and on climate.","As geopolitical challenges and tensions escalate globally, one thing is clear: Fragmented politics will not fix a fractured planet.

This is why the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA)—the world’s highest decision-making body on the environment—is so critical to address our shared and emerging environmental threats.

The seventh session of the assembly, taking place at the headquarters of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi, Kenya this month, will bring together ministers, intergovernmental organizations, multilateral environmental agreements, the broader UN system, civil society groups, scientists, activists, and the private sector to shape global environmental policy.

Recent UNEP data show emissions continue to rise as the impacts of global environment and climate challenges are accelerating and growing ever more extreme. We see it in record heatwaves; disappearing ecosystems; and toxins in our air, water, and soil. These are global threats that demand global solutions.

To deliver at the speed and scale required, the United Nations system must act together—with the full family of Multilateral Environmental Agreements coming together to support countries.

Even in turbulent times, environmental multilateralism continues to deliver. Since countries met at UNEA last year, this multilateralism has delivered important progress.

Governments agreed to establish the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Panel on Chemicals, Waste, and Pollution—finally completing the “trifecta” of science bodies alongside the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The BBNJ Agreement on the sustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction came into force, a major win for the governance of our oceans.

Importantly, during such a challenging political climate, the Paris Agreement is showing that it is working. However, it is clear we need to move much faster with greater determination. But change is afoot: The global shift to low-emission and climate-resilient development is irreversible. Renewable energy is outcompeting fossil fuels pricewise. Climate smart investments are driving tomorrow’s vibrant economies and societies.

While we must recognize that many were hoping COP30 would include explicit reference to phasing out fossil fuels in the decision text, this was not to be. However, the COP president committed to creating two road maps during his one-year tenure, one to halt and reverse deforestation and another to transition away from fossil fuels—a move that was backed by more than 80 countries during the talks.

These are not small steps—nor are they enough to address the threats we face in full. But they do reinforce that multilateralism can still bring science and policy together to address our global challenges.

Of course, progress is not always straight forward. Since UNEA’s historic resolution in 2022 on a legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, negotiations have continued to advance. While we do not yet have a full treaty text agreed, the latest talks in Geneva earlier this year made hard fought progress and countries remain at the table, sustaining momentum toward an agreement that ends plastic pollution once and for all.

This year, under the theme “Advancing sustainable solutions for a resilient planet,” UNEA will build on these wins to set the stage for even greater progress.

The seventh edition of UNEP’s flagship report, the Global Environmental Outlook, will be key to informing how we deliver this future. Released during UNEA, the report will help move us beyond diagnoses of our common challenges to identifying real solutions across five interconnected areas: economics and finance; circularity and waste; environment; energy; and food systems. Drawing on contributions from hundreds of experts worldwide, the Outlook will help countries prioritize the most effective solutions to deliver our global goals.

To deliver at the speed and scale required, the United Nations system must act together—with the full family of Multilateral Environmental Agreements coming together to support countries. UNEP is proud to host 17 conventions and panels that span the environmental spectrum, from toxic chemicals to protection of the ozone layer. Bringing this family of agreements closer together offers opportunities to better align priorities.

This is why UNEA will put a central focus on how these agreements can better work together for accelerated, more targeted support to countries as they implement commitments. Because action on climate is action on biodiversity and land; because action on land is action on climate; because action on chemicals, pollution, and waste is action on nature and on climate.

Inaction now carries a clearer cost than ever. At UNEA-7 in Nairobi—the environmental capital of the world—the “Nairobi Spirit” can convert shared challenges into shared action and, ultimately, shared prosperity on a safe, resilient planet that benefits all.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62288514&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C413%2C0%2C414,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:09.879149

The total market cap of bitcoin miners has collapsed from over $90 billion in mid-October to around $55 billion today, according to Bitcoin Mining Stock (4).","Bitcoin mining — a noisy energy hog

In 2021, China cracked down on cryptocurrencies and banned Bitcoin mining and trading. Since then, the U.S. has taken the title of the world’s biggest Bitcoin mining hub, accounting for about 75% of reported activity, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (2).

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve decides how much money should be minted each year. But cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are decentralized and no specific body or organization controls them.

So how do new bitcoins enter the economy? They’re mined.

If you’re picturing a worker with a pickaxe, replace the worker with a computer and the pickaxe with computing power.

Bitcoin mining plants operate tens of thousands of computers day and night to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to add a transaction “block” to the public bitcoin ledger, which is known as the blockchain. As a reward, they are granted newly minted bitcoins.

The higher the price of Bitcoin, the more incentive to mine, and the price is up over 400% in the last five years.

The total Bitcoin supply is capped at 21 million, and there are currently about 19.9 million in circulation today. As the price rose, mining became more profitable, which led to more miners competing to solve blocks and an increase in overall electricity use.

From mid-2022 to mid-2023, the 34 largest mines in the U.S. consumed 32.3 terawatt-hours of electricity, 33% more than Los Angeles and enough for three to six million homes, according to one study published in Nature Communications (3). Worse still, 85% of this power came from fossil fuels.

Most of the mines were in Texas, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania and North Dakota. Locals have complained about a constant din from the mining rigs, and lawmakers are concerned about how they’re affecting the utility bills and air quality of residents.

Trump’s strategy

Eric Trump has traveled the world talking about American Bitcoin, which he is a stakeholder in along with his older brother, Donald Trump Jr.. On stage at the Consensus conference in Toronto earlier this year, he emphasized that the Trump administration’s pro-fossil-fuel energy policies were going to help crypto mining.

“We believe we have the cheapest energy anywhere in the country, so much of it coming out of West Texas. We have a president of the United States who actually believes in having a proper energy policy … where he wants the cheapest energy of anywhere in the world because that’s going to fuel all the innovation that we’re talking about right now,” he said. “Go try and mine Bitcoin in France. Go try and mine Bitcoin in Scotland … you’re just never going to do it. The energy price is too high.”

Trump has focused on rolling back clean energy regulations to bring energy prices down. He has also attacked the clean energy industry, shutting down projects and claiming it’s the reason for high electricity prices, even though the data undermines that argument.

O’Leary’s ESG bet

O’Leary on the other hand says low-cost sustainable energy, which Bitzero champions, is the future of Bitcoin mining.

Founded in 2021, the Vancouver-based company has four data centers for mining in three countries — Norway, Finland and the U.S. — and, the CEO told Moneywise, they use “100% renewable energy.”

The company said the currently available energy mix at its remote 184-acre North Dakota site includes wind, natural gas and grid sources. Natural gas is considered much cleaner than other fossil fuels like coal, but it isn’t strictly a renewable source unless it’s produced from organic waste. Bitzero hopes to use only renewable energy when the site becomes operational.

This has been the direction the industry has been moving in. A global survey by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance showed that miners’ electricity mix is predominantly sustainable (52.4%), with renewables accounting for 42.6% and nuclear accounting for 9.8%. Natural gas has also replaced coal as the single largest energy source used in Bitcoin mining.

How you can invest

There are many bitcoin mining firms that are publicly-listed in the U.S., like Riot Blockchain (RIOT), IREN (IREN), Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Cipher Mining (CIFR), CleanSpark (CLSK), Bitdeer (BTDR) and TeraWulf (WULF).

When deciding whether or not to invest, it’s important to consider companies’ fundamentals, like costs per coin mined. O’Leary says he looks at power contracts: “What's your power coming in at? It's over 8 cents kWh? No thanks.”

You may also choose for ideological or strategic reasons to look at how they source their energy and if that aligns with your values and expectations of how policies are going to look in the future. For example, IREN claims to use 100% renewable energy at its data centers. Despite its name, CleanSpark runs on “low-carbon power” and not 100% renewable energy.

These companies do remain very vulnerable to the price of bitcoin plummetting. The total market cap of bitcoin miners has collapsed from over $90 billion in mid-October to around $55 billion today, according to Bitcoin Mining Stock (4).

However, they may have the opportunity of repurposing their computing capacity for AI and other uses. JPMorgan analysts recently published a note highlighting the flurry of deals as crypto miners convert to high-performance computing (HPC) power providers.

The investment bank lifted its stock ratings on Cipher Mining and CleanSpark to ""overweight,"" citing the former's recent 410 MW of HPC contracts and the latter's 200 MW of critical-IT potential at its newly acquired 285-MW Texas site, according to The Block (5).

In the Sackett case, the court majority ruled that the waters of the U.S. shouldn’t include wetlands unless they have a direct “continuous surface connection” to another body of water.
While Alsentzer wasn’t happy with the Sackett decision, he argues the new proposed rules curtail federal clean water protections even more.
“Federal law has never said a family farmer can't do what they need to do to support ag on their land,” he said.
“Montana and our ranching community works very hard, is very much a steward of the environment,” she said.","HELENA — The Trump administration is proposing changes to the definition of what bodies of water are considered “the waters of the United States.” While it may seem like an obscure or even irrelevant question, Montana agricultural organizations say it’s not just academic for farmers and ranchers.

The Clean Water Act gives the federal government the authority to address pollution in “waters of the United States.” That means a wide variety of land use activities may require a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency if it’s determined they would affect those waters.

(Watch the video to hear more on the possible impacts of a change to WOTUS.)

Montana Ag: What Waters of the U.S. changes could mean for agriculture

Over the last decade, different federal administrations have tried to establish different standards for when a body of water qualifies as a water of the U.S.

“WOTUS really did put ranchers and agricultural producers in a very difficult position,” said Raylee Honeycutt, executive vice president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association. “It was kind of like a pingpong game: We kept seeing rules changing and going back and forth, expansion, reduction.”

The Stockgrowers and other agricultural groups celebrated in 2023, when the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Sackett v. EPA narrowed the definition of “waters of the U.S.” The Trump administration says its proposed new rules are intended to implement the Sackett decision.

Honeycutt says she’s hopeful these rule changes will bring more stability for agriculture.

“Really what Montana Stockgrowers was asking for – as well as the larger livestock community – was some certainty and clarity in the rules, so that people could continue to plan and make business decisions based off those rules,” she said.

She says one of the major concerns for farmers and ranchers was whether federal regulations extended to “ephemeral” bodies of water – those that don’t have water for the entire year.

“At one point in time, we were talking about puddles of water that had standing water on it being navigable and being under the authority of the EPA,” she said. “So what we're really seeing is some commonsense approach to, when there's water standing because it's rained a lot, that isn't necessarily a body of water that should be regulated by the EPA.”

The EPA says the new definitions would focus enforcement on “relatively permanent” bodies of water. In the Sackett case, the court majority ruled that the waters of the U.S. shouldn’t include wetlands unless they have a direct “continuous surface connection” to another body of water. The new rule would define that by saying a wetland must border a body of water under federal jurisdiction and have surface water at least during a “wet season.”

The agency also says it’s planning to make changes specifically with agricultural producers in mind, including expanding exclusions to limit the number of ditches that would fall under federal jurisdiction and reinstating a specific exemption for groundwater.

Not everyone is happy with what the administration is proposing.

“This narrow interpretation isn't based on science; it's based on essentially a wish list of, ‘How can we do as much as we want everywhere?’” said Guy Alsentzer, executive director of the environmental group Upper Missouri Waterkeeper.

While Alsentzer wasn’t happy with the Sackett decision, he argues the new proposed rules curtail federal clean water protections even more.

“If you care about clean and healthy water, you can't just care about the river – you’ve got to care about all its arteries, which is to say its headwaters and its wetlands,” he said. “This is an unscientific rule.”

He argues development and other actions taken on lands that only have water for part of the year can still have significant downstream impacts.

Alsentzer believes the concerns about how a stricter WOTUS rule would affect farms and ranches are overstated.

“Federal law has never said a family farmer can't do what they need to do to support ag on their land,” he said. “What federal law has said is, the big industrial-scale operators, you've got to take responsibility for your pollution.”

Honeycutt said, regardless of these changes, there are still going to be federal environmental protections in place, as well as protections at the state level.

“Montana and our ranching community works very hard, is very much a steward of the environment,” she said. “We want the world and the earth to be thriving. We are just one component in making that a success.”

Alsentzer said Montana does have state protections, but he questioned whether the state would have sufficient funding to fill the gap if federal oversight is cut back.

The EPA will be accepting public comment on the changes to the WOTUS rule through Jan. 5, 2026. Both Honeycutt and Alsentzer said their groups are encouraging their allies to submit input.

“We're working with our members as well as our national partners to make sure that ranching and the agricultural community is very represented,” said Honeycutt.

“We need to, at minimum, let them know that we care, we're watching and we're upset with the decisions they make,” Alsentzer said. “And then to the extent that they still make a bad decision, then it's incumbent on us to stand up for our rights.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/73f4432/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4240x2226+0+303/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Ff2%2F7a%2Fcb16e1904439b872ce7641d1d02e%2Fdsc03293.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:19.730899

Expensive natural gas prices hit households with a double whammy Because natural gas is the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, when the fuel gets more expensive, it forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills.
“Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” according to EIA.","When fracking spread across our country in the early 2000s, it ushered in an era of cheap gas and fundamentally changed the American energy landscape. Gas toppled coal to become the dominant source of electricity generation in the country–– and the United States became the world’s largest natural gas producer.

However, we’ve gotten so used to the idea of cheap natural gas that we’re failing to reassess whether that narrative is still true. The data is increasingly telling us it isn’t – we’re now the world’s largest natural gas exporter and natural gas power plants are far more expensive to build – both of which force Americans to pay more for power. That means we risk locking ourselves into expensive decisions with decades-long consequences.

The fracking revolution began nearly 20 years ago—today’s reality is different. If government officials and utility executives still think we’re in the era of cheap natural gas, their decisions will be driven by outdated knowledge, and they won’t be able to fight rising power prices if they invest in the wrong technology.

Natural gas prices face upward pressure on two fronts

Soaring data center electricity demand has sent utilities scrambling to add new sources of electricity to the grid. In places like Virginia, ground-zero for the data center surge and home to roughly 20% of the world’s data centers, the gas industry is shouting from the rooftops that gas is needed to meet this new demand while keeping costs low.

That premise is wrong on multiple levels.

First, it’s essentially impossible to build a new gas-fired power plant by the end of this decade. Gas turbine manufacturers like GE Vernova, Siemens Energy, and Mitsubishi scaled back their production capabilities years ago when new turbine orders were few and far between. As a result, power producers trying to source new turbines face wait times of five to seven years.

Second, much of the workforce that built the surge of gas infrastructure in the 2000s and 2010s has either retired or moved on to other industries, creating a deep workforce shortage. If utilities want to build a new gas plant, it’ll be years before they can get the equipment, and even then, it’s hard to find workers to build it—but we need the power now, not in 2030. That means new gas-fired power plants will be dramatically more expensive this time around.

NextEra CEO John Ketchum says building a new gas-fired power plant today would cost three times as much as the last facility the utility built, back in 2022.

And that’s only half of the equation—once the facility is built, you need fuel to run it. Turns out, that’s drastically more expensive now too.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts natural gas prices will rise 14% in 2026, following a 59% year-over-year increase from 2024 to 2025. EIA attributes rising prices to increased demand stemming from rising liquified natural gas (LNG) exports and flat production capabilities.

“Gas is only going to get more expensive going forward,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s energy program. “You can build more pipelines in Virginia or anywhere else, but that extra natural gas is still going to be competing with folks in Berlin and Beijing for access to the U.S. gas.”

“LNG is tying us more to global markets that pay more than we do for gas,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas, Austin. “That has to put more upward pressure on gas.”

Like any other commodity that’s sold across the world, gas companies seek the highest-priced markets. These companies say American natural gas increases our domestic energy security, but they don’t care about home heating bills, they just want to make the highest possible profit – even if that means selling our gas to countries like China.

And yet, Energy Secretary Chris Wright wants to double LNG exports within five years, and then double them again. LNG exports already increased 25% between 2024 and 2025.

Expensive natural gas prices hit households with a double whammy

Because natural gas is the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, when the fuel gets more expensive, it forces consumers to pay higher electricity bills. In fact, every region of the country has seen electricity prices increase over the last three years.

Wholesale electricity prices spiked 23% in 2025, and EIA predicts they’ll climb another 8.6% in 2026. “Natural gas prices tend to be the biggest determinant of power prices,” according to EIA.

But it’s not just electricity bills that are causing sticker shock—the majority of homes in the U.S. use natural gas to heat them, so as gas prices rise, so too will home heating bills. Indeed, EIA is forecasting that home heating costs will rise next year. Federal Reserve data shows retail gas utility service has risen 11% over the past year, near an all-time high. That means more expensive home heating bills for families this winter, potentially fueling the 8% increase in home heating costs expected this year.

Americans are already struggling to pay their utility bills—1 in 20 households has a utility debt high enough to be sent to a collection agency, and average monthly energy bills have increased 35% since 2022, according to a recent report.

Fortunately, rapidly growing wind, solar, and storage can help keep costs in check and can be deployed quickly to meet growing electricity demand. Wind and solar are the cheapest sources of new electricity, and they’ve gotten exponentially cheaper over the past decade-- 91% of new renewable power projects commissioned last year were more affordable than new fossil fuels, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

And renewables and battery storage are essentially the only new sources of electricity being added to the U.S. grid right now, comprising over 90% of new capacity in 2025 and 2024. The truth is that states with the highest levels of wind and solar generation like Iowa, Oklahoma, and New Mexico have had the lowest utility bill rate increases in America, Energy Innovation research finds.

If policymakers rely on natural gas as a solution for the energy affordability crisis, they will fail to protect American families and businesses from higher energy prices.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6932f71620d81e28e50d703d/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-07 09:00:30.220540

Economic and Environmental Implications

Beyond its economic benefits, the Gorgon Stage 3 project carries significant environmental considerations. Chevron’s proposal was accepted by the offshore environmental regulator in November, following a public comment period. This approval indicates that the project meets the necessary environmental standards and regulations, a critical aspect in today’s energy sector.

The development is not only poised to enhance LNG exports but also to secure long-term gas supplies for local consumption. Western Australia’s 15% gas reservation policy ensures that a portion of the gas produced is allocated for domestic use, supporting local energy needs. This policy is crucial for balancing export opportunities with domestic energy security, a growing concern in many regions worldwide.

What's happening?

As ABC News reported, voters in many states have been expressing their frustration after utility rate hikes. The issue has been especially on voters' minds in key battleground states as Democrats and Republicans debate over affordable electricity.

A survey found that 36% of American adults find their electricity bills to be a major source of stress. As an estimated 80 million Americans are struggling to pay their utility bills, Charles Hua from the consumer advocacy organization PowerLines said: ""It's a life or death and 'eat or heat' type decision that people have to make.""

Why are rising energy bills significant?

Increasingly expensive electricity bills are straining Americans' budgets and forcing them to make difficult decisions that affect their safety and comfort. The high cost of electricity is affecting people's health, and experts anticipate these costs will continue to rise as AI data centers expand.

The issue is also impacting politics, as voters demand relief amid unaffordable price hikes. Politicians must rise to the challenge of addressing their constituents' concerns and work to lower energy costs to affordable levels.

What's being done about high energy costs?

Some companies, such as Georgia Power, have proposed spending billions of dollars to expand their power-generating capacity to meet data center demand. There are discussions underway among lawmakers about whether data centers will have to pay their fair share of the power they use or if taxpayers will bear those costs.

He leads the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu appointed him in 2023 to steer a city famous for ambition and equally famous for smoke. His mandate is simple in writing and complex in practice: protect public health through stronger environmental governance.

His signature has been evidence. Real-time air quality monitors now sit in neighbourhoods across the city. They feed data into dashboards that guide policy. These tools allow his team to move from hunches to measurable trends. Pollution becomes something they can track, map, and confront.

Enforcement gives the science its teeth. Hotels, bakeries, factories, and prayer houses have been sealed for crossing environmental lines. His critics say the actions feel dramatic. Supporters see a consistent message: rules exist for a reason. The visibility of these shutdowns has pulled public attention toward issues once ignored.

Ajayi’s range extends beyond the streets of Lagos. He appears at regional and global forums where climate resilience and the blue economy dominate the agenda. His advocacy time and again circles back to a single idea: research achieves little until it shapes the lives of ordinary people. He argues that environmental justice requires translation, not abstraction.

His career bridges academia, public health, and administration. That combination explains his push for data-driven systems. It also explains projects like the Lagos Carbon Market, which sits at the intersection of climate finance and state-level governance. The idea is bold: create incentives for cleaner practices within Africa’s most commercially active city.

CHINESE CLEANTECH INVESTMENT INTO AUSTRALIA HAS COLLAPSED, PUTTING AT RISK THE COUNTRY’S NET ZERO & INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION GOALS

A new report released today by independent think tank Climate Energy Finance (CEF), Rising Tide: China’s Outbound Cleantech Capital Surge Drives Global Collaboration Toward Net Zero, finds that Chinese firms have committed more than US$180bn of outbound foreign direct investment (OFDI) in cleantech since the start of 2023 – up 80% since CEF’s Green Capital Tsunami report a year ago.

China’s investment into cleantech manufacturing and clean energy infrastructure spanned batteries, battery materials, solar PV, wind, EVs, hydro-electricity and green hydrogen industrial precincts in countries as diverse as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Türkiye, Brazil, Hungary, Spain, France, Portugal, Azerbaijan, Zambia, Egypt, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

The sheer scale and depth of Chinese cleantech firms’ green energy statecraft push over the last three years is bringing about a profound shift in the global energy, economic and geopolitical landscape, extending China’s leadership and influence as the US withdraws from the net zero playing field since the re-election of President Trump in 2024, and initiates a trade war.

For China and its partners, investment and technology cooperation on green manufacturing and clean energy infrastructure is a win-win-win. It aligns with delivery of host countries’ net zero targets and green industrialisation priorities, with a focus on building domestic capabilities through learning and technology transfer, as China deploys its cleantech capital and overwhelming global decarbonisation leadership as a diplomatic instrument of its green energy statecraft. And a win in relation to climate.

The picture is different in Australia. Caution continues to define the federal government’s approach to Australia's #1 trade partner, maintaining a chilling effect on investment engagement. Chinese OFDI into Australia has collapsed by 85% since 2018, now making up only 1.5% of the total OFDI from all countries, a decline from the already exceptionally weak 1.87% in 2024. 2024 recorded the third lowest value and number of transactions since 2006 at just US$882m, a fraction of the peak of US$16bn in 2008.

Foreign capital, technology and knowhow are key to achievement of Australia’s decarbonisation goals. Around 70% of investment in Australian clean energy projects comes from overseas. The decline in engagement with China’s capital and expertise puts at risk Australia’s net zero and green re-industrialisation ambitions set out in its Future Made in Australia and Net Zero Plans. The report recommends reforms to enable carefully-managed strategic partnership with the world’s cleantech leader to support Australia’s energy transition, competitiveness and long-term prosperity.

Report lead author Caroline Wang, CEF’s China Analyst said:

“As this report shows, a new geoeconomic order is emerging as the primary engine of the energy transition, China, commits multibillions in foreign cleantech capital investment in renewables and green manufacturing projects. This is accelerating economic and technological integration between emerging economies and China across renewables and green industrial ecosystems. South-South cooperation is increasingly diversified and de-risked amid global trade and geopolitical uncertainties, through a mix of cross-border, public-private finance and project partnerships. At the same time, formalised knowledge sharing and capacity building initiatives such as training and R&D partnerships are rising.

In 2025, US tariffs, unilateralism and regression on renewables have further accelerated the shift in the centre of gravity of global commerce towards China and emerging economies, as countries seek to diversify their economic and political partnerships away from an unstable US and achieve their sustainable development goals.

Australia stands at a critical juncture. Chinese investment in Australia remains at historic lows. A multipolar world – no longer centred on the US, Australia’s traditional security ally – necessitates an urgent overhaul of its economic, foreign investment, and foreign policy settings. This means strategically working with China, or being left behind in the new world order. Australia has an opportunity to selectively partner with global Chinese cleantech firms, which bring not only capital, but world-class technology and expertise in areas of Australia’s national priority, particularly the Net Zero plan and Future Made in Australia plans, and to learn from some of the partnerships referenced in this report.

Not engaging with China’s capital and expertise will delay Australia’s net zero transition, putting at risk its decarbonisation goals and future prosperity in a net-zero global economy.”

Tim Buckley, CEF Director and former MD of global investment bank Citigroup said:

“China leads the world in almost all cleantech research, development and deployment. China leads the world in all cleantech manufacturing supply chains. China leads the world in cleantech domestic deployments and cleantech exports. Now, consistent with the Paris Agreement for economically developed countries to help the Global South deploy zero-emissions domestic energy solutions to overcome their addiction to imported fossil fuels, China leads the world in cleantech OFDI.

It is brilliant to record over US$180bn of OFDI from China since the start of 2023, up from US$100bn just one year earlier, as China develops partnerships and manufacturing capacities around the world to leverage their supply chains, technology leadership, capital and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) capacities to accelerate cleantech deployments globally.”

Dr Muyi Yang, Senior Energy Analyst at global think tank Ember, said:

“China’s cleantech makers are now looking much more to overseas markets, as demand at home stabilises and the global energy transition speeds up. And that’s where the dilemma kicks in. Almost everyone agrees you can’t hit climate goals without working with China. But once cooperation moves to actually making clean products together, worries about over-reliance and ‘de-risking’ suddenly grow louder. The real challenge isn’t to cut China out, it’s to build more diversified, resilient supply chains that still tap into China’s know-how while helping other countries grow their own clean industries. If they don’t, by the time their local industries finally get going, Chinese companies may have already pulled even further ahead.”

Also see commentary from David Olsson AM, National President of the Australia China Business Council in the Foreword:

“Australia has an opportunity to align economic ambition with geopolitical reality. Preserving our security relationship with the United States should not preclude deeper collaboration with China in areas of shared economic and climate interest. A more nuanced and strategic approach to green energy statecraft – one that attracts investment while safeguarding national security – is essential to building economic resilience, securing our sovereign capabilities, and ensuring our competitiveness in a decarbonising world.”

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy clarified it has not halted lending to renewable energy projects, despite concerns of oversupply in the solar PV module industry. The ministry aims for informed capital deployment, encouraging financing for upstream manufacturing stages rather than just modules. This comes as India nears its non-fossil fuel capacity target.

The Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) on Sunday dismissed reports suggesting that it has asked financial institutions to pause fresh lending to renewable energy projects.

The clarification comes amid concerns of oversupply in India’s solar photovoltaic (PV) module industry and follows earlier communication urging lenders to take a cautious view on financing new, standalone module manufacturing capacity.

India has reached 50% of its installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of its Paris Agreement target. As of 31 October 2025, non-fossil capacity stands at about 259 GW, including 31.2 GW added so far in FY26.

The ministry said that there has been “no advisory to Financial Institutions for stopping lending to either renewable energy power projects or to renewable energy equipment manufacturing facilities.”

It further said that the objective is not to halt financing but to ensure informed capital deployment across the solar manufacturing ecosystem.

Live Events

The MNRE confirmed circulating the status of domestic manufacturing capacities to the Department of Financial Services and institutions such as PFC, REC and IREDA. According to the ministry, this information has been shared so that institutions “adopt a calibrated and well-informed approach while evaluating proposals for financing any manufacturing facility in solar PV manufacturing sector and explore and expand their solar PV manufacturing portfolio to upstream stages like solar cells, ingots-wafers and polysilicon as well as solar module ancillaries like solar glass and aluminium frames, etc. as well, rather than being limited to financing solar PV module manufacturing facilities alone.”

The clarification follows media reports stating that rapid expansion of standalone module units, combined with weakening export demand, could push the domestic market into oversupply.

Over the last three years, several Indian companies scaled up module capacity to target the U.S. market. However, higher U.S. tariffs and increased scrutiny of Indian shipments involving China-origin components have curbed exports, contributing to excess capacity in India.

Industry projections indicate module manufacturing capacity could rise to nearly 200 GW in the next few years, while solar cell capacity could grow to 100 GW—well above India’s near-term installation pace. This comes at a time when new solar project execution has slowed due to muted demand.

“The Government of India is committed to make India self-reliant in solar PV manufacturing and establish the country as a major player in the global value chain,” the ministry said.

It noted that solar module manufacturing capacity has expanded from 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers today—reflecting the cumulative efforts of industry, state governments and central initiatives.

The ministry added that it remains committed to further strengthening the solar manufacturing ecosystem through continued policy support, infrastructure development, and innovation,” and will continue working with stakeholders to ensure the sector remains competitive and future-ready.

The deadline has helped drive a big spike in business for solar installers as buyers rush to qualify for the 30% tax credit before it disappears. But California installers said lengthy utility permitting times could imperil customers’ tax credits if their systems aren’t in place by Dec. 31.

“Clients are concerned about potentially missing the tax credit deadline,” Anthony Del Bene, a manager at Berkeley solar installer A1 Sun, said in an email. “We explained that we would do everything possible to meet this timeframe [but] given the delays we’re seeing, I can’t say I feel completely at ease.”

US homeowners already pay more for solar and wait longer for installation than Australians and Europeans due to a byzantine permitting system, which varies from city to city and utility to utility. Now, with the sun setting on the federal tax credit, delays that prevent solar and battery installations until after Dec. 31 could cost homeowners $10,000 more for a typical project.

Emily Walker, director of insights at Boston-based solar marketplace EnergySage, said permitting has been a barrier in the US long before the current solar stampede. “Installers are working around the clock to meet the rush, but most have stopped promising year-end completion due to limited bandwidth and increasingly long and inconsistent permitting timelines,” she said in an email.

A US Internal Revenue Service spokesperson said that to qualify for the tax credit, homeowners need to complete installation of solar and battery systems by Dec. 31. For those installing both, a finished system often must include the attachment of a device called a meter socket adapter to their utility meter to connect solar and battery components without expensive electrical upgrades.

That creates a particular bottleneck in California, the nation’s largest solar market. Nearly 60% of new residential solar installations in the state include batteries compared to 40% nationally, according to the US Energy Information Administration, and utilities typically install the meter socket adapters.

Solar executives said it can then take up to a month or more for utilities to connect an installed system to the power grid, but that’s no longer a requirement to receive the tax credit.

Kevin Luo, policy and market development manager at industry group California Solar & Storage Association, said the race to go solar before the tax credits expire has only exacerbated longstanding permitting delays at two of the state’s big investor-owned utilities, PG&E Corp. and Southern California Edison.

“They had not prepared sufficiently for that even though they knew it was coming,” he said.

Lengthy municipal permitting times are also making it a gamble for homeowners trying to qualify for federal tax credits. “Many jurisdictions take weeks and sometimes months to approve permits for solar and battery systems, and that has caused significant delays in getting systems installed before the end of the year,” said Jake Hassid, managing partner at Northern California installer Simply Solar.

Bill Russell, a manager at solar installer NRG Clean Power in the Los Angeles area, said it’s taking Southern California Edison six to 10 weeks — four times longer than other utilities — to install meter socket adapters, putting customers’ ability to qualify for the 30% tax credit “in serious jeopardy.”

Southern California Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford said the utility has experienced “significant delays” in installing the devices between September and November due to a jump in applications from homeowners as the tax credit deadline approached. The utility is working to “speed up the process, enabling customers to receive their tax credits,” he said.

PG&E spokesperson Mike Gazda said the time to process meter socket adapter applications and install the devices was nine days in October and November, but several installers said they’re experiencing weeks or a month-long delay.

Barry Cinnamon, chief executive officer of Bay Area installer Cinnamon Energy Systems, said he launched a marketing campaign urging potential customers to “hurry up” after the enactment of the Trump administration’s tax bill in July scuttled tax credits and rebates for renewable energy, heat pumps and electric vehicles. That resulted in record sales, and Cinnamon hired more installers to handle the demand.

To avoid waiting for the utility to install meter socket adapters, he switched to a more expensive gadget called a gateway, which performs the same function but can be deployed by the installer. Otherwise, “we're not going to be able to complete the installation in time now because we will have that delay from the utility,” said Cinnamon.

China is broadcasting to the world that long-term industrial success lies in mastering the supply chain ecosystem, especially for core EV components. The path forward for Malaysia is clear: Proton and Perodua must collaborate to create a globally competitive local component industry through cross-company standardization.

Commonisation isn't new to the automotive industry. The Detroit Big Three achieved dominance in the 1950s and 60s on this very premise, derogatorily called ""badge engineering.""

General Motors, once the world's largest and most valuable company, was the most prolific practitioner.

The Japanese and Germans followed suit, with successful platform-sharing within corporate groups like VAG, Toyota Group and Hyundai-Kia.

But here's the problem: this practice remained limited to companies within the same corporate umbrella. Stellantis, Fiat-Chrysler, and the Renault-Nissan Alliance all attempted broader collaboration, but corporate egos prevented true industry-wide commonization.

At the 2015 Detroit Auto Show, former Fiat Chrysler chairman Sergio Marchionne captured the absurdity perfectly: ""Competition and brand-building means that every manufacturer wants to make its own core components, like, say, four-cylinder engines, leading to ruinous overlap. You are talking about hundreds of millions of duplicative and redundant investments that do not bear any benefit for the consumer.""

Yet to this day, car companies pour billions into building nearly identical engines differentiated only by letter acronyms - engines that 90 per cent of consumers couldn't distinguish if their lives depended on it.

This is where China rewrote the playbook. Chinese carmakers can now develop new models in under two years, while traditional brands still need three years or more.

They didn't discover magic - they took commonisation beyond corporate boundaries.

A June 2025 Wards Auto article captured this transformation through Ramiro Gutierrez, president of ZF North America, who described the stark difference:

""The approach of many legacy customers is 'No, I want my steering system, and my braking system, and my suspension system - and they cannot be the same as this other guy's.'

In China, the same systems can be sold to ten automakers because they realise standardisation will get them to market faster, and differentiating those systems provides no added value to the end user.""

The distinction is crucial: while VAG perfected parts-bin sharing within their empire, Chinese manufacturers embraced component sharing across competing companies and even across industries.

When German giants struggled with software, Chinese automakers simply partnered with smartphone and electronics companies who already had the expertise and operating systems ready to deploy.

In China, directly competing companies routinely use identical standardised modules from the same Tier-1 suppliers, creating a powerful ""ecosystem of scale."" This presents a fundamental divergence from the Western model.

Where Western standardisation remains confined to brands under a single corporate umbrella, China's scope spans multiple competing companies. This provides suppliers with aggregated volume from entire industry segments rather than single OEM groups. R&D costs amortise significantly faster when spread across many automakers, freeing companies to focus innovation on user experience, design, and software rather than proprietary engineering of commodity systems.

Consider CATL, the world's largest battery manufacturer. Through their ""Choco-SEB"" swappable battery system, five major Chinese automakers including direct competitors like FAW, Changan, and GAC, all use the same standard battery packs.

Similarly, suppliers like Desay SV and iFLYTEK dominate the digital cockpit market by supplying identical domain controller modules and voice interaction systems to competing car brands.

This model delivers tremendous economic advantages: mega-scale production, rapid R&D amortisation, and aggressive reinvestment in innovation.

It creates a virtuous cycle where costs decrease while technology advances, benefiting the entire ecosystem.

The combined production of Proton and Perodua represents a domestic volume of about 420,000 units annually.

While this market size is not in the league of China, it provides the minimum viable scale necessary to attract major Tier-1 foreign investment, establish a high-tech local manufacturing base, and eventually anchor regional exports into Asean.

Both companies have already identified the same three components for localization. Instead of developing proprietary systems separately, a national standardization strategy could catalyze the birth of a local component industry.

First, both companies must agree on one or two standard battery pack formats, focusing on common physical dimensions and connection points.

Capacity (kWh) and chemistry (LFP vs. NMC) can vary, but standard form factors would create predictable demand for suppliers.

Second, they need to establish specifications for motor classes based on dimensions, power output ranges, mounting points, and core architecture requirements suited to the Malaysian market across different size and price segments.

Third, a common Battery Management System (BMS) platform architecture must be developed that suppliers can build upon, ensuring compatibility and economies of scale.

Ideally, these standards should be developed with other industry players beyond Proton and Perodua - but these two national champions must start the ball rolling.

The Government's Critical Role

Government action is absolutely essential to make this happen. The current EV steering committee provides a starting point - invite all industry players to the table and clearly indicate that the future will include national standards for these three key components.

All local assembly programmes must incorporate these local parts. The government must establish clear timelines and consequences: Standards must be established within three years

This will proceed regardless of individual company participation

Strategic incentives (R&D grants, tax breaks, pioneer status) for suppliers committing to produce standard components in Malaysia

Incentives for Proton and Perodua to offset initial risks in adopting common platforms

The government should also leverage diplomatic and trade relationships to attract global Tier-1 suppliers, ensuring investment packages include substantive technology transfer and local vendor development programmes.

A Golden Opportunity

The EV era offers Malaysia a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform from an assembler into a high-tech manufacturer.

Success won't come from going it alone. By emulating China's proven cross-company standardisation model, Proton and Perodua - with strong government support - can create the economies of scale necessary to birth a local EV component champion.

The question isn't whether Malaysia can afford to pursue this strategy. It's wchether we can afford not to.",,N,,2025-12-07 09:00:27.257736

Mosaic and the EPA have disputed the Center for Biological Diversity’s arguments in the case.","Mosaic urged the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss as “moot” a lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity challenging the project. The environmental group filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which last year approved the use of phosphogypsum for the pilot project on Mosaic property.

“Mosaic began construction activities the week of August 25, 2025, and began applying phosphogypsum as road base on October 7, 2025,” the company, which intervened in the case on the side of the EPA, said in Friday’s filing.

“It completed all portions of the road that involved phosphogypsum on November 4, 2025. Although Mosaic is still working to complete some ‘control’ sections of the road, those sections do not use any phosphogypsum — they are constructed from common road materials. Mosaic and University of Florida scientists and engineers will also test and monitor the road base as described in the (EPA) approval.”

Mosaic attorneys added, “This action (lawsuit) is now moot because construction of the phosphogypsum portions of the pilot road project is complete. The court should accordingly dismiss the (Center for Biological Diversity) petition for review.”

The Center for Biological Diversity filed the challenge in February, about two months after the EPA approved the project at Mosaic’s New Wales facility. The issue of using phosphogypsum in road-building has long been controversial, as opponents have pointed to potential cancer risks from the substance, which is typically stored in huge stacks, known as “gypstacks.”

In challenging the project, the Center for Biological Diversity has contended, in part, that a 1992 federal rule bars using phosphogypsum in road projects. It has cited concerns about radon emissions and potential air and groundwater pollution.

The EPA said in a court filing this year that the project was limited to a 3,200-foot road. Mosaic — a major player in the phosphate industry — used phosphogypsum from a stack on the New Wales property for the project, according to a declaration of a company official attached to the company’s filing Friday.

Mosaic and the EPA have disputed the Center for Biological Diversity’s arguments in the case.

“At bottom, EPA approved a site-specific project presenting total risks that are at least an order of magnitude less than placement of phosphogypsum in a stack,” EPA attorneys wrote in a September brief.

Mosaic said in a separate September brief that the Center for Biological Diversity’s “real concern is that the pilot will serve as a gateway to broader beneficial use of phosphogypsum in road base.”

Phosphogypsum includes radium, which decays to form radon gas. Radium and radon can cause cancer, and the giant stacks are used to try to limit public exposure to radon emissions, according to information on the EPA’s website.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df93f4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/949x498+0+67/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffd%2Fff%2Fc1fbea4f4d399febca3338680270%2Fnew-wales-phosphate-plant.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:02.881382

“Do you want to breathe? Do you want to drink water? Then save the Aravallis,” one of the many posters they held up read.

On December 3, Congress leader and chair of the Congress Parliamentary Party Sonia Gandhi cited the example of the Aravallis, detailing why India needed “a new deal for the environment”. “The Modi Government has now nearly signed a death warrant for these hills, already denuded by illegal mining,” she wrote in The Hindu.

On December 5, an online petition initiated by the citizen collectives People For Aravallis and Save Sariska said that the Supreme Court had immersed the ancient hill range into an “existential crisis” after its judgment on November 20. Among the five main demands that the online petition asks citizens to make is that India’s apex court recall its recent judgment – one, that they say, will endanger the Aravallis greatly. The petition, signed by citizen signatories, will be sent to around 30 officials and authorities including the Supreme Court of India.

What is this judgment, how is it endangering the Aravallis now, why are citizens galvanising into action for the hill range, and how bad is this ‘death warrant’ that Gandhi spoke about?

The Wire breaks it down for you.

What are the Aravallis?

The Aravallis are a long stretch of low-and mid-elevation hills (ranging from ) in northwest India.

The hill range contains a diverse variety of habitats. These include dry deciduous forests, such as those found in the Sariska Tiger Reserve which is home to India’s national animal; tropical thorn forests such as those that dominate in the Delhi Ridge right next door to the national capital; and wetlands like the Sambhar Lake near Jaipur, Rajasthan (formed due to a natural depression in the Aravalli hill range), which supports tens of thousands of local and migratory birds.

The Aravallis are also one of the oldest fold-mountain systems of the world: according to some estimates such as this one, it was formed in the Pre-Cambrian era which dates back to about 3-4 billion years ago. This makes it much older than the adjacent Himalayas (though home to the world’s tallest peak, this mountain range is only about 40-50 million years old).

The hill range provides a host of ecosystem services across its 700-km length. These include regulatory services which play a key role in maintaining climate, carbon sequestration, air and water quality, preventing soil erosion and more.

The Aravallis are also home to many sacred groves, or lands protected by local communities for their spiritual and cultural significance. In 2023, for instance, scientists identified a staggering 89 such small and big sacred sites in Udaipur district in the Rajasthan Aravallis alone.

“The Aravalli range, which runs from Gujarat through Rajasthan and till Haryana, has long played a significant role in Indian geography and history,” Gandhi wrote in an article for The Hindu on December 5. “It has served as a barrier to the spread of desertification from the Thar Desert to the Gangetic Plains, guarded Rajasthan's proudest forts such as Chittorgarh and Ranthambore, and served as the cradle of spirituality for communities across northwest India.”

Clearly, the Aravallis are important for not just wildlife and biodiversity, but people too.

A hill range already under threat

The Aravallis face a number of threats. Illegal mining is a prime concern. A book chapter in 2021 identified “illegal and rampant mining”, as well as unorganised urbanisation, over-exploitation of natural resources, introduction and spread of invasive species, disposal of untreated sewage and solid waste and deforestation as major threats.

The Delhi government itself identifies illegal mining, along with the construction of buildings, roads and housing, conversion of forest land into parks (such as this plan by the Haryana government), garbage dumping, and the introduction of invasive species (such as Prosopis juliflora or the vilayati babool tree) as some of the chief threats that the Delhi Ridge (which is part of the Aravallis in the union territory) experiences today.

One of the reasons why mining is such a huge threat across most of the hill range is that there has always been ambiguity in the definition of what constitutes a forest – and is therefore liable to be protected under Indian law – in many parts of the Aravallis. In Haryana for instance, the Aravallis are called gair mumkin pahar (or ‘uncultivable hilly areas’).

However, conservationists have been fighting long battles to ensure that these open forests, hillocks and grasslands are still protected, and illegal mining operations shut down. For instance, in July this year, the district of Nuh in Haryana got a dedicated ‘mining unit’ to prevent illegal mining; the local administration also closed down four roads allegedly constructed by illegal miners in the district and wrongly regularised, The Tribune reported.

Why are citizens demanding its protection now?

On November 20, the Supreme Court accepted a new definition of the Aravalli hill ranges that the Union Environment Ministry proposed: that only hills above 100 meters above the local terrain be considered as the ‘Aravalli Hills and Ranges’.

“Those hills and ranges comprising rocks of the Aravalli Supergroup and Delhi Supergroup, which originated during the Palacoproerozoid to Mesoproterozoic, having a relief higher than 100 meters (+5 Meters) above the surrounding terrain, may be defined as 'Aravalli Hills and Ranges’,” the court order read.

The new definition treats a landform as part of the Aravalli landscape only if it has at least 100 metres of elevation above the local relief (including the landform’s slopes and adjacent areas), the Jhatkaa signature petition that went online on December 5 noted. This is highly unusual: the elevations of physical and geographical features are usually expressed in metres above mean sea level – and are not dependent on the terrain around them. However, the report of the committee that looked into this that was accessed by The Wire justified this by noting that the use of elevation alone as a “sole criterion cannot suffice the purpose as taking the average elevation for defining Aravalli Hills and Ranges will lead to inclusion and exclusion error for selection of Aravalli Hills and Ranges in the four States”.

But here’s the problem: by this new definition, at least 90% of the Aravallis will no longer be protected legally.

According to a report by the Indian Express, internal documents of the Forest Survey of India (FSI) showed that only 1,048 of 12,081 Aravalli Hills 20 metres or higher and spread across 15 districts in Rajasthan, are 100 metres or more in height. This means that just about 8.7% of the Aravallis in Rajasthan will be protected by this definition. Rajasthan has the highest area under the Aravallis across all states. The news report also quoted an official of the Union Environment ministry as saying that the FSI had cautioned that the 100 metre cut-off “would protect only a few guard posts while surrendering the fences below”. Losing lower hills will likely expose vast areas to sand and dust particles blowing from the Thar desert to the Indo-Gangetic plains and endanger the livelihood of farmers and health of people, including those living in Delhi-NCR, the Indian Express quoted the unnamed official as saying.

“The acceptance of the uniform definition of the Aravalli hills by the SC bench is extremely regressive,” Neelam Ahluwalia, Founder Member, People for Aravallis, told The Wire.

“How can a 3 billion-year-old ecosystem which is India’s ecological, geological and cultural heritage be so narrowly defined to facilitate mining and commercial exploitation? India’s oldest mountain range is bleeding as a result of licensed and illegal mining and real estate development with hill after hill across Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat being razed to the ground. Aravallis require strict protection, not illogical and senseless definitions to exclude the majority of the areas from legal protection,” she said.

National security cited again

The new definition of the Aravallis has been adopted to enable mining in the area for reasons including “national security”, documents show.

After an order by the Supreme Court in May 2024, the Union Environment Ministry had constituted a Committee to develop a uniform definition of the Aravalli hills and ranges. While the Committee, after several meetings, agreed that “the presence of vegetation over the Aravalli slopes acts as a value-added protective layer”, arrests soil erosion, regulates local microclimate, and preserves biodiversity. The Committee also added that the hill range contains “precious and strategic minerals” such as gold, tungsten and lead. This offers “substantial potential for future exploration”, an additional affidavit on behalf of the Union Environment Ministry said.

The hills also contain “significant potential” for critical minerals such as graphite, lithium and other rare earth elements – “all of which are of growing strategic relevance for energy transition, high-technology manufacturing, and national security”.

“In this context, the Committee was of the considered opinion that while the ecological and environmental integrity of the Aravalli Hills and Ranges must remain the foremost priority, it is equally necessary to evolve framework that enables systematic, scientific, and environmentally sustainable exploitation of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals located within the region. Such a balanced approach would ensure that the country's strategic and developmental interests are not compromised, while upholding the objectives of conservation and ecological restoration.”

This is yet another instance wherein the Union Environment Ministry has cited national security and strategic interests to accelerate developmental activities. The ministry has used this very argument in the case of the slew of infrastructure projects planned in the Great Nicobar island in the Andaman and Nicobar island complex against which several sections of society including ecologists and activists have raised numerous concerns about.

A death knell for the Aravallis

The new re-definition of the Aravallis is disastrous for the hill range chiefly because of the impacts on people, biodiversity and the ecosystem due to the opening of vast tracts of the Aravallis to mining, environmentalists have said.

Even with existing levels of mining which is already “extensive”, all that local villagers are left with are just “bare hills, dust, rubble and diseases,” said activist Kailash Mina who has been leading grassroot struggles against illegal mining in the Aravallis.

“The uniform definition of the Aravalli hills accepted by the Supreme Court will lead to more destruction in the range and more negative impact on the communities dependent on the Aravallis for their sustenance. Agricultural productivity which has declined across the Aravalli belt in South Haryana and Rajasthan as a result of unavailability of water due to excessive mining and with a layer of dust from the stone crushers covering the crops will be more negatively impacted with more than 90% of the hills across the range not qualifying as Aravalli hills and being opened up for mining,” he added.

The mining that ensues will also have ramifications for human health – not just for local communities living in the vicinity and within the hill range, but even for people living in urban areas including the national capital of New Delhi. Mining in the Aravallis will release more dust and pollution into the air, and this will worsen the already poor air quality in the national capital because Delhi sits right on the edge of the hill range.

Medical practitioners have already noted how the current air quality in Delhi is disastrous for health, even affecting children negatively.

“How can we destroy more than 90% of [the Aravallis], with just one stroke? As a doctor I see more and more patients who are suffering the consequences of living in high levels of pollution,” Dr. Sharda Yadav, a medical doctor and resident of Gurgaon who participated in the Aravalli Bachao protest on November 30, said.

Yadav, who specialises in dental surgery, told The Wire that she now sees higher incidences of patients coming in with respiratory issues such as asthma and bronchitis as part of their broader, medical systemic history.

“Allergic elements present in polluted air cause coughing, sneezing and suffocation leading to mouth breathing. Chronic mouth breathing can lead to a variety of dental problems, including bad breath, gum disease and tooth decay primarily because it causes a dry mouth and affects oral hygiene,” Yadav said.

Ecological and environmental impacts

The Aravallis are already witnessing degradation due to mining, encroachment and urbanisation.

“Losing more hills and forests to mining will shrink habitat of wildlife and increase man-animal conflict; intensify desertification; worsen dust pollution, water scarcity and extreme weather events; negatively impact food and water security for millions of people living in North West India,” Ahluwalia told The Wire.

Trees and their canopy cover in the Aravalli hills preserve humidity in the atmosphere, moderates the wind velocity and helps regulate rainfall patterns, ecologist Pia Sethi said in a statement.

“The loss of vegetation cover with the opening up of smaller Aravalli hills for mining as they are not considered as Aravallis anymore can impact local rainfall patterns and temperature, leading to increased heat stress throughout the Aravalli belt in North West India,” she commented.

Groundwater recharge will also be affected, said water conservationist Rajendra Singh, famously called “The Waterman of India”. The Magsaysay award winner stressed that many districts in the Aravallis are already highly water-stressed.

“The Aravalli region acts as a critical water recharge zone,” he said. “The highly fractured and weathered rocks with their natural cracks allow water to percolate and recharge the groundwater. Calculations reveal an immense potential of 2 million litres of ground water recharge per hectare of the Aravalli landscape. Aquifers lying beneath the Aravallis are interconnected and any disturbance or alterations in the pattern due to breaking of hills due to mining can significantly alter the groundwater table and its purity.”

'Scrap definition, recall judgment'

The letter put together by the People For Aravallis and Save Sariska which is to be sent to 30 officials and government authorities including the Supreme Court demands that the government scrap the new, uniform definition of the Aravallis.

It also demands that the Supreme Court order dated November 20 that accepts this new definition of the Aravallis be recalled, “as the decision risks irreversible damage to North West India’s only barrier against desertification, critical water recharge zones, pollution sinks, wildlife habitats and public health”.

It urges the government to declare the Aravallis across Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi as a ‘Critical Ecological Zone’ because of the suite of crucial ecosystem services that the range provides for millions of people living in northwest India.

Another demand is that all mining and stone crushing activities near human habitation, agricultural fields, water bodies, wildlife sensitive zones in the Aravallis be stopped, and alternative building materials be developed so that mining is no longer a threat for the hill range.",https://m.thewire.in/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhld2lyZS1pbi1wcm9kLXNvcnRkL21lZGlhZjcwNTlmZjAtZDMyZi0xMWYwLWE1ZjMtZTU1ZmUzOTdjMGFmLmpwZw==,N,,2025-12-07 11:03:15.114373

Reporting supported with a grant from The Water Desk at the University of Colorado Boulder.

NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico—Silvia Fernández Gallardo Boone leaned over a stream of water rushing through a concrete chute at the city’s wastewater treatment plant.

“Smell it!” she said, beaming.

Odorless, treated wastewater flowed into the Coyote Arroyo, or creek, then the Rio Grande. Mere months earlier, more than 12 million gallons of raw sewage were leaking every day into the river and groundwater in Nuevo Laredo. After repairs to the treatment plant, to Fernández Gallardo’s delight, the flow of untreated wastewater has been significantly reduced.

“Being on the border, we really live our lives on both sides of the river,” Fernández Gallardo said, looking out at the treatment plant. “We all have a stake in taking care of the river.”

When Carmen Lilia Canturosas was elected mayor of Nuevo Laredo in 2021, deferred maintenance had debilitated the plant. To make matters worse, broken sewer lines were leaking wastewater onto city streets. Canturosas, re-elected in 2024, threw her support behind overhauling Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater and sewer system.

Fernández Gallardo, an architect by training, was appointed general manager of the Potable Water and Sanitation Commission (Comisión de Agua Potable y Alcantarillado), known by its Spanish acronym COMAPA. In 2023, COMAPA broke ground on an $80 million project, backed by U.S. and Mexican institutions, to repair the failing wastewater treatment plant and damaged sewer lines. The North American Development Bank (NADBank) issued the largest grant for wastewater improvements in its 30-year history.

Shared waterways like the Rio Grande have been sites of cooperation between the two countries, but also points of contention. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater overhaul is the latest bet that the U.S. and Mexico can work together to improve water quality and the environment.

But the project is reaching fruition as tensions mount between the U.S. and Mexico under the second Trump presidency. Mexico once again has fallen short on its treaty commitment to share Rio Grande water with the United States. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariff demands have cast a shadow over trade hubs like Laredo-Nuevo Laredo.

Far from the policy disputes of Washington, D.C., officials like Fernández Gallardo are still counting on binational collaboration to yield tangible benefits for local residents.

“Rehabilitating the Rio Bravo doesn’t just mean improving local environmental conditions,” she wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News, using the Mexican name for the river. “It also represents an opportunity to move toward shared water security between Mexico and the United States.”

Monitoring Water Quality

The day before Fernández Gallardo toured the plant, Martin Castro and Tom Vaughan were on the other side of the border, knee deep in the Rio Grande. Four Border Patrol officers peered out from an outcropping above the river and asked what they were doing.

Castro, watershed science director at the Rio Grande International Study Center, and Vaughan, a center co-founder and emeritus biology professor at Texas A&M International University in Laredo, calmly explained that they were taking water quality samples. A few minutes later, the officers left.

The pair were collecting samples to contribute to an extensive database on the river’s water quality, as they do every month.

On that late October day, Border Patrol and National Guard troops far outnumbered fishermen and other recreational visitors to the Rio Grande. It’s not only the law enforcement presence that makes environmental protection on the Rio Grande unique.

As an international river, the Rio Grande was initially excluded from the Texas Clean Rivers Program. The collaborative effort monitors and protects the state’s water resources. Vaughan was among those who advocated in the 1990s for the Rio Grande to be included.

The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), a federal agency that enforces the border and water agreements, eventually took over water quality monitoring on the river. IBWC data from the Rio Grande now feeds into the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s Clean Rivers Program.

For more than 1,200 miles, the Rio Grande snakes between Texas and Mexico, crossing remote deserts and urban areas before reaching its delta at the Gulf of Mexico. IBWC partners with organizations like the Rio Grande study center to collect water samples at 119 stations. Monitoring at eight stations in El Paso was suspended in 2023 because of border security installations. IBWC spokesperson Frank Fisher said sampling has been re-established at all but three sites.

Castro and Vaughan collected samples to send to a certified laboratory. They record other measurements themselves, such as turbidity using a Secchi disk.

“Upriver, I would swim in it,” Vaughan said, referring to the Rio Grande upstream of the bend in the river that wraps around Laredo. “If I was really thirsty, I might drink it.”

But he explained that sewage downstream of the city makes the water unsafe for swimming or other contact recreation. This part of the Rio Grande below the Amistad Reservoir, known as segment 2304, exceeds Texas standards for bacteria.

In this stretch of the river, the highest readings for E. coli, the indicator for bacteria, are downstream of Laredo and the wastewater discharges from Nuevo Laredo, according to IBWC’s 2024 Rio Grande summary report. At the Pipeline Crossing and El Cenizo sites, E. coli readings were 240,000 parts per 100 milliliters. That is nearly 2,000 times the state’s water quality standard of 126 parts.

The IBWC report warns of “serious health risks” and that the water is unsuitable for recreational activities or consumption. The report attributes the high bacteria levels to wastewater infrastructure allowing sewage to enter the river.

IBWC’s Fisher said bacteria levels are elevated in other parts of the river including in the urban areas of El Paso/Ciudad Juárez, Del Rio/Ciudad Acuña, Eagle Pass/Piedras Negras, and in Hidalgo County.

“TCEQ is committed to advancing collaboration among federal, state, and binational partners to improve water quality and resilience in the border region,” said Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesperson Victoria Cann.

Cann referenced the Lower Rio Grande Water Quality Initiative as one example of the agency’s efforts to improve water management. The initiative aims to “restore, protect and improve” water quality on the Lower Rio Grande downstream of Falcon Reservoir. The group recently completed an 18-month binational salinity study, according to Cann.

Cleaning Up the Rio Grande

It’s one thing to collect data on the river’s water quality. It’s another to act on that data. For decades, the U.S. and Mexico have debated how to improve the environment and sanitation along their nearly 2,000-mile border.

The 1944 water treaty between the two countries entrusted border sanitation issues to the IBWC. As new problems cropped up—like sewage flowing downhill from Mexico into the U.S.— new agreements, known as minutes, were added to the treaty. In 1989, the U.S. and Mexico partnered to build a wastewater treatment plant in Nuevo Laredo.

After the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was adopted in 1994, Nuevo Laredo and other border cities grew rapidly. Nuevo Laredo’s wastewater treatment plant opened in 1996. Binational wastewater treatment plants were also built in Tijuana, Baja California and Nogales, Arizona.

In a side agreement to NAFTA, the two countries created the NADBank, a binational development bank to fund infrastructure on the border.

Nuevo Laredo’s population has almost doubled since 1994, to nearly half a million people. Laredo, with about 260,000 people, is now the busiest land port for international trade in the United States.

But ongoing maintenance of wastewater infrastructure became a sticking point. By the time NAFTA was renegotiated in 2020—and renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement—border wastewater treatment plants were in urgent need of repairs. Sewage flowing from Tijuana into Southern California became an international dispute.

Colorado State University emeritus political scientist Stephen Mumme, an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations, partially attributes maintenance problems to the “constant churn” in Mexican politics, in which local administrations change every three years.

Mexican cities also struggle to finance long-term infrastructure projects and collect monthly bills from ratepayers. Sanitation competes with other urgent public works in border cities buckling under rapid growth.

“The capacity to engage in the type of financing and planning that is often taken for granted in American cities is not yet fully realized in Mexican cities, even in border cities,” Mumme said.

Jesús Frausto Ortega, coordinator of the water management graduate program at Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Monterrey, Mexico, said that previous efforts to stop the flow of sewage in Nuevo Laredo were like paving over a pothole.

“You could fix one part, but there was no holistic solution,” said Frausto Ortega, who previously worked in Nuevo Laredo.

He said Mexican cities often lack political will to invest in sanitation infrastructure.

“Traditionally, officials don’t invest in projects that are underground,” he said. “[That’s because] the public doesn’t see the project and we don’t have reliable accountability mechanisms.”

COMAPA’s Fernández Gallardo said she heard this sentiment from other public officials.

“Why would you want to invest in sewer lines?” she remembers them asking. “That’s like burying money.”

Binational Investment

Fernández Gallardo and Canturosas, the mayor, persisted. They found support among U.S. officials, including then U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar and then IBWC Commissioner Maria-Elena Giner. NADBank provided an initial $650,000 grant to develop plans for the wastewater treatment plant and collapsed sewer lines.

Support started to pour in. NADBank committed $22 million from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Border Environment Infrastructure Fund. Mexican agencies, including COMAPA, committed another $53 million. The IBWC pitched in $2 million, and a commercial loan of $6 million rounded out the budget.

IBWC’s Fisher said the agency’s contribution came “as part of a long-standing practice to share the cost of extraordinary maintenance.” He said the funds were used to purchase six aerators needed for the biological process at the plant.

NADBank Managing Director John Beckham said that the significant commitments from both countries set the effort apart.

“Those are unique features of this project that are replicable,” he said. “We’re proud of it. We think it’s something that can help us in other parts of the river.”

Fernández Gallardo estimated in late October that the wastewater treatment plant’s rehabilitation was 80 percent complete. She said that sewage was still being discharged at 10 locations in the city, down from 27.

“You’re investing in a public good,” she said. “These are projects that you don’t see, but you feel the difference in the city.”

Fernández Gallardo acknowledged that COMAPA must prevent deferred maintenance from once again hobbling the plant. She said that going forward, 4 percent of funds from water bills will be designated for maintenance.

“[We have to] ensure that these plants can be maintained over time …,” Beckham said. “To avoid cycles of every 25 years where we have to lay out $80 million.”

Martin Castro of the Rio Grande International Study Center said the upgrades are a “meaningful milestone.”

“They underscore how urgently the river needs sustained infrastructure investment,” he said. “Continued investment and binational cooperation are essential to protect water quality for both communities.”

A Changing Political—and Environmental—Climate

While Nuevo Laredo is making strides, extreme drought and climate change are testing the fragile balance on the binational river. The Rio Grande provides drinking water for over 6 million people in the United States and Mexico. Farmers from Colorado to the Gulf of Mexico rely on it to irrigate their crops.

But experts warn that current water consumption levels cannot be sustained. The Amistad Reservoir, upstream of Laredo, hit historic lows during July 2024. Climate change will further reduce the river’s flow.

A November 2025 study led by the World Wildlife Fund found that 52 percent of water consumption in the Rio Grande Basin is unsustainable, causing depletion of reservoirs, aquifers and river flows. American Rivers named the Lower Rio Grande the fifth most endangered river in the United States this year.

The Rio Grande is the only source of water for Nuevo Laredo and Laredo. But sometimes the river drops so low that the pumps at the water treatment plant struggle to draw in water, Fernández Gallardo said. She touted COMAPA’s purple pipe program, which diverts treated wastewater for outdoor irrigation and industrial use, but said more must be done to conserve and re-use water.

“Without the river, we don’t have the two Laredos,” she said.

Fernández Gallardo said she would like Nuevo Laredo to directly re-use treated wastewater for domestic supply, known as direct potable reuse.

“Treated wastewater is the only water resource whose supply will always go up as the population increases,” she wrote in a statement. “[Direct reuse] would redefine the future of water on the border.”

Another Rio Grande city, El Paso, is rolling out this technology. But Fernández Gallardo knows the municipal administration’s time to execute projects is running out.

Escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico are felt locally. While Mexico increased Rio Grande water deliveries to the United States in the past year, the Trump administration has threatened Mexico with additional tariffs and even sanctions if the nation does not deliver more to Texas. Meanwhile, Mexican officials have attributed the shortfall to the ongoing drought.

The Trump administration quickly replaced several of the U.S. officials essential to the Nuevo Laredo project, including Salazar, the ambassador, and Giner, the well-liked IBWC commissioner.

The Trump administration is also moving forward with plans for a border wall through Laredo, which local organizations, including the Rio Grande International Study Center, oppose.

Water quality woes on the Rio Grande have attracted little national attention. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has pressured Mexico to stop the sewage flows from Tijuana. The EPA has struck agreements with Mexico to accelerate the timeline to repair the Tijuana treatment plant.

A State Department spokesperson said that the U.S. and Mexico have “launched a new era of cooperation characterized by swift and decisive actions.”

“No other bilateral relationship has a greater effect on the daily lives of the American people and President Trump and his cabinet are committed to improving the welfare, health, and prosperity of our border communities,” the spokesperson said.

The EPA also funds NADBank’s grants for wastewater infrastructure on the border. Congress has not passed a full federal budget for 2026. Nonetheless, the spending bills for environment and natural resource agencies that passed through committee maintained support for the EPA’s border wastewater programs. The Senate bill would appropriate $36 million and the House bill $45 million for border wastewater projects, comparable to recent years.

CSU’s Mumme said that the Trump administration’s increasing hostility toward Mexico could backfire.

“Trump is used to bullying his way. But that only goes so far,” he said. “Mexico does have leverage.”

Mumme said the history of cooperation shows that the U.S. and Mexico can achieve common goals, on issues from wastewater to water scarcity.

“There’s no substitute to cooperating and finding mutually beneficial solutions,” he said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rio-Grande-3w.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:05.798831

The Ground Under It Is Already Shifting.,"Rambo Talabong, Anika Jane Beamer",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07122025/new-jersey-energy-grid-plan/,"“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy.
Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage.
Offshore wind “was a big piece of trying to get to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said.
A Guide, Not a Mandate For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.
Potosnak’s group is backing a lame-duck bill that would incorporate the state’s 2035 goal of 100 percent clean energy—currently in place from a 2023 Murphy executive order—into state law.","In the waning days of Governor Phil Murphy’s tenure, state officials unveiled an updated Energy Master Plan that calls for 100 percent clean electricity by 2035 and steep reductions in climate pollution by midcentury. Since 2019, the state has used the first version of the plan as the backbone of its climate strategy, promising reliable, affordable and clean power.

The blueprint lands at a moment when delivering on all three goals is increasingly in doubt.

While a second Trump administration rolls back federal clean-energy support, PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator that serves New Jersey and a dozen other states, struggles to manage surging electricity demand from artificial-intelligence data centers.

“The Energy Master Plan is a statutorily required report to chart out New Jersey’s energy future,” said Eric Miller, who leads the Governor’s Office of Climate Action and the Green Economy. While not binding, it is the state’s official roadmap to attain its climate goals.

Miller’s office and the state Board of Public Utilities developed the plan with public input and help from outside consultants.

Under the plan, New Jersey is betting heavily on utility-scale solar and battery storage. State modeling envisions total solar capacity climbing to about 22 gigawatts by 2050 which is four times today’s roughly 5 gigawatts of installed solar. On paper, it would be enough to supply nearly all of the state’s current households over a year. To get there, the plan assumes adding about 750 megawatts of new solar each year from 2026, roughly double the pace of solar construction in 2024.

The plan’s release follows a governor’s race in which energy costs dominated, and voters chose U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat who campaigned on preserving Murphy-era climate targets, over Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican who argued for a slower transition.

“Voters sent a clear message that clean energy is the most cost-effective path forward and the smartest long-term investment,” said Ed Potosnak, head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters and a local council member in Franklin Township.

A Grid Tested By Data Centers

The plan lands as New Jersey enters what Miller calls the “load growth era.”

For roughly two decades, electricity demand in PJM’s footprint, which stretches from New Jersey to Illinois, was flat or falling as aging power plants retired and efficiency improved. That trend has flipped because of data centers.

“What we saw in 2024 into ’25, and I think what we’re going to see for the next 15 years, is a scenario where demand on the electric grid is growing,” Miller said.

For years, New Jersey spent billions subsidizing hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles and thousands of buildings to electrify. Now, Miller said, “some of the techniques for greenhouse gas reductions are going to have to kind of meet the moment,” by taking a more proactive role in engaging with PJM, or by filling in the dearth in clean energy incentives caused by the Trump administration.

The recent PJM capacity auctions have added billions of dollars in costs for customers across the region. This showed up as a 20 percent jump in summer electricity bills in New Jersey this year, which became a hot campaign issue during its recent gubernatorial race.

“The wholesale price of electricity is determined by PJM and federal policy, and then also the price of natural gas,” said Frank Felder, an energy economist who has advised regulators. “New Jersey can’t do much about that.”

Participating in a fast-track rulemaking process that PJM initiated to address data center-driven demand, outgoing governor Murphy joined other governors in proposing that data center developers bring their own power generators in exchange for quicker permit processing.

PJM seeks to decide which proposals to pursue this month and file them with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by the end of the year.

Federal Headwinds and Stalled Offshore Wind

Layered on top of PJM’s turmoil are decisions coming from Washington.

Experts repeatedly pointed to President Trump’s second-term moves to strip away clean-energy tax incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act and to impose new tariffs on imported solar panels and wind equipment. They say those steps have raised costs and driven off developers.

Potosnak called it “Trump’s clean energy ban” and said the administration’s opposition to offshore wind “derailed the best chance we had to get massive amounts of offshore wind going that would have begun lowering our utility rates this year.” Several major Atlantic projects, including those planned off New Jersey’s coast, have been canceled or delayed.

Offshore wind “was a big piece of trying to get to 100 percent clean electricity by 2035,” Felder said. With new contracts unlikely for several years, he warned New Jersey could be “back at basically square one” by the end of the decade.

Even so, Felder and others urged caution against writing off renewables entirely. Robert Mieth, a Rutgers University researcher who studies power systems, noted that offshore wind is well established in Europe and that, with or without U.S. manufacturing, “there will be access to competitive and affordable renewable technology from other countries.”

In the meantime, state officials point to progress in areas they can influence more directly.

Miller noted that New Jersey has gone from roughly 20,000 plug-in vehicles in 2018 to about 270,000 today, after lawmakers set clear targets and funded incentives and chargers.

The state’s “nation-leading solar program,” he said, is “primarily state-incentivized, primarily state-funded,” and can keep expanding—albeit slower now—even as federal tax credits expire.

“The cheapest energy is the energy you don’t have to make,” Potosnak said, citing efficiency programs, rooftop and warehouse solar and batteries on parking lots that “drive down utility costs for families and businesses” while cutting pollution.

A Guide, Not a Mandate

For all its detail, the Energy Master Plan is not binding.

“The Energy Master Plan does not have the force of law,” Miller said. It has been “very informative,” he added, but “it is not a legal requirement that we follow it exactly.”

Gov.-elect Sherrill will determine how closely New Jersey hews to the map. Neither she nor her opponent had any role in shaping the modeling, Miller said, and the plan was not written with a particular “political future” in mind. Instead, Miller said, the Murphy administration hopes the incoming governor will treat it as “a very useful modeling exercise” or a guide.

Advocates are already trying to lock some of those targets into a statute. Potosnak’s group is backing a lame-duck bill that would incorporate the state’s 2035 goal of 100 percent clean energy—currently in place from a 2023 Murphy executive order—into state law.

If it passes, he said, it would give residents and environmental groups the right to sue if future administrations fall short and send a signal to investors that New Jersey’s direction will not change with every election.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2150017008.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 06:00:23.504659

For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models.
Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback.
You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.","Don’t look now, but the Trump White House is changing the cost of your driving commute.

Maybe you missed this news, perhaps disturbed (yet unsurprised) by our President’s daily tirades… attacking Somalis as “garbage” one day, pardoning a convicted drug smuggler the next or his continued threats of invading Venezuela. How easily we miss the closer-to-home news by getting distracted by these “bright, shiny objects.”

We all know that Connecticut drivers must cope with some of the highest gas prices, longest commutes, and oldest highways in the Northeast. Now Washington has decided to dramatically weaken fuel-economy standards for new cars, cutting the 2031 target from roughly 50 mpg to about 34. This threatens to make things worse for everyone, especially current and future electric-vehicle owners.

On the surface, the rollback is pitched by the White House as a win for “affordable cars,” claiming that these relaxed miles-per-gallon rules will shave maybe $900 off the cost of a new gas-powered SUV. But for Connecticut commuters who routinely log 12,000–15,000 miles a year, those savings will evaporate quickly: cars that burn more fuel cost more to operate, and in a pricey state like ours, the pump always gets paid.

But the bigger, less obvious impact of the mileage rules will be on electric-vehicle drivers– the very people who bought into the promise of lower operating costs, cleaner air, and a modernized transportation system.

According to the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 2.7 million cars and trucks in our small state. But only about 60,000 of them are EVs.

For those current EV owners, the MPG rollback creates more uncertainty… beyond just finding a charging station. EV resale values depend on strong future demand. So when Washington signals that gasoline-powered cars will stay dominant longer, that EV market may sputter. Fewer people will shop for EVs, fewer choose them, and used EV prices will likely soften.

Federal tax incentives (up to $7,500) for new EV buyers already expired this fall but some Connecticut rebates continue… for now.

Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised. Federal programs launched with great fanfare in 2021 pledged 500,000 publicly available chargers nationwide. But fewer than 400 federally funded chargers have actually been built under the $7.5 billion program.

In Connecticut, fast-charging deserts for thirsty EVs persist across Litchfield County, the Quiet Corner, and shoreline towns east of New Haven. Even Fairfield County’s charging stations, while more plentiful, are frequently congested or out of service.

For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models. Without strict fuel-economy rules, carmakers can meet federal requirements by selling profitable gas-powered SUVs rather than investing in lower-cost EVs that would appeal to everyday drivers. The result? Slower arrival of mid-priced EVs, the very models that would make ‘going electric’ a realistic choice for middle-class families in these tight times.

Remember four years ago when Elon Musk promised us a Tesla for $25,000? In fact the new entry-level models now cost about $37,000 or more.

Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback. It’s an economic one. More money will leave the state for out-of-region fuel suppliers. And an unreliable, underbuilt charging network threatens to stall our transportation future.

The real bottom line? You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tesla-charging.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 08:59:32.332482

This commitment is supported through a comprehensive set of initiatives, including the PLI Scheme for High Efficiency Solar PV Modules and measures to provide a level playing field for the Indian manufacturers. The catalytic effect of these interventions has resulted in an expansion in solar module manufacturing capacity, from just 2.3 GW in 2014 to around 122 GW enlisted in MNRE’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) today.

This expansion underscores the success of India's solar PV manufacturing story through the collective efforts of the industry, various state governments and the Government of India, while also reinforcing India’s commitment to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and contributing meaningfully to global decarbonization efforts. MNRE remains committed to further strengthening the solar manufacturing ecosystem through continued policy support, infrastructure development, and innovation. The Ministry will continue engaging with stakeholders to ensure India’s solar journey remains inclusive, competitive, and future-ready, the official statement said.

But in rich countries that have built infrastructure, natural gas has displaced coal as the biggest source of electricity.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright spoke to the National Petroleum Council on Dec. 3 at its presentation of two studies offering solutions for increasing energy production and electricity reliability. These are excerpts from his remarks:

I always say to people — I can say without a doubt — energy is the most important industry in the world by far, because every other industry wouldn’t be remotely close to what it is today without energy. Affordable, reliable, secure energy literally makes the world go ’round, allowing us to live long, healthy, opportunity-rich lives.

So, I’ve been frustrated most of my career to see politics — and not just looking at math and numbers — seep into energy, leading to tremendous destruction to the quality of life.

We spent 25 years not growing our electricity production very much, maybe 1 percent a year. Does that sound American? One percent a year growth in energy and electricity? And it’s electricity that’s going to drive artificial intelligence. Americans are frustrated with the rise in electricity prices. They went up a lot, but they shouldn’t have.

We have an increase in electricity prices because of political decisions, policy decisions. It was a choice, not an unfortunate event or scarcity problem. Political choices drove the price of electricity up.

Wood was the biggest source of energy on the planet throughout all of human history, until about 1900. We had coal as the largest source of energy for several decades, probably through World War II. And then coal was passed by oil, and oil has been the largest source of energy in the United States — and globally — for many decades.

Today, oil and natural gas are about 72 percent of total U.S. primary energy, the highest percentage ever. And yet nobody wants to go study petroleum engineering because they’re going away, ‘they’re going out of business.’

I’m like, ‘They’re at a record high in quantity and in market share, and both are growing. So maybe they’re not going away.’

The National Petroleum Council matters. Oil and natural gas, together with coal, are what power the world.

I love coal. It’s the largest source of global electricity since we started collecting data around 1900.

But in rich countries that have built infrastructure, natural gas has displaced coal as the biggest source of electricity. So oil and natural gas — the petroleum industry — matters massively. We need it to build smart infrastructure and have smart policies and deliver these products as efficiently as you can, which impacts the economic opportunities for Americans.

We got into some ruts by not having open, honest conversations about environmental issues in oil and gas and infrastructure.

My goal, the Trump administration’s goal, is to be open, transparent and discuss all of these trade-offs. To discuss these things so we can have a more rational view.

We don’t want to deindustrialize the United States. We don’t want AI, like the other energy-intensive industries, to go overseas. We don’t want to keep exporting job opportunities for Americans. We actually want to grow opportunity and prosperity right here.

Despite the strong recent performance of the overall energy sector, the report warns of deepening skilled labour shortages.
According to the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, the main barriers preventing people from entering energy-related training include costs, foregone wages and limited awareness of available programmes.
Reskilling within the energy sector itself is also essential.","Strong investment in energy infrastructure drove a 2.2 per cent rise in energy jobs last year, nearly double the rate of employment growth for the wider global economy, according to a new International Energy Agency (IEA) report, which highlights the dynamic trends across the sector as well as bottlenecks for skilled labour in key areas.

The World Energy Employment 2025 report released finds that global energy sector employment reached 76 million people worldwide in 2024, up more than 5 million from 2019.

The sector has contributed 2.4 per cent of all net jobs created across the global economy over the past five years.

The power sector is leading the way on job creation, accounting for three-quarters of recent employment growth, and is now the largest employer in energy, overtaking fuel supply.

Solar PV is a key driver of growth, complemented by rapid expansions in hiring in nuclear power, grids and storage.

Increasing electrification of other sectors of the economy is also reshaping employment trends, with jobs in EV manufacturing and batteries surging by nearly 800 000 in 2024.

Fossil fuel employment remained resilient in 2024.

Coal jobs rebounded in India, China and Indonesia, pushing employment in the coal industry 8 per cent above its 2019 levels despite steep declines in advanced economies.

The oil and gas industry has also regained most of the jobs lost in 2020, although low prices and economic uncertainties have triggered job cuts in 2025.

Based on early data, energy employment growth is expected to moderate to 1.3 per cent in 2025, reflecting persistently tight labour markets and heightened trade and geopolitical tensions that are making some firms more cautious about hiring.

Despite the strong recent performance of the overall energy sector, the report warns of deepening skilled labour shortages.

Out of 700 energy-related companies, unions and training institutions participating in the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, more than half of them reported critical hiring bottlenecks that threaten to slow the building of energy infrastructure, delay projects and raise system costs.

“Energy has been one of the strongest and most consistent engines of job creation in the global economy during a period marked by significant uncertainties,” said IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. “But this momentum cannot be taken for granted. The world’s ability to build the energy infrastructure it needs depends on having enough skilled workers in place. Governments, industry and training institutions must come together to close the labour and skills gap. Left unaddressed, these shortages could slow progress, raise costs and weaken energy security.”

Applied technical roles such as electricians, pipefitters, line workers, plant operators and nuclear engineers are in especially short supply.

These occupations alone have added 2.5 million positions since 2019 and now represent over half of the entire global energy workforce, more than double their share of total employment in the broader economy.

An ageing workforce is intensifying the pressure, with 2.4 energy workers in advanced economies nearing retirement for every new entrant under 25.

Nuclear- and grid-related professions face some of the steepest demographic challenges, with retirements outnumbering new entrants by ratios of 1.7 and 1.4 to 1 respectively.

At the same time, the supply of newly qualified workers is not keeping pace with the sector’s needs. To prevent the skills gap from widening further by 2030, the number of new qualified entrants into the energy sector globally would need to rise by 40 per cent.

The report shows that this would require an additional $2.6 billion per year of investment globally, representing less than 0.1 per cent of spending on education worldwide.

Policy measures can make a major difference.

According to the IEA’s Energy Employment Survey, the main barriers preventing people from entering energy-related training include costs, foregone wages and limited awareness of available programmes.

India's renewable energy sector continues its robust expansion, with non-fossil fuel sources now accounting for half of the nation's total power generation capacity, a milestone reached five years earlier than initially projected under commitments made during the Paris Agreement.

Current figures through the end of October 2025 show approximately 259 gigawatts of installed capacity from clean energy sources, including a substantial addition of 31.2 GW during the first seven months of this fiscal year.

Recent media coverage suggested that the ministry had instructed financial institutions to suspend funding for renewable projects due to concerns about excessive production capacity.

The ministry has categorically denied these claims.

What the ministry has done, according to official statements, is provide detailed information to financial oversight bodies and major lending institutions, including Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation, and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, about current manufacturing capabilities throughout the solar photovoltaic supply chain.

This information encompasses production capacity data for solar panels, cells, silicon wafers, polysilicon materials, and supporting components such as specialised glass and aluminum framing. The goal is to encourage lenders to take a more comprehensive view when assessing funding applications for solar manufacturing plants.

The ministry is urging financial institutions to broaden their investment perspective beyond conventional solar panel assembly operations to include earlier stages of production and component manufacturing.

India's solar manufacturing sector has experienced remarkable transformation, with panel production capacity surging from a modest 2.3 GW in 2014 to approximately 122 GW currently listed under the ministry's official registry of approved manufacturers and products.

Centre in its statement reaffirmed its dedication to establishing India as a significant force in the worldwide solar manufacturing landscape while working toward the ambitious target of 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by the decade's end.

Ministry officials indicated they will maintain ongoing dialogue with industry participants to ensure the sector remains dynamic, inclusive, and prepared for future challenges.",https://static.businessworld.in/1589948103_kbF4A7_2020_05_20T041000Z_1_LYNXMPEG4J072_RTROPTP_4_IEA_RENEWABLES.JPG,N,,2025-12-07 02:58:27.213631

Despite this year’s abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, US innovators are still front and center in the global decarbonization race. That includes the somewhat unglamorous but carbon-heavy field of concrete, where a research team at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts has introduced a bio-inspired concrete alternative that sequesters carbon during the production process, achieving true carbon-negative status.

Concrete Has A Carbon Problem, Bigly

The research team calculates that their new alternative building material sequesters 6.1 kilograms of carbon per cubic meter during the production process. In contrast, conventional concrete emits roughly 330 kilograms of carbon during production.

Getting to -6 from +330 is quite an achievement, considering the carbon intensity of conventional concrete. Part of the challenge involves reducing the high heat required to transform limestone into the “clinker” that forms the basis of traditional cement, which is the glue that holds gravel and other concrete aggregates together.

Another significant challenge is to replace the limestone itself. A sedimentary rock composed mainly of calcium carbonate fossils, limestone releases a copious amount of carbon dioxide when heated. The US Geological Survey estimates that limestone accounts for almost 66% of the carbon emissions attributed to cement production.

“While most people realize that cars, planes, and power plants contribute to climate change, there’s another major source of greenhouse gases that’s often overlooked. It’s all around us –perhaps even right where you are as you read this. It’s concrete, and the cement used to make it,” USGS elaborated in a think piece last year (see lots more concrete background here).

The Long Road To The Superbricks Of The Future

The roster of solutions to concrete’s carbon problem has been growing into the bio-based space. In a new study published in the journal Matter, the WPI research team notes that one area of focus involves deploying microbes to precipitate calcium carbonate, with bamboo, mycelium, fungi, and bacteria-based materials also among the other alternatives. However, the researchers also note that cost, complexity, engineering issues, and the potential for negative environmental impacts are limiting factors for bio-inspired cement alternatives.

The WPI team itself encountered a significant roadblock in an earlier work, in which they described a bio-inspired process for growing minerals on a polymer scaffold. They introduced trace amounts of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which catalyzed water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then interacted with calcium to produce calcite, which attached itself to the scaffold.

“The material exhibits a compressive strength of 12 MPa and a degree of self-healing capability,” the researchers reported, with MPa being shorthand for megapascal, a valuation of the compressive strength of a concrete mix. By that measure, 12 MPa is pretty good for a first effort. It comes within shouting distance of the minimum MPa for some uses, though the American Cement Association notes that high-strength concrete typically has a strength of at least 55 MPa.

The WPI team also took note of a more substantial issue, stating that the strength of their new material “decreases significantly under humid conditions,” which they describe as a “universal problem for biologically inspired construction materials that use hydrophilic polymers as scaffolds.”

“Although incorporating biomaterials reduces carbon emissions, these products are not water resistant and require a protective layer,” they emphasize.

The Hydrophobic Solution

If you caught that thing about hydrophilic, so did the WPI team. In the new work, they took a different tack. Under the title, “Durable, high-strength carbon-negative enzymatic structural materials via a capillary suspension technique,” they describe how they deployed sand to form a hydrophobic scaffold upon which calcium carbonate crystals can grow.

“We present a strong, cost-effective, carbon-negative building material, named enzymatic structural material (ESM), that integrates enzymatically formed CaCO3 crystals into a hydrochar scaffold via capillary suspension,” they explain.

“This enables versatile fabrication, rapid molding into various structures within hours, and scalability for mass production, bypassing the 28-day curing required for conventional concrete,” the researchers add. In addition to the carbon sequestration benefit, they also cite recycling and repairability as an additional plus in the sustainability column, helping to reduce construction waste and extend the lifespan of a project.

While not hitting the high-strength mark for conventional concrete, the research team achieved a respectable compressive strength of 25.8 MPa, making ESM suitable for roof decks and wall bricks among other applications.

WPI also emphasizes that ESM takes only hours to cure, compared to the four-week timetable typical of most concrete mixtures, helping to accelerate housing construction and post-disaster rebuilding efforts.

“Because ESM is produced with low energy and renewable biological inputs, it also aligns with global goals for carbon-neutral infrastructure and circular manufacturing,” ESM points out.

US Innovators Keep On Innovating

Don’t get too excited just yet. The road from the laboratory to the shelves of your local hardware store is a long one. The WPI team plans to focus their next steps on parsing out the ecological efficiency of their ESM formula, while improving its performance and laying the groundwork for scaled-up production.

In the meantime, various near-term carbon cutting solutions are emerging on the market. One example from the CleanTechnica archive is the Massachusetts startup Sublime Systems. The company’s low carbon “Sublime Cement” is beginning to catch on among construction industry stakeholders in the US, with Microsoft being one high-profile example.

When last heard from, the American Cement Association (a rebrand of the Portland Cement Association earlier this year) also continues to hold the torch for global leadership in the decarbonization movement. “The association has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to set a global standard for innovation and create a sustainable future,” ACA says of its “Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality.” Released in May of 2024, the Roadmap provides space for carbon capture and sequestration, but the overall emphasis is on next-generation solutions that deploy low-carbon feedstocks and renewable energy at the production end. ACA also counts energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy at the building design and construction end towards its 2050 carbon neutral goal.

So much for last year’s effort. This year has been a different story. In May, the US Department of Energy clawed back carbon capture grants for cement producers, among other industries, leading ACA President and CEO Mike Ireland to call the action “a missed opportunity for both America’s cement manufacturers and this administration.”

Nevertheless, the ACA moved forward with a decarbonization agenda for its third annual Sustainability Summit in August. “While 2025 has brought landmark changes in Washington that directly affect cement companies, the industry’s top goal of decarbonization remains the same,” Ireland declared in a preview of the event. The Summit also highlighted alternative kiln fuels and low-carbon cement blends along with a commitment to continue investing in carbon capture systems despite the federal funding cuts.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/carbon-negative-building-material-WPI.png,N,,2025-12-07 09:58:03.729027

The investment in GFCL EV Products Limited marks a turning point for India’s ambitions to control its own EV supply chain rather than relying on imports from China and other nations.

The World Bank Group’s private-sector arm announced the deal on Dec. 5, targeting a new plant in Jolva, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The facility will produce critical lithium-ion battery components under one roof, including electrolyte salts, cathode materials and specialized binders that go into every electric vehicle battery.

This represents IFC’s first investment in a battery materials company in India, signaling confidence that the country can compete in the high-value chemistry that makes electric vehicles possible. For a nation racing to electrify its transportation sector, the deal couldn’t come at a better time.

What makes this facility different

Unlike typical manufacturing plants that focus on one component, GFCL EV’s facility will handle multiple stages of battery production in a single location. The plant will produce lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte salt, custom electrolyte formulations, lithium iron phosphate cathode materials and PVDF/PTFE binders. These materials together account for more than half the cost of a lithium iron phosphate battery cell.

The parent company, Gujarat Fluorochemicals Limited, already operates as one of India’s largest producers of fluoropolymers and specialty chemicals. With three manufacturing units in Gujarat and a captive fluorspar mine in Morocco, GFL brings decades of chemistry expertise to the battery materials business. The company deployed about 1,125 crore rupees (approximately $135 million) in capital expenditures during fiscal year 2024-25, with more than half dedicated to EV-related projects.

Racing to meet surging demand

India’s electric vehicle market is exploding. Industry forecasts show lithium battery demand will skyrocket from about 4 gigawatt-hours in 2023 to nearly 139 gigawatt-hours by 2035, driven primarily by compact passenger vehicles and small SUVs. The government’s Production Linked Incentive scheme for battery storage aims to create massive manufacturing capacity with an overall budget of 18,100 crore rupees (about $2.2 billion).

The challenge isn’t just building enough batteries but ensuring India isn’t simply assembling components made elsewhere. Cathode materials and electrolyte salts represent the highest import dependence, with China currently dominating global production. Industry estimates suggest cathode materials alone can account for 29% to 51% of a lithium-ion battery’s total price, depending on chemistry and metal prices.

Why IFC is betting big

The investment fits IFC’s broader strategy of backing projects that deliver climate benefits, create high-skill jobs and strengthen supply chain resilience. By supporting domestic battery materials production, IFC aims to reduce India’s dependence on imported components while enabling the country’s transition to electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

IFC has already invested heavily in India’s EV ecosystem, including a $20 million equity stake in Transvolt Mobility, its first global investment in an EV fleet platform. The organization has also supported two- and three-wheeler manufacturers, last-mile logistics operators and charging infrastructure providers. Moving upstream into battery materials represents the next logical step in building a complete domestic EV supply chain.

Navigating choppy waters

The investment comes during turbulent times for global battery markets. Lithium hydroxide prices have plummeted nearly 90% from their 2022 peaks, while battery pack prices fell about 20% in 2024 to a record low of $115 per kilowatt-hour. Overcapacity in global cathode and materials markets could squeeze profit margins and intensify competition from established players in China and South Korea.

Technology shifts also pose challenges. While GFCL EV focuses on lithium iron phosphate chemistry, which has become mainstream for mass-market EVs due to safety and cost advantages, automakers are exploring alternative chemistries including manganese-rich variants and even sodium-ion batteries. GFL’s expertise in fluorine-based materials across multiple battery types should provide some protection against single-chemistry risk.

A blueprint for Indian manufacturing

If successful, the GFCL EV facility could serve as a model for how traditional chemical companies can pivot into high-value energy transition materials. The project blends decades of process knowledge with emerging demand from the electric vehicle revolution. For India, owning the chemistry inside battery cells matters as much as assembling the cells themselves.

The partnership between a global development financier and an established Indian chemical manufacturer demonstrates that India’s battery story is moving beyond assembly plants toward the more strategic business of controlling critical materials. Whether this gamble pays off will depend on execution, market conditions and the country’s ability to compete with deeply entrenched Asian manufacturers who have spent years perfecting these processes.

Nuclear Energy: Korea in the U.S. SMR market On Aug. 25, shortly after President Lee Jae Myung took office, the first Korea-U.S. summit took place.
For these reasons, the United States sought support from foreign nations, and Korea was one country chosen to support the United States as their relationship improved.
As Seoul works to strengthen its longstanding alliance with Washington, Korea is encountering a new set of opportunities in the expanding U.S. nuclear energy sector.
Moreover, continued investment in nuclear energy contributes to national energy security and offers a low-carbon alternative that aligns with long-term environmental and climate goals.","The U.S. push to revive its nuclear industry is opening lucrative doors for Korean companies — and posing difficult questions for Seoul about how closely to align its economic and climate ambitions with Washington’s energy agenda.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s energy agenda to center energy supplies on projects like the nuclear power plants and the Alaska liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has created both opportunities for economic growth for Korea but also raised concerns over Korea’s dependency on U.S. priorities.

Trump’s firm determination for fossil fuels has been demonstrated time and time again, beginning from his infamous statement, “Drill, baby, drill,” during his inaugural address, and re-exemplified by the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris agreement in January 2025.

On Oct. 29, Korea and the United States finalized the logistics for tariff agreements in essential industries, easing tensions over trade and Korea’s role in the energy supply of the United States.

After the Korea-U.S. summit, Seoul's presidential aide, Kim Yong-beom, announced that the ""reciprocal"" tariffs will be reduced from 25 percent to 15 percent, signaling a shift in the two countries’ approach to trade and investment.

The finalized tariff negotiations offered preferential treatment for imported components critical to the energy supply of the United States, such as the nuclear and oil sectors, reflecting Trump's strategic focus on traditional energy sources. This agreement is due to the fact that the United States does not have the capability to independently develop its own full energy supply. Under this framework, Korea is gaining strategic and economic benefits by having increased exports with reduced tariffs, though questions remain about whether these advantages outweigh the financial support required by the United States.

Nuclear Energy: Korea in the U.S. SMR market

On Aug. 25, shortly after President Lee Jae Myung took office, the first Korea-U.S. summit took place.

In the Korea-U.S. Business Roundtable, Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy concluded 11 memorandums of understanding in five fields including shipbuilding, nuclear plants, airlines and LNG. The nuclear power plant factor is both a positive and a negative for Korea.

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Doosan Enerbility cooperated with X-Energy and Amazon Web Services on future planning for small modular reactor (SMR) design, construction, operation, supply chain development, investment and market expansion. With that, KHNP was incorporated into nuclear power plant and uranium enrichment plant construction in the United States.

After the Three Mile Island accident occurred outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1979, due to a lack of a proper cooling facility, the United States paused its insistence on the supply of skilled manpower, thus collapsing the nuclear industry environment. Civic concern about radioactive waste disposal and its high cost problem followed after multiple accidents.

For these reasons, the United States sought support from foreign nations, and Korea was one country chosen to support the United States as their relationship improved.

""This phenomenon implies how urgent the United States is in its recovery of the nuclear industry,” claimed Kim Ji-young from the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.

As Seoul works to strengthen its longstanding alliance with Washington, Korea is encountering a new set of opportunities in the expanding U.S. nuclear energy sector. Recent partnerships signal a broader opening for Korea to take part in the design, construction and supply chain development of SMRs.

The global SMR market is expected to grow substantially in the coming decades, supported by Korea’s 10th Electricity Plan, which targets six new reactors by 2033 and nuclear energy accounting for 34.6 percent of national electricity. Korea aims to increase nuclear generating capacity from 24.7 gigawatt-electrical in 2022 to 28.9 gigawatt electrical in 2030 and 31.7 gigawatt electrical in 2036, while also planning to export 10 nuclear units by 2030 and advance the development of Korean SMRs, according to the World Nuclear Association.

This expansion strengthens Korea’s economic position by enhancing its global role as a supplier of advanced nuclear components, supporting domestic industry growth, creating high-skilled jobs and promoting expertise in reactor construction, operation and supply chain development. Moreover, continued investment in nuclear energy contributes to national energy security and offers a low-carbon alternative that aligns with long-term environmental and climate goals.

But the benefits come with notable challenges.

Korea’s increased involvement in U.S. strategic-sector initiatives stems from a $350 billion investment package linked to the Korea-U.S. trade deal, which allocates $200 billion for U.S.-selected strategic industries, including advanced energy and nuclear technology, and $150 billion for shipbuilding cooperation, according to Reuters.

A Korean report noted, “Mid‑ to long‑term, critics warn that Korea’s nuclear ecosystem could be structurally subordinated to Westinghouse […] even for SMRs, Korea may have to submit to a U.S. firm’s technology verification.”

Some experts point out that while cooperation strengthens diplomatic ties, it may temporarily slow Korea’s ability to diversify its domestic energy innovation efforts.

Pressuring investment: In the pipeline of Trump’s ‘Alaska LNG’ project

Trump’s ambitious construction of an 800-mile-long pipeline in Alaska that encompasses regions from the North Slope to the Cook Inlet — a project known as Alaska LNG — is the ultimate fruit of his plans for the advancement of U.S. power in the energy industry.

Mike Dunleavy, the Republican governor of Alaska, describes the project as a “step in the right direction for Alaska and American energy dominance,” supporting Trump’s cancellation of the 2024 Rule on Alaska Petroleum Reserve on Nov. 23.

But who will enable his vision for U.S. oil industry expansion?

Trump is turning to Asian countries for the answer, with Korea as one of the prime sources for concentrated investment.

“We have the greatest amount of energy in the world and we're dealing with South Korea, as you know, in Alaska,” Trump declared at the Korea-U.S. summit on Aug. 25. “We're going to be making a deal, a joint venture with South Korea. Japan is also very strongly involved.""

Despite Trump’s confidence in Korea’s inclination to collaborate, no realistically operational discussion took place during the summit, according to chief presidential secretary Kim.

On this topic, Shin Hyun-don, a professor of the energy resources department at Inha University, concludes in hindsight that the contract between the United States and the Korea Gas Corp. (Kogas) signed in August was an effective means of circumventing seemingly compulsory Alaska investment, which can be highly risky considering its technical and economic uncertainty.

The long-term purchase contract requires Kogas to buy 3.3 million tons of U.S. LNG per year across a decade.

“The current government deserves a passing score as [the contract] created a valid justification to not participate in the Alaska LNG project,” Shin remarked.

Further regarding this settlement, optimists view this agreement in a commercially beneficial light in that while crude oil from the Middle East entails a 3 percent tariff, the agreement with the United States would be under the two nations' FTA, indicating duty-free shipments despite the relatively long distance.

“Crude oil from the United States is more economical depending on the circumstances,” an official said.

Yet, domestic industries are expressing concerns about the inevitability of a widespread reconstruction of oil facilities for the accommodation of U.S. crude oil in national factories, which would require a prodigious amount of funds — $2 billion to $3 billion worth of structure reformation to be exact, the Korea National Oil Corporation revealed.

This would be especially unfavorable considering Korea’s current economic state. The Lee government’s midterm financial plan is predicted to add up to more than 109 trillion won ($74 billion) in new debt each year, according to Park Sung-hoon, the chief spokesperson of the People Power Party.

The aftermath for the energy industry

“Both leaders welcome Korean investments in various sectors to advance economic and national security interests, including but not limited to shipbuilding, energy, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, and artificial intelligence/quantum computing,” said the White House after the Korea-U.S. summit, held prior to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Oct. 29, alluding for more potential interactions between the two countries in multiple sectors of the manufacturing industry.

Trump’s endeavor to develop the energy industry in the United States became apparent on May 23 after signing four executive orders to recalibrate the U.S. nuclear industry and discussing rapid cooperation on Alaska LNG supplying East Asian countries.

The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute claimed in July that the Trump administration's actions, such as signing executive orders on nuclear energy, are “desperate acts on rejuvenating the U.S. nuclear energy industry.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Christopher Allen Wright also said on Sept. 25 that the construction of LNG pipelines in Alaska will be “started within the next 12 months.”

Such a rapid execution to renovate and empower an industry was reflected in affairs with Korea.

In the first summit, private companies such as Trifigura and Total Energies were contracted for future exports of LNG to Korea, and companies like Centrus and Fermi America decided to cooperate on establishing a nuclear facility complex in Texas.

There was also an agreement between two defense-wise allied nations to approve the construction of nuclear-powered submarines operated by Korea.

Further collaborations in developing nonrenewable energy sources and applications brought a warning from the Embassy of China in Korea to “ exercise caution when proceeding [with introducing nuclear submarines].”

As the summit came to a conclusion and overall investment logistics were finalized, a variety of comments came from the Korean political sphere.

Democratic Party leader Jung Chung-rae said the overall investment was “the greatest negotiation and greatest achievement that will forever shine in the history of Korean diplomacy.”

The People Power Party claimed that the execution of the conference was only made “how the Americans wanted,” expressing criticism toward the terms.

The commerce industry expressed relief at the decision to disperse investment sectors, with the Peterson Institute for International Economics rating it as a “wise decision in minimizing foreign market instability” and the New York Times reviewing it as “overall less burdensome.”

The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions criticized the Korea-U.S. summit for the decision to accept investments to facilitate energy, goods and technology and exports to the United States, saying, “The burden will ultimately fall on workers and the public.”

With the final terms made for large-scale investments, it comes down to either a revival or rehabilitation of Korea-U.S. economic affairs and projects deemed prosperous for energy production under the Trump administration. With “Lee's strategy of flattery” clearly working, the BBC said, now Korea must wait to see whether or not the trick brings a beneficial impact.

The event, focused on sustainable transformation across Central and Eastern Europe, brought together stakeholders from business, government, academia, and civil society.

One of the central messages of the event was clear: Bulgaria needs a comprehensive, forward-looking national energy strategy that balances environmental targets with energy security, social impact, and industrial competitiveness.

“Time is of the essence,” said energy entrepreneur Hristo Kovachki, who participated in the roundtable discussion titled “Bulgaria’s New Energy Strategy.” “Drafting a clear strategy must not be delayed – but we need to approach it wisely, without dismantling our existing infrastructure prematurely.”

The Role of Coal and Alternative Fuels

With the EU pushing for deep decarbonization across its member states, many countries are facing tough decisions about the future of coal. Bulgaria, where coal continues to play a role in the energy mix, is under pressure to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy sources.

However, Kovachki pushed back against the idea of sudden coal plant closures, arguing that transitional fuels and new technologies must be integrated into the process. He pointed to biowaste and natural gas as viable alternatives.

“Bulgaria generates over 10 million tons of biowaste annually,” Kovachki noted. “This is a resource we can use sustainably, especially in power plants that are currently coal-dependent.”

He also described natural gas as the fuel of the transition, highlighting its flexibility and lower emissions compared to coal. According to Kovachki, such alternatives offer a more stable and realistic path toward reducing emissions without causing energy insecurity or economic disruption.

Institutional Support and Strategic Planning

A recurring theme in Kovachki’s comments was the need for state support, especially for private energy companies navigating the complexities of the energy transition. He emphasized that private operators cannot carry the burden of transition alone and called for government involvement in coordinating investments and regulatory reforms.

“The state should be more involved in ensuring a successful transition for its coal power plants, who still produce the majority of the country’s baseload power after NPP Kozloduy,” he said.

This point resonated with others at the forum, including Alexander Zagorov, secretary of the Podkrepa Labour Confederation, who warned that political pressure and unclear messaging around the future of coal were hindering constructive dialogue between businesses and trade unions.

“The attacks on the coal industry are making meaningful engagement very difficult,” Zagorov said. “With the right strategy, we can avoid conflict and work together.”

EU Ambitions and Local Realities

Panelists agreed that while the EU’s decarbonization targets are important, translating them into local policy will require careful adaptation to Bulgaria’s specific economic and social context. Professor Hristo Vasilev, an energy expert, summarized the panel’s sentiment by urging cross-sectoral cooperation.

“Capable people from various sectors must come together to lead Bulgaria’s energy sector toward decarbonization, while minimizing the social impact,” he said.

The forum also highlighted Bulgaria’s critical energy infrastructure and potential for innovation. Kovachki’s previously stated views on extracting rare earth elements from coal and mining byproducts – an idea supported by several international experts – fit within the EU’s broader push for strategic resource independence and circular economy practices.

Next Steps: From Dialogue to Policy

The event concluded with a shared sense that Bulgaria must move from discussion to action. Representatives from Bulgartransgaz, the Electricity System Operator, and other institutions echoed the need for a unified national plan that can attract investment, maintain energy reliability, and guide decarbonization efforts.

As the country continues to modernize its energy sector under the European Green Deal framework, the formulation of a balanced, data-driven, and inclusive national energy strategy remains a top priority.

The success of Bulgaria’s green transition, participants agreed, will depend not only on technology or funding – but on cooperation across political, business, and social lines.",https://www.eyeonannapolis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-11-e1764958076224.jpeg,N,,2025-12-07 05:59:48.429167

A litany of energy companies around the world has, in recent months, expressed new ambitions to expand production across the entire midstream sector, marking a new era of possibilities as the new year approaches. One such company that has ambitious projects ready for the new year is Targa Resources. The firm recently announced the plan to construct what will become its flagship “Speedway” pipeline, connecting its Permian Basin operations to a facility in Mont Belvieu.

Targa to expand its Permian pipeline, as well as new gas and NGL facilities

Targa Resources, one of the largest energy operators in the United States, recently announced an astonishing plan to build a new 500-mile ‘Speedway’ pipeline that will connect the company’s substantial operations in the Permian Basin to a gas and NGL processing facility in Mont Belvieu. The company has also expressed its intention to build a new gas processing plant that will continue to serve its US customer base.

The Permian Basin has become the backbone of the American gas and oil sector, attracting some of the largest and most profitable energy companies in the world, while keeping a close eye on any new potential customers aiming to cash in on the boom of natural energy resources production in the United States. This new expansion development plan comes amid calls by the international energy community to diversify domestic and regional energy production.

The US energy boom has been led by a new directive set in motion by Donald Trump

The US energy market has seen substantial increases in natural energy resources such as gas and oil, led by the ever-enigmatic Donald Trump. Trump announced on his first day in office for his second term that he would institute new measures to revive the oil and gas sector in the US, following a wave of renewable energy permitting under the previous administration.

Targa’s new ‘Speedway’ pipeline will become the belle of the US energy ball

Targa recently announced its plan to construct a ‘Speedway’ Pipeline that will span approximately 500 miles from its Permian basin operations all the way down to its processing facility in Texas. The new 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids pipeline will transport NGLs from Targa’s existing assets in the Permian and any potential future plant additions to its fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas.

The new 30-inch diameter pipeline and associated infrastructure will build on the company’s already impressive energy operations in the United States. With construction underway, Targa has stated it expects the Speedway pipeline to be fully operational by 2027 at an estimated cost of roughly $1.6 billion. To accommodate an expected growth of operations in the near future, Targa will also move forward with the construction of its Yeti plant.

The Yeti plant will be a 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing facility, marking the continued growth of the Permian operations and the US energy market overall. The Permian has seen several exceedingly large energy companies outline pipeline expansion plans in recent months.

The US energy market is set to welcome the new year in style and abundance

The opulence of the American revival of its energy sector has been a sight to behold. As new and pioneering projects are being planned, the US energy sector has not looked this promising for a very long time indeed. Take, for example, the plan recently unveiled by Transwestern Pipeline to open a bidding season for Energy Transfer’s Desert Southwest expansion. If the current expansion of the American energy market continues, the world will have no choice but to turn to the US to meet any increases in energy demand.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_1845607_XL-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:57:39.784244

V Environmental Protection Agency: Implications for Public Health Policy and Practice.” Public Health Reports, vol.","Since assuming office, the Trump Administration has made it blatantly clear that expediting the extraction and deployment of fossil fuels through legal measures is one of their priorities. On his Inauguration Day, Trump delivered EO 14154 Unleashing American Energy to redirect domestic energy development exclusively towards the oil and gas industry. Since then, he has pursued a hostile reversal of policies outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act. In May of 2025, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed complaints against the states of New York and Vermont over their climate superfund laws and preemptively sued Michigan and Hawaii to prevent them from taking legal measures against oil companies. [1, 2] These states have cited tort laws, which allow parties to remedy their injuries through lawsuits, to recover damages associated with climate change. Tort-based claims are similarly found in three dozen other pending lawsuits in which state and local governments have sued major fossil fuel companies for inflicting harm upon people or property. [3] The DOJ, however, alleges that the Clean Air Act, a federal law that regulates air emissions, preempts state efforts to address and mitigate climate change. Citing Trump’s EO Protecting American Energy from State Overreach, the DOJ also argued that state-led energy regulation impinges on the executive branch’s foreign affairs powers. Other legal groups have sought long-term avenues to suppress climate cases. In a letter to the DOJ in June of 2025, 16 Republican state attorneys general requested that the administration enact protections for the fossil fuel industry modeled after a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from litigation when their guns are utilized for criminal purposes. [4]

If Big Oil is granted a legal shield, the courthouse doors would shut for Americans seeking accountability for the role corporations played in contributing to extreme weather damage. Such an action would establish a precedent of prioritizing corporate interests over community well-being and would shift the fiscal consequences of climate change onto taxpayers. Additionally, fossil fuel immunity claims should be considered illegitimate attempts to constitutionalize an economic interest and violate states’ regulatory power to impose environmental standards. Previous environmental cases have substantiated the lack of federal prerogative and accountability in climate action, and precedent has determined states’ constitutional power to enshrine environmental rights.

States that have filed lawsuits against energy and fossil fuel companies usually follow a consistent pattern of citing violations of state tort law, signifying their proper venue in state and local courts, and undermining the soundness of federal measures that intervene in fossil fuel regulation. In County of San Mateo v. Chevron Corp., the Ninth Circuit affirmed a district order remanding to state court claims brought by California local governments against fossil fuel companies, finding that “the companies did not establish prerequisites for the Grable exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule for cases that raise a substantial federal issue.” [5] The Ninth Circuit held that such cases were not subject to federal jurisdiction because they did not raise concerns relevant to federal law. Furthermore, the Ninth Circuit held that “the Clean Air Act did not completely preempt the plaintiffs’ state-law claims” and that the plaintiffs’ injuries were considered “too attenuated and remote” to be governed by federal law applicable to federal enclaves. [6] The plaintiffs' complaints remained a state law complaint on the grounds that the Clean Air Act (CAA) fails to address all claims related to air pollution.

The decision on the Clean Air Act’s preemption power is particularly notable, as current lawsuits pursued by the DOJ call upon the CAA to prove state climate action inessential. Additionally, the court panel rejected the energy companies’ argument that the plaintiffs’ claims should be heard in federal court under 28 U.S. Code § 1331, also known as the federal question jurisdiction, simply because the alleged harm happened on federal land under exclusive federal control. The general federal question jurisdictional statute grants federal district courts original subject matter jurisdiction over ""all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.” [7] In this instance, the federal government’s tangential stake in the case — having dominion over the land in which the violations occurred — proved insufficient in employing this statute. Such a determination demonstrates that fossil fuel infrastructure operated on federal land is not exempt from civil liability, and even more so, that the harms these facilities produce can still be cited under state law.

Corporations, like Chevron, host a portion of their oil extraction operations on federal land, and thus, it is notable that while operating in these areas, no immunity is being granted. Ultimately, the empirical favorability of state court climate litigation undermines the plausibility of federal directives on fossil fuel immunity. However, with the overruling of Chevron in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, redirecting the interpretation of federal statute from agencies to the court, the judicial system has assumed novel importance within the climate fight. Power has been further invested in the courts to issue sound rulings on environmental policy, subverting the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the federal government’s reliance on it to supplement state regulation. [8]

In cases where the EPA does have ruling authority, modern environmental jurisprudence increasingly recognizes the right of states and their sovereignty to hold federal agencies accountable for regulatory neglect in the face of environmental degradation. Although Massachusetts v. EPA is largely recognized for declaring greenhouse gases pollutants, the landmark ruling also reinforced states' legal standing to sue federal agencies over subpar environmental regulations. In this case, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that Massachusetts, due to its ""stake in protecting its quasi-sovereign interests"" as a state, had standing to sue the EPA over potential damage caused to its territory by global warming, along with the legal right to seek redress for agency inaction. [9] Massachusetts specifically cited injuries to its land and health, which paved the way for administrative recognition of environmental harms. The majority decision concluded that Massachusetts had a legal right to seek relief given that the Commonwealth met all three conditions: (1) a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, (2) the injury that is traceable to the act of the defendant (the EPA in this case), and (3) evidence that favorable action by the EPA would help repair the injury. [10]

In the wake of lawsuits against Big Oil, the question of whether judicial decisions can adequately ameliorate climate injuries has been contested. In May 2025, Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration challenging their executive orders that accelerate the deployment of fossil fuels in Lighthiser v. Trump. In October, a federal district court in Montana dismissed the case. According to the court, the plaintiffs were incapable of surmounting the ‘final, dispositive hurdle’ that the relief would be outside the court’s power to grant. The court acknowledged that the plaintiffs had proven sufficient injury, but argued that the issue of alleviating climate change was too broad and failed to meet the requirements of redressability. In Massachusetts v. EPA, the agency put forth a similar argument claiming that its power to regulate global climate change was insufficient to provide relief. Here, however, the majority reached a different conclusion than that of Montana’s federal district court. Majority leader Justice Stevens stated that ‘incremental agency action over time may produce cumulative effects and that for standing to be present, the state would not have to show that any single action would remedy its problems.” Stevens further argued that “the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gases would have a significant effect because of the enormous amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the U.S. transportation sector.” [11] Thus, the failure of Lighthiser v. Trump in seeking redress and holding fossil fuel companies accountable does not disprove the prospect of such action, as Massachusetts v. EPA validated the utility of regulatory standards in remedying climate injuries and proved that they can be traceable to an entity.

In holding fossil fuel companies accountable, the application of the Public Trust Doctrine (PTD) presents a potential avenue for asserting states’ role in environmental protection. The doctrine derives from the Roman ""jus publicum"" principle of common ownership of natural resources: “By the law of nature these things are common to mankind—the air, running water, the sea, and consequently the shores of the sea.” [12] In the U.S.’s recognition of the public trust doctrine, state governments rightfully serve as trustees of resources, though its application has traditionally been exclusive to that of waterways. The PTD has been constitutionalized by several states, including Hawaii, which enshrines that “all public natural resources are held in trust by the State for the benefit of the people” and explicitly defines resources to include “land, water, air, minerals, and energy sources.” [13] In Hawaii’s complaint against BP, Shell, and Exxon, the state alleges that it has a constitutional obligation to uphold this protection and cites eight causes of action in its complaint, among them negligence and “harm to public trust resources.” [14] Formerly employed to settle disputes over access to waterways, the doctrine has now imposed affirmative duties upon states to protect resources, as evidenced in various state constitutions. [15]

Similarly, Pennsylvania’s constitution guarantees a “right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment,” and provides that “as trustee of these resources, [Pennsylvania] shall conserve and maintain them for the benefit of all the people.” [16] As public-trust-based litigation becomes increasingly prevalent in state efforts to address climate change, courts must clarify their function. Hawaii’s invocation of its constitutionalized PTD in litigation against major oil companies emphasizes the doctrine’s contemporary expansion and undermines claims that fossil fuel entities enjoy protection from state-led environmental litigation.

Trump’s Executive Orders raise pressing concerns about the future of the fossil fuel industry and the extent of state autonomy in regulating and preserving these industries within their borders. Understanding how past legal actions have justified state countermeasures against federal expansion of fossil fuels is essential in today’s era of energy polarization. Efforts to immunize fossil fuel corporations place corporate interests above community well-being — a tension reflected in the growing incorporation of the public trust doctrine into state constitutions. This doctrine has been invoked in legal battles to defend states’ rights to safeguard their natural resources and land from oil and gas expansion. Moreover, climate cases are increasingly being remanded to state courts, underscoring the limits of federal authority in establishing doctrines that confer “rights” upon fossil fuel industries. The disparities between landmark cases such as Massachusetts v. EPA and Lighthiser v. Trump reveal that holding entities accountable for regulatory failures is possible, particularly when public health violations are at stake. As organizations and communities seek representation and redress for the harms caused by fossil fuels, these corporations must remain subject to rigorous public scrutiny and accountability.

Michigan Advance

EV sales are in the tank. So what happens next?

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe. ✂️

The takeaway is that, yes, this is a setback, but ICE cars are not going to win.

North Dakota Monitor

Natural gas operator fined for environmental violation at North Dakota reservation

The operator of natural gas production facilities on the Fort Berthold Reservation was ordered Friday to pay a $500,000 fine and do 500 hours of community service for an environmental violation.

Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty earlier this year in U.S. District Court in North Dakota to a violation of the Clean Air Act that affected the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation.

Targa, which operates six natural gas compressor stations on Fort Berthold, failed to install required hazardous air pollutant monitoring systems, federal prosecutors say in court records.

The violation occurred between 2018 and 2022 on the Johnson Compressor Station near Mandaree. Natural gas gathering pipelines include compressor stations that boost pressure before the gas reaches a natural gas processing plant.

The combustion engines on the compressor station produce hazardous air pollutants such as benzene and formaldehyde, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan O’Konek said during the plea hearing, according to a transcript.

The plea agreement indicates Targa self-reported the violation and promptly corrected it by installing monitoring equipment. The company has since taken steps to improve environmental compliance, federal prosecutors said. The attorney for Targa did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. ✂️

Included only because I’m a sucker for ND news. The issue was found and reported by the company itself. They are a repeat offender, but I’ll look at the positive that there is someone internally looking for issues. Hopefully, they’ll develop better internal processes to stop this from happening again.

Georgia hashes out plan to let data centers build their own clean energy

Big companies have spent years pushing Georgia to let them find and pay for new clean energy to add to the grid, in the hopes that they could then get data centers and other power-hungry facilities online faster.

Now, that concept is tantalizingly close to becoming a reality, with regulators, utility Georgia Power, and others hammering out the details of a program that could be finalized sometime next year. If approved, the framework could not only benefit companies but also reduce the need for a massive buildout of gas-fired plants that Georgia Power is planning to satiate the artificial intelligence boom.

Today, utilities are responsible for bringing the vast majority of new power projects online in the state. But over the past two years, the Clean Energy Buyers Association has negotiated to secure a commitment from Georgia Power that ​“will, for the first time, allow commercial and industrial customers to bring clean energy projects to the utility’s system,” said Katie Southworth, the deputy director for market and policy innovation in the South and Southeast at the trade group, which includes major hyperscalers like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. ✂️

Because it made me smile:

✂️ But as it stands, CEBA sees ​“the approved CIR framework as a meaningful step toward the ​‘bring-your-own clean energy’ model,” Southworth said — a model that goes by the catchy acronym BYONCE in clean-energy social media circles. ✂️

It looks like there are still technical kinks to iron out and not all regions of the country are managed in a way to easily facilitate this, but I like the idea.

Idaho Capital Sun

Idaho Congressman Fulcher introduces bill extending private, short-term health care coverage

Idaho Republican Congressman Russ Fulcher is hoping to expand the use of private, short-term health insurance.

Fulcher on Thursday announced the introduction of the Removing Insurance Gaps for Health Treatment (RIGHT) Act of 2025, which would extend the maximum allowance for short-term health plans from four months to up to three years.

Short-term, limited-duration insurance, known as STLDI, are private insurance plans designed to cover temporary gaps in health coverage. The plans are sometimes less expensive than plans offered through state health insurance marketplace plans, but do not always cover as many services and are not subject to the same consumer protection regulations as those compliant with the Affordable Care Act.

“Four months is far too short a limit, posing undue stress and uncertainty on Americans who would otherwise be left without coverage,” Fulcher said in a press release. “My bill, the RIGHT Act, expands STLDI plans to a full year, with the option to renew for up to three years. This is a practical, no-cost approach that offers families more choice, control, and flexibility to select the healthcare options that work best for them.” ✂️

He’s a U.S. rep. Couldn’t he just sign the discharge petition and extend ACA subsidies?

Maine Morning Star

Federal court rejects state effort to weaken agreement protecting disabled children’s rights

A federal court last week rejected a joint attempt by Maine and the U.S. Department of Justice to weaken a previous agreement that required the state to improve services so that children with disabilities no longer had to be separated from their families.

In a statement Friday, a coalition of rights organizations said the ruling “preserves essential protections that ensure children with behavioral-health needs will receive integrated, community-based services rather than face unnecessary institutionalization.”

The settlement agreement stemmed from a September 2024 lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice that alleged the state was failing to meet the needs of students that require behavioral health services and violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by separating them from their homes and communities by institutionalizing them or sending them to juvenile detention centers.

Two months later, the lawsuit was dismissed after the state agreed to implement a robust accountability system with reporting requirements, community outreach and the establishment of an independent watchdog, who would oversee data on state services. Under that initial agreement, the state committed to increasing the availability of community-based behavioral health services through the Maine Department of Health and Human Services so that children would no longer have to be separated from their families. ✂️

Once again, the courts step up to do the right thing.

Maryland Matters

Redistricting supporters outnumber opponents at Maryland meeting

Supporters of mid-decade redistricting in Maryland showed up in force for a virtual meeting of a state advisory commission Friday, calling on state leaders to redo congressional maps to oppose President Donald Trump (R).

It was the third hearing of the Governor’s Redistricting Advisory Commission and the third different outcome: Redistricting opponents dominated the first hearing and the second was nearly evenly split. Redistricting proponents dominated Friday’s meeting, thanks to a slew of climate and civil rights advocates, union leaders, a few retired federal employees and even a high school student.

Also joining the chorus was Bobby LaPin, the Maryland social media personality who has announced his intention to run against Senate President Bill Ferguson (D- Baltimore City), a commission member who opposes mid-cycle redistricting.

The commission will meet at least once more, on Dec. 12, to hear public comment.

The redistricting saga began with Trump urging Republican-led states to redistrict for partisan gain before the 2026 elections, to pick up GOP seats in Congress. Red states that have passed new maps so far include Texas, Missouri, Ohio and North Carolina. Democrats in California and Virginia have fired back with maps of their own. ✂️

Arizona’s Congresswoman Grijalva says she was pepper sprayed during Tucson ICE raid

Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was involved in a clash with federal agents during a protest of immigration raids in west Tucson Friday, during which she claims she was hit with pepper spray.

According to a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to carry out as many as 16 warrants in southern Arizona in a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations.” In videos posted to social media by community advocates, several masked federal agents in tactical gear can be seen near the westside location of popular Mexican seafood and grill restaurant Taco Giro.

The raids prompted a protest and federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray against the crowd. The Arizona Daily Star reported that multiple employees who live near the west Tucson restaurant were detained. At least one protester was among those taken into custody by federal agents. AZ Family reported that Taco Giro locations in north Tucson, Casa Grande and Vail were also targeted. ICE spokesman Fernando Burgos-Ortiz confirmed to the Arizona Mirror that multiple people were arrested, but didn’t clarify how many or confirm claims that agents had pepper-sprayed a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.

Tricia McLaughlin, the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, dismissed Grijalva’s account. McLaughlin accused Grijalva of hindering the work of federal agents and appeared to question Grijalva’s claim that she was pepper-sprayed by highlighting her lack of visible physical reaction in the video. ✂️

Oregon Capital Chronicle

Portland’s DA balked at charging federal agents under Oregon law. Then AG Rayfield stepped in

The top local prosecutor in the Portland area is cautioning against “unreasonable expectations” for his ability to charge federal agents using state law, after signing onto a statement last week warning the Trump administration that its officers could be held accountable for excessive force.

The district attorneys in Oregon’s three most populated counties and Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stood in unison last week when they signed onto a letter warning the Trump administration that they were monitoring reports of excessive force by federal agents with the goal of potentially bringing charges forward should the issue persist. Rayfield, alongside Multnomah County District Attorney Nathan Vasquez, Washington County District Attorney Kevin Barton and Clackamas County District Attorney John Wentworth, requested cooperation from the federal government in Oregon’s investigations.

The attorneys pointed to instances of disproportionate use of force through tear gas and nonlethal munitions by agents with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during protests outside the Portland waterfront Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility. They also referred to federal agents from an unmarked van in October holding teenagers at gunpoint by a Hillsboro Dutch Bros coffee stand and the November arrest of a 17-year-old U.S. citizen during his lunch off-grounds from McMinnville High School. ✂️

Events

1790 - The U.S. Congress moves from NY City to Philadelphia.

1825 - President Adams recommends establishing a national observatory.

1849 - Harriet Tubman makes her final escape from slavery.

1865 - Georgia ratifies the 13th Amendment and abolishes slavery.

WineRev:

1865 Washington DC The 13th Amendment to Constitution, abolishing slavery, had passed both branches of Congress back in January (the center of a fine movie ‘Lincoln’ starting Daniel Day Lewis). Now it needed to be ratified by ¾ of the states. Since the Lincoln Administration did not consider secession legal, legally those 11 Southern states were still part of the Union (so instead of needing 15 ratifications from the 20 states that remained loyal, the Amendment needed 25 out of the 31 total.) OTOH Lee surrendered back in April, Jeff Davis was arrested in May, there was no fighting going on, and in the various Southern states the Union Army is watching over the brand new and re-constituted state governments. (And former Confederates were not allowed to vote or be part of any elected office. If they got mad about this, they could complain to any armed Union soldier or officer on occupation duty in their town…..) On this day the government of Georgia ratifies the Amendment, making ¾, making it part of the Constitution.

1877 - Thomas Edison records voices for the first time at the offices of Scientific American.

1884 - The Washington Monument in D.C. is completed.

Will he tear it down or just rename it?

1922 - Power is transmitted over the first electric power line in NY.

1923 - President Coolidge becomes the first Presidential to address the country on the radio.

WineRev:

1923 Washington DC Marconi and Tesla had gotten the world signaling by radio at the turn of the century. In the fading days of World War I scientists and engineers figured out how to add voices, sounds, even music to the dots and dashes (Morse code) that had been used earlier. Transmitters went up and receivers were designed and sold. In 1920 KDKA in Pittsburgh became the first US commercial radio station to go on the air. Their first broadcast told of the results of the 1920

Presidential Election (Harding the winner.) In the summer of 1923 President Harding died in office and Calvin Coolidge became President.

On this day Mr. Coolidge became the first President ever to speak live on radioto a national audience from the White House.(They connected other stations by telephone lines to the same broadcast so it could be widely heard. They called the connection a ‘network’….a technical term worth remembering. 😊)

1933 - Judge John M. Woolsey rules that James Joyce's novel Ulysses is not obscene (United States v. One Book Called Ulysses).

1947 - The Everglades National Park (FL) is dedicated by President Truman.

WineRev:

1947Florida National Parks were invented by President Grant back in 1872 when he invented the world’s first one called ‘Yellowstone.’ Other mountains, seacoasts, canyons have been designated National Parks (and administered by the Park Service and the Dept. of the Interior.) On this day President Truman (shrewd enough to go to Florida in December!) dedicates a most unusual ecosystem as a protected National Park: The Everglades.

1961 - Ernie Davis becomes the first Black to win the Heisman Trophy.

St. Nicholas Day

St. Nicholas Day on December 6 celebrates of course carries some connection to Christmas and Santa Claus, but there is much more to this holiday and St. Nicholas than that. Although St. Nicholas partially inspired the Christmas and Santa Claus that we all know and love, St. Nicholas actually derives from a different kind of tale. Let’s learn about St. Nicholas and what this day is truly about.

WineRev:

343 (Three digit date!) Death date of Nicolas, Bishop of Myra (now Demre), Eastern Roman Empire (now Turkey) (The Church remembers saints on their death day, looking death in the eye and proclaiming “this one we will remember despite you, so the good they did will live on in memory and for inspiration.”)

Almost nothing known about Nicolas from surviving records; earliest mentions are from over 200 years later. Many miracles already attributed to him and he had a legendary for reputation for generosity and gift-giving (in secret; by tradition he left gifts for the poor in the middle of the night, and anonymously.)

Most famously remembered for rescuing three sisters from being sold into prostitution by dropping a bag of gold coins down their chimney on three consecutive nights so their father had a dowry for each of them and could marry them off. (Notice any parallels with some other guy: chimney…..gifts……coming by night? Some story pieces have been around a LONG time.) The real Good St. Nick!

To Quote Girsaol

Tomorrow is St. Nicholas’ Day, the patron saint of children who is not known for having anything to do with sardines.

St. Nicholas and I have something in common! I have nothing to do with sardines, either!

National Miners Day

Despite federal efforts to ensure safe working conditions for miners, they have one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs you can imagine. To recognize their efforts, Congress has declared December 6 National Miners Day. Why? Our entire economy depends on them. On this holiday, we should all take a moment to think about the many ways that miners play a role in our daily lives. Mined materials contribute to things like roads, houses, cars and computers. We wouldn’t be able to get much done without their hard work.

I applaud all of the work that miners have done for us.

===

NATIONAL GAZPACHO DAY

National Gazpacho Day, on December 6th, recognizes a flavorful soup that cooks serve cold. This typically tomato-based vegetable soup originated in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia. Gazpacho is widely consumed in Spanish cuisine, usually during the summer months.

I question the wisdom of making this day at a point of the year when many of us want soup served hot, but I’m not the “national day” Gazpacho.

===

Mitten Tree Day

On December 6th, Mitten Tree Day celebrates the gift of warmth. It’s a day to collect mittens, hang them on a Christmas tree, and then hand them out to those in need.

Those who live in cold climates understand the necessity of mittens. This winter clothing item is essential for keeping the hands warm while outdoors. Unfortunately, however, there are many children around the world who are without adequate winter clothing, which includes mittens.

It’s a national day I can get behind.

===

Put On Your Own Shoes Day

Sounds simple enough – and surely plenty of us do it every day, unless you really feel like braving the walk to work in your socks – but it seems this day might be more to do with shoes themselves and a way of encouraging children to put on and tie their own shoes.

Not just for children…

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-12-06 23:44:50+00:00,techxplore.com,Georgia Power says it needs a huge increase in power capacity to meet data center demand,Jeff Amy,,,,,https://techxplore.com/news/2025-12-georgia-power-huge-capacity-center.html,"Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.
80% of new capacity for data centers Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas.
The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers.
That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.
But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.","With data centers flooding into Georgia, utility regulators face a big decision: Should they let Georgia Power Co. spend more than $15 billion to increase its electricity capacity by 50% over the next six years to serve computer complexes? Or could the utility overbuild and stick other ratepayers with the bill?

It would be one of the biggest build-outs in the U.S. to meet the insatiable electricity demand from developers of artificial intelligence. The largest subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., Georgia Power said in testimony filed last month that the build-out will boost the state's economy and ""allow Georgia to contribute to the nation's focus on the global importance of artificial intelligence and the digital economy.""

""Given the number of companies interested in doing business in Georgia and the amount of customer load with signed contracts or in advanced discussions, it is important to continue moving forward with support for this great growth opportunity,"" company officials said in testimony.

But electricity bills have emerged as a potent political issue in Georgia and nationwide, with grassroots opposition to data centers partly based on fears that other customers will subsidize the power demands of technology behemoths.

""I think what's happening in Georgia is in some sense a perfect microcosm of what's happening nationwide,"" said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonprofit group that seeks to increase public involvement in utility regulation. ""You're seeing electricity demand grow at the fastest rate in decades, and you're seeing electricity prices rise at the fastest rate in decades.""

A growing political issue

Electricity costs were a key issue in last month's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, both data center hot spots. On Tuesday in North Carolina, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein cited concerns about data centers as one reason for opposing a 15% rate increase sought by Duke Energy for two utilities.

In Georgia, the five elected Republicans on the Public Service Commission will decide on Georgia Power's proposal weeks after voters delivered a stinging rebuke to GOP leadership, ousting two incumbent Republicans on the panel in favor of Democrats by overwhelming margins. Those two Democrats won in campaigns that centered on six Georgia Power rate increases commissioners have allowed in recent years, even though the company agreed to a three-year rate freeze in July.

After hearings next week, commissioners are scheduled to take a final vote Dec. 19. The two new Democrats won't take office until January and current commissioners denied a request by opponents to postpone the decision until then.

Brionte McCorkle of Georgia Conservation Voters, a group that advocates for carbon-free energy and supported the Democrats, fears the vote will be one last gift from the all-Republican commission to Georgia Power.

""It would be a slap in the face for the commission to rush through this proposal, and give the power company everything it wants,"" said McCorkle ""It's just not listening to what the people have said loud and clear.""

80% of new capacity for data centers

Georgia Power, with 2.8 million customers, projects the largest percentage increase in electricity demand over the next five years of any region but Texas. That's according to an analysis by power consultant Grid Strategies of forecasts filed with federal officials. The utility says it needs 10,000 megawatts of new capacity—enough to power 4 million Georgia homes—saying 80% of that would power data centers. That's in addition to the 3,000 megawatts the commission approved in 2024 after an unusual mid-cycle request by Georgia Power.

Whether the forecast is accurate and who will pay the bill if data center customers don't materialize is at the heart of the decision. Commissioners in January adopted rules meant to make sure data centers pay the costs of building new power plants and transmission lines they need. But if Georgia Power overbuilds and there are no data centers to pay, other customers could shoulder those costs.

""The whole argument is premised on the idea that if we get all these new customers, then we can take costs and spread it out over more people and therefore put downward pressure on prices,"" Hua said. ""Well, if you don't actually end up getting all those customers and you built all this new infrastructure, then you could see a scenario where you actually drive bills through the roof even more.""

The ultimate potential costs are unknown because Georgia Power's estimates are partially a trade secret that the company won't release. For example, the $15 billion price tag only covers construction costs for 80% of the current 10,000 megawatt request, and it doesn't include any of the borrowing costs, which customers must also pay. The price of the 3,000 megawatts approved in 2024 remains entirely secret. Because of the rate freeze, ultimate costs won't become clear until 2028, the next time commissioners set electricity rates.

Will customers pay?

Public Service Commission staff members who have analyzed the request say Georgia Power will need $3.4 billion a year in additional revenue by 2031, which could equal out to $20 a month for a residential customer. The company replied that such a claim is ""flatly incorrect.""

""These customers pay upfront the full costs of serving them, commit to long-term contracts, and provide financial guarantees,"" said spokesperson Matthew Kent. ""That means residential and small business customers are protected from cost increases tied to these projects.""

Staff members recommended that the commission allow Georgia Power to build capacity for new large customers only after they have signed contracts starting with 3,100 megawatts of capacity and up to 7,400 megawatts total for contracts signed by March 16. That recommendation would also allow the commission to avoid approving contracts for some new multibillion-dollar natural gas-fired power plants. Costs for such construction have risen sharply, partly because equipment manufacturers are having trouble meeting demand.

The company reacted sharply against that recommendation, saying ""it would significantly inhibit"" its ability to sign up new data centers, hurt economic development, and reduce the opportunity to lower rates.

The company and staff could negotiate a settlement before the Dec. 19 vote. McCorkle said any outcome should focus on protecting customers.

""What we don't want is a form of corporate welfare, where individual citizens are paying for the benefit of big mega corporations like Meta and Amazon,"" she said.

They create opportunities, attract investment, generate new high-quality jobs, and strengthen energy security, while consolidating Greece’s geostrategic position.
Indeed, energy security today is inseparable from national security.
Their presence enhances stability, confirms Greece’s credibility, and creates a broader shield of energy protection.
By investing in the hydrocarbons sector, Greece increases its energy security while remaining fully prepared.","“The emerging regional architecture of energy security, prosperity and stability runs through Greece,” Environment and Energy Minister Stavros Papastavrou said in an interview with Kathimerini during his recent trip to Washington.

He highlighted that the presence of two major American energy companies in Greece provides a broader shield of energy security. He also sent a clear message to Turkey. Unless it embraces the US-promoted model of cooperation – abandoning the casus belli and the “gray zones theory” – it will not be able to participate in this new regional framework.

In recent months, Greece has achieved a significant geostrategic upgrade through its energy agreements with the United States. How can this momentum be sustained or even strengthened?

The agreements signed in Athens in November offer undeniable, multifaceted benefits, economic, energy-related, and geostrategic. They create opportunities, attract investment, generate new high-quality jobs, and strengthen energy security, while consolidating Greece’s geostrategic position. To fully realize these gains, it is essential that the agreements are implemented immediately, with continuous engagement, commitment to the objectives, and strict adherence to timelines. The Vertical Corridor is already operational, allowing the supply of US LNG to Ukraine. Just a few days ago, my US counterpart and I established a working group tasked with implementing the strategic objectives of the Vertical Corridor; its first meeting is scheduled for December 10. These initiatives form part of a broader architecture that enhances Greece’s regional role. The Vertical Corridor – connecting some 100 million people – the 3+1 framework linking Greece, Cyprus, Israel and the US, and the IMEC corridor together aim to create a unified pathway for regional development and stability stretching from India to Ukraine. Greece sits at the heart of this chain, acting as a key hub where energy routes, infrastructure, pipelines, ports, rail and road networks intersect, shaping a new regional architecture.

This new regional architecture strongly reflects the Trump doctrine, which firmly links energy to national security. Does Athens feel more secure within this model?

Indeed, energy security today is inseparable from national security. By strengthening the former, Greece naturally bolsters the latter. The conclusion of the Chevron-Helleniq Energy agreement and the first offshore drilling in 40 years – planned by the ExxonMobil-Energean-Helleniq Energy consortium – mark a new era in which the world’s two largest publicly listed energy companies are actively operating on Greek territory. Their presence enhances stability, confirms Greece’s credibility, and creates a broader shield of energy protection. However, as important as this energy shield is, it cannot replace Greece’s responsibility to continuously strengthen its national deterrent capabilities and leverage emerging European defense supply chains, especially amid global upheavals and Turkey’s ongoing casus belli. By investing in the hydrocarbons sector, Greece increases its energy security while remaining fully prepared.

Since the US considers regional stability and reduced tensions crucial for the success of its energy companies’ projects, does this affect Greece’s approach to Turkey?

This new architecture can only thrive in an environment of stability, genuine cooperation and clear prospects. We want it to serve as a paradigm shift for the region – one that eliminates extremes and threats. It is therefore up to Turkey to follow this model of cooperation, leaving behind the casus belli and the “gray zones theory.” Otherwise, Turkey will be unable to participate in this new reality. This vision of regional development highlights the need for a positive, realistic agenda based on commercial cooperation and respect for international law. Our planning prioritizes synergies grounded in international commercial norms rather than tensions or zero-sum thinking. Moreover, in recent months, Greece- – without reacting to Turkey’s provocations – has advanced the institutionalization of maritime spatial planning and marine parks, as well as agreements with the Chevron-Helleniq Energy consortium for offshore blocks south of Crete and the Peloponnese, exercising its sovereign rights in the sector.

Since you mentioned the 3+1, how valuable was the recent meeting in Athens and what foundations has it set for the future?

The recent meeting – held for the first time at the ministerial level – was particularly successful, marking an upgrade of the format. Established in 2019 through the US East Med Act, the 3+1 mechanism includes funding for the creation of the Eastern Mediterranean Energy Center, a goal toward which we are working systematically. Such a permanent cooperation hub will enhance strategic dialogue, build expertise, and solidify the energy partnership among member-states. At the same time, the 3+1 can serve as the link between the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the Vertical Corridor, creating a unified architecture of energy security and development across the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The next 3+1 meeting is scheduled for April 2026 in Washington.

With regard to IMEC, can Greece be confident it has established its place if and when the corridor becomes a reality?

From the outset, Greece treated IMEC as a strategic opportunity and acted methodically to secure its participation, without adopting an adversarial approach toward other European countries. This approach was reinforced through careful government planning, successive meetings between Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – both in Athens in August 2023 and in India in February 2024 – and by promoting Greece as a key connectivity hub. Today, Greece has strengthened its role as an alternative gateway to the corridor. Combined with the Vertical Corridor and the 3+1, Greece is establishing its position in this emerging regional architecture.

Where does the electricity interconnection project stand? Sources in Washington suggest that if the three countries decide to break the deadlock, the US would provide support if needed.

As both the Greek prime minister and the president of Cyprus have announced, it has been decided to update the technical and financial data of the Greece-Cyprus electricity interconnection. During my visit to the US, interest in participating in the project was confirmed by American institutions – whether government-linked or purely private. For Greece, this project has never been purely economic. It carries strategic significance, ending Cyprus’s energy isolation and fitting within a broader vision connecting Greece, Cyprus, and Israel – and further linking Israel, the Arab world and India – transforming our geographic and energy links into a genuine corridor of stability and development.",https://www.ekathimerini.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Papastavrou-960x600.jpg?v=1765016606,N,,2025-12-07 05:59:58.927156

Now, Ford’s next EVs will be vastly different, as its CEO is clear about the future and believes adapting to the historic shift is the best way to survive. Discover what lies ahead for Ford in the future, and how it plans to adapt with its EVs.

Ford’s CEO is clear about the future

Several factors play a key role in choosing the type of car a person drives. In the U.S., being ‘carbon-conscious’ has become a significant trend, as thousands have embraced a greener lifestyle and thus, greener cars as well. While many may miss the great roar of an internal combustion engine (ICE), electric-powered vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular.

Beyond savings on fuel and maintenance costs, government incentives have also increased the popularity of EVs in the U.S. market. However, since the end of a particular tax credit incentive, what will the future hold for the EV market? While some may be uncertain, Ford’s CEO is clear about the future, and has even hinted that the next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift.’

Next EVs will be vastly different to adapt to the ‘historic shift’

The popular $7,500 tax credit incentive has been cut as a result of the Trump Administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The U.S. market saw a significant increase in the sales of EVs before the incentive came to an end, but what happens next?

According to Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, the EV industry will still be vibrant, but much smaller than they initially thought. At the Detroit conference, Farley stated that “partial electrification” cars, or rather hybrids, would be easier for customers to embrace, highlighting a ‘historic shift’. Farley continued that they learned their lesson the hard way by overestimating the EV market, adding:

“Customers are not interested in the $75,000 electric vehicle. They find them interesting. They’re fast, they’re efficient, you don’t go to the gas station, but they’re expensive.”

This is what the future of Ford may look like

Thanks to the federal reforms, all automakers, including Ford, will have to figure out what to do with their EV capacity and battery plants. According to Farley:

“We’re going to have to find a place; what we do with all the batter plants. And we’ll fill them. But it will be more stress because we had a four-year predictable policy. Now the policy changes. It means Ford, our construction companies, and we all have to make adjustments. And it’s going to be good for the country, I believe. But it will be one more stress on the supply side.”

For now, customers can most likely expect Ford to focus on EVs that will be much smaller and better suited to urban and suburban lifestyles with shorter commutes. Prices for these EVs will be lower, as their batteries will be significantly smaller. However, Farley added that hybrids, E-Revs, and EV plug-ins are the future (and Ford’s savior), as America is already “falling in love.”

Ford currently has few hybrid options to choose from. Currently, we can choose between the Maverick and the Escape when it comes to standard hybrids, with the Escape also available as a plug-in hybrid. However, the Escape production is coming to an end in 2026, meaning Ford’s only saviors will be the Maverick and the F-150. Only time will tell how soon Ford launches a new hybrid model. Perhaps Sweden’s new shocking hybrid model will serve as a source of inspiration in the future.

In late October, Hochul made it clear that she was having second thoughts about the building mandate, too.
They argued that under federal law, the state does not have the power to ban fossil fuel appliances.
They would need to convince the district court judge to block a law that was passed through the democratic process and that he himself had just upheld.
The plaintiffs argued that they would: Propane gas companies, for example, could lose much of their new business, and union plumbers and pipefitters could lose jobs.","When New York abruptly backed down this month from its plans to implement a nation-leading ban on gas in new buildings, some legal observers had questions. Lawmakers passed the All-Electric Buildings Act, which requires most new buildings to have only electric appliances, in 2023 as a step toward reducing pollution from the state’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and advancing New York’s legally mandated emissions targets. It was set to take effect in January.

Delaying the law’s implementation past then would cause the state “irreparable harm,” lawyers argued in an October 1 brief. They’d spent two years successfully defending the law against industry opponents.

But the law is now on hold — with the state’s signoff. After Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration agreed, a federal judge finalized a deal last week that will likely suspend New York’s gas ban for at least a year and potentially two or more.

The state’s sudden retreat came after a series of actions from Hochul this year walking back the state’s climate commitments: shelving a promised carbon pricing program and vowing to fight a court ruling to revive it; signing off on a thrice-rejected underwater gas pipeline after talks with President Donald Trump; and granting permits to a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining facility that regulators had long said violated the state’s climate law.

In late October, Hochul made it clear that she was having second thoughts about the building mandate, too.

“On the electric building issue, I’m looking for an all of the above approach,” she told reporters in Rochester at the time. “I’m going to look at this with a very realistic approach and do what I can, because my number one focus is affordability right now.”

Republicans and upstate Democrats had been pressuring Hochul to press pause on the electric buildings law, and industry opponents of the law were still trying to persuade a judge to block it, but the state was holding its ground in court. Then, on November 12, New York’s lawyers filed an agreement with the law’s opponents to delay implementation until four months after a federal appeals court and even the US Supreme Court weigh in. The judge’s signoff made it legally binding — notably, delaying enforcement until after next year’s gubernatorial election.

Hochul’s office is now framing the court deal as a pragmatic step that will help uphold the law in the long term.

“The Governor remains committed to the all-electric-buildings law and believes this action will help the State defend it, as well as reduce regulatory uncertainty for developers during this period of litigation,” said spokesperson Ken Lovett in a statement.

Some legal experts are skeptical.

“The state’s move, while it was done under the cover of litigation, was 100 percent a political move,” said Amy Turner, director of the Cities Climate Law Initiative at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.

If the governor had sought to put the electric buildings mandate on hold through executive action, climate groups almost certainly would have sued. With the court agreement, Turner said, “they found a way to do it that makes it seem like their hands were tied.”

Here’s a closer look at what New York argued in court in early October — and why its recent backtracking is raising eyebrows among some legal observers.

1. Plaintiffs would need to meet a really high legal bar to put the law on hold.

The saga started when a coalition of gas and construction industry interests, including building trades unions, sued New York state in the federal Northern District over the freshly passed electric buildings law in 2023. They argued that under federal law, the state does not have the power to ban fossil fuel appliances.

Judge Glenn Suddaby ruled in favor of the state this July and dismissed the case, but the plaintiffs went back to him in September, pleading for him to suspend the law anyway while they appealed the ruling. They argued that they had a strong case, citing a federal appeals court in California that had overturned Berkeley’s first-in-the-nation gas ban on the basis of the same federal law.

It was not unusual for the New York plaintiffs to seek such an injunction, said Daniel Carpenter-Gold, an attorney at the Public Health Law Center who has been tracking the case. “But it’s also very difficult to win,” he said.

In their October 1 brief, New York’s lawyers stressed just how high of a bar the plaintiffs would have to meet to secure an injunction at this stage — particularly since it was the first time in the two-year case that they’d asked the judge to take such a step.

They would need to convince the district court judge to block a law that was passed through the democratic process and that he himself had just upheld. To do so, they would need to show both that they had a good chance of winning at the appellate level, and that they would face “irreparable harm” if the law were allowed to proceed.

“Plaintiffs fail to satisfy any of these requirements,” the state’s lawyers argued.

2. New York state couldn’t block the law even if it wanted to.

The state went a step further in its October 1 filing, arguing that it couldn’t suspend the law even if it wanted to. The Code Council had already finalized the new building code, the culmination of a lengthy process that takes place every five years and is meant to take into account new laws like the All-Electric Buildings Act that are passed in the interim.

Once the new code is published, it’s up to local code enforcement officials — not the state — to enforce it. In other words, New York’s lawyers argued, it was too late for a court to force the state to block it.

3. Delaying implementation would cause the state “irreparable harm.”

The final issue at stake in the recent court exchange was which side would suffer “irreparable harm” if their opponents prevailed. The plaintiffs argued that they would: Propane gas companies, for example, could lose much of their new business, and union plumbers and pipefitters could lose jobs.

The state countered that it would, because new fossil fuel buildings constructed while the law is on hold would last for decades to come, irreversibly setting back the state’s efforts to meet its legally binding climate targets.

As the political battle over building electrification heated up in early November, there was no sign that Judge Suddaby was wavering on his decision.

On November 3, the plaintiffs said they would move the case to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals if he didn’t file an injunction within a week. He didn’t.

“The state has a strong case,” said Carpenter-Gold, of the Public Health Law Center. There was “nothing that I could see that would have indicated that their position had weakened in any way,” he said. So he was surprised when New York’s lawyers suddenly conceded the plaintiffs’ demand.

The deal suspends the law for at least a year: until the appeals court rules on it, which could easily take six months; while the plaintiffs potentially appeal to the US Supreme Court, which could add several months more, even if the high court declines to take up the case; and for another four months either way.

Climate hawks are furious at the Hochul administration’s decision. After it was first reported, lawmakers and advocates lined up to demand that the governor reverse course. That would be hard for her to do. Now that the judge has signed off on the November 12 deal, the state is under court order to keep the law on ice. The New York Department of State issued a notice late last week that the all-electric section of the building code is on pause.

It’s not yet clear whether the notice fully satisfies the court order, or whether the code council will take further action to codify the delay. Climate advocates are planning to rally outside its next meeting, on December 5, either way.",https://i0.wp.com/www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electric-Buildings.webp?fit=1640%2C1092&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-06 17:59:50.711969

An estimated 9.2 million lead service lines currently deliver drinking water to homes, businesses, schools, and unsuspecting citizens throughout the United States. Lead water lines pose an extremely high public safety issue. This has been a known fact for many years, and concern was raised again recently when the U.S. EPA released data showing that approximately 9.2 million water lines still need to be replaced.

There has been an abundance of funding available for cities and counties to address this public health issue, so it is disheartening to realize that millions of lead water lines are still delivering water to citizens.

The federal government allocated $15 billion in funding in 2021 to address lead pipe water issues. And recently, the Environmental Defense Fund announced that more than 250 utilities have active lead-service-line replacement programs underway. While progress is being made, questions remain about why more public entities are moving slowly and how long the federal funding support will remain in place.

Since the funding framework for supporting water projects, specifically lead water pipe replacement projects, is currently under review, several states are aggressively urging the Trump Administration to continue the financial funding support for projects to mitigate this public safety issue.

In the meantime, many upcoming lead water line replacement projects will be launched in 2025. These will be large and critically important initiatives. The following future contracting opportunities are examples of what can be expected in 2026.

City leaders in Detroit, Michigan, will soon launch a $140 million project for a large-scale and citywide water infrastructure improvement initiative as aging water mains lead service lines are replaced. The project’s scope will include two primary water main replacement packages covering more than 25 miles of distribution pipelines. It will also include five dedicated lead service line replacement projects to remove and replace thousands of residential service connections from the water main. The work will include street restoration, new valves and hydrants, and system pressure improvements to enhance long-term performance. Approximately $20 million has been allocated for each component of work. Construction is expected to begin in July 2026 and continue until July 2028.

Officials at the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) will launch a $114 million systemwide initiative designed to identify and replace lead service lines across its regional water network. The multi-year program will begin with an extensive inventory and field inspection process to locate and classify the materials used for more than 600,000 customer service lines. As strange as it may sound, more than half of the lines are made of unknown materials. The total number of lines to be replaced will be determined by inventory findings, but projections are that thousands of lead or unknown material service connections will require replacements.

Current estimates indicate that the inspection and data collection efforts will continue through 2026, with design and early engineering to ramp up in late 2026 and possibly continue into early 2027. Construction procurements will begin as soon as possible after all other phases are completed.

New York City's lead service line replacement program will launch with a $72 million city-led expansion that will initially target specific neighborhoods in the Bronx before moving on to the Queens and Brooklyn areas. The program, announced in October 2025 and partially funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will standardize design, outreach, and compliance across boroughs while expediting the replacement of lead service lines for public health protections.

Some noteworthy components of this work will include uniform design packages, resident outreach programs, coordination of utility and street restoration work, block-by-block mapping, and an inventory of service line materials. Delivery will occur in phases over several years. Currently, the project is in the design stage and construction solicitation documents will be released as design standards and packaging are finalized in 2026. Phased neighborhood work packages will be released beginning in 2026, and more bidding opportunities will follow.

City leaders in Shorewood, Wisconsin, will also launch a project to replace lead infested service lines and aging water mains at a cost of approximately $44 million. The village’s goal is to eliminate all public and private sector lead service lines, but that will take many years. This initial effort will kick start the program. The capital investment that was required to support this water infrastructure project comes from local, state, and federal sources, including an allocation from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Shorewood maintains more than 30 miles of water main lines, and most were installed before 1940. Officials estimate that more than 90% of homes are connected by lead service lines. All the new replacement lines will be copper. Design work is underway, and the selection of a contracting firm will precede the planned construction which is slated to begin in 2026. Three additional similar phases of work are scheduled for 2027 when 160 lead service lines and two water mains are ready for updating.

As America enters 2026, the nation stands at a crossroads: the scale of the remaining work is enormous, but the momentum appears to be very strong. With federal funding under review and many states pushing for continued support, the next few years will determine whether the country can finally eliminate this long-recognized hazard. What is clear is that every mile of pipe replaced represents a step toward safer communities, healthier families, and a modernized water system in America worthy of public trust.",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/135e576e/135e576e-98f5-4435-b33c-0aaf00dbf16d/leadpipeinground_getty_2211014580.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 00:57:36.182079

The mobile battery energy storage system, known as MBESS, is a potential replacement for use of portable diesel generators.
“Advancing energy storage technology is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition,” said New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll.
The mobile energy storage system being investigated, Viridi’s RSP150, is an 8.5-foot trailer-mounted, lithium-ion unit that can provide 30kW of power for approximately five hours.
“This mobile battery storage system demonstration and collaboration offers a better understanding of this emerging technology and its potential impact in real-world conditions,” said Haresh Kamath, director of energy storage and cross-cutting technologies at EPRI.","The New York Power Authority (NYPA) is collaborating with Cornell University and the Electric Power Research Institute to demonstrate use of a quieter and no-emission mobile battery to power campus events.

The mobile battery energy storage system, known as MBESS, is a potential replacement for use of portable diesel generators.

""Use of new technologies like the MBESS unit is evidence of New York’s commitment to transition to a clean energy economy and to pursue new energy storage options that will help strengthen the state’s electric system, ensuring its reliability and resilience,"" NYPA said.

“Advancing energy storage technology is essential to accelerating the clean energy transition,” said New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll. “The success of the new mobile battery storage system at Cornell highlights NYPA’s commitment to innovation and to piloting new technologies that can be scaled to drive New York’s energy future.”

The newly designed MBESS unit debuted in November at Cornell’s Ithaca campus to validate the system’s ability to provide temporary power during various large outdoor events.

The unit will be evaluated for its contribution to energy resilience and emergency response efforts. Cornell used the MBESS system Nov. 20 at the “Charging Forward: Cornell’s Mobile Battery Demonstration.”

Mobile battery energy storage systems have emerged in recent years as a versatile option to provide a clean and quiet alternative to portable diesel fuel generation power at off-grid locations. Unlike stationary storage systems, MBESS can be deployed to remote or temporary sites, providing temporary power under various applications such as grid support, emergency backup, and remote power supply.

Cornell’s system, manufactured by Viridi, employs Viridi’s proprietary lithium-ion battery technology, reducing potential fire risk, and is being explored as a quieter option, a flexible emergency power source, and a new standard for providing on-site power at locations where power is limited or non-existent.

For Cornell, this project builds on the university’s long-standing commitment to sustainability and carbon neutrality. The mobile battery will contribute to Cornell’s living laboratory for sustainable innovation, which seeks to simultaneously improve university facilities while demonstrating scalable sustainability solutions for the general public.

“Cornell is proud to collaborate with NYPA and EPRI on this exciting demonstration of mobile battery energy storage,” said Juliet Parsons, associate director of Operations and Logistics at Cornell University. “The MBESS project supports Cornell’s campus-wide commitment to carbon neutrality while offering a cleaner, quieter, and more efficient power solution for major events like commencement, reunion, and other campus-wide gatherings. By reducing our reliance on diesel generators, we’re improving both the sustainability and quality of event support, while also contributing to the university’s role as a living laboratory for scalable clean energy innovation.”

When not in use, Cornell’s MBESS will be parked at a charging center where it is connected to the grid. When the MBESS is required to provide temporary power to an event or during an emergency, it is disconnected from the grid and transported to a site where it can be used as standalone power source for up to five hours.

This transportable characteristic is particularly valuable during an emergency event such as a storm where quick response and adaptability are crucial, NYPA noted.

The MBESS will be used to provide power during outdoor campus events such as convocation, graduation, reunion and homecoming. The unit could generate power to light up large tents, give catering trucks a place to plug in, power an inflatable large screen at movie nights, amongst other activities.

The MBESS will avoid the need for polluting generators that normally would have to be gassed up several times during the run of outdoor events.

The mobile energy storage system being investigated, Viridi’s RSP150, is an 8.5-foot trailer-mounted, lithium-ion unit that can provide 30kW of power for approximately five hours. The unit will be deployed to various sites as needed, primarily for large-scale events that require reliable power without sole reliance on portable diesel generators.

NYPA funded the project and engaged Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and the Facilities and Campus Services Office to host the demonstration and oversaw the installation of charging infrastructure and site acceptance testing.

Under the research and development project, NYPA and EPRI researchers will document the process and procedures of acquiring and deploying the MBESS to expand the industry’s understanding of the technology’s readiness and characteristics.

Cornell faculty and students will examine how the technology can help reduce the environmental footprint of large universities in a cost-effective manner. Advancing MBESS has the potential to provide societal benefit by increasing the flexibility, reliability and resiliency of clean energy use.

“This mobile battery storage system demonstration and collaboration offers a better understanding of this emerging technology and its potential impact in real-world conditions,” said Haresh Kamath, director of energy storage and cross-cutting technologies at EPRI. “The insights gained here can help inform broader industry adoption of flexible technologies, supporting a more reliable and resilient energy future.”

Business cycles are inevitable, but the U.S. economy has a structural framework conducive to long-term expansion.","In the wake of tariffs, immigration crackdowns, geopolitical disruptions, and heightened uncertainty, the pace of U.S. job growth has slowed significantly in recent months and has been trending at a pace well below historical patterns. In addition, performance across industries has recently been notably uneven. While current challenges are clearly affecting near-term expansion, looking out over a few decades, we are still seeing signs of solid potential.

One factor influencing U.S. growth at present is the performance of other countries. Leading global economic analysts are generally projecting moderate growth over the next few years, which is a welcomed signal. However, significant downside risks could affect not only the immediate situation, but also the long-term outlook. One factor which could reduce future gains is the potential for decreased supply chain efficiencies, whether from trade tensions due to policy decisions or ongoing international conflicts.

Another concern is the high cost of energy, which is curtailing growth (as well as quality of life) in numerous countries. Prices are negatively affecting expansion in Europe and other areas, and overall inflation remains an issue. While comparatively low energy prices in the U.S. are making manufactured goods more competitive abroad, there are offsetting downside risks arising from stagnant conditions in other major economies. Fiscal challenges are also increasingly problematic, with many countries facing difficult decisions related to rising debt service, growing entitlements (such as pensions for aging populations), and pressing infrastructure requirements.

Simultaneously, there is potential for technology (especially AI) to reshape international patterns by reducing costs, opening markets, and enabling smaller players. However, optimizing these benefits depends on, among other things, efforts to assure access for emerging countries and stable and predictable trade rules.

Over the long-term horizon, the effects of underlying demographic patterns will further affect overall prospects. As with many nations, U.S. birthrates are falling significantly, and virtually all population gains stem from in-migration. AI is potentially a major factor in dealing with the lack of growth in the numbers of people in prime working age ranges (at least temporarily), but for many essential occupations, hands-on work is essential. The need for sensible immigration policies is clear, as is the need for efforts to encourage labor force participation and productivity.

Even with the current challenges, our analysis of the outlook for the U.S. economy indicates moderate growth, with real gross domestic product expanding at a 2.48% annual rate and a gain of some 79.6 million jobs over the next 30 years. The pace will depend in part on how effectively current issues are dealt with, but the fundamental structure of the national economy remains sound.

Climate change is any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer.

There are a wide variety of factors that influence climate change. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, some of them include reflectivity of the sun’s energy, changes in the earth’s orbit and rotation, volcanic activity, and greenhouse gas emissions.

What Are Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions?

View the City of Lakewood's annual GHG reports.

Greenhouse gases (GHG) in our atmosphere absorb radiant energy from the sun causing the atmosphere to warm and making it suitable for life. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, add more greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane to the atmosphere. This enhances the greenhouse effect, trapping more heat and causing global temperatures to rise.

Image Description:

Solar energy travels to the Earth at sunlight.

Sunlight hits the Earth and is absorbed, heating the planet.

GHGs in the atmosphere prevent some of the heat from escaping, warming the Earth over time. Continued use of fossil fuels increases the Greenhouse Effect to dangerous levels.

Beginning with the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s, human civilization has increasingly emitted CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere. Current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased by 40% from historic levels, corresponding to rising global temperatures. Since 1880, the global annual average temperature has increased by 1.8°F, according to data from the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC). Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Consensus from the world's leading climate scientists estimate that temperatures will increase between 6.7 and 8.4°F by the end of the century. GHG emissions increase and changes to the climate carry the risks of severe and sometimes irreversible impacts to our natural and human systems. In Lakewood, drought, reduced snowpack, strained water supply, disaster recovery costs and other impacts are already influencing municipal operations and household economies.

Tracking GHG Emissions

Lakewood Community Sustainability, Climate, and Zero Waste division works to do our part in reducing GHG emissions and adapting to a changing climate system in order to ensure a resilient future. We measure communitywide emissions through GHG emission inventories. These help us understand where emissions come from and what might be driving their growth is the first step toward reducing our contribution to global GHG emissions.

Lakewood annually reports its GHG emissions and efforts to reduce emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In 2018, Lakewood joined 43 other cities around the world on the CDP Cities A List, for its leadership in environmental action.

A similar study by conservation group Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.
When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted.
Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.
But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.","This story was originally published by ProPublica and co-published with High Country News.

Once every 10 years, ranchers must renew the permits that allow their cattle, sheep and other livestock to graze on the West’s public domain. These renewals are the government’s best opportunity to address how those livestock are harming the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, the federal agencies that manage the majority of public lands, are required by law to review each permit before deciding whether to place additional conditions on it or — in rare cases — to deny its renewal.

But in 2014, Congress mandated that the agencies automatically renew permits for another decade if they are unable to complete the reviews. This exemption has dramatically reduced scrutiny of grazing’s impact on public lands.

In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, a ProPublica and High Country News analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about another 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review, the analysis found.

A similar study by conservation group Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

This diminishing oversight has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of federal staff who complete the reviews. These staffers also conduct land health assessments of large parcels to help inform whether permits in the area need changes to protect natural resources.

The BLM’s rangeland management staff shrank 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data. President Donald Trump’s administration is further hamstringing the BLM — about 1 in 10 rangeland staff members left the agency between last November’s election and June, according to agency records.

When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted. Such overgrazing can spread invasive plants by dispersing seeds and disturbing the soil, pushing out native species and worsening wildfire risk. When herds strip vegetation near creeks and streams, silt flows into the waterways, wiping out fish nurseries. And, without adequate staff to amend permits, agencies lose the chance to reduce the number of animals on an allotment — and the climate-warming methane they emit.

Once a permit is renewed, with or without a review, it becomes more difficult to rectify such harms for another decade.

Ten current and former BLM rangeland management employees said in interviews that they felt pressure to go easy on ranchers. This included downplaying environmental harm in permit reviews and land health assessments, according to BLM staffers who worked in rangeland management. Several spoke on condition of anonymity because they still work for the government.

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth,” one BLM employee said of agency oversight.

In a statement, an agency spokesperson said, “The BLM is committed to transparency, sound science, and public participation as it administers grazing permits and considers updates to grazing regulations.”

In a shift, the Trump administration placed the approval process for all the BLM’s contracts and agreements of value in the hands of political appointees rather than career civil servants. In recent months, officials cut funding for an app that assists ranchers in collecting soil and vegetation data for use in permitting, for contractors who manage the data that informs grazing permits, for New Mexico farmers growing seeds used in restoration projects and for soil research in the Southwest, according to BLM records obtained by ProPublica and High Country News.

“Does not believe this action is needed to meet the administration priorities,” the cancellations read.

The Forest Service did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Ranching is often a multi-generation practice that serves to keep working landscapes intact, while also preserving open space, and benefiting recreation, wildlife, and watersheds.”

To gauge the effects of this shrinking oversight, ProPublica and High Country News toured parcels of federal grazing land, called allotments, in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada, finding evidence of either unpermitted grazing or habitat degraded by livestock in each state. In Arizona alone, reporters witnessed such issues in two national conservation areas, a national monument and a national forest.

On an allotment within Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, an expanse of desert grasslands and forested streams southeast of Tucson, the BLM lets up to 1,500 head of cattle graze across roughly 35,000 acres. These permits were recently reauthorized until 2035 using the exemption that allows environmental reviews to be skipped.

During a visit in late April, a grove of hearty cottonwoods stood against the afternoon sun, casting cool shadows over a narrow creek. This stretch of green sustains birds, frogs, snakes and ocelots. It’s also designated under federal law as critical habitat for five threatened or endangered species. Cattle are not allowed in the creekbed, but a thin barbed-wire fence meant to stop the animals lay crumpled in the dirt.

A native leopard frog broke the hot afternoon stillness as it leapt from the creek’s bank. Its launching pad was the hardened mud imprint of a cow hoof, and it landed with a plop in water fouled by cow feces and the partially submerged bones of a cow corpse. A half-dozen cattle crashed through the creek and up the steep embankment, tearing up plants that protected the soil from erosion and sending silt billowing into the water.

“Looks like a sewer,” Chris Bugbee, a wildlife ecologist with the environmental group the Center for Biological Diversity, remarked as he took in the destruction. “This one hurts. There is no excuse.”

A 2024 BLM land health assessment listed the grazing allotment as “ALL STANDARDS MET.” In April, a camouflaged trail camera bearing the agency’s insignia was pointed toward the creek. (ProPublica and High Country News submitted a public records request for images on the camera’s memory card in May, but the BLM has yet to fulfill the request.)

No ranchers paid to graze their livestock in this allotment last year, according to BLM data, so it is unclear who owned the cattle. The Arizona Cattle Growers’ Association, which represents ranchers in the state, did not respond to requests for comment.

Over the past eight years, Bugbee and his team have annually surveyed grazing impacts on the banks of streams and rivers in the Southwest that are designated as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.

The industry maintains that the presence of livestock benefits many ecosystems, pointing to studies that have found, for example, that grazing can increase soil’s ability to hold carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Other research suggests that, when managed properly, grazing can improve the health of habitat enough to support a more diverse mix of species.

Grazing also reduces vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Frank Shirts Jr., owner of the largest sheep operation on Forest Service land, said that sheep eat invasive weeds and brush, creating firebreaks. “These animals are fantastic,” he said.

Retta Bruegger, a range ecologist at Colorado State University, said that some ecosystems, especially those that receive more precipitation, can withstand more intense grazing without permanently damaging the land. In regions where plants evolved over many years alongside large grazers like cattle, livestock can “provide a very important ecosystem function.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’” said Bruegger, who supports balancing the industry’s needs with the land’s.

But answering those questions, she said, would require adequate staff to monitor the land.

Rubber stamping

After a century of intense grazing wore down public lands, a court ruled in 1974 that grazing permits were subject to environmental reviews, and Congress passed a law two years later mandating them every decade.

For years, a backlog of permit reviews grew, as federal land management agencies lacked the staff to inspect all their territory — 240 million acres across BLM and Forest Service jurisdictions. Around 2000, Congress began giving temporary approval for regulators to skip reviews. Western Republicans, with the livestock industry’s support, pushed to enshrine the concept in law. The idea ultimately received bipartisan approval in December 2014, after being slipped into a must-pass defense spending bill.

Some conservationists now call it simply “the loophole.”

Many in the livestock industry lambaste the lack of reviews. When permits are automatically renewed, the law does not allow the terms to change, so ranchers are prevented from updating their grazing practices.

“It just locks people into grazing the same place, the same time, year after year,” said Chris Jasmine, manager of biodiversity and rangelands for Nevada Gold Mines, which owns 11 ranches in northern Nevada.

To help inform permit renewals, teams of BLM experts — rangeland specialists, hydrologists, botanists, soil scientists and wildlife biologists — assess the health of grazing allotments.

When the process is working as intended, these assessments are considered in permit reviews. But the current lack of staff has left large swaths of land without scrutiny.

All told, the BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands available for grazing. But the agency has no record of completing land health assessments for more than 35 million acres, nearly a quarter of its total.

Where the BLM has conducted such assessments, it found grazing had degraded at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. And close to two-thirds of the land it listed as being in good shape had not been checked in more than a decade, the analysis found.

The situation, though, is even worse than those numbers indicate, as the agency has often skipped permit reviews on land in poor condition. Even if the BLM had previously found the environment to be in bad shape, Congress’ 2014 law still dictated automatic renewal. Of the acreage the agency had previously found to be degraded due to livestock, 82% was reauthorized for grazing without a review, according to ProPublica and High Country News’ analysis.

Several BLM employees said agency higher-ups instruct staff to study land that’s in better condition while avoiding allotments that are in worse shape or more controversial. Environmental groups such as the Western Watersheds Project as well as local stockmen’s associations are quick to litigate changes to permits. Automatic renewals avoid these drawn-out public fights. “We were just using a bureaucratic loophole,” one staffer said. “We were allowing ongoing degradation of habitat.”

“This can’t be the future of public lands,” Bugbee, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said of parcels degraded by cattle, likening the land to a “mowed lawn.”

Agency staff pointed to myriad reasons why the environment is suffering.

For example, after a wildfire, the BLM aims to keep livestock off the land for two years to allow the ecosystem to recover. But ranchers often negotiate an earlier return to the public pastures where their livestock graze, said Steve Ellis, who spent his career with the BLM and Forest Service, rising to high-level positions in both.

“There was always pressure to get back on,” Ellis said. “That’s not a new thing. It’s just part of working for the bureau.”

The government’s support for ranchers can add to the damage. Land management agencies sometimes seed invasive grasses, which can benefit livestock, although those plants can drive out species that are native to the local ecosystem. And state and federal agencies kill predators such as wolves and cougars — also integral to a healthy balance of species — to protect ranchers’ economic interests.

Some staff members also question the agency’s oversight.

BLM employees said that in some permit reviews and land health assessments, rank-and-file staff noted the presence of threatened and endangered species, which would have triggered tighter environmental controls, only for agency managers to delete that information from their reports.

One current BLM staffer called the reviews “rubber stamping” and said higher-ranking staff who controlled the text of reports “wouldn’t let me stick anything into the official documentation that acknowledged things were in poor shape.”

Another complicating factor, according to BLM staff, is that ranchers are often invited to participate in fieldwork to gauge whether they are overgrazing. The results, employees said, were watered-down reviews and assessments.

The industry, though, is critical of the assessment process for other reasons. Erin Spaur, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said it’s an inflexible “one-size-fits-all approach” that doesn’t sufficiently account for differences in ecosystems.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency,” said Dennis Willis, who spent more than three decades with the BLM, including managing rangeland, adding that “there’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

Flexibility and collaboration

Some ranchers acknowledge the environmental impacts of their industry. But they say that more flexibility — not stricter oversight — would make them better stewards of the land.

Jasmine, with Nevada Gold Mines, contends that ranching can be done without denuding the West. A sixth-generation Nevadan, he oversees the mining company’s ranching operations, which run about 5,000 head of cattle.

On a sunny July day near Carlin, Nevada, Jasmine walked through chest-high vegetation to show off the recovery of Maggie Creek, a tributary to the Humboldt River that flows through a checkerboard of public and private lands. Photographs from the 1980s show barren ground around the shallow creek. When ranchers changed how they rotated their herds in the 1990s to give the streambed more rest, the land bounced back, Jasmine said, as a chorus of chirping birds punctuated his story. He credited a BLM biologist with initiating many of the projects that helped revive Maggie Creek.

“It’s a renewable resource. That grass that they’re eating right now will come back next year and the year after that if managed properly,” he said. “It’s about not eating the same plants in the same place year after year after year.”

Jasmine touted the company’s goal of protecting locally important species, its sage grouse restoration projects and its partnership with the BLM, which targeted grazing to remove unwanted vegetation and create a firebreak.

But Nevada Gold Mines — a joint venture between two companies with a combined value of around $150 billion — operates in a different economic reality than most ranchers and can afford to keep cattle off the land long enough for it to recover.

Smaller ranchers face slim profit margins, making it attractive to heavily graze federal lands, where the cost is much lower than on state or private land.

For years, some politicians and environmental groups have proposed protecting degraded or sensitive habitats by paying ranchers to retire their permits, making the areas off limits to grazing and preserving the land as wildlife habitat. Ranchers have occasionally taken these offers. But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.

In October, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to further voluntary retirement, calling it “a pragmatic solution that supports local economies, protects biodiversity, and saves taxpayer dollars by reducing the cost of administering grazing programs.”

Louis Wertz, a spokesperson for the Western Landowners Alliance, said that the conservation-minded ranchers who make up his group want to both stay in business and “live in a place that is vibrant, full of life, provides clean water, has clean air.” But when it comes to food production, he added, “the expectations we have of both being environmentally harmless and healthy and cheap are untenable. Over the last 150 years in the United States, we have chosen cheapness at the expense of environmental quality.”

Like Jasmine, Wertz said that understaffing at the BLM and Forest Service deprives ranchers of an opportunity to change how they manage their herds, even when they want to.

“It is important that there be accountability for producers on the landscape,” Wertz said, but there should also be “flexibility so producers can be economically successful and so they can do what is right for the landscape.”",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/250429_HCN_6990_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:00:47.498644

Natural gas usage must diminish over time, so that renewable clean electricity comprises the dominant energy source, not the subordinate one.
This situation has created a market that is heavily tilted in favor of fossil fuels, a serious disadvantage for clean energy generation and storage.
This is not a free market, and creates mismatched choices for consumers who desire lower cost clean energy.
We must open the doors to more opportunities for clean electricity, storage and resilient systems installations across our communities.","The good people of Connecticut do deserve clean affordable electricity. The recent commentary is correct in saying that demand for energy is not going away. In fact, it is increasing with the prevalence of data centers and growth within our cities. Natural gas is touted as reliable, on-demand energy. This is true. But it is also a fossil fuel that produces (with increased use) greater amounts of greenhouse gases, which accelerates climate change, impacts our health and environment, and slows the transition to a truly clean energy future.

So, to recognize the simple truth that if our society wants a clean and cost-effective electricity, we must move towards clean energy sources. These include solar, wind, geo-exchange and use of battery storage, heat pumps, passive construction and other innovations. Electricity generation in Connecticut is sourced from natural gas: 60.7%. Nuclear, 33.9%, renewables, 4.3%; according to the Energy Information Administration. Renewables are just a footnote. Natural gas usage must diminish over time, so that renewable clean electricity comprises the dominant energy source, not the subordinate one.

Fossil fuels for the great majority of our energy history have been more heavily subsidized than renewables. They have received approximately nine times more subsidies than renewables. Starting in about 2016 subsidies for renewables began to increase annually towards those levels of fossil fuels. With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 subsidies for renewables increases significantly. Those, however, are being dismantled by the current administration.

In the 2025 spending bill, the administration added nearly $40 billion in new federal subsidies for fossil fuels over the next decade. This is on top of the pre-existing $30.8 billion annual subsidies for fossil fuels. Additionally, the fossil fuel industry benefits from increasingly lax regulations on pollution from natural gas and other fossil fuels, freeing them up from responsibility from the negative health and environmental impacts to our citizens. Not having to pay for these impacts is called “implicit subsidies” and total an estimated $62 billion annually. This situation has created a market that is heavily tilted in favor of fossil fuels, a serious disadvantage for clean energy generation and storage. This is not a free market, and creates mismatched choices for consumers who desire lower cost clean energy. The decades of large subsidies for fossil fuels helped build out necessary infrastructure, a situation not wholly available to the renewable clean electricity sector because of historic subsidies.

Due to these disparities in subsidies, many have promoted fair market pricing of carbon emissions (a carbon tax) on fossil fuels, and pairing that with a cash-back for citizens to receive those collected funds to offset pricing fluctuations during the transition towards clean electricity. According to The Wall Street Journal, 3,649 economists support pricing carbon.

The argument for using natural gas because it “provides crucial backup to intermittent resources” is a false leader. Currently natural gas is the dominant fuel for electricity generation, not a backup fuel. Promoting more natural gas impedes innovation to generation and storage systems that can address spikes in demand. ISO New England notes that behind-the-meter solar has helped manage peak energy needs, especially during summer heat waves. Therefore, rather than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new natural gas infrastructure and power plants, the money would be better spent modernizing the grid with clean electricity generation systems. Natural gas is not more flexible than clean renewables when paired with battery storage and other innovations. Stepping back to natural gas is a step backward for our energy systems.

The Department of Energy notes that 67% of natural gas pumped from the ground in the U.S. is from fracked resources, of which there are over one million wells. Fracking impacts water quality in aquifers and utilizes chemical mixtures containing carcinogenic compounds impacting the environment and human health. Reducing exposure from these practices and pollutants is a sound environmental move.

Legislation is critical in balancing state and national energy policies. For Connecticut, Public Act No. 25-125 states "" ... state agencies shall have the goal of only utilizing zero-carbon generating electricity by 2030.” It also says, “The state shall reduce the level of emissions of greenhouse gas ... not later than January 1, 2030, to a level at least forty-five per cent below the level emitted in 2001.” And by January 1, 2050, Connecticut must – by law – provide an eighty per cent reduction in GHGs compared to 2001. Connecticut will not achieve these mandated goals if we expand the use of natural gas and other fossil fuels, and in doing so will break the law.

None of our energy sources is “the enemy."" It is about using our technological advancements to bring lower cost and clean electricity to Connecticut. Three generations ago, natural gas was pegged as a “bridge fuel."" That bridge is now being extended to unfair lengths, and future generations will ask why we didn’t fix this now rather than put the burden upon them. Renewable systems offer greater energy security, more jobs, long-term affordability and a healthier environment for people. We must open the doors to more opportunities for clean electricity, storage and resilient systems installations across our communities.",http://d3gouztkx1c1lh.cloudfront.net/360_TheDay_Live/0/0/0/0/766/789/766789_original,N,,2025-12-06 14:01:09.468702

The continent is considering combining clean hydrogen production with synthetic fuels to power heavy transport. For this mission, turquoise hydrogen is all the more essential. This is a form of low-carbon hydrogen that gets produced without any CO₂ emissions.

Where does methanol come into the equation?

The fact that turquoise hydrogen exists is not what Europe is most interested in. For European developers, the best part is the ability to use this clean hydrogen to produce 150,000 tonnes of methanol per year, which is a core fuel for the decarbonization era. This fuel will be of utmost importance in the shipping industry.

The reason why hydrogen will be used to produce methanol is that hydrogen is rather difficult to transport and store. Methanol, on the other hand, is a liquid that is compatible with existing storage tanks, making it far easier to ship. Another exciting feature is that e-methanol is one of the most promising marine fuels. E-methanol is basically methanol produced using low-carbon hydrogen and captured CO₂.

A British-based project at the forefront of the turquoise hydrogen endeavor

Hilroc, the British-based company, is taking the lead in terms of getting Europe to produce methanol from turquoise hydrogen. The firm will build a turquoise hydrogen facility in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, that is integrated with the energy-from-waste plant that is being developed by Agile Energy. In turn, a 150,000-tonnes-per-year e-methanol plant will be constructed.

This integration model will process about 200,000 tonnes of municipal and industrial waste each year. The whole idea is not to release carbon into the atmosphere but to amalgamate the captured carbon with Hiroc’s turquoise hydrogen to ensure that a circular carbon system is created. In this way, low-carbon methanol is produced, and this methanol fully resonates with Europe’s net-zero emissions ambition.

Thermal Plasma Electrolysis (TPE) will be relied upon to split methane to yield hydrogen and solid carbon. Thermal Plasma Electrolysis aligns with the UK’s Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard.

What Europe hopes for when it comes to methanol production?

In Europe, there is a strong demand for methanol as it is seen as the most lucrative replacement for diesel in the maritime industry. Europe has high hopes of producing at least 150,000 tons at the Scottish site, making the site one of the largest e-methanol facilities in Europe.

The advantage of methanol is rather apparent since it is easy to store and blend. Another advantage of this project is that waste will be used as feedstock, and thus, CO₂ emissions will be captured for synthetic fuel production. In the process, the facility will reduce landfill pressure while displacing fossil fuels that are commonly used in the marine industry. Europe is set on its mission to get rid of CO₂ emissions completely and has already answered the question, what to do with Earth’s CO₂. The continent has decided to bury it with 10 million tons disappearing. The continent has recently discovered that carbon capture is the missing piece that may have been the answer we all have been looking for.

Europe is geared for a clean fuel future

This Inverurie project will be rather valuable for Europe’s renewable energy future, and it will signify a huge turning point should all go well with the plans for the hydrogen to methanol value chain. Turquoise hydrogen has the potential to unlock long-term decarbonization. The truth is that 150,000 tons is only the start of a clean fuel future for Europe. With Europe going green at a desperate speed, we can only anticipate what will come next.

Sales of new electric vehicles have plunged since federal tax credits ended on Sept. 30.

In November, EVs accounted for 5.3 percent of U.S. new-car and light-truck sales, a share that was less than half the record high in September, according to an estimate published last week by S&P Global Mobility.

The numbers were especially ugly on Tuesday when several automakers released their November figures. Ford said that unit sales of its Mustang Mach-E were down 49 percent compared to the same month in 2024. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 was down 59 percent. I could go on.

But most industry analysts are not sounding an alarm. This is because the decline in sales was expected the moment in July that President Donald Trump signed the legislation that canceled the credit, which was up to $7,500 per vehicle. The law led to months of chaos, during which many consumers accelerated their purchasing decisions to qualify for the credit, contributing to the collapse that followed.

One of the main questions going forward is how long it will take for the market to return to some kind of normalcy. The most common answer I’m seeing is that the current shakeout will likely last well into 2026.

After that, we’ll get to the more important question: What happens next? To help figure this out, I spoke with Peter Slowik, U.S. passenger vehicles lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation, or ICCT, a research nonprofit with offices around the globe.

Researchers use different methods to calculate the total cost of ownership, making this a challenging metric to agree on. (Car and Driver published an overview this summer of the factors to watch.)

But there is little debate that the costs of EVs will continue to decrease, even with cuts to subsidies.

Automakers, who think in decade-plus time horizons, can see the way things are going. Each company is making strategic choices about how much to maintain gasoline and hybrid vehicle lineups, even as they know electric drivetrains will dominate the long-term future.

“We think this transition is inevitable, and the automakers that can [best navigate] this transition are the ones that are likely to win the race,” Slowik said. “They stand to win big, both at home, in terms of their domestic manufacturing volumes, and their sales shares relative to other automakers, but then also abroad.”

ICCT is a useful resource for understanding this moment. For starters, check out a Nov. 17 blog post that offers data-backed commentary on U.S. policy.

Any attempt to make predictions carries risk. If you’d asked me a year ago, I would not have guessed that Trump would be able to pass a repeal of the EV tax credits.

The credits largely benefited U.S.-based companies such as Tesla, Ford and General Motors, helping them gain a competitive edge over models assembled in other countries that were not eligible.

It didn’t make sense to remove the tax credits—and do so with such suddenness—except for the odd political reality of this year and the way the debate in Congress was dominated by fiscal hardliners.

But the push and pull of adding or subtracting subsidies will ultimately matter less than larger factors, such as the long-term decline in battery costs and the increase in battery efficiency.

In the meantime, the rough sales numbers are going to continue. Let’s reconvene next year at this time and we’ll have a better sense of what the recovery looks like.

The HVAC industry says furnaces can last up to 30 years, but the average is 15 to 20 years before the system fails. And that never happens on a sunny spring day.

Before it does, it might be useful to have a plan on what to replace it with, taking into account cost, performance and environmental impact.

Which costs more to buy: a gas or electric furnace?

About 24% of homes in North Carolina use natural gas for heating, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

If yours is one, you already have the gas line and connection, which means your up-front cost to install a new gas furnace would be lower compared to someone who doesn’t have that infrastructure.

A gas furnace itself can cost $3,000 to $8,000, according to industry estimates, which can be as much as twice the purchase price of an electric furnace.

Is a gas or electric furnace cheaper to run?

Operating costs typically run lower for gas furnaces because gas, at the moment, is less expensive than electricity when used for heating. Gas prices do fluctuate and Duke Energy currently has a request for an electric rate hike on the table.

The nonpartisan but pro-natural-gas-industry group Consumer Energy Alliance says operating costs for gas appliances are significantly lower than electric heating sources.

Technologies for both gas and electric heat likely have improved since your system was installed, and depending on efficiency upgrades, it may be worth replacing your unit even before it dies.

The Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill has truncated generous tax credits designed to encourage homeowners to invest in more efficient heat pumps, water heaters and other energy-saving devices. Those credits include up to $2,000 on qualified heat pumps, which can both heat and cool a home, but they’re now set to expire Dec. 31, 2025.

Is a gas or electric furnace better for the environment?

Manufacturing oversupply scenarios present systemic risks that extend beyond simple capacity-demand imbalances. In renewable energy sectors experiencing rapid expansion, the convergence of policy-driven scaling, international trade tensions, and infrastructure constraints creates complex vulnerability patterns that challenge traditional market stabilisation mechanisms. These dynamics become particularly pronounced when domestic industrial development objectives intersect with global competitive pressures and technological dependencies, as demonstrated by India's solar buildout oversupply warning.

The emergence of manufacturing capacity bubbles in strategic industries reflects deeper structural challenges in coordinating industrial policy with market fundamentals. When government incentive programmes successfully mobilise private capital without corresponding demand coordination mechanisms, the resulting oversupply can threaten the long-term viability of the very industries these policies aim to develop.

How India's Solar Buildout Oversupply Warning Exposes Manufacturing Strategy Gaps

India's photovoltaic manufacturing sector demonstrates how rapid scaling can create structural imbalances that threaten industry sustainability. The Production-Linked Incentive framework has generated manufacturing capabilities exceeding 100 GW annually, while domestic consumption patterns suggest absorption capacity closer to 35-40 GW per year. This threefold capacity surplus represents one of the most significant oversupply situations in global renewable energy manufacturing.

Furthermore, the development has broader implications for the global energy transition minerals supply chain, as manufacturing oversupply in one region can disrupt pricing and investment patterns across international markets.

Manufacturing Capacity Expansion Dynamics

The PLI scheme's success in mobilising industrial investment has created a complex web of manufacturing facilities across multiple value chain segments. Module assembly capabilities have expanded most rapidly, with over 15 GW of operational capacity established within 24 months of policy implementation. Cell manufacturing has grown more gradually, reaching approximately 8 GW of capacity, while upstream wafer and ingot production remains limited at under 3 GW.

Key Manufacturing Metrics:

Total awarded PLI capacity: 45+ GW across all production stages

Operational module assembly: 15+ GW as of late 2024

Cell production capacity: 8 GW operational

Ingot-wafer capacity: Under 3 GW operational

Projected 2025 total capacity: 100+ GW annually

This capacity distribution reveals the challenges of building integrated domestic supply chains. Most manufacturers have focused on final assembly operations, which require lower capital investment and technical expertise compared to upstream silicon processing. However, this approach perpetuates dependence on imported cells and wafers, creating vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and trade policy changes.

Inventory Accumulation Patterns

Industry inventory levels have reached critical thresholds that indicate fundamental demand-supply misalignment. Excess inventory has grown from approximately 10 GW in early 2024 to over 20 GW by year-end, with projections suggesting continued accumulation through 2025. This inventory buildup represents significant working capital constraints for manufacturers and potential price deflation pressures.

The inventory crisis reflects multiple factors beyond simple overcapacity. Installation project delays due to grid infrastructure constraints, land acquisition challenges, and financing bottlenecks have reduced actual solar deployment below planned levels. Additionally, quality certification requirements and performance testing delays have slowed the conversion of manufacturing output into deployed capacity.

What Financial and Trade Pressures Are Reshaping Market Dynamics

Export Market Deterioration

International market access has become increasingly constrained for Indian solar manufacturers. The United States, previously a major destination for Indian solar exports, has implemented comprehensive trade measures targeting modules suspected of containing Chinese-origin components. These measures include both tariff barriers and supply chain verification requirements that have effectively reduced export competitiveness.

Trade Impact Analysis:

U.S. tariff rates: 50% on modules with Chinese components

Export volume decline: Over 50% in first half of 2025

Alternative market development: Limited progress in Southeast Asia and Africa

Supply chain verification costs: 2-3% of module value

The tariff impact analysis shows these trade restrictions extend beyond direct tariff costs. Supply chain documentation and verification requirements have created administrative burdens that small and medium manufacturers struggle to manage. Larger manufacturers with integrated operations face different challenges, as vertical integration requirements conflict with cost optimisation strategies that rely on global component sourcing.

Cost Competitiveness Challenges

Manufacturing cost structures remain a fundamental barrier to sustainable market development. Indian-assembled modules using imported cells carry cost premiums of approximately 3-5 cents per watt compared to direct Chinese imports. Fully integrated Indian manufacturing shows even larger cost disadvantages, with premiums potentially exceeding 10 cents per watt in some market segments.

Cost Structure Breakdown:

Raw material costs: 60-65% of total manufacturing cost

Labour and overhead: 15-20% of total cost

Capital equipment amortisation: 10-15% of total cost

Working capital financing: 5-8% of total cost

These cost disadvantages stem from multiple sources. Scale efficiencies remain limited compared to Chinese manufacturers operating gigawatt-scale facilities. Technology licensing costs add additional burdens, as most advanced cell technologies require royalty payments to international patent holders. Energy costs, while declining, remain higher than in major manufacturing centres like China and Vietnam.

Banking Sector Risk Assessment

Financial institutions have begun implementing enhanced due diligence for solar manufacturing loan applications. The Ministry of Finance has reportedly issued guidance recommending careful evaluation of standalone manufacturing projects that lack vertical integration or established off-take agreements. This represents the first formal acknowledgement of oversupply risks at the policy level.

Financial Risk Indicators:

Debt service coverage ratios below 1.2x

Export revenue concentration exceeding 60% in single markets

Working capital cycles extending beyond 120 days

Dependence on PLI incentives for positive margins

Why Vertical Integration Becomes Strategic Priority

Government Policy Recalibration

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy has shifted policy emphasis toward supporting integrated manufacturing facilities capable of producing components across multiple value chain stages. This policy evolution reflects recognition that standalone assembly operations provide limited strategic value and remain vulnerable to supply chain disruptions.

Priority support now focuses on facilities demonstrating capabilities in polysilicon production, wafer manufacturing, cell fabrication, and module assembly. This integrated approach aims to reduce import dependence while creating more resilient domestic production networks. However, the capital requirements for truly integrated facilities exceed $1 billion per gigawatt of capacity.

This shift aligns with India's lithium supply strategy, which emphasises building comprehensive supply chains for critical materials rather than relying on single-stage processing operations.

Supply Chain Security Versus Economic Efficiency

The strategic trade-offs between supply chain security and economic efficiency have become central to policy debates. Achieving meaningful import substitution requires accepting higher production costs and consumer prices in exchange for reduced dependence on Chinese supply chains. This trade-off becomes particularly challenging when global solar prices continue declining due to Chinese oversupply.

Strategic Integration Benefits:

Reduced import dependence from 85% to under 30%

Enhanced supply chain resilience during trade disruptions

Technology transfer and domestic innovation capabilities

Employment creation across skill levels

Economic Integration Costs:

Capital requirements 3-4x higher than assembly operations

Operating cost premiums of 15-25% over Chinese alternatives

Extended payback periods requiring patient capital

Technical risks in scaling advanced manufacturing processes

How Grid Infrastructure Constraints Compound Oversupply Issues

Generation Capacity Versus Grid Absorption

India's power grid faces mounting challenges absorbing rapidly expanding solar generation capacity. Several states have experienced grid curtailment events where solar power plants are required to reduce output due to transmission constraints or grid stability concerns. These curtailment incidents threaten project economics and potentially slow future solar deployment growth.

Grid Integration Challenges:

Transmission capacity constraints in high-solar regions

Grid balancing requirements during peak generation periods

Frequency stability challenges during cloud cover transitions

Regional demand-supply mismatches requiring enhanced transmission

The duck curve phenomenon, where solar generation peaks at midday but demand peaks occur during morning and evening periods, requires substantial grid infrastructure investments. Energy storage systems, advanced forecasting capabilities, and flexible generation resources become essential for maintaining grid stability as solar penetration increases.

Infrastructure Investment Requirements

Grid modernisation needs extend far beyond simple transmission capacity expansion. Advanced grid management systems capable of handling variable renewable generation require sophisticated control technologies and real-time monitoring capabilities. These systems must coordinate multiple generation sources while maintaining frequency and voltage stability across the network.

Infrastructure Investment Priorities:

Category Investment Need Timeline Transmission Lines $15-20 billion 2025-2030 Grid Storage $8-12 billion 2025-2028 Control Systems $3-5 billion 2025-2027 Distribution Upgrades $10-15 billion 2025-2032

Energy storage requirements alone represent massive capital demands. Battery storage systems capable of providing 4-6 hours of backup during peak demand periods require investments of $200-300 per kWh of capacity. At projected solar deployment scales, total storage needs could exceed 50 GWh by 2030.

What Strategic Scenarios Could Reshape Industry Structure

Market Consolidation Pathway

Oversupply pressures create conditions favouring industry consolidation, where financially stronger manufacturers acquire distressed assets at reduced valuations. This consolidation process could ultimately create more efficient and competitive domestic manufacturing capabilities, though the transition period involves significant financial losses for early investors.

Historical precedent from Chinese solar manufacturing suggests consolidation phases typically eliminate 60-70% of initial market participants over 3-5 year periods. Surviving manufacturers benefit from improved economies of scale and reduced competitive pressures, but the consolidation process requires substantial working capital to weather extended periods of negative cash flow.

Consolidation Indicators:

Module prices declining 20-30% annually

Manufacturer margin compression below 5%

Working capital cycles extending beyond 150 days

Debt restructuring requests from 30%+ of industry participants

Export Diversification Strategy

Alternative export markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America offer potential absorption capacity for Indian solar manufacturing output. However, market development in these regions requires different competitive strategies, including adapted product specifications, local partnership development, and patient market development investments.

Southeast Asian markets, particularly Vietnam, Thailand, and Philippines, show strong solar deployment growth but prefer established technology providers with proven track records. African markets offer longer-term potential but require development financing solutions and local capacity building investments. Latin American markets show price sensitivity that challenges Indian cost structures.

Export Market Potential Analysis:

Region Annual Market Size Growth Rate Competitive Position Southeast Asia 8-12 GW 15-20% Moderate barriers Africa 3-5 GW 25-30% Low competition Latin America 6-10 GW 12-18% High price sensitivity Middle East 4-8 GW 10-15% Quality requirements

Policy Intervention Scenarios

Government intervention through enhanced domestic demand creation, strategic export financing, or capacity rationalisation programmes could help stabilise market conditions. Demand support measures might include accelerated auction schedules, rooftop solar incentives, or industrial captive power requirements mandating domestic content.

Export financing mechanisms could include concessional credit facilities, export credit guarantees, or bilateral trade agreements that provide preferential access to emerging markets. Capacity rationalisation might involve production quotas, minimum efficiency standards, or consolidation incentives that encourage voluntary market exits.

How Market Participants Should Navigate Transition Risks

Investment Risk Assessment Framework

Investors require sophisticated risk assessment capabilities to distinguish viable manufacturers from those facing fundamental viability challenges. Financial metrics alone prove insufficient, as PLI incentives can mask underlying cost structure problems for extended periods.

High-Risk Characteristics:

Standalone module assembly without upstream integration

Export revenue concentration exceeding 70% in restricted markets

Operating margins dependent on PLI incentives for profitability

Debt service coverage ratios below 1.1x during peak production periods

Lower-Risk Investment Profiles:

Vertical integration spanning at least three value chain stages

Domestic market focus with established utility relationships

Cost structures within 10-15% of Chinese benchmarks

Technology partnerships providing ongoing innovation access

Strategic Response Options

Manufacturers face difficult strategic choices regarding capacity utilisation, market positioning, and technology development. Capacity reduction decisions require careful timing to avoid stranded asset losses while maintaining market position for eventual recovery. Market repositioning toward higher-value applications or specialised technologies offers differentiation opportunities but requires substantial R&D investments.

Manufacturer Strategy Matrix:

Market Position Recommended Actions Success Probability Integrated Players Maintain capacity, focus on cost reduction Moderate-High Assembly Focus Seek partnerships or consolidation Low-Moderate Technology Leaders Develop premium segments Moderate Export Dependent Diversify markets rapidly Low

Technology development becomes increasingly important as commodity manufacturing margins compress. Manufacturers investing in next-generation cell technologies, specialised applications like agrivoltaics, or energy storage integration may achieve differentiation that supports premium pricing. However, these strategies require sustained R&D spending during periods of cash flow pressure.

Policy Response Recommendations

Effective policy responses require coordination across multiple government agencies to address manufacturing oversupply while supporting broader renewable energy deployment objectives. Manufacturing policy should prioritise integrated facilities over standalone capacity additions, while demand policy should accelerate grid infrastructure development and energy storage deployment.

Policy Coordination Framework:

Manufacturing incentives linked to domestic content utilisation

Grid investment acceleration through infrastructure bonds

Export credit facilities for alternative market development

Technology development support for next-generation applications

Financial sector guidance should establish clear risk assessment standards that prevent speculative capacity additions while supporting viable manufacturing operations. This requires sophisticated evaluation criteria that consider long-term competitiveness rather than short-term PLI eligibility.

What Long-Term Implications Shape India's Energy Transition

Balancing Industrial Development With Market Sustainability

India's solar buildout oversupply warning represents a critical test of industrial policy effectiveness in emerging economies pursuing renewable energy manufacturing capabilities. The challenge lies in maintaining momentum toward energy security and manufacturing development objectives while preventing boom-bust cycles that threaten long-term industry viability.

Successful navigation of this transition requires accepting short-term capacity adjustments and financial losses in exchange for sustainable long-term industry development. This process involves difficult political choices, as capacity rationalisation affects employment and regional development objectives that motivated initial policy support.

In addition, developments like India's lithium refinery initiatives demonstrate the interconnected nature of clean energy supply chains, where oversupply in one segment can affect investment decisions across related industries.

Global Supply Chain Implications

Despite current challenges, India's solar manufacturing development positions the country as a potential alternative to China-dominated global supply chains. Success in managing the current oversupply crisis could establish India as a major participant in the global clean energy economy, supporting both domestic energy security and international climate objectives.

The strategic value of alternative supply chains extends beyond economic considerations to include energy security and geopolitical resilience. European and American markets increasingly seek supply chain diversification options that reduce dependence on single-country sources, creating opportunities for Indian manufacturers that achieve cost competitiveness.

Moreover, trade war market effects continue to reshape global manufacturing strategies, potentially creating long-term advantages for Indian manufacturers who successfully navigate the current transition period.

Technology Development Pathways

Long-term success requires progression from assembly operations toward higher-value manufacturing and technology development capabilities. This evolution demands sustained investments in R&D, workforce development, and technology partnerships that enable participation in next-generation solar technologies.

Technology Advancement Priorities:

Next-generation cell efficiency improvements (25%+ efficiency targets)

Specialised applications including floating solar and agrivoltaics

Energy storage integration and smart solar solutions

Manufacturing automation and quality control systems

The current crisis creates opportunities for strategic technology partnerships with international leaders seeking manufacturing diversification. According to industry analysis, these partnerships could accelerate Indian capabilities while providing technology transfer that supports long-term competitiveness.

Furthermore, India's solar buildout oversupply warning serves as a crucial inflection point for the global renewable energy industry, demonstrating how rapid policy-driven scaling must be balanced with market fundamentals to ensure sustainable growth in critical clean energy technologies.

Additionally, analysis from France's industrial lithium development prospects provides valuable context for understanding the broader implications of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project initiative.","The Strategic Imperative Behind EU Battery Material Sovereignty

Battery manufacturing across Europe currently relies almost entirely on lithium sourced from nations thousands of miles away. This dependency creates vulnerability in supply chains that power everything from electric vehicles to renewable energy storage systems. As global competition intensifies for critical minerals, European policymakers are crafting frameworks that could fundamentally alter how lithium flows through international markets. The Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project represents a pivotal development in this evolving landscape.

The continent's approach to mineral security extends beyond simple trade policies. It represents a comprehensive strategy to establish domestic production capabilities that can withstand geopolitical disruptions while maintaining competitive pricing structures. Understanding how these evolving policies will reshape investment patterns and extraction technologies provides crucial insight into the future of European industrial competitiveness.

European content requirements for lithium represent a graduated approach to reducing import dependency. The proposed framework calls for 20% of lithium used in electric vehicle batteries to originate from EU sources by 2031, with this requirement escalating to 40% by 2036. This timeline provides manufacturers with sufficient lead time to establish supply relationships while giving domestic projects clear market incentives.

The economic rationale behind these thresholds reflects careful analysis of production capacity constraints and capital deployment timelines. Industrial leaders suggest that mandatory content requirements would create ""marginal impact"" on vehicle pricing, though specific cost analyses remain proprietary. This positions regulatory certainty as a prerequisite for attracting the multi-billion euro investments required to establish European lithium production.

Current global lithium trade patterns show Europe sourcing virtually all battery-grade materials from Australia, Chile, and Chinese processing facilities. The Critical Raw Materials Act designates lithium as both a ""critical raw material"" and ""strategic raw material,"" establishing the legal foundation for content mandates similar to those used in automotive manufacturing under trade agreements like USMCA.

Economic Impact Assessment on European Vehicle Manufacturing

The financial implications of domestic content requirements extend beyond simple material costs. European automakers must balance supply chain security against production economics, particularly as lithium prices experience significant volatility. Manufacturing executives emphasize that regulatory frameworks providing long-term certainty enable more accurate capital allocation decisions than volatile spot market pricing.

Industry analysis suggests that lithium hydroxide, the preferred battery-grade material, commands premium pricing over lithium carbonate due to superior chemical purity requirements. European projects targeting hydroxide production position themselves to capture these price premiums while meeting stringent battery chemistry specifications demanded by automotive manufacturers.

The competitive positioning against Asian battery suppliers involves complex calculations beyond raw material costs. European operations must account for higher labour costs, environmental compliance requirements, and novel extraction technologies. However, proximity to vehicle manufacturing facilities reduces transportation costs and supply chain complexity, creating offsetting economic advantages.

What Makes European Lithium Projects Economically Viable Under New Regulations?

Investment Framework Analysis for Multi-Billion Euro Projects

European lithium development requires unprecedented capital commitments for the continent's mineral sector. Imerys' French project represents a €1.8 billion investment targeting integrated mining and refining operations, while Vulcan Energy Resources secured A$3.9 billion financing for its German geothermal extraction facility. These investment scales demonstrate institutional confidence in European lithium demand despite current market oversupply conditions.

The capital intensity of European projects exceeds established operations in Australia and Chile due to several factors. Furthermore, novel extraction methodologies require advanced engineering solutions, while stringent environmental compliance frameworks mandate additional infrastructure. Additionally, higher regional labour and construction costs compare unfavourably to established mining jurisdictions, necessitating integration with renewable energy systems for sustainable production profiles.

Risk assessment models for these investments incorporate regulatory certainty as a fundamental variable. Alessandro Dazza of Imerys emphasised that ""investors need a clear framework"" to commit capital at this scale, suggesting that the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project may paradoxically reduce financial risk by guaranteeing future demand.

Production Economics and Market Positioning

Target production specifications reveal the scale of European ambitions. The Imerys French operation aims to produce 34,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide annually, sufficient to support battery manufacturing for approximately 700,000 electric vehicles per year. This capacity represents a significant portion of European EV production targets while maintaining flexibility for export markets.

Lithium hydroxide production offers strategic advantages over lithium carbonate for battery applications. The hydroxide form provides superior thermal stability and chemical purity required for high-performance lithium-ion cells. This technical differentiation typically commands 15-25% price premiums over carbonate equivalents, improving project economics despite higher production costs.

Financial structuring approaches vary significantly across European projects. Imerys pursues minority stake sales to share development risks, while Vulcan Energy leverages public market financing through ASX listing. These diverse capital structures reflect different risk tolerance levels and strategic partnerships with automotive manufacturers or battery producers.

How Do Permitting Delays Impact European Critical Mineral Independence?

Regulatory Timeline Challenges

Administrative bottlenecks present material risks to European lithium independence timelines. However, mining permitting challenges continue to create significant obstacles for domestic producers. Imerys delayed commercial production from 2028 to 2030 due to ""longer-than-expected permitting processes,"" creating a two-year gap in planned domestic supply availability.

The regulatory complexity involves multiple approval layers including environmental impact assessments requiring comprehensive ecological studies. Furthermore, social licensing processes incorporate community consultation frameworks, while multi-jurisdictional approvals span mining, energy, and environmental agencies. Additionally, heritage site evaluations become particularly relevant in densely populated European regions.

Permitting delays compound other project risks, including commodity price volatility and demand uncertainty. Sibanye Stillwater continues assessing commissioning timing for its Finnish project due to weak lithium pricing, demonstrating how regulatory and market factors create compound development obstacles.

Strategic Implications of Production Delays

The 2027-2030 supply gap represents a strategic vulnerability period for European automakers. During this window, manufacturers must rely on existing import channels while domestic capacity remains under development. This dependency persists precisely when global lithium demand is projected to accelerate due to expanding EV adoption across multiple continents.

Alternative sourcing strategies during project development phases include long-term supply contracts with established Australian and Chilean producers. In addition, strategic inventory management helps buffer against supply disruptions, while technology partnerships with Asian battery manufacturers maintain diverse supply bases. Furthermore, recycling capacity expansion reduces primary lithium requirements.

Current regulatory uncertainty affects both demand-side and supply-side planning. Germany's efforts to modify EU combustion engine phase-out policies beyond 2035 create additional complexity for long-term demand forecasting, influencing both project development timelines and financing decisions.

What Role Do Geothermal and Sustainable Extraction Methods Play?

Technology Integration in European Lithium Operations

Geothermal-powered lithium extraction represents a uniquely European approach to mineral development. Vulcan Energy's Upper Rhine Valley project integrates geothermal energy production with lithium extraction, creating dual revenue streams while minimising carbon emissions. This technological integration addresses European sustainability requirements while potentially reducing operational costs through renewable energy self-sufficiency.

The geothermal extraction process offers several advantages over conventional mining. For instance, it eliminates mining waste through direct brine processing while reducing physical footprint compared to open-pit operations. Moreover, integration with existing energy infrastructure in geothermal regions provides lower environmental impact through minimal surface disruption.

Technical specifications for geothermal lithium extraction involve accessing high-temperature reservoir brines (200-250°C) containing dissolved lithium concentrations. The Rhine Graben geological structure provides optimal conditions for this extraction methodology, with established geothermal infrastructure reducing capital requirements.

Sustainability as a Competitive Advantage

European lithium projects increasingly position environmental compliance as strategic differentiation rather than regulatory burden. Vulcan Energy's A$3.9 billion financing success signals institutional investor validation of geothermal-powered extraction models, suggesting that sustainability profiles directly influence capital availability and pricing.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment criteria have become fundamental considerations for mineral project financing. European projects benefit from renewable energy integration reducing carbon footprint calculations. Additionally, advanced environmental monitoring exceeds global industry standards, while community engagement frameworks address social licensing requirements. Furthermore, transparent governance structures meet institutional investor standards.

The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) standard compliance requirements for European projects establish operational benchmarks that differentiate regional production from global competitors. These standards create barriers to entry while potentially commanding premium pricing for sustainably produced materials.

How Will Market Dynamics Affect European Lithium Project Viability?

Current Market Imbalance Analysis

Global lithium markets currently exhibit significant oversupply conditions, creating challenging conditions for new project development. However, long-term demand projections indicate that ""all known projects today will not be able to cover future EV demand,"" according to industry executives. This apparent contradiction reflects timing mismatches between current production capacity and projected consumption growth.

Price volatility impacts project development decisions across all stages. Exploration budgets contract during low-price environments, while construction financing becomes more expensive due to commodity price uncertainty. Consequently, commercial production timing shifts based on economic viability thresholds, and strategic investor participation varies with market sentiment cycles.

The current supply-demand imbalance primarily reflects slower-than-expected EV adoption in certain markets, production acceleration in Australia and Chile, and inventory building during previous high-price periods. However, underlying demand fundamentals remain supportive due to expanding battery manufacturing capacity and renewable energy storage requirements.

Competition from Established Producing Regions

European lithium projects must compete against established operations with significant cost advantages. Australian spodumene mining benefits from large-scale open-pit operations and established processing infrastructure. Similarly, Chilean brine operations leverage natural evaporation processes reducing energy requirements, while Chinese processing facilities offer integrated supply chain advantages.

Cost competitiveness challenges for European operations include several factors. Labour costs remain 2-3x higher than developing markets, requiring automation and productivity enhancement as mitigation. Furthermore, energy costs involve variable renewable pricing, necessitating renewable energy integration strategies. Additionally, stringent environmental compliance requirements demand technology differentiation and premium positioning.

Strategic value considerations extend beyond pure cost optimisation. Supply chain security, reduced transportation costs, and regulatory alignment create competitive advantages that offset higher production costs for European automotive manufacturers seeking supply chain resilience. These advantages become increasingly valuable as energy transition minerals gain strategic importance.

What Are the Broader Implications for EU Industrial Policy?

Critical Raw Materials Act Implementation

The proposed lithium content requirements integrate with the EU's broader Critical Raw Materials Act framework, creating comprehensive mineral security policies. This legislation establishes strategic objectives for domestic production capacity, recycling infrastructure development, and international partnership frameworks across multiple critical materials beyond lithium.

Cross-sector applications extend beyond automotive manufacturing to include defence industry applications requiring secure supply chains for specialised battery systems. Moreover, renewable energy storage supports grid stabilisation and energy transition goals, while industrial equipment uses lithium-ion systems for manufacturing automation. Additionally, consumer electronics manufactured within European technology hubs benefit from secure supply chains.

Implementation timelines coordinate multiple policy instruments, including green technology investment incentives, research and development funding, and trade policy adjustments affecting critical mineral imports. This comprehensive approach demonstrates European commitment to strategic autonomy in critical technology supply chains, building upon lithium industry innovations from other regions.

Geopolitical Considerations in Resource Security

European lithium independence initiatives respond to evolving geopolitical dynamics, particularly regarding China's dominant position in lithium processing and battery manufacturing. While China controls approximately 60% of global lithium refining capacity, European policies aim to establish alternative supply chains reducing strategic dependency.

Alliance building strategies include partnership frameworks with democratic lithium-producing nations like Australia and Canada. Furthermore, technology sharing agreements facilitate sustainable extraction methodologies, while joint venture structures combine European capital with international resource bases. Additionally, multilateral institutions coordinate critical mineral security across allied nations.

Trade policy implications involve balancing content requirements with World Trade Organisation compliance and existing free trade agreements. European policymakers must ensure that domestic content mandates do not trigger trade disputes while achieving strategic autonomy objectives, particularly as lithium brine market insights inform global supply chain strategies.

Investment and Partnership Strategies for European Lithium Development

Minority Stake Sales and Capital Structure

European lithium projects increasingly rely on sophisticated capital structures distributing development risks across multiple investor categories. Imerys pursues ""advanced"" discussions for minority stake sales, demonstrating strategic approaches to project financing that balance control retention with capital requirements and risk sharing.

Strategic investor identification involves several categories including automotive manufacturers seeking supply chain integration and security. Additionally, battery producers require feedstock quality assurance and delivery reliability, while sovereign wealth funds focus on strategic resource investments. Furthermore, infrastructure funds are attracted to long-term, utility-like cash flow profiles.

Risk-sharing mechanisms in capital-intensive mineral development include staged investment commitments, milestone-based funding releases, and commodity price hedging arrangements. These structures protect investors from development delays while providing projects with committed capital throughout construction phases.

Multi-Project Portfolio Approach

Geographic diversification across European jurisdictions spreads regulatory and geological risks while maximising policy support. Imerys operates projects in both France and Cornwall, while other companies develop operations across Germany, Finland, and additional European regions.

Technology diversification strategies encompass conventional hard-rock mining in established geological formations. Moreover, geothermal brine extraction operates in suitable geographical regions, while recycling facility development enables secondary lithium recovery. Additionally, research and development partnerships advance next-generation extraction technologies.

Timeline staggering enables companies to apply lessons learned from initial projects to subsequent developments while maintaining continuous project pipeline advancement. This approach reduces concentrated development risks while building operational expertise across diverse technical challenges, benefiting from recent battery recycling breakthrough innovations.

Reshaping Global Lithium Markets Through Regional Content Requirements

Long-term Market Structure Evolution

European content requirements will likely accelerate similar policies in other regions, creating fragmented global lithium trade patterns prioritising supply chain security over pure economic optimisation. This shift represents a fundamental change from globalised commodity markets toward regionalised supply chain structures.

Anticipated changes include regional processing hubs developing closer to consumption centres. Furthermore, premium pricing emerges for domestically produced materials meeting content requirements, while technology transfer acceleration occurs as companies establish local operations. Additionally, investment patterns shift toward strategic rather than purely economic considerations.

Regional supply chain development acceleration extends beyond lithium to encompass entire battery material supply chains, including nickel processing, cobalt refining, and battery cell manufacturing. This integrated approach creates comprehensive domestic capabilities rather than isolated material production.

Success Metrics for European Lithium Independence

Measuring European lithium policy effectiveness requires tracking multiple performance indicators beyond simple production volumes. Market share evolution in European EV battery supply chains provides the most direct measure of content requirement success, while cost competitiveness achievement determines long-term sustainability without ongoing subsidisation.

Key performance benchmarks include EU production capacity targeting 50,000+ tonnes LCE by 2030 and 120,000+ tonnes LCE by 2035. Consequently, content requirement achievement aims for 20% compliance by 2030 and 35% by 2035. Moreover, cost competitiveness goals involve achieving less than 120% of import costs by 2030 and less than 110% by 2035.

Timeline achievement versus actual capacity development will ultimately determine whether European lithium independence represents successful industrial policy or requires adjustment to balance strategic objectives with economic realities. The 2027-2030 period represents the critical testing phase for these ambitious policy frameworks.

Innovation incentives created by content requirements extend beyond immediate lithium production to encompass advanced extraction technologies, recycling capabilities, and battery chemistry improvements that reduce primary material requirements. These secondary effects may prove more valuable than direct production capacity in achieving long-term strategic autonomy objectives. The success of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project will serve as a crucial benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of these comprehensive policy initiatives.

For further insights into European lithium market developments, Imerys' strategic project recognition by the European Union highlights the significance of domestic content requirements. Additionally, analysis from France's industrial lithium development prospects provides valuable context for understanding the broader implications of the Imerys European content rule for EV lithium project initiative.

Maybe increasing to 50% of new car sales by 2035, he said, but 100% is a dream deferred.
Up to 90% of China’s small car sales already are electric, and green tech there is booming.
But Republican consultant Mike Murphy last year polled Americans on electric cars and found that most of the divide isn’t pragmatic.
The car sales story this fall in King County and around some parts of the state is tantalizing.","When President Trump proposed rolling back fuel-efficiency standards on cars this past week, he did it with his usual panache, calling electric cars “a green new scam.”

The idea of mandating a gradual shift to EVs is “insane,” he said.

But was it really going to be so far-fetched to get rid of gas cars?

It sure looks like the green dream may have been closer than previously thought, according to the latest data from Washington state about new cars hitting the road.

I say “could have been” because the federal government now seems hellbent to keep Americans guzzling oil until long after the last glacier is melted.

But first, a remarkable data point.

In October, 37% of the new cars sold in King County were battery-powered electrics (this includes plug-in hybrids) — in other words, cars that can be plugged in. This smashed the record for one-month adoption of green cars.

An additional 20% sold were hybrids. That means the old-style type of cars — those with solely internal combustion engines — made up only 43% of the new cars registered for the month in King County.

Statewide, 26% of new cars sold and then registered in October were EVs, and 20% gas-electric hybrids. So across the entire state, gas-only cars declined to just 54% of new car sales in October, according to state Department of Licensing registration data.

“It’s a temporary peak, unfortunately, but it also shows how far we’ve come,” says Matthew Metz.

Metz is a retired Seattle torts lawyer who took up the cause of banning new gas cars 10 years ago. He was called “moonbatty,” a “commie,” and so on. He reported to me back in 2017 that when the idea of phasing out gas cars first made the news, “99.9% of the reaction was negative.”

“People will get over it,” he predicted then.

The political system and the oil industry of course didn’t get over it. But Metz was right that large swaths of the population did.

Consider that in 2017, electric cars made up just 2% of new car sales in this state, with hybrids only 5%. Internal combustion engines had a monopoly-level hold on the market, at 93% of all new cars hitting the roads.

Advertising

Fast-forward eight years. The state’s largest county just crossed a tipping point where fewer than half the cars sold here in August, September and October combined were gas-combustion only. Who would have bet on that in 2017?

“When we started on this, EVs had a stigma,” Metz said. “There were very few electric cars available. There were no chargers. The charge times were three times longer. There’s still a ton of work to do, but the stigma is in the past.”

The surge in sales this fall was in part because buyers were scrambling to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits. Republicans have killed those off, as Trump gleefully noted this past week when he lowered the auto industry’s fuel mileage standards.

“Today, we’re taking one more step to kill the green new scam, as part of the greatest scam, probably,” Trump said.

Metz founded a group, called Coltura, to try to wean both Washington and the nation completely off of gas. So he’s a crazy optimist. But he sounded a bit resigned about the future.

Since Trump returned to office, he and congressional Republicans have sought to cancel the ability of California and other states to set their own car standards. It means the push in Washington state to try to shift new car sales all the way up to 100% EV by 2035 has effectively been scotched (though the Trump action is being challenged in court.)

Metz shared industry data showing that sales of some makes of electric cars have plunged in November, since the tax credits expired.

He now predicts that with the government hostility, momentum for EVs will slow. Maybe increasing to 50% of new car sales by 2035, he said, but 100% is a dream deferred.

“Unless they want to turn us into Cuba, with only the old model gas cars and trucks driving around, then it’s inevitable that the market is going to keep moving ahead in some way with EVs,” he said. “But it is back to the drawing board.”

I kid you not, the day after Metz made this crack about turning us into Cuba, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had this to say about the fuel standards rollback:

“This rule will actually allow you to bring back the 1970s station wagon,” Duffy said. “Maybe a little wood paneling on the side. We can bring back choice to consumers.”

Make America like the ’70s again! Up to 90% of China’s small car sales already are electric, and green tech there is booming. Meanwhile our leaders are nostalgically fantasizing about road trips at 10 mpg.

There are some obvious drawbacks to EVs. They’re expensive to buy and still too inconvenient to fill with juice (especially for those in apartments or without driveways). But Republican consultant Mike Murphy last year polled Americans on electric cars and found that most of the divide isn’t pragmatic.

“It’s tribal,” Murphy wrote. “In our modern politics any friend of my enemy must be my enemy too. If Joe Biden is for EVs, we must be against them.”

I asked Metz for his take.

“I think Republicans are just pro-oil,” he said. “They want to keep the oil economy going for as long as they can, and that’s pretty much it.”

It’s like that 2006 documentary “Who Killed the Electric Car?” in which the oil powers sabotage a prototype EV to save their golden goose. On rerun in 2025.

So what will become of the green dream to end gas? The car sales story this fall in King County and around some parts of the state is tantalizing. A third of cars that just sold in King County have no engine in them at all — an inconceivable statistic only a few years ago.

Will this be looked back on as the first proof of a new age dawning? Or as a fad?

I guess if we see the station wagon making a comeback, we’ll have our answer.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12052025_TZR_Electric_Vehicle_Charging-2024_tzr_123.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:09.430683

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me.

Before I delve into today’s show I want to acknowledge that the news cycle is a shit show right now in the EV world. And that means a lot of today’s show will delve into politics and yeah, it’s going to be tough going. I don’t want to sugar coat this – politics matters – and those who say it doesn’t come from a place of privilege they’re not willing to acknowledge. So please, don’t blame us for covering political stories that are relevant to the EV world.

And we start with one such story – namely that the U.S. Government has officially published plans to slash fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks.

Standing with the CEOs of Ford and Stellantis, President Trump ripped into previous standard set by President Biden, calling them illegal and blaming them for the high cost of cars (even though I and many watching will blame unwanted in-car tech). Slashing nearly a third off the twenty-thirty-one target of fifty- point four miles per gallon, the new target is thirty-four point five miles per gallon – less than automakers managed fleet wide last year. We’re already seeing automakers push away from EVs toward more heavily polluting engines – like V-8s – even when their portfolios include more efficient, cheaper engines and drivetrains. And that only signals bad things ahead for everyone. But maybe there’s hope for one thing: kei cars. President Trump says he wants them to be allowed in the U.S., after seeing them on his trip to Japan. And given we’re now ruled by Presidential whim in the U.S…. Well… yah.

That Presidential whim – and continued attacks on EVs have seen what all of us predicted come to pass: a meteoric drop in EV sales during November.

Ford, which has indefinitely paused all F150 Lightning production – reported a sixty point eight percent drop in EV sales during November, replaced by a surge in gas-guzzling SUV sales. Meanwhile, Honda’s Prologue EV sales dropped eighty-six percent, despite large cash-on-hood incentives for buyers. At the time of filming, GM hasn’t published its November figures, but they’re not expected to be good. Hyundai and Kia also had a terrible November, with sales drops of more than one half for both brands. Meanwhile, pretty much every automaker recorded increases in hybrid sales.

We’re off to the UK now, where in addition to trying to legally erase and ban people like me from actually existing outside of their homes, the UK government is doing its best to mimic the USA.

Its just-released budget confirmed that while the government will be extending EV incentives until twenty-thirty, it also wants to tax EV and plug-in hybrid owners three pence per mile. Granted, the budget does include commitments to address the cost of EV charging, and to work on making it easier to install charging for people without off-street parking – but the data from November sales is already very dour. While EV sales in November were up one point five percent on the same period last year, with EVs now accounting for twenty-six point four percent of the new car market, the growth rate of EV adoption is the lowest it’s been in three years.

Luckily though, not every country in the world is making EVs the problem, and in Norway, we’ve got further demonstration of how amazing EV incentives can be to adoption rates.

This week, figures from November show that EVs accounted for more than ninety-seven point six percent of all new vehicles registered in the country. – but thanks to a rise in competitive pricing deals, Norway set new records for car registrations for the year, with just shy of twenty-thousand vehicles hitting the roads. That’s nearly double the number of cars sold in October. And while the Norwegian government had toyed with the idea of rolling back its VAT exemption on EV from twenty twenty-seven, a compromise reached this week will keep VAT exemption for EVs until twenty twenty-eight, with a new user limit of one hundred and fifty-thousand kroner in twenty twenty-seven, half of what it will be next year.

As some governments around the world sour on an all-electric future, we’re starting to see automakers take advantage of the situation and push back plans to go all -electric.

This week, reporting from Bloomberg suggests BMW, which has maintained it wants an electrified future – is now considering reintroducing its range-extended EV architecture for future models. The report claims that BMW is examining the reintroduction of REx – Range-Extending Engines – for its X5 and 7-Series models in China. It’s worth noting that the reporting is referring to engines connected to a generator that will provide electricity to an EV drivetrain when the car’sbatteries are empty, rather than traditional plug-in hybrid setups where the engine can drive the wheels in some situations. BMW has not refuted nor confirmed the reporting, stating that it is continually refining its plans based on customer and market trends.

Aptera has officially published its newest video update this week showing off its Validation Vehicle Assembly line for the first time.

The company – which is working to bring its three-wheeled solar electric car to market – is still very much using a pretty manual production process at this time, but what makes this line different from what went before is the extensive use of specialized assembly jigs to speed up component installation onto the pre-assembled bodies – complete with battery packs that Aptera’s battery partner CTNS is now building on site. This is the first time CTNS has build battery modules at Aptera’s facility, lowering build costs and lead times. With validation assembly under way – the company says it’s continuing its final testing a pace, and says that its combined cycle testing – high speed, stop and go, and urban – are quote ‘encouraging’. It’s hoping to engage in final regulatory testing soon. Watch this space.

Hyundai’s EV sales may have taken a hit last month in the U.S., but that hasn’t stopped its luxury arm, Genesis, from showing off its newest, highest-performance EV yet: the GV60 Magma.

Revealed in France this week, the model is a new upper-end variant of the GV60, with redesigned front body components and an all-wheel-drive system that rockets from zero to two hundred kilometers per hour (that’s zero to one hundred twenty-five miles per hour) in ten point nine seconds. A head-up display is standard, and the seats are wrapped in a suede-like material called Chamude. Official range figures for most markets aren’t out yet, but this is clearly a car built to go fast and think about range second. For the curious, it somehow keeps the mighty orb… because it wouldn’t be a GV60 without it.

Genesis also revealed its newest concept, the Magma GT, hinting at the brand’s future direction.

While some markets have yet to experience BYD’s EVs thanks to protectionist policies wrapped up as cybersecurity concerns, BYD has just celebrated a new milestone for its BYD Dolphin: 1 Million Global Sales.

On sale in its home market since twenty twenty-one and welcomed to Europe in twenty twenty-three, the Dolphin EV — not to be confused with its smaller sibling, the Seagull (or Dolphin Surf in Europe) — celebrated its half-millionth model late twenty twenty-three after twenty-five months in production – and the one millionth model hasn’t taken a long time to arrive after. With a choice of forty-five point one two kilowatt-hour or sixty point four-eight kilowatt-hour battery packs, the Dolphin holds its own in the already-crowded C-Segment in Europe, fighting off far more stablished brands, like Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in the EV space.

Over the past few years, we’ve seen plenty of developments made in the sector of wireless inductive charging for EVs – both in the passenger car and light-duty segment.

This week however, researchers at Purdue University carried out the first successful real-world test of a dynamic high-power inductive charging system fitted to a class-eight electric big rig on a quarter-mile stretch of US Highway 52 and US Highway 231 in West Lafayette Indiana. Using a specially-modified electric tractor built by Cummins, the system successfully transmitted one hundred and ninety kilowatts from the road to the truck while it was traveling along at sixty-five miles per hour (or about one hundred and four kilometers per hour). While the press release doesn’t go into details, my back-of-the-napkin calculations suggest that’s more than enough to cover all — or at least a significant portion — of the energy requirements for a fully loaded Class 8 big rig, if this system were extended over a meaningful distance.

And finally for this segment, some good news. While the U.S. White House continues its war on renewables, data from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shows that renewables are still ascendent in the Energy Generation Landscape.

Its latest report, published this week, shows that of the new generation capacity added to the U.S. electrical grid from January through until the End of September, and astonishing eighty-eight percent came from renewables. In fact, for twenty-five months straight, Solar has dominated new solar generating capacity – and I should note here that FERC only tracks grid-scale solar, not domestic solar. Today, nearly one third of all U.S. electricity generation comes from grid-scale renewable projects, with domestic solar pushing it well over that figure. If things continue, solar will become the second-largest source of U.S. Grid Generation, second only to natural gas.

Our final two stories are next, but first, a word from you.

For over fifteen years—ten in the U.S.—I and the TE team have been bringing you news on cleaner, greener, safer, smarter, and more equitable transportation and energy. We’re not backed by corporations, and we don’t have huge production budgets. Our tiny team—three full-time and one part-time member—works hard every week to bring you well-researched, honest content.

When we started, YouTube ad revenue paid the bills. These days, like most independent creators, ad revenue has dropped sharply. Worse, YouTube often sidelines diverse voices, overlooks minority creators, and prioritizes clickbait and AI fluff over real content. We wouldn’t exist without your support at Patreon.com/TransportEvolved.

I hate doing this, but here it is: just this week, a $4,200 annual E&O insurance bill arrived. Even though it’s yearly, it hits like a monthly expense—on top of team salaries, health insurance, retirement plans, and keeping the lights on. Health insurance alone has gone up forty percent this year. We keep a tight rein on our finances and have buffers, but right now, we’re treading water rather than growing—and costs are going up. I even fund part of the channel from my partner’s income, and that’s not sustainable. In an ideal world, we wouldn’t have to ask for your support… but here we are. It’s better than putting everything behind a paywall, which I am most certainly and vehemently against.

To keep producing videos—and to keep this channel alive—we need a budget boost. Even a thousand dollars a month—less than ten percent of what it costs to run this channel, which itself is about ten percent of the budget of much larger channels—would make a huge difference and let us sleep easier at night.

Even a single dollar helps. We’ve added new Patreon tiers for every budget, so if you already support us, thank you—it keeps this show alive.

And now… it’s time for those last two stories. Both of them from the UK.

Apparently, Brits like tea. A lot. And, as someone who is part British, I can attest that yes, I do indeed like a cup of tea to keep me going in the afternoon. Although in the morning, I’m all about Coffee.

But this week, Stellantis brand Vauxhall – which is basically the UK twin to Opel – took its UK roots and ran with it, announcing its new elect-ric-it-tea van. It’s a very obvious pun on electricity and consists of a Vauxhall Vivaro electric van that features a fully-kitted out kitchen behind its central sliding door. The company cites lots of research stating that most tradespeople say they’d prefer to stop and have a cup of tea in the afternoon that they themselves had made, and decided to make this advertising campaign around it. Now, it’s a neat, fun little concept, complete with sink, coffee, tea, fresh milk, and even some chocolate digestives (or maybe hobnobs). But there’s one flaw: I don’t know a single tradesperson with a van – electric or otherwise – that has room inside for all their gear and a fully-fitted kitchen. A smarter option? An electric kettle plugged into an on-board V2L system.

And finally,

If you’re an EV driver and you have any experience of public charging, you might know that when you plug in to a fast charger, the cable is locked in position by your car for your – and its safety.

When the charging session ends, the cable is supposed to release, but sometimes – if the charging session fails or there’s an error in the car the lock doesn’t release, causing panic and frustration. Most EVs today come with a hidden release cable that allow you to safely disconnect, but most owners don’t know about it. And, apparently, that’s led many people in the UK to call 999 – the UK equivalent of 911 – for assistance. This week, the London metropolitan police got so fed up with the number of calls from hapless EV owners asking for assistance that it had to issue a public statement reminding people that having your car stuck on a charging station is – and never should be – an emergency services call. Sure, if there’s a fire that’s different, but my advice is to learn where your EVs’ emergency release cable is. Most (but not all) have them.

And on that note, we’re done for today’s show.

But first, a huge thank you to the Electric Vehicle Association for sponsoring today’s show. The EVA has been advocating for electric vehicles since nineteen sixty-seven and remains firmly committed to a cleaner, greener future for all.

And in closing, some important words:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong. You have a purpose.

This week has seen more marginalization, more hate, and more othering of people in our lives and our communities. More bans, more threatened deportations and worse. And while the person in charge doesn’t already represent a nation or even the majority of people in it, it can be hard to want to carry on carrying on. But in order to change history – we need resistance – and intentionality.

Engage in Tactical Frivolity. Don’t surrender to fear, hate, or misinformation. That’s as true in Portland, Oregon, as it is anywhere power and greed seek to crush the will of ordinary people. Don’t buy into division and cruelty. Empathy is a skill we must practice daily to preserve our shared humanity. Just like humor, it’s an act of radical resistance.

But everyone needs time out. Unplug, get outside, dive into a good book, go gardening, or do a run, and recharge. Care for yourself and your loved ones now, so you can return ready to fight for decency, community, justice, and a better world. Let your light shine — in or outside an inflatable frog costume.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. Don’t let hate or ignorance win. As always, keep evolving!",https://www.transportevolved.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ten_560_thumb.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:14.509849

Even so, the efforts of Brazilian climate leadership deserve attention and recognition.
By shifting the debate to a dedicated forum with technical and political focus, the coalition creates space to build operational consensus, finance transition guarantees and design social and labor protections.
This parallel path is a necessary complement to global negotiations on the planet’s foremost climate agenda: ending the use of fossil fuels.
Civil society demanded ambition, integrity of information and climate justice — reinforcing that serious policy must articulate science, human rights and broad social participation.","The holding of the 30th UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Belém made history for two complementary reasons: it was the first climate conference hosted in the Amazon, and it put forests, Indigenous peoples and civil society back at the center of climate negotiations. Bringing together 195 countries and culminating in the unanimous adoption of 29 decisions, the conference showed that, despite geopolitical contradictions and obstacles, there is still room for collective progress.

The key points of Belém were the “joint decision,” the shifting positions of the European Union, the objections of large oil-producing countries and the enormous efforts of Brazilian diplomatic coordination to deliver on implementation of the Paris Agreement. In parallel with the diplomatic conference, Belém welcomed a vigorous presence of civil society, a powerful expression of its commitment to social justice in the fight against climate change.

The decision to join forces: strategy, scope and limits

In the context of the climate negotiations, the Brazilian presidency of the COP created the Mutirão — a “joint decision” strategy to untangle sensitive issues and stitch together a single package of decisions that included finance, adaptation, just transition, trade, gender and technology. At the end of the conference, this package resulted in the approval of 29 documents that sought to advance on multiple fronts without leaving behind urgent demands from the Global South.

Among the financial measures approved, concrete allocations of $135 million to the Adaptation Fund and $300 million to adapt the health sector to climate impacts stand out. The presidency also proposed reformulating climate finance reporting, linking it to the New Collective Quantified Goal for Climate Finance (NCQG), seeking greater transparency between “provided” and “mobilized” resources.

On the other hand, financial ambition fell short of what was necessary: the task-force proposal foresees tripling adaptation financing by 2035 compared with 2025, but without a clearly defined base value. This gap reflects the historical difficulty of the multilateral system in translating political commitment into measurable financial flows — a challenge that, according to climate finance experts, is reflected in the current adaptation finance gap, estimated at around $340 billion. This amount is forecast to reach $1.35 trillion by 2035.

No binding target was delivered to finance adaptation, and the multilateral ambition to mobilize trillions for clean infrastructure remains without clear accountability mechanisms. The recognition that historical goals have not been met gained space in the final text, but without new and effective structures that guarantee the flow of resources where they are most urgent.

Among other points in the task-force decision, advances were made on information integrity and the fight against climate disinformation — essential to confronting denialism, including disinformation promoted by parts of the fossil-fuel industry. There were also developments on carbon markets and discussions on high-integrity rules — a necessary subject for robust accounting of carbon credits, which remains controversial given cases of fraud and technical errors worldwide.

The EU’s position: defensive pragmatism

The European Union played a decisive role in the final design of the “joint decision”. European officials adopted a pragmatic stance: supporting the negotiated package as long as it did not include provisions they considered unfeasible or unsupported, especially those related to the energy transition. In negotiations, European representatives conditioned their greater willingness to finance adaptation on the inclusion — from their point of view — of balanced measures in the energy transition.

This stance produced two key effects: (1) the EU helped ensure approval of the package, avoiding a total impasse; (2) at the same time, its bargaining limited the financial ambition of the final text, contributing to less binding wording on goals and responsibilities. Observers interpreted this strategy as a balance between pro-climate rhetoric and cautious practice — especially relevant after the United States’s direct absence, which altered traditional leadership dynamics.

Objections from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Russia: blocking the fossil roadmap

One of the most sensitive points in the Belém negotiations was the so‑called “roadmap” for moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels — an explicit priority of the Brazilian presidency. Although the initiative gained important political support, especially from the Global South and activist leaders, it did not make it into the final texts due to a lack of consensus. Fossil-fuel-producing countries (notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates), as well as major emitters such as China and India, and to a lesser extent, Russia, and even Japan, raised firm objections.

These objections ranged from practical issues (timing, socioeconomic impacts and energy security) to geopolitical positions defending industrial and revenue interests. For many of these countries, formal commitments to abandon fossil fuels would entail high political and economic costs, requiring guarantees of finance, technology transfer and just treatment for workers and communities. This bloc managed to bar inclusion of the roadmap in the joint decision, relegating it to a parallel initiative — albeit one that faces growing political pressure.

Brazilian diplomatic leadership: sewing consensus and maintaining the agenda

Brazil, as COP30 president, worked intensively to transform the mutirão effort into a political reality. The presidency’s strategy combined multilateral diplomacy (bilateral and multilateral negotiations), global visibility — placing the Amazon at the center of discussions — and bridge-building among groups of countries. The presidency proposed the creation of an international just-transition mechanism, with a draft to be presented by June 2026 and contributions open until March 15, 2026, aiming to establish an instrument to organize finance, technical cooperation and capacity building.

This action produced results: 122 countries presented new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) during COP30, and a package of decisions elevated just transition as an institutional priority. However, the Brazilian effort coexists with internal contradictions — part of the government promoted a roadmap for renewables even as the state authorized oil exploration auctions at the mouth of the Amazon, renewed contracts for gas and coal thermal plants through 2040, and faced a Congress about to review vetoes and make environmental licensing more flexible.

These internal tensions erode the policy coherence needed to transform international commitments into robust domestic policies. Even so, the efforts of Brazilian climate leadership deserve attention and recognition.

Colombia–Netherlands initiative: a promising path to the end of fossil fuels

Facing the impasse on including the energy transition roadmap, Colombia and the Netherlands launched a joint initiative to organize the first international conference on “Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels” in April 2026. This initiative deserves attention and applause for inaugurating an alternative strategic path to the unanimity-based system of UN climate conferences. It points to a promising mobilization of more than 80 countries to address the transition from coal, oil and gas to renewable energies, in parallel with COP processes.

By shifting the debate to a dedicated forum with technical and political focus, the coalition creates space to build operational consensus, finance transition guarantees and design social and labor protections. This parallel path is a necessary complement to global negotiations on the planet’s foremost climate agenda: ending the use of fossil fuels.

Civil society, Indigenous peoples and the pulse of climate democracy

Belém experienced one of the highest levels of civil society participation in COP history after three years of conferences in less receptive environments for public demonstrations. At COP30, more than 3,000 Indigenous people engaged inside and outside the negotiations, defending territorial rights among many demands; hundreds of parallel events addressed themes related to the Amazon’s socioenvironmental values and standing-forest bioeconomy. The streets were filled with a march estimated at 70,000 people — a clear popular demonstration for global climate action. Science was prominent: a scientific pavilion brought climate scientists into direct contact with the COP presidency.

Civil society demanded ambition, integrity of information and climate justice — reinforcing that serious policy must articulate science, human rights and broad social participation. The launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Fund (TFFF), which raised nearly $7 billion, was welcomed by some sectors; others criticized its governance and reliance on private funds, reflecting the debate on financing forest protection without offloading public responsibility.

The end of deforestation by 2030 is an imperative for Brazil to reach its NDC. Efforts have been made to decrease present deforestation to reasonable levels, which will continue in the coming years. Nevertheless, the TFFF figures and other funding sources suggest that they are below the zero-deforestation ambition needs.

The event also exposed shortcomings in COP infrastructure: thermal discomfort in the Amazon heat and humidity, and a small fire that was quickly controlled but interrupted use of some spaces for an afternoon and led to a few hospital visits without major consequences.

What lies ahead

At the slow pace of consensus-based diplomacy, attention now turns to COP31 in Turkey, with Australia chairing negotiations. Key points to watch for a minimally positive meeting include guaranteed and meaningful inclusion of civil society; a real commitment by hosts to halt approval of new coal projects; concrete progress on adaptation finance with numerical targets; operationalization of the just-transition mechanism; and consolidation of technical processes that make the fossil-fuel roadmap a negotiable agenda rather than mere rhetoric. A Pre-COP in the Pacific, responding to the needs of island states threatened by sea-level rise, and the selection of a negotiation president with the capacity to unite interests will be decisive.

COP30 in Belém renewed the political agenda by placing the Amazon at the heart of negotiations and by structuring a joint package of decisions that seeks to reconcile justice, adaptation and transition. At the same time, it made clear that without binding financial commitments, consistent social inclusion and domestic policy coherence, progress will be slow.

The Colombia–Netherlands initiative for a conference dedicated to ending fossil fuels is a promising beacon: it offers a technical-political forum to translate political pressure from Belém into concrete measures. If Brazilian diplomacy and global coalitions can convert the “joint decisions” momentum into operational instruments and real finance, COP30 may be remembered as the starting point of a historic turning point — led, above all, by the civil society that occupied Belém and demonstrated that the world wants, and can, accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.

Geopolitical conflicts and multilateral fissures persist, but Brazilian leadership at this COP advanced agendas despite contradictions. The resistance of oil-producing countries and the absence of the United States shaped resistance to consensus-based diplomatic agreements. Still, Belém sent a strong signal from civil society and a considerable coalition of countries willing to pursue the end of fossil fuels — a positive and promising outcome for a polarized world dominated by the capital of the old fossil economy.

He has led the development of an optimised end-to-end supply chain, delivering value to customers and implementing intelligent supply chain strategies.","Global manufacturing solutions provider Jabil is expanding its partnership with metal parts manufacturer Inno to enhance the production of battery energy storage system (BESS) enclosures.

The move could strengthen the supply chain for a technology that is fundamental to the worldwide transition toward renewable energy.

Their collaboration includes a joint investment in a 15,000-square-metre facility in Rayong, Thailand, which is expected to begin prototyping in late 2026.

Bolstering the BESS value chain

Battery energy storage is crucial for creating a more flexible and resilient energy system. As renewable generation from sources like wind and solar expands, BESS technology fulfils a critical function. It allows for the storage of energy when it is plentiful and its release to the grid during periods of peak demand, or when generation is low stabilising the system and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The partnership between Jabil and Inno – a subsidiary of Shanghai Xinpeng Industry Co. (XP) – builds on a relationship that dates back to 2014. The new facility in Rayong will focus specifically on manufacturing BESS metal enclosures. These components can represent a large portion of overall system costs because of raw material expenses and complex welding requirements.

Traditionally, manufacturers have sourced these enclosures from China before shipping them for final integration in markets closer to the end user. This expanded partnership could enable Jabil to offer a comprehensive lifecycle solution for BESS customers. The process includes sheet metal processing structural section fabrication welding and coating all from a single cost-effective location.

The site’s position just 25km from Laem Chabang, Thailand’s largest port, provides strategic access to global shipping lanes. By localising these manufacturing processes the collaboration could help simplify sourcing and reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-distance transportation.

Building supply chain resilience

Diversifying the supply chain for renewable energy components is becoming increasingly important. Geopolitical uncertainty and tariffs have highlighted the risks of relying on a single region for critical parts. The new Thailand facility offers an alternative manufacturing hub, helping to create a more robust and resilient supply network for the energy sector.

""For over a decade,"" says Brent Tompkins, SVP, Global Business Units, Renewables and Energy Infrastructure, ""our team has helped energy storage leaders design and integrate technologies like battery management systems power electronics and high-level assemblies into their BESS solutions.

""Our customers are increasingly looking to diversify their supply chain in the face of tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty. We're excited to offer this critical industry a vertically integrated solution that meets their needs from enclosure production to final integration and fulfilment while simplifying sourcing and reducing risk.""

Supporting a sustainable energy future

The collaboration is positioned to support the increasing global demand for clean energy. This includes providing the necessary infrastructure to power energy-intensive sectors such as artificial intelligence in a more sustainable way. By improving the accessibility and affordability of BESS technology, the partnership could play a role in accelerating the adoption of renewable power worldwide.

According to Jeffrey Shen, CEO of XP, the joint effort will accelerate Inno’s expansion within the energy storage market.

""Our collaboration with Jabil will accelerate Inno's growth in the energy storage market, bringing the potential of renewable power to more communities around the world, especially in support of the growing energy demand of AI infrastructures globally,"" Jeffrey explains.

""Together we can provide customers with increased supply chain resiliency at a competitive price point.""

As the electrification of transport, buildings and industry continues to gain momentum a reliable supply of energy storage solutions is essential for meeting climate goals and achieving a decarbonised global economy.

IFC’s First Battery Materials Investment in India

This marks IFC’s first direct investment into a battery-materials manufacturing company in India, underlining growing international confidence in the country’s clean-mobility transition. The funding is being made through compulsorily convertible instruments, which will eventually be converted into equity in GFCL EV Products.

IFC’s participation not only provides capital but also enhances the project’s global credibility, helping attract future international financing and partnerships.

GFL’s Vision to Build a World-Class Battery Materials Platform

Gujarat Fluorochemicals, part of the INOXGFL Group, is rapidly emerging as a key player in India’s advanced materials and battery ecosystem. Through its subsidiary, GFCL EV Products, the company is working towards building a large-scale, integrated battery-materials platform capable of serving both domestic and global markets.

The company aims to cover a significant portion of the battery bill of materials (BoM) required for lithium-ion battery manufacturing—positioning India as a serious global competitor in the battery supply chain.

Boost to India’s EV Manufacturing and Clean Energy Ambitions

The new battery-materials facility is expected to:

Accelerate EV production across two-wheelers, three-wheelers, cars and commercial vehicles

Support the fast-growing energy-storage sector for renewable integration

Generate high-value manufacturing jobs

Encourage further foreign investments into India’s EV supply chain

Strengthen India’s position as a future global hub for battery materials and advanced chemistry manufacturing

As EV adoption surges across India, access to domestically sourced battery materials will be critical to ensuring sustainable, cost-competitive, and scalable growth.

Outlook: A Foundational Step for India’s EV Supply Chain

With global battery supply chains facing geopolitical risks and raw-material constraints, the IFC-backed GFL project represents a foundational investment in India’s energy security and clean-mobility future. As domestic EV demand continues to rise and gigafactory investments expand, integrated battery-materials manufacturing will become a cornerstone of India’s next phase of industrial growth.

Summary

Electricity as a Weapon: The Russia-Ukraine war marks the first major conflict where control of electricity infrastructure is central to military strategy and peace negotiations.

Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Plant: Never before has a power plant been part of a peace deal—Russia’s demand for half the output is unprecedented.

Grid Vulnerability: Both Ukraine and Russia are targeting each other’s power grids and energy facilities, with over 1,300 strikes reported against Ukraine’s sector alone.

Energy & Society: Disabling a nation’s electric grid cripples hospitals, emergency services, water, manufacturing, and the ability to wage war.

Rising U.S. Utility Rates: Electricity prices are spiking nationwide, driven by flat supply, soaring demand from AI data centers, and costly policies favoring wind, solar, and batteries.

Land Use Conflicts: Rapid expansion of high-voltage transmission lines, data centers, and renewable projects faces growing local opposition and regulatory hurdles.

Natural Gas Dominance: Despite hopes for nuclear, the U.S. is set to meet surging demand with new natural gas plants, not rapid nuclear deployment.

Labor & Supply Chain Shortages: Construction of new energy infrastructure is being slowed by skilled labor shortages and dependence on critical minerals from abroad.

Political Impact: Electricity affordability is emerging as a top issue for 2025 elections, crossing partisan lines and fueling debates about technology, energy policy, and the future of American industry.

Commodities & the Future: The drive to reshape the U.S. grid, reindustrialize, and support tech growth hinges on access to commodities like copper, uranium, and rare earths.

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Well, if you've been following the news, you know the President is trying to meet with Putin and bring about a peace agreement for the Ukraine war. But one of the big stories about that war is electricity. You haven't heard about it. Joining me on the program is Robert Bryce. Robert, you recently wrote an article called ""Electricity War,"" and I'm just reading here from the opening: more than any conflict in history, the Russia-Ukraine war has been about electricity. So let's talk about that because I hadn't heard that anywhere until I read your piece.

Robert Bryce:

Well, thanks. You know, I've been following the power business for a while. My latest book is A Question of Power: Electricity and the Wealth of Nations. I've done two documentaries on this. This is the world's most important form of energy. And it's clear that when you look at how this war has gone on, electricity has been front and center. I think one of the key points—and what spurred me to write this article, Jim—was that in the 28-point peace proposal or plan that Trump put forward, one of the tenets was that the Russians would get half the output of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. This is unprecedented. In the spoils of war, there has never been a power plant included in any peace deal—this is the very first time. And I think it's the ninth largest nuclear power plant in the world. So clearly, the Russians want this as one of their objectives. And the Trump administration is essentially saying, ""Well, yeah, sure, if that's what you want, we'll give you half the output."" But then you consider the number of attacks—missile attacks, etc.—on nuclear power plants, transformers, and so on, and it's clear this is, in fact, an electricity war.

Jim Puplava:

So when you look at this—and this isn't the first time—you talked about, in the first Gulf War, the U.S.-led bombing campaign nearly destroyed Saddam Hussein's electricity infrastructure. If you take out electricity, just think about the world we live in: you turn on the lights, you have refrigerators, your iPad, iPod, whatever it is. Our society runs on electricity. You take out electricity, what happens?

Robert Bryce:

Well, electricity—the electric grid—is the mother network. It's the network upon which all of our critical societal systems depend: hospitals, water, wastewater, emergency services, communications—all depend on the grid. So it's no surprise that in the Korean War, Vietnam War, and then in the Iraq wars, the electric infrastructure was a prime target for the U.S. military. Now we've seen—I'm just remembering my numbers here—in January, a Ukrainian official claimed Russian forces had launched nearly 1,300 strikes on Ukraine's energy sector, including more than 800 electric substations, distribution and power lines, more than 250 strikes on energy generation facilities, and 30 on gas facilities. Then add in the attacks the Ukrainians have launched on Russian facilities, and again, this is unprecedented—it's never happened at this scale before.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, one of the negotiating items—and Trump didn't do it—but the Ukrainians wanted long-range missiles so they could go farther and damage Russia's energy infrastructure. In your article, you talk about how, if you destroy your adversary's grid, you weaken their entire society, including their ability to wage war.

Robert Bryce:

Well, sure. If you have a nuclear—or any kind of—manufacturing plant to make munitions, missiles, tanks, jeeps, automobiles, bullets, rifles, you need power. If you ruin a country's electric grid, you not only make the overwhelming majority of people in the country miserable, you destroy their ability to manufacture the tools of war. But I think it's also important to remember—here we are in December, Jim, and winter is coming to Ukraine. This was a big threat before: the ability of Ukrainians to keep their power grid up during the depths of winter. Putin has shown no interest in declaring peace or any kind of peace deal, in my view, and I think he'd be happy to just continue the war, continue degrading Ukraine's infrastructure, and force ordinary Ukrainians through another fierce winter. This is a way to wage war. As I ended the piece, Putin now has the ability to weaponize winter, and that sure looks like what he wants to do.

Jim Puplava:

Well, just look at what happened to Europe when he invaded Ukraine. In the case of Germany, where they shut down their nuclear power plants, their gas plants, or their coal plants, they were left stranded and vulnerable to Russian blackmail, essentially.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And remember the Zaporizhzhia plant, which I mentioned before—it has about 5,700 megawatts of generation capacity. As I said, it's the ninth largest nuclear plant in the world. That was one of the first objectives of the Russian invasion. They captured that plant within about two or three weeks—or, I'm sorry, it was just eight days after Putin launched the invasion. So this has been a strategic goal of the Russians from the very beginning: to capture key parts of the Ukrainian power grid.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. I just wonder, if Trump can't get Putin to the table to negotiate peace, if he just gives the Ukrainians long-range missiles, that would escalate the war, but it could get more serious.

Robert Bryce:

Well, exactly. And this has been something—remember, this is a multi-level game at hand here, Jim. So yes, the U.S. could give the Ukrainians long-range missiles, but is Putin just going to see that as an act of war by the Americans, that they're using the Ukrainians now fully as a proxy to attack Russia? Further, we still need the Russians for other reasons. Yes, we've embargoed their oil exports—note, we haven't embargoed their uranium exports. Why? Because still today, about 20% of the nuclear fuel used in the U.S. reactor fleet comes from Russia. So, you know, the possibility of declaring all-out war against Russia is there. I was talking to a relative over the holidays; he said, ""Well, we just haven't pressured the Russians enough."" And I'm thinking, ""Well, the Russians have a lot of cards here too."" NATO—we could talk about NATO, we could talk about a whole lot of other things, but are we really serious about declaring full-scale war on the Russians over Ukraine? I don't think we are. And, you know, do I want my sons—I have two of them—to go to Ukraine to fight the Russians? No. Hell no.

Jim Puplava:

No. It's interesting because we're finding out—like we did with COVID—about supply chain difficulties, where you couldn't get stuff. I mean, I can't think of anything I get from Amazon or something I buy that doesn't say ""Made in China.""

Robert Bryce:

Yeah.

Jim Puplava:

As for rare earths, Russia has a number of key minerals, including uranium. So it really leaves us vulnerable. Now that we're on the topic of electricity, I'd like to transition to probably one of the hottest topics coming up in next year's election, which is affordability. And right at the top of that, Robert, is electricity prices. It was on the ballot in New Jersey—New Jersey utility prices are up 26%. It was on the ballot in Virginia, where most of the world's data centers are located. What we're seeing is politicians and the media blaming three groups: tech companies with their AI data centers, utilities, and then the catch-all—Trump.

Robert Bryce:

Sure.

Jim Puplava:

So let's talk about what is driving these utility costs. We've had discussions in the past—probably for the first time in multiple decades, various utilities are becoming more like growth stocks because of the energy demands for electricity.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And isn't it interesting, Jim, you know, you're an investment guy. For years, the utility sector was viewed as this sleepy part of the business—what you buy for widows and orphans and grandmas; you buy the utility stocks and collect the dividends. Now stocks like Vistra and Constellation have far outperformed the S&P 500 because of the profits they stand to make as independent power producers. Why is that? It's because of this massive increase in demand for power. As you know, Jim, electric demand in the U.S. for the last 20 years has essentially been flat, growing at less than 1% a year. And now, all of a sudden, we're looking at 2, 3, 4% per year growth. The EPRI—the Electric Power Research Institute—is estimating AI is going to need another 50 gigawatts of new generation capacity by 2030. So suddenly, the power business is ""sexy."" And as you point out, in various states across the country, rates are skyrocketing. Why is that? Well, these states, they've been drinking the Kool-Aid on wind, solar, and batteries, and now the bill is coming due. They're finding out they don't have enough power to meet demand. Further, because of AI and data centers, they're trying to build a lot of high-voltage transmission. And what happens in electricity and plumbing—poop rolls downhill. The ratepayers are getting stuck with the bill.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. Let's talk about wind and solar. I live in California, the land of fruits and nuts, and we're a prime example. We've got the highest gasoline prices in the country, the highest tax rates, but also the highest utility prices. That's because in California, we've shut down two nuclear power plants—one's been postponed from shutting down, but we shut down one; we shut down our coal-fired plants, and we built these wind farms and solar panel farms. It produces intermittent power, and we don't have the battery backup to make that consistent.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. And you can't build gas pipelines either. All of these things combined, Jim, are driving up California's power prices. Further, this is just a teaser for what's to come because the utilities in California are still facing net zero mandates. They're going to try to build a lot more wind and solar. They want to push a lot more high-voltage transmission. All of this is incredibly expensive. Just on the transmission side alone, we're talking tens of billions of dollars in additional costs—if those lines can even be built. That's the other part of this: land use conflicts over high-voltage transmission. You mentioned Virginia—whole sections of the state are opposing high-voltage transmission projects proposed to serve data centers. Local folks are saying, ""Look, we don't want these big projects, these power lines coming over our neighborhood. We don't get any benefit from them."" Again, another example of how energy policy and land use policy are interconnected.

Jim Puplava:

You know, it's amazing because we live in this technological society. I just think of all the things I have to charge at night: my iWatch, my iPhone, my iPad, my iMac—all these devices that use electricity, which make our lives convenient and give us what we want. But the other side of that, Robert, is our use of the Internet and AI. We're on e-commerce—think of all that. It requires data centers to house the information we're using. So there seems to be a disconnect between the life I live and what's necessary to produce that life.

Robert Bryce:

Well, it's funny as you say that, Jim. Well, first, on the iWatch—you make a good living; you can afford a good mechanical watch. Maybe you don't have to get a Rolex, but spring for a nice watch! You're too old for those digital things. But you're right, you know, there's this attitude of ""well, I don't want it here, put it somewhere else."" I don't like the term NIMBY—I think it's a slur. Everyone, everywhere cares about their neighborhood. But as you were saying that, it reminds me of the old maxim in the trash business: everybody wants their trash picked up, but nobody wants it put down. That applies, I think, to data centers. The concerns of local communities are real and valid. These data centers—they're big boxes, they're noisy, they draw tremendous amounts of power; nobody lives there, they change the character of neighborhoods, and they're massive power draws. That's why in Ireland, around Dublin, you can't build data centers—there's a prohibition. In New Mexico, new radical rules dramatically reduce where data centers can locate. So this is happening in a lot of places.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we recently interviewed Mark Mills, and he was talking about the amount of electricity and land space. Have you seen the amount of land these buildings occupy? I mean, it's like a miniature city—are they that huge?

Robert Bryce:

Well, interesting you bring that up—my wife Lauren and I just drove back from Denver, and yesterday we went through Abilene and stopped by the Stargate project, OpenAI's data center that's going up there, Jim. It's about two square miles—1,100 acres, so 640 acres per square mile. So more than one and a half square miles. I've been to a county fair and a goat rope; I've seen a few construction sites, but I don't know that I've seen one this big, with that much dirt being moved. You can see it on Google Maps. We drove along one road on just one side of it—it was a full mile. The number of contractors, the cranes—it was truly staggering. If built as Sam Altman says, and that's a big ""if,"" it'll be 5 gigawatts—that's 5,000 megawatts. For comparison, I live in Austin, Texas. Austin Energy, our municipally owned utility, has 4,000 megawatts of installed capacity.

Jim Puplava:

And that's for the whole city.

Robert Bryce:

That's for the whole city of over a million people. So one data center—this big AI project OpenAI is pushing—will use more power than the entire city of Austin. It's just truly staggering in scale.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, I don't think utilities were ready for this kind of demand. Plus, we have an aging infrastructure. And on top of AI, Robert, we also have this reindustrialization. I can't turn on a financial channel each week without seeing another company—this week Eli Lilly—building a $5 billion manufacturing plant. So it's not just AI centers, it's the manufacturing we're trying to bring back and build factories. That's going to take electricity and power. It's enormous.

Robert Bryce:

It is. And as you point out, this whole push has caught the utility sector flat-footed. Also, in terms of capital allocation—you're a numbers guy, a money guy—I just did these calculations. If you look at the big five tech companies—Amazon, Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Apple—their combined market capitalization is around $15 trillion. The combined market cap of 108 U.S. utilities (all electric, gas, water utilities—the biggest in the U.S.) is about $1.6 trillion. Just the big five tech companies are worth $15 trillion and they're demanding massive amounts of power. So it's a mismatch in capital availability, a mismatch in market strength. The big tech companies—there's a queue for gas-fired turbines. How much does it cost to jump the queue? They'll jump the queue. The scale of these buildouts and the amounts of money involved are truly unprecedented.

Jim Puplava:

You know, I just wonder, Robert, if they can even produce this, because we're looking at natural gas for power in the next five years—that's what we see. And then after that, maybe nuclear. If they could accelerate these small nuclear power plants—so you build a data center out in Timbuktu, away from any residential area, and then pop in a small nuclear power plant. It seems that would be a solution, but you've got to get through the regulatory red tape and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Robert Bryce:

Sure. I like how you put that—""pop one in,"" like it's a car battery or something. Easy to say, Jim. I'm adamantly pro-nuclear and have been saying the same thing for 15 years: natural gas to nuclear. But it's clear—and I've lectured on this; I'm going to be in Orlando next week talking about this very thing. The caption for my presentation is ""AI, Gas, and the Grid."" There is simply no way nuclear is going to provide any sizable amount of new power to the AI/data center race. It's all going to be gas. Why? Because we can't deploy new nuclear fast enough. I think we'll be lucky to deploy 10 gigawatts of new nuclear by 2035. We'll probably build 100 gigawatts of new gas by then. So it's a gas story. AI is a gas story—full stop.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, we're invested in natural gas and pipelines for that very reason. Because I know the way Washington works—the red tape and bureaucracy you have to go through. And not only that, Robert, it's like we're finding with technology—we can't make this high-tech stuff without rare earth minerals, and you can't run nuclear power plants without uranium, and we're dependent on foreigners for a lot of this.

Robert Bryce:

Well, you're right. I've written a lot about China, supply chains, and rare earths. You're absolutely right—copper is a strategic element. But don't forget the rare earths are also critical for nuclear: samarium, gadolinium, europium, dysprosium—several are required by the nuclear sector. None of this happens in a vacuum. Just back to the SMR story—I published a piece a few days ago about the collapse in share prices of several pure-play SMR companies: Oklo, NuScale, Terrestrial, and Nano Nuclear in November. Mr. Market has been looking at those companies and saying, ""I'm not sure I buy this story,"" because they're all many years away from commercial deployment and even further from profitability. They'll have to raise billions in new capital, and at NuScale for one, they're massively diluting existing shareholders. I'm hopeful for SMRs, but I wouldn't bet against the incumbent companies like GE Vernova and BWX Technologies—they have big balance sheets, lots of experience in manufacturing, they're not startups, and they know what they're doing when it comes to building reactors.

Jim Puplava:

Oh, absolutely. So how do you think this plays out? Next year is a key congressional election, and the number one issue on the ballot is going to be affordability. With affordability, they're really talking about electricity. If we're talking about rising food costs, I can make some substitutes—maybe buy fresh food instead of packaged, or go to a lower cut of beef. I've noticed in our supermarket they've got lower cuts of beef, which are cheaper. Costco cleared out a good portion of their beef section and is featuring seafood, which is cheaper. But with electricity, you can't substitute. You either turn on the lights or you don't. So how do you think this plays out? It's shaping up to be the number one issue in the election next year.

Robert Bryce:

It is interesting, Jim, and it could be one of those rare issues where Democrats and Republicans align. It's a populist issue. For instance, Josh Hawley—a Republican in Missouri—railed against the Grain Belt Express high-voltage transmission line and got it killed. In Virginia, as you pointed out, candidates ran against data centers, saying they'll make them pay their fair share. That's Democrats running against big tech—and nobody likes big tech. So how this shakes out will be really interesting in November. Republicans may be on the defensive because Trump has had the big tech bros in the Oval Office and at the inauguration. Does he really want to stand next to Zuckerberg and Bezos as they build these data centers, or will he flip the script and say he's for consumers now? To be clear, we can't blame all the electricity price rises on data centers and big tech, but they're an easy target. This is about land use, affordability, local neighborhood issues—and these cross partisan lines.

Jim Puplava:

You know, this is the problem with the media today. It's easy, when there's a particular problem, to find somebody to blame it on—""Okay, it's the tech guys, that's why this is going on."" It's a lot more complex, as you talk about in your article and others have discussed: the green transition, more wind and solar, distant transmission lines, distribution rates, and so on. It's more complex, but if you can find someone to blame, it makes the story simple—""Ah, okay, it's the tech guys.""

Robert Bryce:

Well, I take your point. I'll add that what I fear—and I think my fear is well-founded—is that the big investor-owned utilities are only focused on their massive capital expenditure programs for the next few years: funding new high-voltage transmission, funding new generation. While they may not be able to say this is all for data centers, to them it doesn't matter. I've watched this for a long time. What do the big utilities care about? Getting as much of their expenditures into the rate base as possible. So far, public utility commissions have said, ""Sure, no problem."" We've seen that here in Texas, with Oncor proposing a 765kV line running from east to west out to the Permian Basin. The demand is in the Permian. Why build a power line across the state? Makes no sense—unless you're a utility that wants a rate base and an $80 billion project. Then it makes a lot of sense.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah. So this is going to play out. It's going to be the number one issue. It's funny—as you mentioned, we started out thinking about utilities. Me, being in the investment business, if I had someone older, conservative, wanted income, I'd put them in utilities: bread and butter, safe, not volatile. It's a whole different ballgame today with utilities.

Robert Bryce:

Oh, absolutely. It's interesting to take a step back and look at the utility sector and what's happening in commodities. I haven't checked the natural gas price today, but this cold spell has hit—sent gas prices up, I think it's over $5, the Henry Hub spot price. Remember, just two years ago, the average price for natural gas in the U.S. was $2.20. We're now more than double that. Then add in what we're seeing in the copper market, uranium, rare earths, all of these technologies require digging stuff out of the ground—and a lot of stuff. That's going to be a pinch point. I'll just add one other quick point: it's also about labor, Jim. This is another macro theme we've talked about before. You can talk about building all the data centers in the world, but you have to have skilled labor—men and some women willing to be there in the mud, cold, dark, and rain. The supply of those workers is very tight right now.

Jim Puplava:

Oh, it's incredible. I just added onto my house—putting in a hyperbaric chamber. I had an electrician out for three 20-amp circuits to power this, six hours a day: $1,500. If I had kids today thinking about college, I'd say go to trade school. You can become an electrician and in a couple of years you're making six figures. Here's an interesting thing I'll throw—

Robert Bryce:

And you happily paid that $1,500 too, didn't you? It wasn't a big expense for you, but to get it done right, you paid that. That's what we're seeing. I was at a conference a few weeks ago—a man who runs a lot of linemen, journeyman linemen. He's seeing other companies poaching his people, paying as much as $500 per day per diem to work in remote areas. The wage war to capture these skilled laborers is another big inflationary part of the economy that doesn't get much attention.

Jim Puplava:

Well, and this is something you're seeing—what's rather interesting, I'm looking at this from maybe a 40,000-foot level—but if you look at the '70s and '80s, we outsourced manufacturing, so we got the rust belt, blue-collar workers lost their jobs. Now, with AI, it's white-collar jobs being lost. The Wall Street Journal recently said it'll be the worst job market for graduating seniors next year. I can't turn on or pick up a newspaper without seeing some company laying off workers—Amazon, 40,000, because of AI. So to me, we don't have enough electricians, welders, plumbers, carpenters. Life is looking good for a blue-collar worker or tradesman over the next decade.

Robert Bryce:

Auto mechanics—I'll add that in. That's another key issue. There was also one—yes, using Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the Economic Policy and Innovation Center came out with a report last month. Since 1995, the participation rate in the labor force of men aged 16 to 24 has dropped from 71% to 55%, along with all the other social pathologies associated with increased loneliness, time online, and disengagement from social groups. The decline in labor force connection promises more social and economic problems. It's not just the folks our age—the people in their dotage, right? The workforce of the future is shrinking, and the men who should be starting their careers are dropping out of the workforce. That's very worrisome.

Jim Puplava:

It's an incredible time. We're going through probably one of the biggest transitions. I don't think we've fully grasped what's happening: reshoring, supply chain shortages we're trying to correct. We're scrambling to catch up for policy mistakes, in my opinion, made three or four decades ago.

Robert Bryce:

It is. It's funny you say that because I ask people about this a lot—is it more uncertain now? I have the sense, as you do, that we're in conflict with China—some of that self-imposed, right? Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs. I won't say we're at the brink of war with Russia, but we're in conflict. We have a president who one day goes this way, the next day the other. We're shooting supposed drug smugglers in the water—wait a minute! The level of uncertainty, economically, with massive debt in the U.S., where we're paying more for our debt than for national defense, upheaval in commodity markets, layoffs in oil, tech, and retail—it's an incredible amount of uncertainty. I wish I knew what was going to happen next, but I'm just trying to be defensive, be smart, and plan to keep working because I'm too young to retire—what else would I do?

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, it's amazing. We certainly live in interesting times. We shifted, Robert, probably three or four years ago—I'm now a little over 30% in commodities for clients: oil, gas, gold, silver, uranium, all these things. All this stuff we're trying to do—reshoring, the grid, energy—it takes raw materials. The government even came out and declared copper a strategic material. Silver is now a strategic material. We want to make all this stuff, but to do that—especially if you're bringing back manufacturing—you need commodities. You need stuff to make stuff.

Robert Bryce:

You're right. Let me see—I'm just looking at the Henry Hub price today. The front month price for January delivery is $5.31. What a massive jump. Of course, it's winter and prices always go up, but we've also seen the massive run-up in copper. Copper has been fairly flat for a while, but now, with the problems at the Grasberg mine in Indonesia, copper's at $5.37 per pound—that's up 35% for the year. Silver's up over 100%. Gold's up 60%. Platinum's up 84%. It truly is a remarkable time. Even despite the run-up in gas prices, U.S. natural gas is still about half the cost of Europe or Asia. The key for the U.S. is to keep energy and power cheap, abundant, and reliable. That's the key to maintaining the U.S. advantage over the rest of the world.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, was on this week talking about how, if it weren't for the energy coming out now with the Trump administration taking off regulations, what he's trying to do and what other tech companies are trying to do wouldn't be possible. It's impossible.

Robert Bryce:

It's—AI is a power play. It's a play for watts. There was an interesting article the other day about Nvidia's chipsets: their power density, their power demand, keeps going up. It's a little counterintuitive to me, Jim, because my fifth book was Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper. The history of the computer age has been just that—smaller, faster, lighter, denser, cheaper—since ENIAC. The power demand went down, and the computing power went up. But now, with large language models and the rest, even with the increased efficiency of chips, the data demand and computational power demand have grown so fast that the power sector can't keep up with the compute sector.

Jim Puplava:

I've watched this over three or four decades. Right now, it's sort of the NIMBY idea: we don't want data centers; big tech are the bad people; utilities are also bad. Maybe we'll go against them or see what politicians try to do. Then we'll start having energy shortages, blackouts, because we don't have enough energy. Then the pendulum swings in the opposite direction.

Robert Bryce:

It may well be, but I think the land use conflicts are not going away. What still beggars belief is how—now, I have plenty of criticisms of the Trump administration, plenty—but on the energy front, I think they've been absolutely right on pretty much everything. What we haven't seen, Jim, is a similar move in Europe. Instead, the Brits, Germans, the EU—Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission—just yesterday or the day before said, ""We're moving toward energy independence."" I thought, ""You are so blind, you don't know what you're talking about,"" because they continue to think they're going to solve energy problems with wind, solar, and batteries. Just since January 1 in England, Ireland, and Scotland, there have been, I think, 65 rejections of wind and solar projects. So the idea that they're going to run on wind and solar—you can't build it. Local communities all over the British Isles are saying, ""Take this stuff and put it somewhere else.""

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, it's amazing. You keep talking about this land use thing—it's not only just the land use for wind farms and solar, but now you throw in data centers. And let's not forget, if you're going to build something like a Taiwan Semiconductor plant in Phoenix or Intel or Apple, those plants take massive amounts of land. We want to bring back all these factories, but you can't just go in the middle of a city, tear down buildings, and put up a two-square-mile manufacturing plant.

Robert Bryce:

That's certainly true. I mentioned I was in Abilene just yesterday, and this Stargate project is located northwest of Abilene. It's just a big area with cattle grazing and mesquite and huisache—so there's plenty of land in Texas, but that's not necessarily the case in Virginia, Data Center Alley near Dulles Airport. That's very land-constrained. The theme we're seeing with data centers is that the latest numbers show that some of the biggest installations are going where the gas is. I mentioned Abilene—almost spitting distance from the Permian Basin. In that part of Texas, natural gas is super cheap and abundant. Same in the Haynesville—Entergy is building a big gas-fired plant in Louisiana for Facebook. In Ohio, over the Utica, Facebook is building more capacity. In Pennsylvania, near the Marcellus, a lot of data centers are going in there. The hyperscalers—the big tech companies—are putting data centers where the gas is because that's their only way to get the power they need. It's a gas-to-power play.

Jim Puplava:

All right, well, Robert, as we close, any parting thoughts? Do you think Putin settles with Trump and the Ukrainians on this?

Robert Bryce:

Well, he hasn't settled yet. We've been looking at this same deal for two, three weeks now. I don't know. I wish he would, Jim. I hope and pray there's some settlement, but I don't see what—Trump's motivation is clear: he wants to see an end to this and call himself the peacemaker. But what's Putin's motivation to quit? I think he has a lot of incentives to keep the war going. I hope I'm wrong, but as he hasn't quit now, what incentives have changed that would make him do something different? From everything I hear—and it's only that—the Russian economy is doing fine. The longer the war goes, the more Putin is fine with that. As brutal as that is, I don't wish it to be true, but that's what it appears.

Jim Puplava:

Well, it's amazing because if he's successful in Ukraine, he's also been poking around in Europe. It's like resurrecting the old Soviet empire.

Robert Bryce:

It's a dangerous time. It's delicate to figure out the right way forward. I pray for peace, but I'm trying to be as sober about this as everything else. I want a good outcome, but again, this is just one of many uncertainties in a world that seems as fraught and dangerous as any time in my adult life.

Jim Puplava:

Hopefully, we can bring the country together on things, because at least in my lifetime, I've never seen the country as divided as it is today. You'd probably have to go back to the Civil War to see this much division.

Robert Bryce:

That's a good point. I don't know that that's true—I guess Ken Burns has a line, he's been talking lately, he has a new documentary coming out, and he said, ""The country has always been divided. What's different now?"" I think that's probably true. But the vitriol is what's been hard, and unfortunately, the Trump administration has fanned the flames of some of that. The midterms are going to be interesting. I'm curious to see who's going to run in '28—who the Democrats will put up. It's clear Gavin Newsom is running. But who's going to prevail on the Republican side? Economics and affordability, particularly on energy, as you've talked about, will be front and center.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, well, it looks like, at least from what I'm following, it could be Newsom and AOC. Among the candidates, Newsom seems to be at the top right now.

Robert Bryce:

He has the money, he's from a big state with a lot of electoral votes. He says he hasn't decided—he's decided. But he's from California, and as you say, the land of fruits and nuts. I think Republicans will say, ""Do you really want a California-style regime nationally with all these insane climate policies?"" They can point to his record on housing, a lot of things—he's vulnerable on his own record. There's no doubt the Democratic Party has moved further left and is now really the party of AOC, but Newsom—don't count him out. He's movie-star handsome, very good on the stump, but it's going to be a battle royale on the Republican side.

Jim Puplava:

Well, we live in interesting times. I'm just glad I own hard assets for my clients and we own some growth utilities. It's a different market. That's one of the things I've seen in the market over the years—every decade brings a different kind of cycle, stocks that drive it. Right now, I see the drive in commodity-type stocks. But anyway, as always, it's a pleasure having you on the program. I read your article, ""The Electricity War,"" and I hadn't heard anyone talk about that. So I wanted to have you on. You're my electricity man, my expert buddy.

Robert Bryce:

That's very kind, thanks. Don't forget robertbryce.substack.com.

Jim Puplava:

Hey Robert, tell them about your two documentary films—they're excellent. If you really want to understand electricity and what's going on, people should go watch them. They're very interesting and well done.

Robert Bryce:

Thank you. I've actually made a couple of mini-documentaries—""mini docs""—with my daughter Mary. One is ""Shrinking Fission"" on SMRs, about seven minutes. We also made one earlier this year called ""Sunblock: The Global Fight to Save Farmland from Big Solar."" I also did a feature-length documentary in 2019 with Tyson Culver called ""Juice: How Electricity Explains the World""—that's at juicethemovie.com. Then we did a five-part docuseries called ""Juice: Power, Politics, and the Grid."" Each segment's about 20 minutes, available at juicetheseries.com. All are free on YouTube. I'm easy to find—just search Robert Bryce on YouTube or Google. Thank you. I'm very proud of all the documentaries we've done—I'm very lucky to do what I do. It's my purpose and my passion, and I love to talk about this stuff.

Jim Puplava:

Well, you're very good at it, so I appreciate you coming on the program. Happy holidays, Merry Christmas, and a prosperous new year.

Robert Bryce:

Awesome. Thanks, Jim.

The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns. This poses many risks to all forms of life, according to the United Nations Climate Action.

Here are some benefits of fighting climate change from various sources, including Yale Climate Connections.

The benefits of fighting climate change

Cleaner air leads to fewer pollution-related illnesses, which means less money spent on medical treatments and fewer hospital admissions.

Reducing emissions helps prevent crop losses, which can save billions of dollars annually and enhance food security.

Transitioning to clean energy means investment in building new infrastructure like solar, wind farms, and manufacturing clean vehicles, creating demand for skilled jobs like engineers, electricians, and construction workers.

In most parts of the world, new renewable energy projects are already the most affordable source of power.

Energy efficiency upgrades in homes and buildings can lead to substantial reductions in energy bills for households.

Investing in clean energy can decouple economies from the volatile price swings and geopolitical shocks of the global fossil fuel market.

Here are some ways climate change impacts daily life from various sources, including the Environmental Defense Fund.

Higher grocery prices due to crop failures.

Increased energy bills from heatwaves.

Infrastructure damage from floods.

Health risks include heat stress and respiratory issues.

Inaction on climate change exposes economies to massive costs from extreme weather events, infrastructure damage, and agricultural losses, according to the World Resources Institute. The global economic benefits from avoided damages and short-term improvements could increase globally by up to 3% by 2050.

By reducing emissions, climate action lessens the frequency and intensity of these costly disruptions.

Taking climate action in the United States can save at least $4 billion by the end of the century on road maintenance alone, according to Yale Climate Connections.

Article content

This revelation, emerging from life-cycle and supply chain audits, exposes the false claim behind Ottawa’s more than $50 billion experiment. A Volvo study found that manufacturing an EV generates 70 per cent more emissions than building a comparable conventional vehicle because battery production is energy-intensive and often powered by coal in countries such as China. Depending on the electricity grid, it can take years or never for an EV to offset that initial carbon debt.

Prime Minister Mark Carney paused the federal electric vehicle (EV) mandate for 2026 due to public pressure and corporate failures while keeping the 2030 and 2035 targets. The mandate requires 20 per cent of new vehicles sold in 2026 to be zero-emission, rising to 60 per cent in 2030 and 100 per cent in 2035. Carney inherited this policy crisis but is reluctant to abandon it.

Industry failures and Trump tariffs forced Ottawa’s hand. Northvolt received $240 million in federal subsidies for a Quebec battery plant before filing for bankruptcy. Lion Electric burned through $100 million before announcing layoffs. Arrival, a U.K.-based electric van and bus manufacturer, collapsed entirely. Stellantis and LG Energy Solution extracted $15 billion for Windsor. Volkswagen secured $13 billion for St. Thomas.

The federal government committed more than $50 billion in subsidies and tax credits to prop up Canada’s EV industry. Ottawa defended these payouts as necessary to match the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, which offers major incentives for EV and battery manufacturing. That is twice Manitoba’s annual operating budget. Every Manitoban could have had a two-year tax holiday with the public money Ottawa wasted on EVs.

Even with incentives, EVs reached only 15 per cent of new vehicle sales in 2024, far short of the mandated levels for 2026 and 2030. When federal subsidies ended in January 2025, sales collapsed to nine per cent, revealing the true level of consumer demand. Dealer lots overflowed with unsold inventory. EV sales also slowed in the U.S. and Europe in 2024, showing that cooling demand is a broader trend.

As economist Friedrich Hayek observed, “The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.” Politicians and bureaucrats cannot know what millions of Canadians know about their own needs. When federal ministers mandate which vehicles Canadians must buy and which companies deserve billions, they substitute the judgment of a few hundred officials for the collective wisdom of an entire market.

Bureaucrats draft regulations that determine the vehicles Canadians must purchase years from now, as if they can predict technology and consumer preferences better than markets.

Green ideology provided perfect cover. Invoke a climate emergency and fiscal responsibility vanishes. Question more than $50 billion in subsidies and you are labelled a climate denier. Point out the environmental costs of battery production, and you are accused of spreading misinformation.

History repeatedly teaches that central planning always fails. Soviet five-year plans, Venezuela’s resource nationalization and Britain’s industrial policy failures all show the same pattern. Every attempt to run economies from political offices ends in misallocation, waste and outcomes opposite to those promised. Concentrated political power cannot ever match the intelligence of free markets responding to real prices and constraints.

Markets collect information that no central planner can access. Prices signal scarcity and value. Profits and losses reward accuracy and punish error. When governments override these mechanisms with mandates and subsidies, they impair the information system that enables rational economic decisions.

The EV mandate forced a technological shift and failed. Billions in subsidies went to failing companies. Taxpayers absorbed losses while corporations walked away. Workers lost their jobs.

Canada needs a full repeal of the EV mandate and a retreat from PMO planners directing market decisions. The law must be struck, not paused. The contrived 2030 and 2035 targets must be abandoned.

Markets, not cabinet ministers, must determine what technologies Canadians choose.

At a hearing before the Pennsylvania House Committee on Energy, several witnesses cautioned against the bill’s renewable mandate.
Josh Shapiro should drop his own attempts to tax reliable energy sources and force renewable energy on consumers.
Or are we truly going to work toward Pennsylvania energy dominance?","In July, nearly two dozen companies gathered in Pittsburgh, along with President Donald Trump and other leaders, to announce investments in data centers and needed energy infrastructure. Totaling more than $90 billion, the expenditures would equal nearly ten percent of Pennsylvania’s gross domestic product, inducing a headline that described the prospect as “truly mind-blowing.”

Since then, some have begun erecting regulatory obstacles to this development. Presented as consumer protections, many are more likely to be economy killers — and “mind-blowing” for would-be reformers of 164,000 regulations already dampening Pennsylvania’s business climate.

Consider a six-bill package introduced by seven Democrat members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives “to encourage the responsible development of A.I. data centers addressing water and energy use, emergency preparedness,” and more.

Pennsylvania has power plants, steel mills, factories, coal mines, and acres of warehouses–all of which deal with a host of regulations to address these same issues. One bill would impose energy-efficiency standards on data centers when there is no more powerful incentive for prudent use of resources than the profit motive.

Why are lawmakers specifically targeting these information processors?

“This is an attempt to throttle new data centers to prevent more natural gas from being used to power them,” writes Jim Willis, publisher of Marcellus Drilling News. “‘Responsible development’ is code for no development.”

A seventh House bill, titled the “Data Center Act,” would require the eponymous facilities to get at least 25 percent of their energy from so-called renewable sources, defined as wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric.

Such market meddling has contributed to rising electricity prices and a more fragile power grid by giving preferential treatment to expensive and unreliable energy sources–particularly wind and solar. Moreover, misguided policies have shortened or ended operations for more practical technologies, such as coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.

At a hearing before the Pennsylvania House Committee on Energy, several witnesses cautioned against the bill’s renewable mandate. They included Stephen DeFrank, chairman of the state Public Utility Commission; Joe Bowring, an independent market monitor with PJM Interconnection; Dr. Amy Brinton, director of government affairs with the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry; Rob Bair, president of the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council; and Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy with the Data Center Coalition.

State Rep. Mike Armanini, one of at least two Republican committee members opposing the mandate, noted that a 2019 proposal by then-Gov. Tom Wolf to impose a tax on fossil fuels had discouraged investment in natural gas plants. He also said that another House committee “would kill the natural gas industry” with a proposal to establish a gas-well setback of nearly a mile.

State Rep. Rob Matzie, a Democrat and the bill’s prime sponsor, agreed that avoiding overregulation was important. But Matzie insisted that policymakers should “promulgate some regulations early from a temporary perspective, and then move forward.”

Perhaps Matzie is testing political winds with the mandate provision. However, once enacted, most regulations are about as “temporary” as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Enacted two decades ago, the state’s Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS) cost electricity customers more than $700 million in 2024 in compliance costs alone. Meanwhile, the wind and solar energy it subsidizes remains unreliable and too expensive to survive in a free market.

In Arizona, regulators have voted unanimously to begin repealing that state’s version of AEPS, reports the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Rating states based on various policies, ALEC ranks Arizona near the top nationally, at second and sixth for economic performance and economic outlook, respectively. On the other hand, Pennsylvania’s rankings are a pathetic 44th and 36th.

Noting Arizona’s economic success, ALEC partially credits the state’s “infrastructure capacity to support resource-intensive industries,” such as data centers that “require dependable, uninterrupted sources of baseload electricity to stay operational.”

If there is to be legislation on data centers, a proposal by state Sen. Camera Bartolotta offers a more viable solution. Barlotta’s bill would expedite permits for projects that meet or exceed federal standards.

Better still would be fulfilling the promise of broad permitting reform in a recent budget agreement. And while budget negotiations ended the threatened implementation of Wolf’s 2019 tax on fossil fuels, Gov. Josh Shapiro should drop his own attempts to tax reliable energy sources and force renewable energy on consumers.

As Rep. Armanini put it: “What are we going to do with Pennsylvania? Are we going to overregulate it and not let [the energy] industry grow? Or are we truly going to work toward Pennsylvania energy dominance? … We need to get into the game of being competitive.”

A competitive Pennsylvania is not out of reach. Thankfully, regulatory reform found its way into the newly minted state budget, suggesting the push for commonsense regulation is quickly gaining momentum in Harrisburg.

In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.
Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.
Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean.
And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.","Nearly a decade ago, when the energy storage market was in its infancy, an industry organization set a dreamy goal: By the end of 2025, the U.S. would deploy 35 gigawatts of batteries connected to the grid.

So how’d the storage industry do? In the third quarter, 4.7 gigawatts of batteries were installed. In sum, more than 40 gigawatts have been deployed, and the year isn’t over, Canary Media reported. In eight years, energy storage went from a tiny player to one of the largest sources of new power on the U.S. grid.

What’s more, that’s nearly half of all new renewable power deployed on the grid for July through September, and this year, renewables have been the leading source of all new capacity, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Much of the new storage capacity has been deployed in Arizona, California, and Texas, states where the grid has been strained in recent years. Experts say that lessons learned there can help other regions deploy battery storage onto their grids, including the Midwest and East Coast, which are buckling under the weight of new data center construction.

Startups have been taking note.

Redwood Materials, which was co-founded by Tesla alumnus JB Straubel, in June added a new business line focused on repurposing used EV batteries for grid-scale storage. The company noticed two overlapping trends: The batteries that were arriving at its recycling facilities still had plenty of life left in them, and meanwhile, the battery storage industry was growing in leaps and bounds.

By 2028, Redwood plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours’ worth of battery storage. Investors have voiced their approval, investing another $350 million in the company to propel the new business line.

Another startup, Base Power, has taken a slightly different tack, leasing batteries to homeowners and aggregating them to serve as a large virtual power plant. The Austin-based startup raised $1 billion in October to help build a battery factory and fuel its expansion beyond Texas. The company has deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours of batteries in Texas.

While lithium-ion batteries have dominated new installations, other startups are pursuing other technologies that could lower storage costs significantly.

Sizable Energy is working on a novel way to store power in flexible reservoirs that float in the open ocean. Fourth Power is using blocks of carbon to store heat at super-high temperatures, and it’s looking to deploy them in 2028 at a cost that’s lower than lithium-ion batteries or peaking natural gas power plants. XL Batteries is deploying its flow-battery technology at petrochemical storage sites, allowing it to store hundreds of megawatt-hours using existing infrastructure. And, Cache Energy has developed inexpensive pellets of calcium hydroxide that could store energy for months with minimal losses.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Modular_Data_Center_2.jpg?resize=1200,675",N,,2025-12-06 11:03:52.258535

Pacific Gas & Electric, which owns the Diablo Canyon Power Plant, needs approval from the Coastal Commission to keep it running after it was scheduled to shut down this year. It’s one of the last permits needed to stay open after lawmakers approved it to continue operating until 2030.

Although situated 325 miles north of San Diego on the Central Coast, what happens within the plant’s concrete domes has implications for the Southern California metropolitan area, too.

Ahead of next week’s meeting, I wanted to get a better understanding of Diablo Canyon’s importance, the decades-long controversy that surrounds it, and what its continued operation means for ratepayers in San Diego.

Why Lawmakers Are Talking About the Plant Now

Diablo Canyon is a 40-year-old power plant in Avila Beach that generates about 9 percent of the state’s total energy. Its towering concrete cylinders and highlighter-green control room simulator are a snapshot in time, largely unchanged from when the plant began operating. Plans to phase it out in 2025 commenced nearly a decade ago.

Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2022 authorized the plant to stay open past its scheduled closure this year after heat-related blackouts the year prior sparked concerns over the reliability of California’s power grid.

Lawmakers pushed through a $1.4 billion state loan to keep it open, against the wishes of some Democrats skeptical of continuing to include nuclear power in the state’s portfolio of clean energy.

The Plant Remains Controversial Despite Growing Popularity of Nuclear Energy

The plant has been marred by controversy since it began operating off the San Luis Obispo coast in 1985. Advocacy groups such as Mothers for Peace have scrutinized its two nuclear reactors for decades over concerns about its waste, which remains radioactive for centuries.

Critics also point to the 2.5 billions of gallons of sea water it pulls in from the Pacific Ocean each day to cool its systems, its damage to marine life, and crisscrossing earthquake fault lines near its reactors as other dangers.

PG&E has maintained the plant is safe to operate and produces little carbon pollution, something proponents of nuclear energy and policymakers have largely embraced as the need for energy continues to grow statewide and nuclear reactors become a more attractive option.

Costs to Keep the PG&E Plant Open Are Hitting Ratepayers’ Pocketbooks, Including in San Diego

How the operators will afford to keep the plant running has been a questionever since lawmakers approved the $1.4 billion loan to keep it open for the next five years, which was to be paid back through federal loans and, if those didn’t fully materialize, profits generated from 2029 to 2030.

As much as $588 million is unlikely to come in, due to insufficient federal funding and projected profits, a report by CalMatters found.

Last year, the California Public Utilities Commission approved $722 million in ratepayer funds to go toward the plant’s operating costs this year. Those rate hikes were spread across customers of all the major investor-owned companies for the first time in history, including Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, because its power helps offset costs for all customers, PG&E said at the time.

That meant SDG&E customers paid $2 a month on average this year to help fund the plant, according to reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle.

The legislation to keep Diablo Canyon open, SB 846, allowed PG&E to do this because it’s seen as an asset to everyone in the state. PG&E has forecast it will cost SDG&E customers $12.6 million in 2026.

This is in addition to rising electricity bills for Californians, which are already among the highest in the country.

Nuclear energy critics and consumer advocates say that burdening ratepayers to fund Diablo Canyon and its environmental impacts are reasons to demand certain conservation requirements from the company to move forward with the permitting process.

The Coastal Commission Is Requiring PG&E to Conserve Land Around the Plant to Keep Operating

Last month, commission staff recommended that 1,100 of the 12,000 acres owned by the company at the site be set aside for conservation and public access to compensate for the estimated 2.5 billion larval fish the plant damages each year.

They also recommended increasing the acreage amount from 1,100 to 3,300 if the plant is approved to operate past 2030, which PG&E is seeking to do with federal regulators.

Commissioners took issue with the staff’s recommendation, wanting more concessions from the company to conserve a larger portion of the Diablo Canyon lands before giving the OK.

This is what the Dec. 11 hearing will be about, and commissioners are expected to approve the permit.

Sen. John Laird and Assemblymember Dawn Addis, both Democrats, wrote a letter to the commission ahead of its November meeting urging them to require PG&E to conserve more land because there was no guarantee that the state would allow the plant to continue running past 2030.

“We are not attempting to reject this permit application to extend Diablo Canyon’s operation until 2030,” Laird said in a statement after the November meeting. “The issue before the commission is rather how much of the Diablo Canyon lands to protect.”

In a 49-45 vote, the Senate passed a resolution overturning a 2024 Interior Department plan that would have limited oil and gas lease sales to about 400,000 acres within the 1.56-million-acre Arctic Wildlife Refuge. One Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, voted with Democrats to oppose the resolution. The legislation is now on the president’s desk awaiting signature.

Federal lease sales in Alaska will now revert to a framework developed in 2020 by the Trump administration that had opened most of the Coastal Plain to oil and gas development. In October, the Interior Department said it would move to restore lease sales to the entire Coastal Plain as part of Trump’s U.S. energy dominance agenda.

The president’s One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, includes provisions mandating six oil and gas lease sales in the Cook Inlet Planning Area in Alaska’s federal waters between 2026 and 2032, compared to two auctions covering the same area during the Biden administration.

Alaska’s all-Republican congressional delegation introduced and cosponsored the legislation. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said after the vote that a return to “balanced management” on the Coastal Plain will support U.S. energy independence.

Kristen Moreland, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, a group formed in 1988 by Alaska Natives opposed to oil drilling on the Coastal Plain, said the Senate vote ignored local concerns. The group has said the Coastal Plain is a critical habitat for Porcupine caribou.

“This action from DC ignores years of consultation and communication with our Gwich’in communities that rely on this landscape for not only our subsistence and survival, but also our culture and spiritual health and well-being,” Moreland said on the group’s website. “We stand united in our opposition to any oil and gas development in the Arctic Refuge and will continue to fight this effort from the Trump administration and decision-makers who ignore our voices.”

Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization, also said the vote prioritizes energy production over wildlife protections.

Groups supporting the push to open the Refuge to energy production include Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, whose members include leaders living in the North Slope region; Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp, the village corporation for Kaktovik, the only community located within the coastal plain; and North Slope Borough, a local government organization in Alaska that supports resource development to fund essential services like schools, infrastructure and emergency services.

As mandated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2017, the first-ever lease sale of tracts in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge occurred on Jan. 6, 2021.

Seven of the nine bids accepted at the 2021 auction went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state-owned corporation, but those leases were canceled by the Biden administration in September 2023.

Chase. The failure, according to a press release, could lead to increased hazardous air pollutants being released into the environment.

The penalties the company faces include three years of probation, 500 hours of community service to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara (MHA) Nation, and payment of a $500,000 National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) Clean Air Act violation fine.

Targa Badlands LLC had pleaded guilty to the offense earlier this year.

According to the press release, Targa Badlands LLC was also responsible for self-identifying, self-reporting, and correcting the failure.

“Today’s sentence underscores the importance of enforcing our environmental laws, which protect the land, water, and communities,” said US Attorney Chase. “At the same time, we recognize that Targa Badlands LLC took responsibility for its actions and self-reported the violation. Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly. This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”

Under NESHAP, Targa Badlands LLC was required to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems on two engines in the Johnson Compressor Station, located in Dunn County. Targa Badlands LLC operated the Station between 2018 and 2022. Continuous parameter monitoring systems monitor and collect data on temperature and pressure for engine operations to ensure the catalyst is being utilized properly, thereby ensuring that the engine does not produce excess emissions.

The 2025 case against Targa Badlands LLC followed two earlier occasions in which the company had agreed to pay civil penalties to the United States for separate NESHAP violations pertaining to natural gas compressor stations operated by the company on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, according to a press statement.

And ultimately, by elevating issues such as technology transfer in Belém, Brazil flexed its influence as a middle power on the world stage.
The climate conference in the jungle made clear that the global energy transition is moving forward without the White House.","At the Polycrisis, we’ve been charting the shifting relationship between climate policy and geopolitics. We have been especially interested in two shifts. The first is the mainstream recognition that action on climate means meaningful action on development goals. The second is the emerging understanding that climate is about industrialization. Until recently, multilateral climate politics have been based on transfers of money and technology from industrialized to less developed countries, and on stable relations between the US and China. This has been upended. What will take its place?

Previous editions of the Polycrisis have spotlit the way that money is sloshing out of poor countries and into the coffers of rich ones. We’ve also focused on the “new nonalignment,” where large, capable and regionally powerful countries like Brazil are setting agendas for the entire world. Elsewhere we have looked at China’s new role as the leader of future technology. For this edition, we asked Rio-based journalist Catherine Osborn, who writes the weekly Latin America brief at Foreign Policy, to assess the UN Climate Conference in Brazil.

This is an updated version of an article that first appeared in Foreign Policy.

Last month, the humid Amazonian rainforest city of Belém, Brazil was alive with all the usual signs of a United Nations climate summit except one: a US negotiating team. Tens of thousands of participants from more than 190 countries and dozens of Indigenous groups staged two weeks of meetings, protests, and negotiations during this year’s summit, known as COP30. Though no US diplomats were present, a handful of conference-goers weaved through the crowds with white-and-green “Make Science Great Again” hats. California Governor Gavin Newsom made a defiant appearance.

This year’s conference was the first since Donald Trump returned to the White House and triggered the United States’ second exit from the 2015 Paris Agreement. This time, Trump had gone beyond withdrawing from international climate diplomacy and was actively working to undermine it. Sanctions threats in October against envoys from countries on the verge of reaching a landmark deal to limit global shipping pollution succeeded in blocking the agreement.

The threat of potential US sabotage hung over Belém as countries negotiated if and how they would speed up climate action. Trump’s pressure offered potential political cover to delegations that were already dragging their feet on climate issues for any number of reasons. Saudi Arabia, for example, had moved in lockstep with the United States to torpedo the shipping pollution deal.

Against this adverse political backdrop, a key pillar of Brazil’s approach to COP30 was what some climate strategists have called “coalitions of the doing.” Rather than waiting for absolute consensus among UN member states, Brazil tried to move in smaller groups to push action forward and emphasize how climate action can lead to economic development. By conventional metrics of COP summits, this one yielded incremental progress rather than any big breakthrough—showing the UN climate regime is surviving, but only barely.

Forest fund

Since their inception in the 1990s, UN climate conferences have aimed to compile an annual set of decisions that require the unanimous consent of more than 190 countries, plus the European Union. These yearly agreements have famously committed countries to work toward limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, an agreement reached in Paris in 2015, and to transition away from fossil fuels, agreed upon in Dubai in 2023.

But many targets set at past conferences have not been met. As a result—and given geopolitical headwinds—Brazilian officials said that Belém should focus more on implementing existing goals than on setting new unanimous targets.

To address unmet climate pledges, Brazilian officials focused extra energy on countries that are eager to engage. This is a growing trend at COP summits: Because the unanimous agreements can be vague and cautious, in recent years, countries have united in smaller groups to set more ambitious targets. These include pledges to end deforestation and reduce heat-trapping methane emissions by 30 percent (compared to 2020 levels) by the end of this decade.

For COP30, Brasília helped craft a plan for a new investment fund to protect tropical forests that had received at least $6.7 billion in pledges by the end of November. Brazil and the United Kingdom announced a program to help seven countries track and reduce so-called super pollutants such as methane. And Brazil rallied at least sixteen countries and the EU to join a group devoted to collaborating on carbon markets.

With the forest fund, Brazil overcame a potential obstacle from the United States. The fund’s technical supervision is due to be carried out by the World Bank, where Washington is the largest shareholder. Earlier this year, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called for the bank to deprioritize some of its climate-related work. If the United States wanted to block the bank’s participation in the forest fund, it likely could have.

“The World Bank is a multilateral institution, and many of its members emphatically supported the idea,” senior Brazilian Finance Ministry official Rafael Dubeux said. The project’s backers carefully emphasized that it was focused on forests rather than climate change more broadly. The fund got the green light.

The Brazilian summit hosts also emphasized the economic dividends of climate action. They are far from alone in this approach. UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in July that countries clinging to fossil fuels are “missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.” Finnish President Alexander Stubb echoed this language in Belém, calling climate investments a “growth and prosperity plan.”

Globally, investments in clean energy this year are on track to be double those in fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. But the trend is uneven across the world. China dominates global production of green technologies such as solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines, far outpacing the United States. Although the adoption of these products is speeding decarbonization across the developing world, without transfer of the underlying technologies, countries might miss the opportunity to develop green industries at home.

Labor organizers in Brazil are worried about importing green technologies rather than building them domestically, said Deyvid Bacelar, the general coordinator at the Brazilian Unified Federation of Oil Workers. Though some oil workers might one day get clean energy jobs due to decarbonization, Bacelar pointed to union research that found that in jobs such as installing imported solar panels, “the pay is lower, and the benefits are worse.”

Though Brazil is rich in many of the raw ingredients for the energy transition, that does not guarantee decent work, Bacelar warned: “We hope the government works so there are green industries in Brazil with well-paying jobs, instead of our country’s role being only selling raw materials.”

At COP30, Brazil called for green dividends to be shared among countries. Several top officials in the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva administration had already crafted national policies to try to address these concerns. (Lula is a former union leader.) Furthermore, the state government of Bahia, home to a BYD plant, secured commitments from the Chinese automotive giant to build a local research center, use Brazilian components in its vehicles, and train local workers—using the prospect of access to the large Brazilian market to bargain for a higher-value slice of China’s massive green overseas investments.

Until now, green industrialization has been less prominent in the COP agenda. Lula highlighted the importance of technology transfers in speeches ahead of the Belém conference. And on its fifth day, Brazil and a dozen other countries including Indonesia, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, and the United Kingdom pledged to create a secretariat for cooperation on green industrialization, saying in a joint declaration that the process must “address, rather than deepen global inequalities.”

The declaration also pledged to work to align countries’ standards about which goods count as low carbon. That can benefit both developed and developing countries, said Linda Kalcher, the executive director at European climate consultancy Strategic Perspectives: “Not only does it help the Europeans import material that meets their standard, it also helps them diversify away from one single supplier. … Most importantly, it builds value chains in other countries.”

Roadmaps?

Confirming climate advocates’ pre-conference worries about the bleak state of multilateralism—and climate cooperation in particular—COP30’s negotiated decision included only limited steps forward, with much of the noteworthy news occurring on the sidelines.

One of the main accomplishments in the summit decision was a commitment for countries to triple the amount of money globally available for climate adaptation by 2035. A decision on this topic was broadly expected, and had been seen as an indicator of whether the UN climate regime as enshrined in the Paris Agreement—cooperation by 190+ countries—was still producing results.

Climate adaptation funding often goes to projects without a quick and straightforward financial profit. These include sea walls to prevent flooding and irrigation systems to help farmers cope with droughts. “The private sector will not spend a lot of money on [climate] adaptation, full stop,” Kalcher said. That’s why years of UN talks have formalized the requirement for governments, especially in richer countries, to help pay. If climate diplomacy is reduced merely to small-group coalitions of the doing, poor countries may be left stranded.

On other topics, and for more ambitious countries, the COP30 decision fell short. In a surprise move, Lula at the start of the conference called for economic roadmaps away from fossil fuel dependence after years of reluctance to endorse the idea. Including this concept in the summit decision would advance a vague 2023 COP outcome on the need for countries to transition away from fossil fuels. Lula’s comments prompted a frantic push to codify the topic, which won support from more than eighty countries but ultimately failed.

While the US absence in Belém offered other actors the chance to show leadership—be they China, the European Union, or Brazil itself—some veteran climate hands came away from the summit with a feeling that “the wheels came off,” in the words of former UN climate boss Yvo de Boer.

For others, the conference was simply a sign of the difficult geopolitical times. And many countries vowed to work outside the summit to keep advancing topics discussed there. Brazil pledged to publish ideas for roadmaps away from fossil fuels over the course of the next year, and Colombia and the Netherlands announced they will host a conference on the topic in April.

The debate on roadmaps is moving forward much like the debate on equitable green industrialization: through a coalition of the doing rather than via a unanimous decision. And ultimately, by elevating issues such as technology transfer in Belém, Brazil flexed its influence as a middle power on the world stage.

The climate conference in the jungle made clear that the global energy transition is moving forward without the White House.

In September, energy prices overall were 2.8 percent higher than they were a year ago.
As of September, electricity prices are up 5.1 percent compared to a year ago, but in some places, the gain is much starker.
He added that seeing relatively low gas prices may in fact add to the anger that some are feeling about electric prices.
Experts have pointed to additional factors in high electricity prices, including expensive upgrades to the grid needed because of storm damage.","Gasoline prices are down while electric and natural gas costs are up, turning the issue of energy affordability into a political Rorschach test.

Democrats are lambasting the White House for high power bills, while President Trump and his allies tout low prices at the pump.

“Energy — gasoline — we’re now at about $2.50 a gallon. We’re going to be, I think, at $2 a gallon. We could even crack that at some point,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting this week.

In recent days, the national average price of gasoline has dipped below $3 per gallon, standing at $2.98 on Friday, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).

“Our prices now for energy, for gasoline, are really low,” Trump added.

Meanwhile, multiple Democrats have decried rising electricity prices in the past few weeks.

“Everyone needs to be screaming about this. Energy costs are up 11% under Trump and families are getting their power shut off,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said in a post on X this week. “This winter that will be deadly. We need to take action now.”

Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christopher Knittel said there’s some truth to what each side is saying.

“They can both be right that electricity prices are certainly growing at much faster than the rate of inflation. Oil prices have fallen somewhat,” Knittel said.

He noted that what the ultimate impact on consumers will depend on how much gasoline they use compared to how much electricity, “and that varies a lot by household.”

Nationwide, energy prices have risen at a comparable pace to inflation over the last year, but there’s wide variance across both location and the type of energy.

In September, energy prices overall were 2.8 percent higher than they were a year ago. This gain is slightly smaller than inflation overall, which rose by 3 percent over the last year.

Gasoline prices are down compared to a year ago. Friday’s price was down slightly from a year prior, when the national average was $3.03 per gallon. However, this is much lower than prices were a few years ago, at the height of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the economic re-opening after the COVID-19 vaccine. In 2022, the national average gasoline price reached just over $5 per gallon.

Presidential policy really only has limited influence over gas prices, as gasoline is traded globally and in the U.S. is only produced by private companies, not the government.

As of September, electricity prices are up 5.1 percent compared to a year ago, but in some places, the gain is much starker.

In New Jersey, for example, where power prices have become a major political issue, residential electric prices in September were 21 percent higher than they were the year before. In Washington, D.C., they were up 31 percent.

Meanwhile, the price of piped gas used in utilities has grown even more sharply, up 11.7 percent in September over the year before.

“U.S. gas production is not keeping up with increases in U.S. gas demand, and most of that U.S. gas demand is coming from LNG exports,” said Ira Joseph, senior research associate at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy, referring to liquified natural gas.

Joseph added that cold temperatures at the start of this year also contributed to the issue.

Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said that rising electricity prices are stretching already thin budgets for many families.

“Low- and moderate-income families live on very tight budgets … and they notice prices that go up,” Wolfe told The Hill.

“They talk about food, they talk about housing, but now they’re talking about electric bills as well. That’s new. I think it’s because the bills have gone up so rapidly,” he said.

He added that seeing relatively low gas prices may in fact add to the anger that some are feeling about electric prices.

“Many people think energy is energy….and I think that they’re aware of the gasoline prices becoming more affordable. Why isn’t their electric bill becoming more affordable?” he said.

Specifically, Wolfe said that one source of this frustration is the rise of power-hungry data centers.

He said people will ask: “‘Why aren’t they paying their share? Why are we paying for data centers?’ I think that’s what the political issue is becoming.”

Data centers are just one piece of the puzzle. Experts have pointed to additional factors in high electricity prices, including expensive upgrades to the grid needed because of storm damage.

According to EPRI, an energy research and development institute, gasoline is the largest energy cost for the average American household, making up an average of $2,930 in expenditures per household in 2024.

That’s compared to $1,850 for electricity, according to the organization, which receives some funding from the electric utility industry, as well as the federal government.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s overall impact on energy prices remains to be seen — as some of his actions are expected to raise prices while others are expected to lower them.

The president’s efforts to cut climate and pollution regulations on the power sector are expected to bring costs down. However, his efforts to ax subsidies for renewable energy are expected to raise them.

“On the exporting of natural gas…as this administration incentivizes more exports, that’s going to take supply away from U.S. households, and that’s going to tend to increase natural gas prices. That’s basic supply and demand,” said Knittel, the MIT professor.

“Getting rid of the subsidies on renewables is going to put upward pressure on electricity prices, so that’s going to be counterbalanced by their reduced environmental regulations on existing … fossil fuel plants. So we don’t quite know yet what the net effect of both of those are, but their policies are pushing in different directions on electricity,” he added.

But, Knittel continued, the Trump administration is not to blame for high electric prices, at least not yet.

“Electricity prices have been going up for the past two decades, so we can’t blame a year’s worth of Trump policies for what we’ve seen,” he said.

The issue is part of a broader struggle between Democrats and Republicans to convince voters that they are the better party for the economy.

During his recent Cabinet meeting, Trump slammed Democrats’ use of the word “affordability” as a “con job.”

“There’s this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about ‘affordability.’ They just say the word. It doesn’t mean anything to anybody,” he said, arguing that he inherited a significant amount of inflation.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/GasolinePrices_Frazin_AP_DavidZalubowski.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-06 08:58:20.962506

In truth, I do not believe we need nuclear power, because there is now a cheaper and safer option.
Today, the battery that is destined to be a global game changer is the sodium ion battery.
Consider these benefits: Sodium batteries maintain efficiency in cold temperatures far better than current lithium ion or lithium iron batteries.
The Chinese company CATL offers the Naxtra sodium ion battery, which performs with high efficiency at temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.","Last year, The Daily Star published a commentary on my observations of climate change over a span of several decades. Now that another year has passed, I’d like to update that column and offer some new thoughts.

In my prior commentary, titled “Observing Local Climate Change for 36 Years,” from the Sept. 14, 2024 edition of The Star, I warned that we were in a new climate regime, where the meaning of a “200-year storm” or a “500-year storm” was largely obsolete, because there is no longer any true reference for the climate conditions we are now experiencing. I also warned that we were likely to see local weather events beyond our imagining. Since that column, we have dodged a local weather disaster on the scale of the floods of 2006 and 2011, but we have seen catastrophic events around the country, notably the terrible flooding in western North Carolina from hurricane Helene, the wildfires in metro Los Angeles, and the Texas hill country flood.

More recently, Hurricane Melissa became one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, and possibly the most powerful, as it made landfall on the southern coast of Jamaica on Oct. 28. I say possibly because the crisp, near perfect circularity of the storm’s eyewall exceeded the capacity of the NOAA satellite algorithm to measure the storm’s intensity.

These events are happening with a frequency that was unimaginable only a few years ago. This non-linear acceleration will continue as long as we pump fossil fuel emissions into the atmosphere. Sadly, on a global scale, that is exactly what we’re doing. When I posted my prior column, the CO2 reading in parts per million at the Mona Loa Observatory for May 2024 was 427 parts per million. This May, the reading was 430.58 ppm — the greatest yearly increase in the history of record keeping. (In March of 1958, when George Keeling made his first measurement at Mona Loa, the CO2 in the atmosphere was 313 ppm.)

In my commentary last year, I made an appeal for us to set aside our NIMBY reflex and support local renewable development, both solar and wind. I also endorsed nuclear power as the best base load complement to renewables and cited Nobel Laureate Burton Richter’s assessment that wind and solar could provide 90% of the national grid, with nuclear supplying 10% to cover the problem of intermittency. I still believe nuclear is a safe complement to renewable power, but I have changed my thinking on its necessity. In truth, I do not believe we need nuclear power, because there is now a cheaper and safer option.

That option is batteries — not the lithium ion currently used in most electric vehicles, or the second-generation lithium iron used in back-up for homes and businesses. Today, the battery that is destined to be a global game changer is the sodium ion battery.

Sodium ion batteries have been around for at least a decade, but recent technical breakthroughs have transformed them into a power source that is truly wonderous. Consider these benefits:

Sodium batteries maintain efficiency in cold temperatures far better than current lithium ion or lithium iron batteries. This makes them ideally suited for winters in places like Upstate New York. The Chinese company CATL offers the Naxtra sodium ion battery, which performs with high efficiency at temperatures of minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

Because of their energy density, sodium batteries are comparable to lithium for battery energy storage, but are cheaper and safer. BYD, another Chinese company, offers the MC Cube-T sodium battery that provides 6.4 MWh of storage. That’s 64,000 watts of power! This unit fits into a 20-foot shipping container and is much cheaper than lithium batteries. What’s more, it performs better than lithium at both cold and hot temperature extremes, making it ideal for baseload storage for grids serving cities or even states.

Sodium batteries are available at much lower cost because the materials to make them are abundant and cheap. Another plus for sodium is the fact that they do not require bottleneck materials like lithium or cobalt, and no phosphorous — an element that is almost exclusively mined in one state in north Africa.

Sodium batteries are truly transformative in their potential to help the world decarbonize. Their significant lower cost, wider temperature range and faster recharge will accelerate trends that are already established. In cars, sodium will deliver EV range on parity with any gas-powered vehicles, with recharge in minutes. Internal combustion engines will make no sense when the EV alternative is cheaper, more reliable, lasts for hundreds of thousands of miles and maintains peak efficiency at temperatures of -40 F to +158 F. In a relatively short time, large trucks and even ships will be powered by sodium technology. It is happening in China already.

While great for transportation, sodium is equally transformative for base load storage. With cheap, compact, high efficiency battery units, homes and businesses, as well as towns and cities, can have dependable back-up power. When these batteries are linked with wind and solar generation, it is possible to have self-sufficient power indefinitely.

Climate heating is a serious concern. But renewable technology is advancing rapidly, including more affordable PVC panels, larger wind turbines and new battery innovations like sodium and next-generation designs. All that is needed now is the political will to deploy.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-06 12:03:21.149847

In many cases, the issue is the way data centers have increased reliance on fossil fuels.","While opposition to data centers continues to grow, including here in northeast Indiana, Allen County's project is already well into construction.

A few weeks ago, in the middle of November, more than a hundred people showed up to make sure the Indiana Department of Environmental Management heard their opposition to a data center being built in southeast Fort Wayne.

“We’re not just here to defend our neighborhoods in the backyard of this data center, we’re here to defend everyone down river,"" Kelly Atkins said to represenatives from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management at a hearing about the latest request from the Google data center. At the end of the hearing, the crowd of speakers began chanting at the representatives; ""Deny, deny, deny.""

Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, is requesting an additional 143 diesel generators to support the campus.

To understand the opposition to the build, first, a look at how the data center came to Fort Wayne, when it was known only as “Project Zodiac.”

How the data center came to Fort Wayne

In October of 2023, what was then described as an “unnamed Fortune 100 company” proposed a data center campus around Adams Center and Paulding roads, using nearly 900 acres of land and requiring an annexation of more than 700 acres into Fort Wayne.

The months that followed included a “super-voluntary” annexation, land sale and tax abatement approvals. In January 2024, after everything was finalized, the anonymous company’s name was released; Google would be building a data center campus with up to 12 buildings.

Community development director Jonathan Leist recalled how the property sale went through.

“So we sold our portion of the property for a little less than $12 million, $11.4 (million) I believe, something like that,"" Leist said. ""So that was over and above our last appraisal that we had of the property. So definitely market rate on the land sale.”

In December 2023, Mayor Sharon Tucker was still serving as the city council representative for the sixth district, the area where the data center is currently being built. Following a visit to a similar data center in Columbus, Ohio, at the December 22, 2023 city council meeting, Tucker spoke in favor of approving the project.

“There have been a multitude of bad projects that have tried to be dumped on the south side and I have fought every single one of them,"" Tucker said at the December 2023 meeting. ""This is not one, council, that I’m fighting.”

In her visit to the campus in Columbus, joined by Leist, he said their concerns specifically about sound pollution diminished.

""I think what we saw and heard there was that the only sound really being emitted was construction,"" Leist said. ""Like there was no unique data center sound that I think people in other locations had.”

A change in the energy landscape

The Midwest has become something of a breeding ground for data centers, due to cooler temperatures that require less energy-intensive cooling than Southern states. Great Lakes states like Indiana, Ohio and Michigan have seen a boom in data center builds over the last several years.

There are 72 facilities under construction in Indiana alone.

Earlier this year, the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan published a study into what happens when data centers come to towns.

The study found that, while many data centers propose to eventually run entirely on green energy, the green energy needed for that much energy running all the time isn’t currently possible.

And in cases like Fort Wayne, the company then asks for more of the old energy sources.

Molly Kleinman is the managing director of the science, technology and public policy program at the Ford School.

“I haven’t seen solid justification for the humungous embrace of as much energy, dirty as it needs to be, as we can get now, and we’ll worry about clean energy down the line,"" Kleinman said.

But it isn’t just about not using green energy. In many cases, the issue is the way data centers have increased reliance on fossil fuels. In many areas, increased energy needs from data centers are helping coal and gas plants slated for closure to find a second life.

“We’ve seen that data centers have eaten up all of the renewable capacity that the countries added over the last several years, and then gone beyond it,"" Kleinman said. ""They have essentially canceled out all of the gains that we had previously made in renewables.”

Bryce Gustafson is program organizer with Citizens Action Coalition, a consumer and environmental advocacy group based out of Indianapolis.

“This may come as a shock to some people, but Indiana was on a trajectory of getting away from fossil fuels,"" he said. ""This has completely upended that trajectory.”

Indiana Michigan Power just got permission to acquire an existing 870-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Ohio. NIPSCO announced plans in September to build a natural gas plant, through separate company NIPSCO GenCo, to address the increased needs from data centers throughout the state.

,North Carolina Environment,2025-12-06 07:14:03+00:00,www.seafoodsource.com,Study suggests wind power development would have little impact on Gulf shrimping,Not Available,,,,,https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/environment-sustainability/study-suggests-wind-power-development-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-would-have-little-impact-on-shrimping,"A study from the University of Miami found that the installation of wind power infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, currently referred to as the Gulf of America by the U.S. government, is unlikely to impact commercial shrimping operations.
The development of offshore wind projects in the United States has been contentious for much of the commercial fishing industry, with fishers claiming turbines in the ocean block them from accessing valued fishing grounds and disrupt the ecosystem.
Researchers took GPS data from shrimp vessels to see how they operate around oil rigs, using them as an analog for wind farms.
As of June 2023, 634 oil platforms in the Gulf had already been reefed.
“As someone who has fished in the Gulf my entire life, I can tell you that the best fishing is always near these rigs.","A study from the University of Miami found that the installation of wind power infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, currently referred to as the Gulf of America by the U.S. government, is unlikely to impact commercial shrimping operations.

The development of offshore wind projects in the United States has been contentious for much of the commercial fishing industry, with fishers claiming turbines in the ocean block them from accessing valued fishing grounds and disrupt the ecosystem. Wind turbines have also posed a problem for NOAA Fisheries, forcing the agency to reconsider how it conducts fisheries surveys as its traditional research vessels can’t navigate too close to the structures.

To study whether commercial shrimpers would be impacted by wind turbines in the Gulf, researchers with the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS) at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science decided to look at how the industry currently interacts with offshore oil rigs, which are already plentiful in the Gulf.

Researchers took GPS data from shrimp vessels to see how they operate around oil rigs, using them as an analog for wind farms. The study found that shrimpers largely avoid the rigs, but there does appear to be a “sweet spot” roughly 3 miles between rigs that shrimpers trawl more frequently.

“To balance offshore energy development with fishing, we need high-resolution vessel data like this to see where activities overlap,” lead author of the study Brendan Turley said in a release. “As the ocean becomes more industrialized, combining different data sources is key to preventing conflicts between economically important marine industries.”

The study – which was published in the journal Marine and Coastal Fisheries – also found that the areas slated for wind power development generally avoid popular shrimp-trawling areas, with only 2.5 percent of total shrimping effort between 2015 and 2019 occurring in those areas.

“Beyond commercial activity, oil rigs also serve as popular recreational fishing and diving sites, highlighting that offshore infrastructure has complex, nuanced impacts rather than being simply labeled ‘good’ or ‘bad,'” Turley said.

Regulators and fishing groups have long recognized that offshore oil rigs can become hotspots for marine life, providing a structure for shellfish to grow on and creating a welcoming habitat for many fish species. In the Gulf, federal and state governments incentivize energy companies to transform decommissioned oil infrastructure into artificial reefs instead of removing them from the water completely.

As of June 2023, 634 oil platforms in the Gulf had already been reefed.

In October 2025, U.S. lawmakers introduced the Marine Fisheries Habitat Protection Act, legislation that would tweak the government’s artificial reef program to make it easier for oil companies to make the conversion.

“Instead of tearing down structures that have become vibrant marine ecosystems, we can repurpose them to benefit the environment, fishermen, and taxpayers alike,” U.S. Representatives Mike Ezell (R-Mississippi) said in introducing the bill. “As someone who has fished in the Gulf my entire life, I can tell you that the best fishing is always near these rigs. When we remove them entirely, we’re not just losing a structure; we’re destroying entire ecosystems. This bill is a no-brainer for coastal communities, sportsmen, and marine life alike.”",https://s3.divcom.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/eb01ab0582eb7e6bf14f91b3e2d03b21.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:01:14.024656

By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to both cities’ climate action plans.
The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.
The applications show that together, the microgrids will emit nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone.
BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.","Developers behind Project Jupiter, the controversial campus of data centers slated for Doña Ana County, have asked state environment officials to sign off on their plans to emit more greenhouse gases than the state’s two largest cities combined, and to generate as much electricity as the state’s largest power company.

Applications for air quality permits confirm figures that Source NM previously reported: If approved, Project Jupiter could emit more than 14 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. By comparison, Albuquerque and Las Cruces emit a combined 6.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually, according to both cities’ climate action plans. The applications also say developers seek to install 41 turbines to annually generate about as much electricity as PNM.

Developers filed two applications, one for a “west microgrid” and one for an “east microgrid.” A microgrid is a self-reliant energy grid that doesn’t need to draw power from a larger utility, like PNM or El Paso Electric. For months, plans have made it clear that developers want to build natural gas generating stations for Project Jupiter’s microgrids, prompting concerns from residents and lawmakers that the data centers won’t comply with the state’s landmark clean energy law, which requires utilities to use 50% renewable energy by 2030, 80% by 2040 and 100% by 2045.

The applications show that together, the microgrids will emit nearly 500 tons per year of nitrogen oxides, an important ingredient in contributing to ozone. Individually, one microgrid is listed at 249.97 tons per year and the other at 248.9.

Environmental advocates say the developers’ proposal to split emissions across two permits for the same project appears to skirt state regulations, which classify projects with at least 250 tons per year of nitrogen oxides as “major sources” of hazardous air pollutants and subject them to arduous monitoring.

“They’ve split it into two separate plants that are ‘minor sources’ to avoid having to monitor their actual air quality impacts, which are going to be huge,” said Colin Cox, senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “They’re coming up to 99.9% of the threshold for when they’d have to do additional work.”

The American Lung Association has long given Doña Ana County a failing grade for ozone, which can cause asthma attacks, increased risk of respiratory infections and even increased risk of premature death.

BorderPlex Digital Assets, the company that has represented Project Jupiter in public meetings, did not respond to a request for comment.

Project Jupiter pits demand for data against New Mexico’s finite natural resources

The permits will only have to go through a public hearing process if an “outside party,” which can include a resident of the area, requests it, according to a spokesperson for the New Mexico Environment Department. No hearings have been scheduled.

Members of the public have, however, tried to stop the project in court.

In October, two residents and a local nonprofit filed a lawsuit against elected members of the Doña Ana County Commission and accused them of voting on an incomplete application when they approved $165 billion in government-backed bonds for the project in September.

“We’ve seen this with other air permit applications, where they’re right under the limit,” Maslyn Locke, a New Mexico Environmental Law Center senior attorney who is representing residents in the case, told Source NM. “Ultimately that means everything has to go 100% perfectly as they operate to not violate that…I don’t know if that’s realistic.”

Since filing suit in October, the nonprofit Empowerment Congress of Doña Ana County has withdrawn as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Another lawsuit, filed by Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, alleged that county leaders acted inappropriately when they approved the project even though it had yet to go through the Planning and Zoning Commission.

The word “spill” may sound alarming, but the reality is that dredging is a carefully managed, routine and essential process for our environment.

The redistribution of sediment is a natural occurrence that supports biodiversity and plays an important role in keeping the delta system healthy. This ultimately benefits fishermen, shrimpers and the communities that rely on Louisiana’s working coast. The faster the dredging is completed, the less disruption there will be.

I urge my neighbors to exercise caution when presented with the alarmist explanations. We should absolutely hold companies accountable to existing environmental regulations, but the issue presented by the authors is simply not one.

The work being done by manufacturing plants and LNG export facilities is strengthening the economy along Louisiana’s coastline, not causing the calamity presented by the environmental activists. Natural gas companies in the region have even taken steps to preserve the coastline’s longevity by investing in restoration efforts.

When environmental activists continue to raise false alarms about Louisiana’s economic powerhouses, they distract from the real progress being made to offset reliance on Russian oil and gas overseas and bolster international security here at home.

According to Loren Scott’s Louisiana Economic Forecast, LNG export facilities will bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state over the next two years. And further, the development of the LNG export industry has “radically” increased the growth prospects of the region. We should be applauding efforts to untether the world from Russian gas and creating good-paying jobs here in Louisiana, not actively working against them.

The state is positioning itself as a hub for electric vehicle and SUV production, drawing investments and creating jobs in a region with pent-up demand for personal vehicles.
Meanwhile, the electric vehicle conversation is evolving rapidly elsewhere.
On December 5, 2025, BYD Australia CEO Stephen Collins told Drive that the company is prepared to meet consumer demand, whether it tips toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).
Elsewhere in the electric vehicle sector, not all the news was celebratory.","The electric vehicle revolution is picking up speed across the globe, with fresh developments emerging from Brazil to Australia and Japan. On December 5, 2025, several landmark events underscored the shifting landscape of the automotive industry, as governments, automakers, and consumers alike grapple with the future of personal mobility. The day brought high-profile launches, bold policy pushes, and even legal drama, all reflecting the dynamic—and sometimes contentious—path toward cleaner, more accessible transportation.

In Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva turned the inauguration of the Chevrolet Spark electric car production line at the Pace factory in Ceará into a rallying cry for affordability and inclusivity in the auto market. According to Estadão, Lula didn’t mince words when addressing automakers and workers: ""Whoever makes these beautiful SUVs needs to be able to buy them."" The president’s remarks came at a time when the dream of car ownership has become increasingly elusive for many Brazilians. In fact, a survey by Bright Consulting revealed that the average car price in Brazil soared from R$70,900 in 2016 to R$159,684 in 2025—a staggering 125% jump, far outpacing the 63.9% inflation rate.

Lula’s speech resonated with a workforce that has watched new cars slip further out of reach. He linked the issue directly to income distribution, arguing, ""We work to have access to the things we produce."" The message was clear: without wage increases and lower prices, cars risk remaining symbols of exclusion rather than vehicles of social mobility. The president called on the auto industry to prioritize Brazilian consumers over exports, urging that producing a “beautiful car” was meaningless if it didn’t end up in a worker’s garage.

Against this backdrop, the Brazilian government’s Sustainable Car program, launched in July 2025, aims to bridge the widening gap between aspiration and reality. As part of the broader Mover industrial policy for Green Mobility and Innovation, the initiative leverages tax incentives—specifically, reductions in the IPI (tax on industrialized products)—to make entry-level, low-emission, and highly recyclable cars more affordable. The program is already showing results: in October, sales of cars included in the Sustainable Car program were 74% higher than those of other vehicles, according to Anfavea. Notably, car prices in 2025 rose by just 2.4%, below the IPCA inflation rate of 3.64%, marking the first price slowdown in five years. While the average price of a new car still hovers around R$160,000, this moderation opens the door to renewed discussions about making car ownership a practical goal once again.

The choice of Ceará for the Chevrolet Spark’s debut was strategic. The state is positioning itself as a hub for electric vehicle and SUV production, drawing investments and creating jobs in a region with pent-up demand for personal vehicles. By focusing on expanding industrial employment and supporting green mobility, the government hopes to address both economic and environmental challenges. The expectation is clear: as production scales up, costs will come down, making new cars more accessible to a broader swath of the population.

Lula’s push for affordability comes at a critical juncture. The Brazilian vehicle market is expected to reach 2.76 million units in 2025, including cars, light commercial vehicles, trucks, and buses. Yet, for many families, a new car remains a luxury. The president’s insistence that “those who produce SUVs need to be able to buy cars” frames the issue as both an economic and social imperative. Whether the combination of tax incentives, compact electric cars, and potential wage gains will be enough to put new vehicles within reach for ordinary Brazilians remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, the electric vehicle conversation is evolving rapidly elsewhere. In Japan, Lexus unveiled its much-anticipated LFA Concept, a fully electric sports car that marks a dramatic departure from its V10-powered predecessor. The LFA Concept, introduced on December 5, 2025, shares its aluminum chassis with Toyota’s new GR GT, but skips the twin-turbo V8 in favor of a cutting-edge electric powertrain. As reported by automotive media, Lexus has been tight-lipped about performance details, but the company emphasized that the LFA name now symbolizes a commitment to preserving and advancing engineering technologies for future generations, rather than being bound to internal combustion engines alone. The LFA Concept is expected to enter production around 2027, possibly following the Toyota GR GT’s own launch.

This move by Lexus highlights the broader industry trend toward electrification at the high-performance end of the market, even as questions linger about consumer appetite for electric sports cars. The LFA Concept’s striking design and advanced platform suggest Lexus is betting on innovation and brand heritage to win over enthusiasts in the coming electric era.

Shifting to Australia, BYD’s local arm is betting on flexibility as it navigates the country’s evolving appetite for electrified vehicles. On December 5, 2025, BYD Australia CEO Stephen Collins told Drive that the company is prepared to meet consumer demand, whether it tips toward battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). ""I think at the end of the day, consumers are going to decide [whether BEVs or PHEVs prove more popular],"" Collins said. BYD’s strategy is to field 10 models, split between BEVs—including the Atto 1, Atto 2, Atto 3, Dolphin, Seal, and Sealion 7—and PHEVs such as the Sealion 6, Shark 6, Sealion 5, and Sealion 8.

As of October 2025, BYD had sold 41,882 vehicles in Australia, with 19,248 BEVs and 22,634 PHEVs. While overall EV sales in Australia (83,805 year-to-date) outpace PHEVs (42,797), BYD’s numbers are skewed by the popularity of the Shark 6, the first plug-in hybrid ute available in the country. Collins noted that PHEVs remain a ""great solution for a lot of people,"" emphasizing the need for continued consumer education about the benefits of both technologies. BYD’s approach underscores the diversity of consumer needs and the importance of offering multiple pathways to electrification.

Elsewhere in the electric vehicle sector, not all the news was celebratory. On December 5, 2025, a former executive filed a lawsuit against Bollinger Innovations and CEO David Michery, alleging breach of contract and other claims. Bollinger Innovations, known for its electric trucks, now faces legal scrutiny just as the company seeks to expand its footprint in a competitive market. The outcome of this legal action could have implications for the company’s reputation and future operations.

Taken together, these developments paint a picture of an auto industry in flux. From Brazil’s push for affordable green cars and Japan’s high-tech electric sports cars to Australia’s pragmatic embrace of both BEVs and PHEVs, the global transition to electric mobility is anything but uniform. Each market faces its own challenges and opportunities, shaped by local economics, consumer preferences, and policy choices. As 2025 draws to a close, the road ahead for electric vehicles is charged with both promise and uncertainty—but one thing is clear: change is accelerating, and everyone, from factory workers to CEOs, is along for the ride.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/f8CxNBHDe9Lu5AQ0aOONlL3q214=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F5be7f7cd-f89b-40b2-983c-c9cd0bf7c41a.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 07:58:14.115116

The Texas Resilient Landscapes Initiative is offering $3.2 million in cost-share funding over the next four years.

The initiative is focused on supporting reforestation efforts in areas vulnerable to risk of loss from disaster or environmental change. Applications for funding are open now and close Jan. 23, 2026.

“Forested and riparian ecosystems across Texas are increasingly threatened by natural disasters and weather extremes,” said Erin Davis, Texas A&M Forest Service Program Coordinator. “This cost-share initiative will help landowners replant their properties with native woodland species to establish a more resilient and sustainable forest for the future.”

Non-federal, non-industrial forest landowners, including tribal and local governments, are eligible. Tracts must be 10 – 150 acres in size, and must have lost trees due to a natural disaster, disease or weather extremes in the past 10 years.

Reimbursable practices include site preparation through shredding or mulching at $168.75 per acre or prescribed fire at $27.50 per acre; planting trees through bareroot or containerized seedlings at $5.60 per seedling, riparian live cuttings at $375 per acre and/or direct seeding at $337.50 per acre; and temporary browse protection at $4.90 per seedling. One type of planting must be included in the planned practices.

“Reforestation is an essential part of sustaining the next generation of trees in our forests and woodlands,” said Davis. “Our hope is to support the restoration of natural landscapes across the state by providing funding to landowners who may have lost trees to natural causes such as fire, flood, disease and drought.”

Priority ranking will be given to projects in areas with gaps in existing funding opportunities for landscape-scale forest restoration and recovery, such as the woodlands in Central and West Texas. Awardees will be notified by Feb. 20, 2026.

Washington’s Immigrant Worker Protection Act would not override adherence to federal law or duty to comply with a subpoena or valid court order.","Washington Attorney General Nick Brown has teamed up with Sen. Rebecca Saldaña (D-Seattle) and Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self (D-Mukilteo) to propose the Immigrant Worker Protection Act.

The proposed legislation would:

Require employers notify employees when the federal government has requested their employment eligibility information.

Remind employers that they are not required to give federal immigration officials access to their non-public places of business unless agents have a warrant.

Make sure employers follow the law and only share employees’ personal data when a subpoena or judicial warrant has been issued.

“What we’re seeing from this administration is a campaign of fear that’s left many people scared to go to work,” Brown said. “This law empowers workers so they get the same information as their bosses do and have the opportunity to get their affairs in order.”

“Immigrant workers keep our communities and economy strong. They deserve fairness, respect, and the peace of mind to work and provide for their families,” Saldaña said. “This legislation protects them from fear and uncertainty, ensuring they can continue contributing to the strength and prosperity of our state.”

“Immigrant workers keep Washington’s economy strong, and they deserve stability and respect in their workplaces – especially as unlawful federal enforcement continues to disrupt families and communities,” Ortiz-Self said. “This bill not only protects workers, but also gives employers the clarity, resources, and support they need to understand their rights and meet their responsibilities under state law. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act ensures timely notice of I-9 audits, strengthens protections on the job, and upholds our urgent commitment to keep Washington families safe and together.”

Immigrants help power Washington’s economy

Washington’s prosperity would not be possible without the contributions of immigrants. At just 15% of the state’s population, immigrants generate 21% of Washington’s economic output, according to research from the Immigration Research Initiative.

The state’s economic engine thrives when employees and employers have a safe, predictable environment in which to operate. However, federal immigration authorities’ tactics have had a destabilizing impact on Washington’s economy, sowing chaos and fear in communities throughout the state.

“As an employer, I know in the case of an I-9 audit there are steps I would need to follow,” said Ana Castro, owner of La Salvadorean Bakery and Restaurant in White Center. “This bill just adds one step to that process and ensures my workers have a chance to provide any updates to their documentation. This bill will help me stay in compliance with federal law because ultimately I rely on my employees to help me keep employment records up to date.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill for Washington state. It will help protect workers' privacy and level the playing field between employers and employees,” said April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council. “This bill can help immigrant workers, and all workers feel safer at work and help them to know what their employer is doing with their personal information.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill to protect workers and keep them in the know about when and how their information is being shared,” said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Working Washington. “Workers who have had changes to their documentation and legal status should have the same opportunity to get their paperwork in order as employers do.”

“We fought to have provisions like these in many of our collective bargaining agreements. We know employers can comply with requirements like this – many already are,” said Stefan Moritz, secretary treasurer of UNITE HERE Local 8. “If an employer has advance knowledge that federal immigration will be doing an I-9 audit, workers should have that notice too so they can seek their own legal advice on how to respond to the situation.”

“The National Employment Law Project is leading the fight for a good-jobs economy, where all workers, regardless of immigration status, have the right to dignity, safety, and fair treatment on the job. When exploitative employers use worksite immigration enforcement to retaliate against immigrant workers, these rights and labor standards are eroded for all workers,” said Marisa Díaz, Director of the Immigrant Worker Justice Program at the National Employment Law Project. “The Immigrant Worker Protection Act supports good jobs because it will expand worker protections and increase access to information on employers’ and workers’ fundamental constitutional rights.”

These incentives include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation, and exemptions that reduce immediate taxable income, lowering initial tax revenues, but exact revenue estimates are elusive.
In 2024, manufacturing workers in the U.S. earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits.
Manufacturing R&D has more than tripled from $132.5 billion in 2000 to $404.7 billion in 2023.
At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of re-shoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely.","The Trump administration has stated that its economic agenda is designed to address the debt crisis by focusing on pro-growth policies that it expects will generate enough revenue to reduce the debt burden.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” created the cornerstone of the plan, as it involves significant tax cuts, which the administration argues will unleash rapid . The belief is that this accelerated growth will generate a larger tax base, ultimately leading to greater tax revenues that help pay down the debt.

Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other analysts, have estimated that the net effect of the plan will likely add several trillion dollars to the national debt over the next decade.

To boost revenues, the administration’s trade strategy includes imposing new tariffs on imported goods to generate “trillions of dollars” for the federal government, providing a new source of revenue to offset the deficit. However, based on recent estimates from nonpartisan economic think tanks, the new tariffs are generally projected to generate lower revenue, in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion in 2026.

The final official figure for the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget deficit was about $1.8 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office and U.S. Treasury Department, so for the first time, net interest payments on the national debt surpassed $1 trillion, due to both high debt levels and higher interest rates.

We haven’t balanced a budget in 25 years, and the six deficits since 2020 have all surpassed $1 trillion:

Spending on major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid continued to rise by about 8%, collectively. While revenues increased overall, due to individual income and payroll taxes, this was partially offset by a decline in corporate tax receipts, potentially due to new tax deductions.

For attacking the $38-trillion federal debt, a genuine game changer would be the speed and magnitude of the re-shoring plan for foreign manufacturing to move to the U.S. Calculating the potential future revenue streams, aside from raising taxes to offset deficit spending, generating up to a million new manufacturing jobs that work in tandem with AI would be a viable option – including large tax revenue implications.

As this chart shows, our manufacturing jobs have been trending down since 1980, and sharply since 2000:

There are no specific estimates of future tax revenue from the re-shoring of manufacturing, but re-shoring generates tax revenue through two primary mechanisms: (1) the largest being increased and income taxes, and corporate and investment taxes, providing significant tax revenue. Also, (2) revenue will accrue from profits from any new or expanded U.S.-based manufacturing companies, as well as revenue from taxes on capital investment, new construction, and local property taxes on new facilities.

Re-shoring is heavily incentivized by federal acts, like the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and state programs. These incentives include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation, and exemptions that reduce immediate taxable income, lowering initial tax revenues, but exact revenue estimates are elusive.

The potential numbers look promising. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1 spent in manufacturing, there is a total impact of $2.65 to the overall U.S. economy. In addition, for every worker in , 4.8 workers are added to the U.S. economy. This is one of the largest job multipliers in the economy. In 2024, manufacturing workers in the U.S. earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits. For all categories of manufacturing workers, hourly earnings averaged $35.50.

We could see new manufacturing jobs in the next decade, due to organic growth and re-shoring alone, and these aren’t the old “assembly line” jobs. America leads the world in innovation, and manufacturers in the U.S. perform 53% of all private-sector R&D in the nation, driving more innovation than any other sector. Manufacturing R&D has more than tripled from $132.5 billion in 2000 to $404.7 billion in 2023.

At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of re-shoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely. With retirements rising and digital fluency growing, manufacturers are capturing institutional knowledge, redesigning roles for human-machine collaboration, and up-skilling at scale.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 04:57:41.914950

One POWERGEN panel, Utility Perspectives on Onsite Power, will bring together leaders from CPS Energy, Duke Energy and Black Hills Energy to discuss what onsite generation really means for grid operators, project teams and plant personnel on the ground.
“[Duke Energy] is building significant power generation capacity across our service territories (solar/battery/gas).
Over the past 15 years, he said Duke Energy has completed more than ten new gas-fired generation projects, along with a large fleet of solar and battery assets.
“Building new generation on either side of the meter has many of the same challenges,” he said.","As data centers and advanced manufacturing accelerate across the United States, utilities are facing load requests that far exceed traditional planning timelines. The demand for rapid, reliable power is pushing engineers and asset planners to weigh new approaches on both sides of the meter. One POWERGEN panel, Utility Perspectives on Onsite Power, will bring together leaders from CPS Energy, Duke Energy and Black Hills Energy to discuss what onsite generation really means for grid operators, project teams and plant personnel on the ground.

One of the panelists, Jeff Joyce, Director of Engineering for Project Management and Construction at Duke Energy, brings more than 25 years of experience in new generation construction and operations. Joyce said his perspective will focus on the choices utilities face as they try to meet historic load growth.

“[Duke Energy] is building significant power generation capacity across our service territories (solar/battery/gas). I hope to provide an electric utility’s perspective on traditional (front of the meter) vs onsite (behind the meter) power to support the AI boom and typical challenges of building on either side of that meter,” he said. “This is important because of the unprecedented growth, scale, and speed desired to power datacenters across the country.”

For engineers, project managers and EPC partners, the session will offer a clear view of how utilities evaluate siting, permitting, equipment availability, outage coordination, fuel planning and interconnection requirements when choosing between utility-owned generation and customer-sited assets. Joyce noted that he hopes attendees “gain insights and clarity on pros/cons and options to power their needs as well as opportunities to engage.”

Although this is a moderated discussion, Joyce said much of his contribution will draw from real project execution experience. Over the past 15 years, he said Duke Energy has completed more than ten new gas-fired generation projects, along with a large fleet of solar and battery assets.

“Building new generation on either side of the meter has many of the same challenges,” he said. Issues such as land use, environmental compliance, procurement lead times, labor availability and commissioning risk affect both utility-scale and onsite projects.

Joyce also underscored several challenges facing utilities, IPPs and self-generators as they evaluate the next decade of buildout. “Broader affordability in the face of extreme demand, interconnection queue complexity and process, supply chain constraints (gas turbines, transformers, etc), evolving grid complexity (operationally speaking) with new developing regulatory requirements and skilled labor” are among the most critical issues, he said.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:03:18.158870

Booker took on the role of sixth district representative after the data center was already under way.
Amid public hearings, council meetings and town halls, one voice has been missing from the conversation about the data center – Google.
Elsewhere in Indiana, communities are beginning to reject data center builds.
Marshall, White and Putnam counties have enacted moratoriums on data centers until they better understand the impacts of them.","In September, a report found construction spending on data centers was at an all-time high of $40 billion in the U.S.

Molly Kleinman is with the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, which has been researching data centers. She says there’s a concern that most of these data centers are being built to support tech companies’ AI features and what might happen when the “AI bubble” pops.

""We’re hearing more and more experts weigh in that the way these giant data centers are being funded is not sustainable and, at some point, bubble’s pop,"" she said.

A response from city council

In October, WANE15 reported language in the contract between the city and DMI FW LLC, which bought the property for Hatchworks LLC, a subsidiary of Google, included a promise the city wouldn’t turn against Google if public opinion does.

While it makes sense from a business standpoint, Bryce Gustafson with Citizens Acton Coalition said it risks public officials losing their power to listen to the public.

“Normal people just don’t have the same level of power in these issues, so if your decision makers are taking away their power, the everyday Hoosier; What kind of power do they have?"" He said.

In 2023, the city council approved the land sale to Hatchworks LLC unanimously. Though, some members of the current council had no hand in that decision.

Activist groups in Fort Wayne have recruited residents to show up at meetings like the IDEM hearing and city council over the past several weeks. They’ve been holding town halls of their own to share information about the center.

At the final city council meeting in November, residents showed up to offer further public comment to the council about the data center and Google’s request for a further 143 diesel generators.

City council has no power to deny the permit. It’s a decision that is in the hands of IDEM and subject to review by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Despite that, fifth district representative Geoff Paddock, who is serving as council president through the end of the year, announced ahead of the public comment he was sending a letter to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management about the request.

""I am asking them to sit down with us, work with us, the city of Fort Wayne, Google, the Mayor’s office, city council members who may be interested, other interested parties to find an alternative,"" Paddock said.

Once again, residents expressed their concerns about air pollution...

""I already have to carry an emergency inhaler around with me, everywhere I go,"" said one young resident who spoke at the meeting. ""I don’t really want to go outside and suffocate in the first two seconds after that data center is complete.”

Following public comment, councilmembers-at-large Chambers and Friestroffer agreed to work with Paddock, IDEM and Google to better understand the energy needs and the risks of the generators.

Sixth district councilwoman Rohli Booker attended a townhall put on by advocacy groups earlier in the month as well as the IDEM hearing. She commended those who spoke for their continued advocacy and how it has helped her advocate in meetings with Google.

“There are things that I heard at that IDEM hearing that I was able to share with them – some of the solutions, some of the concerns, some of the health implications – that if I hadn’t attended, I would not have been able to do,"" Booker said.

Booker took on the role of sixth district representative after the data center was already under way.

Amid public hearings, council meetings and town halls, one voice has been missing from the conversation about the data center – Google.

Mayor Sharon Tucker, who has been a proponent of the build since she was still serving as the city council representative for the 6th district, said she’d like Google to work with the public.

“I do wish our Google partners would do what I’ve done and try to answer those concerns and so that would probably be the one thing that I am disappointed in, that they have not answered those cries of concern,"" she said.

Google hasn’t returned a request for comment.

Following public comment at the council meeting, Chambers said the city is planning a town hall that she hopes Google will attend.

Elsewhere in Indiana, communities are beginning to reject data center builds. Marshall, White and Putnam counties have enacted moratoriums on data centers until they better understand the impacts of them.

The public comment period on the requested extra diesel generators ended November 17, and IDEM has yet to announce a decision on the permit. Due to the requirement to address all comments received, both in writing and verbally, a representative for IDEM says it may take several months for a final permitting decision to be issued.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/92317bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4689x2462+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2Fdd%2F9790da7546cb92f90894c713f2d4%2Fdata-center-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 03:58:49.533396

The draft rule?s first suggested cost cap would additionally limit third-party providers of renewable energy to an average of 6.71 cents per kWh of renewable energy provided.","Tallahassee, Fla. – The Florida Public Service Commission’s staff is set to issue recommendations for the creation of critical renewable energy standards, Thursday, October 2, in Tallahassee, Fla.

A coalition made up of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, the Environmental Defense Fund, Florida Crystals Corp., The Climate Group, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Covanta Energy, among others, is issuing this reminder to the news media with the aim of ensuring that this important issue continues to receive the coverage it deserves in the public interest. Coalition members share a keen interest in development of a robust renewable energy industry in Florida.

We expect the staff recommendation to improve on the “straw man” proposal for renewable energy standards issued by PSC staff August 13. That proposal, accurately described as “timid” in one recent newspaper editorial, was roundly criticized by a host of non-utility stakeholders as well as newspaper editorial boards statewide.

In the recommendations to be issued Thursday we will look to see whether the rule has been improved to “level the playing field” between conventional generation and renewable sources of energy. Conventional generation sources have been responsible for a 25 percent increase in utility rates since 2005 and next year some Floridians will see increases of as much as 30 percent.

Renewable sources of energy help to insulate customers against such price shocks caused by spikes in fuel costs and skyrocketing construction costs for new power plants.

The straw man version of the rule was heavily weighted towards cost containment (allegedly to protect consumers) to the detriment of meaningful investment in renewable energy development that would truly benefit consumers and also create jobs.

The cost containment argument is misleading. The bottom line is that this provision virtually guarantees that the cost of both conventional and renewable energy will remain unnecessarily high. Given the fact that conventional energy providers are passing along cost increases to consumers totaling between 25 to 30 percent, we will look for greater fairness on the cost containment issue.

Relying on coal, gas and nuclear power is a costly and risky strategy for Florida. The current trend for the existing coal, gas and nuclear power electric system is to increase the average residential electric bill by 55 percent, based on trends that anticipate 16 cents per kWh rate by 2020.

The increasing cost to build large power plants and the rising cost of all power plant fuels drives this trend in rate increases. Investing in renewable energy today will reduce the risk of fuel-related rate increases because solar and wind power have very low operating costs and no fuel costs. Biopower, meanwhile, relies on locally grown agricultural and wood waste resources and its costs are not affected as much by trends in global energy demand.

The draft rule?s first suggested cost cap would additionally limit third-party providers of renewable energy to an average of 6.71 cents per kWh of renewable energy provided. Yet it makes sense to commit to more than 6.71 cents per kWh for renewable energy when the alternative is paying residential rates that will grow from 11 cents today to 16 cents per kWh in 2020.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-06 11:02:57.992932

CalCCA Urges CPUC to Protect Customers from Unfair Rate Increases in PG&E and SCE Rate Applications

Low-Income Residents Could See Unjust Rate Hikes of More Than $500 Per Year

Sacramento, Calif. — The California Community Choice Association (CalCCA) is calling on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to revise its proposed decisions approving Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s (PG&E) and Southern California Edison Company’s (SCE) 2026 Energy Resource Recovery Account (ERRA) forecast applications, warning that the decisions would result in significant electricity rate increases for millions of Californians and violate state law protecting customer equity.

The CPUC’s proposed decisions would increase the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) rate for some Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) customers by 350- 455% from 2025 to 2026—in some cases nearly ten times the increase faced by bundled Investor-Owned utility (IOU) customers.* Some CCA households could see bills rise by more than $40 a month—or more than $500 a year—hitting low-income residents the hardest.

CalCCA notes in comments filed this week that the CPUC proposals “breeze past” huge bill increases by preventing CCA customers who have left PG&E or SCE generation service from receiving any value for renewable energy credits (RECs) they previously paid for as well as incorporating other measures that increase costs on community choice ratepayers.

“The CPUC’s proposed cost shift onto CCA customers is both unfair and unlawful, and some of the state’s most vulnerable customers will bear the burden,” said CalCCA CEO Beth Vaughan. “The CPUC must modify the proposed decisions to ensure RECs are valued consistent with the law.”

The PCIA is set annually in the Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs) ERRA proceedings. It includes above-market costs related to power supply commitments that the IOUs made many years ago. These include utility-owned generation (e.g., nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric plants) and long-term renewable energy contracts with third parties. The law requires that CCA and other departed load customers receive the value of benefits associated with the IOUs’ PCIA resources when their utility’s generation customers use the resources. Find additional information on the PCIA here.

CalCCA’s comments filed in PG&E’s 2026 ERRA Forecast proceeding (A.25-05-011) are available here CalCCA’s comments filed in the SCE 2026 ERRA Forecast proceeding (A.25-05-008) are available here.

Next, the CPUC will consider reply comments on the Proposed Decisions in each case. A final decision on both PDs is expected at the Commission’s December 18 voting meeting.

MONTANARO: You know, it certainly was the key issue in the special election we just saw this week in Tennessee, where Democrats again overperformed.","JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

It was another busy week in politics. The Supreme Court approved controversial redistricting plans in Texas. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth was in hot water in part because of strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats in the Caribbean. Oh, and also, there was another special election. So we've asked senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro to join us today to take a step back and put all of this into context. Hi to both of you.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Hello.

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Hey.

SUMMERS: Tam, I want to start with you and Secretary Hegseth, who was at the center of some really big scrutiny this week. Tell us what happened.

KEITH: It all comes back to Hegseth's leadership and judgment as secretary of defense. He was clearly in the hot seat all week. There was concern about the boat strike on September 2, where there were survivors who were then hit a second time and killed. Top lawmakers on key committees went into a closed-door hearing this week with bipartisan concerns. During that meeting, they saw a full video of the strikes, and they came out divided over how alarmed people should be about what happened. And they were divided on partisan political lines.

And that briefing up on the hill happened on the same day that an independent inspector general at the Department of Defense released a report that found, back in March, Hegseth had violated policy and risked the safety of U.S. service members by sharing sensitive military information in a group chat.

MONTANARO: Yeah. And politically, I mean, we've seen Republicans come to Hegseth's defense clearly here. You know, they're pointing to former President Barack Obama for these double-tap drone missile firings in the war on terrorism that were really controversial. They're saying that he wrote the playbook on this. The Pentagon spokesman called the inspector general's report a, quote, ""total exoneration,"" but that's not quite true. And, you know, it's just another example in the Trump era of just saying something is true and then hoping the base will echo those talking points.

And that's also been the case with Trump's recent racist comments about Somalis and Afghan refugees. You know, it's part of the Trump playbook to distract from worse news, like negative views of his handling of the economy, frankly, and go to xenophobia, immigration and other culture war issues. And his base has generally gone right along with that.

SUMMERS: And Hegseth is one part of all of this. But what are we learning this week about the way that the Trump administration is approaching foreign policy and national defense?

MONTANARO: Well, the White House put out a 33-page national security strategy document for the country. It's pretty notable for how Trump and his administration see the United States' role in the world. A few things really jumped out to me. One, there's real isolationist tendencies in it, noting, for example, quote, ""the affairs of other countries are our concern only if their activities directly threaten our interests."" Second, there's a clear retrenchment and focus on the Western hemisphere, which we've seen already here. And thirdly, there's this very harsh, negative view of Europe. The document describes Europe as undergoing economic decline and, quote, ""civilizational erasure"" tied to migration.

SUMMERS: But I have to say, this is not entirely surprising given what we've already seen and know about President Trump.

KEITH: Yeah. It's in line with how he has governed. But the document does lay this out explicitly, and it is quite the crack up of the post World War II order of alliances that largely kept peace and security for the West for well more than half a century at this point. And the question I have with this document is, will this be an enduring position or will it shift depending on who the president's talking to, as policies often do under this president?

SUMMERS: But at the same time, Republicans are grappling with a whole lot of data that suggests that voters are souring on Trump. Tell us what we're seeing.

MONTANARO: Well, Trump is really at his lowest point in his presidency politically. His approval ratings are the lowest. He's seen averaging now in the high 30s. He's in the 20s in our polling with independents. And so much of that is about the economy. His handling of it is low, as the cost of living has really been the dominant issue on people's minds. And yet Trump again this week was dismissing affordability as something important.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, there's this fake narrative that the Democrats talk about - affordability. They just say the word. It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it - affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.

MONTANARO: You know, it certainly was the key issue in the special election we just saw this week in Tennessee, where Democrats again overperformed. The Republican won there, but Democrats did better. So clearly, the cost of living does really matter to people.

SUMMERS: What has the White House been saying about all of this?

KEITH: Well, first, they insist that they do not have their hair on fire about what happened in Tennessee. I did go in and speak with a senior White House official earlier this week who said that the president's travel is really going to ramp up at the end of this year. The first stop, the only one that's been announced so far, is next Tuesday in Pennsylvania. The focus will be affordability. But I have to say, this same senior White House official told me almost exactly the same thing almost a month ago. That time, I was told that the message would about empathy on prices, saying, you know, I feel your pain. We've done a lot, but there's a lot more we need to do.

But as we've seen, the president keeps steering back to the idea of affordability as a word that Democrats made up as some kind of con job against him. That lack of message discipline has been hard to break. And the problem with the cost of living is people go to the grocery store all the time. They are out Christmas shopping, holiday shopping right now, and they can see for themselves what things cost.

SUMMERS: Right. And we've also talked a whole lot about the structural advantages that Republicans have when it comes to the midterms next year. Where do things stand now?

KEITH: Well, the Supreme Court last night delivered a big victory to Republicans, saying that the maps drawn in Texas can stand. That mid-decade redrawing of lines was designed to give Republicans up to five more seats in an already heavily Republican state. President Trump has been a driving force behind that because he is very openly concerned about what happens if Republicans lose control of the House.

MONTANARO: And still, though, for Republicans, you know, they're trying to gain more seats, and they very well may create more in someplace like Texas, but they may not get as many as they would have hoped for. And they're being offset by places like California and elsewhere. And in a wave year, redrawing those seats and making some of them less Republican could backfire. And it's part of a reason, that and affordability, why we've seen potentially so many Republicans retiring from Congress, a real sign that Republicans are taking it very seriously that this could be a wave year coming up for Democrats next year.

KEITH: Because nobody likes to be in the minority.

SUMMERS: NPR's Tamara Keith and Domenico Montanaro, thanks to both of you.

Bryce Bruncati, the residential sales director at Raleigh-based 8M solar, said that meant his team had to pivot quickly.
He expects things like solar leasing can make a difference on both fronts.
Industry advocates say leasing is a viable option, but those interested should keep in mind, solar leasing typically requires long-term contracts and include annual price increases.
“Ratepayers, people that care about the climate, people that care about local small businesses and jobs and economic output, everyone benefits from like a thriving solar industry,” he said.","According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, North Carolina has more than 7,300 workers in the solar industry. Up through this year, it was considered one of the fastest growing employment sectors in the state but the passage the federal spending bill in July marked a big shift in the country’s energy priorities.

Dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” the legislation ended a number of clean energy tax credits, including the 30% residential tax credit for homeowners looking to install solar and battery backups. Under the new rules, customers need to have their solar systems installed, inspected and connected to the grid by the end of 2025 in order to qualify for the credit.

Bryce Bruncati, the residential sales director at Raleigh-based 8M solar, said that meant his team had to pivot quickly.

“We went from a multi-year, six-year step down to cliff in six months,” he said. “So that’s just kind of tough for any business to figure out.”

For the past several months, Bruncati said that meant handling a rush of requests trying to add solar before the tax credits expire by January. He expects sales to plummet.

“We are expecting a potential 40% to 50% market contraction, and unfortunately, that’s going to really impact locally owned installers, but I expect many of them to close their doors,” he said.

Some in the renewable industry are already feeling the hit. Asheville-based Pine Gate Renewables filed bankruptcy and laid off more than 700 employees earlier this year, due to what they called market headwinds.

Bruncati said 8M is reevaluating its sales strategy to try and ensure the company won’t have to do the same.

“We’re trying to keep the teams we have, and our current employees,” he said.

At the center of the strategy is affordability. While solar is expected to cost more next year, Bruncati points out power is too.

He expects things like solar leasing can make a difference on both fronts. Leasing allows homeowners to rent solar and battery systems and start reaping the benefits of energy savings at a much lower, upfront cost.

“That also has the benefit of making solar accessible to a lot of people who maybe couldn’t order in the first place,” he said.

Industry advocates say leasing is a viable option, but those interested should keep in mind, solar leasing typically requires long-term contracts and include annual price increases. Homeowners should work with reputable installers and check annual price increases against the average utility-rate increase for their area to ensure their lease actually provides its promised savings.

As the cost of energy rises, Bruncati said the value of home solar and batteries will, too. He’s hopeful that means demand will return in the long-term and stay stable enough to help businesses like 8M weather this sudden market shift.

“Ratepayers, people that care about the climate, people that care about local small businesses and jobs and economic output, everyone benefits from like a thriving solar industry,” he said.

US President Donald Trump has been attacking the domestic EV industry from all angles, the latest move being a pledge to roll back CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards set during the Biden administration. You do you, Donald. In the meantime, though, the global EV industry is marching forward with a healthy assist from US innovators in the solid-state EV battery field.

CAFE Or Not, Here Comes The Solid-State EV Battery Of The Future …

This year’s sharp U-turn in federal energy policy has already thrown EV sales momentum for a loop. With the support of President Trump, in the summer the Republican-controlled Congress rescinded a $7,500 federal EV tax credit, leading to a sharp plunge in EV sales in the US after the credit ended on September 30. In contrast, EV sales continue to rise in Europe and other markets where public policy is not as vulnerable to partisan politics.

The long term outlook for the US market looks somewhat less gloomy. The cost of EV batteries has been dropping and US automakers expect to produce more affordable EVs in the coming years, with an assist from new LFP batteries. However, over the near term, auto industry insiders anticipate that the CAFE rollback will further depress EV sales, by reducing the upfront cost of buying gas-fueled vehicles.

Into this picture jumps solid-state EV batteries. As the name indicates, solid-state EV batteries do not have the liquid electrolyte found in conventional lithium-ion batteries. Instead, they deploy an electrolyte made of high-tech ceramics or some other solid material.

Small-scale solid-state batteries are nothing new, but scaling up the technology for use in EVs has posed a formidable R&D challenge. Nevertheless, auto industry stakeholders have invested much time and effort into the idea, attracted by the potential for cutting costs while improving range, reducing charging times, and eliminating the toxicity and fire hazards that characterize conventional Li-ion batteries. Solid-state batteries are also lighter and more energy dense than their Li-ion counterparts, providing automotive engineers and stylists with a greater range of design flexibility (see more solid-state background here).

… Eventually!

Among the solid state innovators attracting attention from the auto industry is the Massachusetts-based startup Factorial Energy. The company’s “FEST” semi-solid-state EV battery has been crisscrossing the CleanTechnica radar since 2021, when Mercedes-Benz (formerly Daimler) and Stellantis expressed interest in the new technology (see more Factorial background here).

In 2024, Stellantis followed up with plans to field a fleet of FEST-equipped Dodge Charger EVs in 2026. Though, the timeline has reportedly been pushed to 2027 according to Motor Trend.

As of earlier this year, Stellantis was still committed to making its investment in FEST EV batteries pay off sooner rather than later. In the meantime, Factorial has been moving the R&D needle on its plans for developing a full, 100% solid-state EV battery under the name “Solstice.”

In the latest development, Factorial and the POSCO Future M branch of the Korean conglomerate POSCO Group have hooked up in a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on solid-state EV battery technology.

EVs are actually just part of the plan. “Under the MOU, the two companies plan to explore cooperation in developing materials for all-solid-state batteries, which are powering progress in next-generation industries such as electric vehicles, robotics, energy storage systems and more,” the two firms explain.

“We expect synergy in the next-generation all-solid-state battery business based on Factorial’s battery technology and market presence with global automakers, and POSCO Future M’s competitiveness in cathode and anode materials,” elaborated POSCO Head of Research Hong Young-Jun.

US Innovators Keep Pushing That EV Envelope

Factorial anticipates that the collaboration with POSCO will support a reliable, global supply chain for its solid-state EV batteries, complementing its South Korean factory as well as a facility in its home state of Massachusetts.

Factorial is just one example. Another US contender in the solid-state field is the Colorado startup Solid Power, which recently leveled up its ongoing relationship with BMW.

Earlier this year, BMW let word slip that its interest in Solid Power was on the cusp of payoff, and in October the automaker was ready for a more definitive statement. “Under the newest stage of collaboration with BMW, Solid Power will contribute its sulfide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI for use in fabricating solid-state battery cells,” CleanTechnica reported on October 30.

Another player is the California startup Quantumscape. It was no surprise to see Volkswagen’s PowerCo branch taking Quantumscape’s new solid-state battery out for a spin last year, considering that Volkswagen is a Quantumscape investor. More recently, this year, Quantumscape joined forces with the legacy firm Corning in a new battery manufacturing venture. The two firms also partnered in a showcase of solid-state technology, featuring a Ducati motorcycle.

The Global EV Battery Race Heats Up, With Or Without The US

Although competition abounds in China and elsewhere, US innovators like Factorial, Solid Power, and Quantumscape have a good shot at leading the auto industry into the solid-state EV battery of the future — if not here in the US, then in other markets around the world.

And there is still plenty of innovating left to go around. Earlier this year, for example, researchers at Argonne National Laboratory recapped their efforts to improve solid-state batteries with lithium-metal electrodes.

“Because all atoms in lithium metal can participate in the charge and discharge of a battery — enabling it to store more energy — lithium metal has a higher energy density than graphite, a conventional electrode material,” the lab observed.

The lab points out that LLZO (lithium lanthanum zirconium garnet) solid electrolytes are excellent candidates for lithium metal electrodes. The next-level challenge is to identify other additives, such as gallium or aluminum, that improve electrolyte performance without degrading the electrodes.

Considering the topsy-turvy state of federal policy at the moment, all that hard work is unlikely to pay off — at least not here in the US. Automakers in Europe, though, could benefit. The research was conducted under the Vehicle Technologies Office of the US Department of Energy, through the US-German Cooperation on Energy Storage program. The University of California–Santa Barbara provided the LLZO material for analysis at the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum in Germany and the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences in the Czech Republic.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/factorial-solid-state-ev-battery.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 08:58:04.336802

Coming off that new directive is the news that Enbridge, a North American energy company with substantial pipeline assets in the US, has plans to upgrade the Algonquin Gas Transmission to bolster New England’s pipeline capacity.

The Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline upgrade marks a new era of increased gas capacity in the US

Enbridge has become a major player in the US energy market through its substantial gas pipeline assets in the region. The company has noted that reindustrialization and the reshoring of manufacturing are expected to boost American industrial power consumption growth by a remarkable 3% a year through 2035.

“We’re seeing a significant amount of customer interest in everything—gas-fired power generation as baseload, data center requirements, coal-to-gas conversions, and frankly just good old industrial demand.” – Greg Ebel Enbridge President and Chief Executive Officer

Enbridge has stated that the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline upgrade is aimed at increasing gas flow through New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, connecting to several regional gas pipeline assets. The region has some of the highest gas prices anywhere in the United States, leading to fluctuating prices that can often surprise customers.

The company notes the $0.3-billion expansion of the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline will increase up to 75 MMcf/d of supply to meet the needs of several local gas distribution companies in the US gas sector. The upgrade is designed to address winter gas price fluctuations that have hampered the purchasing power of several of Enbridge’s largest customers.

Unpredictable gas prices in the US have led Enbridge to aim to stabilize the sector

When winter hits the region in the US where the Algonquin Gas Transmission pipeline operates, it naturally affects the price of gas, leading to a wave of complaints from customers and operators alike. The US is the largest gas producer in the world, and since it relies so heavily on the sector, an upgrade to infrastructure was necessary.

“The Northeast has endured some of the highest energy prices in the nation. The combination of high demand, colder than normal temperatures and system constraints have resulted in considerable economic strain on households and businesses throughout the region.” – Enbridge spokesperson Michael Barnes

Enbridge has reached a final investment decision on the pipeline upgrade, a key milestone in the company’s plan for the gas sector in the Northeast of the US. The FID follows another key announcement that will boost gas production in the Permian basin. The company, along with its partners in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline joint venture, plans to upgrade and expand the Eiger Express pipeline.

The Permian basin has become the backbone of the US gas and oil sectors

Enbridge’s expansion plans for its substantial gas pipeline assets in the Permian come as other significantly large energy companies express similar plans to boost the gas infrastructure in the region, such as Enterprise Products Partners’ plan to boost the capacity of the Bahia NGL pipeline. With the substantial growth of the US gas market in recent months, the future of the American energy market is being led by the expansion of several infrastructure projects that can increase the capacity of the sector. The United States will continue to dominate the international gas sector at the current rate of output, led by several of the region’s largest energy companies.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:00:56.977964

Although solar hadn’t been on either of their minds when they had begun their search, after moving in they began to look more seriously at what adding solar panels would entail.

Solar journey

“I started by contacting an energy attorney, Ivy Main. She had been doing a lot of writing on energy policy and law in Virginia,” Edward told me. “We had some back and forth, before Ivy ended up connecting me with Ruth Amundsen. It was about a year before Ruth was able to come visit, to see if this was something that she could do. I arranged for her to do a public talk on solar here at the community library.” After seeing Ruth speak at the library and having her over to see their home, Edward and James decided to move forward with adding panels.

Ruth, an accomplished solar advocate from Norfolk, would ultimately help guide Edward and James through their solar journey: connecting them to an installer (Tiger Solar, based out of Charlottesville) before financing the panels herself through a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the couple.

Through their PPA, Edward and James would pay Ruth for the energy produced by the panels for a set period of time. As Ruth would keep rates steady, they would save money on energy bills throughout the length of the PPA and eventually have the opportunity to own the panels outright.

The PPA meant that Edward and James could access solar without taking on a large upfront cost. It also meant that they would start to see savings almost as soon as the panels came online.

That time would come in the summer of 2024, after a quick two-day installation by Tiger Solar.

Rural practicality

Speaking about their decision to go solar, Edward says: “Rural people are practical first. Our first practical point was that it was a perfect roof. Then, after looking at Ruth’s numbers, we saw that she was going to be able to keep the rates steady. With data centers sucking up energy, the promise from Ruth that she would not raise the rates was the second practical point for us. She is the power company.”

Their third practical point was their plan to eventually add storage to their home system, providing energy resilience in the event of a power outage and furthering their energy independence. “If need be, if the grid goes down, we want to be able to still generate power,” James says about that point, adding that they are waiting for battery prices to go down before ultimately taking that step.

There were also the environmental benefits. In addition to the financial incentives to add solar, they wanted to do their part to help protect the environment. That became even more attractive when it became clear that they wouldn’t have to pay extra – they could switch to clean energy and actually save money by doing so.

Go solar

I visited Edward and James at their home recently to discuss their experiences with residential solar. I too, turning the corner and seeing the house for the first time, was struck by how natural the panels looked on their roof.

For Edward and James, going solar had been smooth; when asked what the biggest surprise had been, their answer was how quickly the installers were able to complete the project. And how light the panels were: “They’re big, but not heavy.”

The simple rooftop solar installation now produces 4800 kwh/year, covering almost all of their annual energy needs. It’s only in the dead of winter that they have to pull in additional power from Dominion. Asked if they would do it all over again, the answer came easily for James: “Yes. We really didn’t have to do a lot.”

If you are interested in pursuing your own solar journey, Edward and James just recommend that you find the right person. Somebody who will listen to your specific needs and be a responsive and dependable solar partner. For them, finding Ruth was what helped to set them on the right path. It also helped that she was a Virginia-local, versus a national company, Edward says. “[With out-of-state companies] if there’s a problem, how am I ever going to solve it? That’s that rural practicality.”

For Edward and James, making the decision to add solar panels to their home was based on practical considerations first: they could add the panels to their roof, build energy resiliency, and help do their part to protect the environment, all while saving money on their electric bills. Who could say no to a deal that good?

Sierra Club petitioned the Sixth Circuit to review the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision granting Michigan’s request to ease air-pollution restrictions in the Detroit metro area.

The EPA’s compliance ruling came after excluding June 2022 testing data, based on elevated ozone readings it claimed were caused by neighboring Canadian wildfires.

Sierra Club argued the exclusion was arbitrary and that Detroit met federal ozone standards only because the data was removed.

The panel disagreed with Friday’s opinion, finding ample evidence supported the EPA’s “exceptional-event” request.

Specifically, findings of brown carbon at the Detroit testing site on the two days air samples were collected were indicative of wildfire smoke, despite the Sierra Club’s claim that the state cherry-picked its sampling data.

“The evidence Michigan provided was extensive, consisting of a comparison of the June 24 and 25 exceedances with historical concentrations, figures showing the progression of smoke plumes over North America using satellite imagery, calculations of trajectories originating from the largest fire sites … and a matching-day analysis,” Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Helene White said.

White, a George W. Bush appointee, also rejected Sierra Club’s claim that Detroit met ozone standards only because the pandemic reduced auto traffic.

She noted ozone levels actually rose from 2019 to 2020 and agreed with the EPA that Detroit’s gains stemmed from lasting state measures, including tighter nitrogen oxide controls and lower-evaporation gasoline.

But the panel sided with Sierra Club on one point, granting its request to revoke Detroit’s attainment status because the region failed to comply with required reasonably available control technology (RACT) standards.

The decision rested on the timing of Michigan’s attainment application and the specific wording of the legislation, both of which White analyzed in her opinion.

Michigan sought attainment status for Detroit in January 2022, but the EPA reclassified the region as “moderate” nonattainment in February 2023.

That reclassification came with updated RACT requirements, which Sierra Club said the state and city failed to meet — even as the EPA approved Detroit’s attainment status in May 2023.

The EPA argued RACT compliance should be measured as of the application date, but the appeals court rejected that view.

Its decision was based in no small part on the use of the present-perfect tense phrase “has met” in the statutory language.

“Congress elected to use the present-perfect ‘has met,’ which ‘denotes past action with an abiding effect or continuing relevance’ and not ’noncontinuing compliance,’” White said. “Accordingly, the phrase ‘has met’ requires that all applicable requirements must be met until the date of redesignation.”

The agency pushed back, arguing the tense could be a way for Congress to stress the importance of past events — such as achieving air quality attainment standards — but the panel determined that interpretation would render the word “has” meaningless.

“The statute clearly contemplates escalating requirements even when a state has submitted a request to redesignate an area to attainment. The nonattainment scheme in the CAA adjusts an area’s obligations based on its failure to comply with the statute’s deadline for achieving attainment.

“It is the state’s failure to meet the deadline, not a finding that the state’s air quality has worsened, that triggers a bump-up in the CAA requirements. When a state fails to meet its deadline, it is bumped up, and the stricter requirements go into effect,” White said.

Michigan cannot skirt the deadline requirement, according to the panel, and its failure to submit a revised improvement plan that properly implements RACT requirements precludes the City of Detroit from attaining attainment status.

Senior U.S. Circuit Judge R. Guy Cole Jr., an appointee of Bill Clinton, and U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanie Dawkins Davis, an appointee of Joe Biden, also sat on the panel.

The EPA said it is reviewing the decision.

The changes, proposed in Carney’s Nov. 4 budget, are meant to address what his government says is a “trend” of companies staying silent about their environmental efforts out of fears of running afoul of the law, according to a statement sent to The Narwhal from Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

Greenwashing is when companies make misleading claims about the eco-friendliness of their products or actions, making their environmental stewardship appear greater than it is. Lawmakers added the anti-greenwashing provisions to the federal Competition Act last year in part to address the issue of companies advertising that they were headed toward net-zero emissions while not presenting evidence showing they were taking any significant steps toward cutting their carbon pollution.

But now, the government believes companies are “withholding information that could aid in attracting investment for green innovation,” a departmental spokesperson said. Carney’s budget claimed the anti-greenwashing law, brought in under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was leading to “some parties slowing or reversing efforts to protect the environment.”

When asked by The Narwhal, the federal department couldn’t name any specific examples of companies slow-walking genuine environmental efforts as a result of last year’s legal changes, which deal specifically with marketing unsubstantiated green claims rather than environmental action itself.

One expert says any legal risks are being massively exaggerated. Wren Montgomery, cofounder of the Greenwash Action Lab and professor at the Ivey Business School at Western University, believes awareness of how to comply with the law is already fairly widespread — and the companies still complaining may simply want to avoid being held accountable for their lack of climate action.

“The only lawyers I’ve heard complain about it are the lawyers actually working in these corporations,” Montgomery said. “So it seems either just that [corporate lawyers] are too thinly spread, and don’t really understand competition law or sustainability reporting very well, or that they’re using it as an excuse.”

The government’s remarks come on the heels of a Nov. 16 open letter released by Clean50, a collective of sustainability leaders, and signed by 144 of its members in business, academia, politics and the environmental sector calling on Carney to do more to tackle the climate crisis — including reversing plans laid out in the budget to dismantle some of Canada’s anti-greenwashing rules.

The letter states that it’s the Carney government’s proposed changes to the law, rather than the law itself, that will undermine investor confidence and harm Canadian entrepreneurs who had already adapted to the changes.

“Renewed greenwashing can distort competition and act as a barrier to entry to genuine green firms or drive them from the market,” the letter reads.

It also comes as Canada signs on to an international pledge to combat climate disinformation, committing to “equitable access to accurate, consistent, evidence-based and understandable information on climate change.”

The Carney government’s concerns about the law revolve around a requirement added to Canada’s Competition Act last year for businesses to back up their environmental claims with evidence that conforms to internationally recognized standards for calculating a company’s carbon footprint.

The budget argued the requirement to adhere to internationally recognized standards, as well as another rule allowing private individuals or organizations to bring greenwashing complaints before a tribunal, were “creating investment uncertainty” and “having the opposite of the desired effect.” It proposed getting rid of both rules, while keeping the base requirement for businesses to substantiate their environmental claims.

The federal Competition Bureau, which enforces fair competition in the marketplace, says deceptive marketing about environmental efforts can lead to a distorted playing field where Canadian consumers make ill-informed choices with their money. A spokesperson for the Competition Bureau said they were aware of the Carney government’s proposed changes to the law, but declined an interview request from The Narwhal.

In Canada, voluntary disclosure standards for including environmental risk in financial statements, developed based on internationally recognized criteria, refer to a framework called the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Other jurisdictions, like the United States, have put in place similar requirements that green claims be grounded in evidence from relevant scientific fields or verifiable criteria.

In June, the bureau issued guidelines for organizations navigating Canada’s anti-greenwashing rules, saying it would accept any carbon accounting standard recognized in at least two countries.

Montgomery said consultants and lawyers who have been working on sustainability reporting have told her they were already aware of what green accounting standards to use, or were already incorporating them into their work. She said it was important to stick to internationally recognized standards because of the risk of the industry using third-party certification methods that could prove dubious.

The government has the option of strengthening the law, Montgomery and other greenwashing experts have argued, instead of repealing parts of it. Ottawa could change the language around the use of standards, the experts said, such as removing the “international” requirement or specifying precisely which standards to use.

Suspending the third-party right of action until those changes were made, rather than canceling it permanently, would be a way to provide clarity without stripping away the law’s purpose, they added.

The government’s concerns over uncertainty in the law echo complaints lodged by large oil and gas companies in Canada last year, many of which said the anti-greenwashing provisions had introduced significant “uncertainty” and that the requirement to adhere to the standards in presenting their information was “vague” or “overreaching.”

The Narwhal asked the office of Industry Minister Mélanie Joly if it could name any examples of companies or organizations that were slowing or reversing genuine environmental efforts as a result of the law.

A departmental spokesperson, Andréa Daigle, responded that the government had heard from “numerous stakeholders across various sectors of the economy” that they felt unable to report on environmental achievements but did not discuss the impact of those efforts.

The fossil fuel industry, as well as other businesses, civil society and government-run groups, had “regularly raised what they and their legal counsel considered an unacceptable risk in making public statements” when it was unclear what standards to use for backing them up, Daigle said.

“This has resulted in a trend … of withholding information that could aid in attracting investment for green innovation and informing consumers about good-faith efforts,” she said.

The goal of paring down the law was to “ease fears of heavy enforcement that could discourage companies from speaking up, while ensuring they remain accountable for showing their claims are genuine.”

Last year, an official at Environment and Climate Change Canada told the Competition Bureau that “uncertainty” around the anti-greenwashing law “has led to some challenges” in encouraging companies to voluntarily adopt net-zero commitments under a government-run program.

At the same time, the department said it was “reasonable” to expect companies to come up with an environmental plan backed by “credible elements” that includes carbon accounting “based on international methodology,” as required by law.

Others at the time said the law seemed fine. The Canadian Renewable Energy Association, for example, said it supported the rules and would “strongly encourage” the adoption of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol as the internationally recognized standard of choice.

In a 2024 survey by Angus Reid Forum, commissioned by Greenpeace Canada, 93 per cent of Canadians agreed companies should face penalties for making unproven environmental claims.

Pike Township Residents Push Back Against Proposed Data Center in Urban Forest

Another week, another data center controversy in Indiana. Residents of Pike Township have joined the chorus of Hoosier communities actively speaking out against a proposed data center that would replace what’s currently a lush urban forest.

According to WRTV, American Tower—which already owns property where a 1,000-foot-tall broadcast tower is located—is proposing a rezoning that would allow construction of a 20,000 square foot data center on the site. Members of Protect Pike Township warn that removing this large swath of trees and forested area would lead to increased flood risk and destroy an important barrier against air pollution. The added use of backup diesel-fueled generators raises concerns about emissions and corresponding air quality impacts.

This is yet another instance of Indiana becoming a prime location for data centers, with developers taking advantage of affordable property and underdeveloped areas. The proposed rezoning will be considered by the City-County Council next week.

More Indiana Counties Enact Data Center Moratoriums Amid Growing Local Concerns

Some Indiana counties are getting ahead of these fights with data center moratoriums. A White County, a community just north of Lafayette, became the latest Indiana region to resist data center development, approving a moratorium after months of public opposition and uncertainty surrounding a proposed project.

The decision means White, Marshall, and Putnam counties have all put the brakes on data center development while they figure out what these projects could mean for local water supplies, land use, and infrastructure. In White County specifically, the moratorium came after a developer asked to rezone nearly 300 acres near Wolcott—a request that kept getting delayed as public opposition mounted.

These interactions are creating real tension between local control and state economic policy. Indiana passed tax breaks in 2019 to attract data center companies, and state officials keep promoting these facilities as crucial for competing in the AI economy. But many rural communities aren’t convinced—they’re worried about whether their water systems and power grids can handle it.

In recent years, 80% of Indiana counties have blocked wind or solar energy projects. Now data centers are becoming the next battleground in the same fight: who gets to decide what kind of development happens in local communities?

For now, these moratoriums give counties breathing room to study the impacts before making permanent decisions. But as more communities push back, the threat of state legislators eventually stepping in to take away local authority remains a reality.

Massachusetts Moves Forward on Climate Education with New Funding and Advisory Council

Massachusetts took a significant step forward for climate education last week when a key legislative committee advanced three bills that would bring climate science into classrooms across the state.

Two bills, Senate Bill 391 and the identical House Bill 560, would establish a trust fund to support climate education, prioritizing underserved communities and those disproportionately affected by climate change. The state’s education commissioner, working with a new Climate Literacy Advisory Council, could use the fund to develop lesson materials, support teacher training, and help districts share best practices. Senate Bill 410 would add “climate science and climate solutions” to the list of topics the state board of education is allowed to include in their standards.

Massachusetts joins a handful of other states making headway to a more informed and prepared next generation, but Massachusetts is taking a slightly different approach by creating a dedicated fund and advisory council rather than just mandating the topics. The idea is to give teachers real resources and support, not just add more requirements without tools and training.

If passed, Massachusetts would join a small but growing number of states recognizing the significance of taking an interdisciplinary approach and prioritizing communities that need support most. The bills are with the respective House and Senate Ways and Means Committees.

Australia Passes Sweeping Environmental Reforms to Protect Nature and Economy

In a time when environmental protections seem under constant threat, Australia just delivered some genuinely hopeful news—and it shows that ambitious environmental reform is still possible when leaders choose to lead.

Australia’s parliament recently passed sweeping reforms to their Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, overhauling environmental laws that had long been criticized as outdated and lackluster. According to Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek, these reforms prove that protecting nature and growing the economy don’t have to be opposing forces.

Minister Plibersek explained that Australia’s old system was actually failing on both fronts—the environment wasn’t being protected, biodiversity was in systemic decline, and the messy, slow approval process was undermining economic productivity. Australia simply couldn’t afford environmental planning decisions that were duplicative and based on incomplete information.

The reforms create clear national standards defining what environmental impacts are “unacceptable” and must be avoided. They establish an independent national EPA to build integrity into decision-making and reduce political interference. And crucially, they write into law something profound: that environmental protection and biodiversity conservation necessarily underpin everything else—the economy, jobs, public health—and therefore must have primacy.

Plibersek called these reforms “an unprecedented bequest to future generations” which may be the most important takeaway for those of us watching from across the world. When the political will exists, it’s possible to design systems that protect nature while supporting economic transition and job creation. Australia just proved that environmental protection and economic prosperity can reinforce each other.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on EOSE. Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc.'s share was trading at $13.61 as of December 1st.

The rapid rise in industrial battery demand is being driven not by green energy sentiment, but by the physics of power generation and consumption. Renewable sources like wind and solar generate electricity intermittently, often out of sync with demand peaks, while growing urban centers and AI-driven data centers are straining aging power grids. Rather than investing billions in new transmission lines, large-scale battery storage has become the more efficient solution — transforming renewables into reliable, dispatchable energy.

Following the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, energy storage evolved into a standalone, government-supported industry with tax incentives and “made in America” mandates, creating fertile ground for new market leaders. Eos Energy (EOSE) has emerged as a key beneficiary, producing zinc-based, water-electrolyte batteries that are nonflammable, cost-effective, and ideally suited for stationary use. The company’s systems now anchor the intersection of renewable energy, grid stability, and industrial power demand.

The inflection point came in 2024, when the AI boom dramatically increased grid loads and triggered a race for energy storage capacity. With substantial production and investment tax credits — up to $45 per kilowatt-hour — Eos can directly monetize tens of millions per gigawatt-hour of output through 2029, making domestic manufacturing financially viable.

Additionally, FEOC restrictions excluding Chinese components have accelerated demand for U.S.-made systems, giving Eos a competitive advantage as it sources over 90% of its materials domestically.

The U.S. Department of Energy has approved an $8.6 million grant that will allow the nation’s first utility-led geothermal heating and cooling network to double in size.

Gas and electric utility Eversource Energy completed the first phase of its geothermal network in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 2024. Eversource is a corecipient of the award along with the city of Framingham and HEET, a Boston-based nonprofit that focuses on geothermal energy and is the lead recipient of the funding.

Geothermal networks are widely considered among the most energy-efficient ways to heat and cool buildings. The federal money will allow Eversource to add approximately 140 new customers to the Framingham network and fund research to monitor the system’s performance.

The federal funding was first announced in December 2024 under the Biden administration. However, the contract between HEET and the Department of Energy was not finalized until Sept. 30 and was just announced Wednesday. The agreement, which allows construction to move forward, comes as the Trump administration is clawing back billions of dollars in clean energy funding, including hundreds of millions of dollars in Massachusetts.

“This award is an opportunity and a responsibility to clearly demonstrate and quantify the growth potential of geothermal network technology,” Zeyneb Magavi, HEET’s executive director, wrote in a statement.

The existing system provides heating and cooling to approximately 140 residential and commercial customers in the western suburb of Boston. The network taps low-temperature thermal energy from dozens of boreholes drilled several hundred feet below ground, where temperatures remain steady at 55 degrees Fahrenheit. A network of pipes circulates water through the boreholes to each building, enabling electric heat pumps to provide additional heating or cooling as needed.

“By harnessing the natural heat from the earth, we are taking a significant step toward increasing our energy independence and promoting abundant local energy sources,” Charlie Sisitsky, Framingham’s mayor, wrote.

Progress on the project is a further indicator that despite their opposition to wind and solar, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress appear to back geothermal energy.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office declaring an energy emergency that expressed support for a limited mix of energy resources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, biofuels, hydropower, and geothermal energy.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by Republicans and signed by Trump in July, quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar, and electric vehicles. However, the bill left geothermal heating and cooling tax credits approved under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 largely intact.

A reorganization of the Department of Energy announced last month eliminated the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy but kept the office for geothermal energy as part of the newly created Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.

“The fact that geothermal is on this administration’s agenda is pretty impactful,” said Nikki Bruno, vice president for thermal solutions and operational services at Eversource. “It means they believe in it. It’s a bipartisan technology.”

Plans for the expansion project call for roughly doubling Framingham’s geothermal network capacity at approximately half the cost of the initial buildout. Part of the estimated cost savings will come from using existing equipment rather than duplicating it.

“You’ve already got all the pumping and control infrastructure installed, so you don’t need to build a new pump house,” said Eric Bosworth, a geothermal expert who runs the consultancy Thermal Energy Insights. Bosworth oversaw the construction of the initial geothermal network in Framingham while working for Eversource.

The network’s efficiency is anticipated to increase as it grows, requiring fewer boreholes to expand. That improvement is due to the different heating and cooling needs of individual buildings, which increasingly balance each other out as the network expands, Magavi said.

The project still awaits approval from state regulators, with Eversource aiming to start construction by the end of 2026, Bruno said.

“What we’re witnessing is the birth of a new utility,” Magavi said. Geothermal networks “can help us address energy security, affordability and so many other challenges.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/ae64d2af69eba3db87c08734364e54bc,N,,2025-12-05 20:00:17.859787

The study argues choice for data centers isn’t between revenue or curtailment, but rather between revenue or waiting in line.
By accessing the grid three years earlier via flexible interconnection, a single data center site stands to generate between $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion in additional earnings.

Flexible connection avoids the need for peak capacity buildout, which saves around $78 million per gigawatt of data center load in system costs, the report found.","Federal regulators, tasked with building a framework to allow data centers to connect to the grid more quickly, are grappling with the question of whether large loads that agree to be curtailed should get expedited access.

A new analysis published this week, sponsored by Google, offers a potential blueprint for a tariff structure that would do just that, its authors argue — while also neutralizing the risk of shifting costs to ratepayers.

The report, conducted by grid orchestration platform Camus Energy, transmission modeling firm Encoord, and Princeton University’s ZERO Lab, uses real transmission data from an anonymized utility in PJM to model hourly constraints at six hypothetical 500 megawatt data center sites.

While many early iterations of flexible interconnection tariffs offer a binary, either firm or non-firm service, the report models a third option: data centers that receive a mix of firm (uninterruptible) and “conditional firm” (or curtailable) grid service. In that scenario, the data center must bring enough accredited capacity to cover its uninterruptible load — through power purchase agreements, virtual power plants, or onsite power — while agreeing to manage the demand of its “conditional firm” load during grid constraints.

The modeling found that accepting a flexible interconnection agreement could get those theoretical data centers online three to five years faster than under the existing interconnection process for inflexible load. The “reliability sacrifice” required across the study’s sites was minimal; grid power was available for more than 99% of all hours in the year. Bridging the remaining gap required dispatching backup sources for between 40 and 70 hours annually.

Responding to risk

The white paper also offers a counterargument to the skepticism raised by the PJM market monitor and others, that data centers are unlikely to curtail voluntarily because the revenue generated by their compute load vastly outweighs any grid penalty or payment.

The study argues choice for data centers isn’t between revenue or curtailment, but rather between revenue or waiting in line. By accessing the grid three years earlier via flexible interconnection, a single data center site stands to generate between $2.3 billion and $3.2 billion in additional earnings.

Data centers are inherently incentivized to adopt the “buy capacity to connect now” approach, despite the up front cost, the study found, because that massive revenue gain easily covers the lifecycle cost of the on-site batteries or generators needed to make flexibility physically reliable. In short, flexibility is the only profitable path through the queue.

On the consumer side, the report attempts to temper fears of cost-shifting, arguing that under the proposed framework, a data center covers between 96% and 100% of the incremental system costs required to serve it.

Flexible connection avoids the need for peak capacity buildout, which saves around $78 million per gigawatt of data center load in system costs, the report found. On top of that, the BYOC arrangement requires the data center to procure its own accredited capacity for its firm load, effectively removing that demand from the general market pool so it doesn’t drive up capacity clearing prices for other ratepayers.

But the report relies on a few foundational assumptions that flexibility critics warn may not align with the realities of the grid. For one thing, while the study proves that data centers can technically afford to be flexible without losing uptime, it leaves open the question of whether they will comply during a true emergency.

Another challenge, as Aurora Energy Research Head of USA East Julia Hoos explained during a recent Latitude Dispatch, is that site-specific flexibility, as modeled in the report, doesn’t account for complex knock-on effects. Taking a large generator or load offline can redirect the power flow all across PJM, potentially requiring transmission upgrades in entirely different parts of the footprint, Hoos explained.

FERC parallels

The hybrid solution the study proposes is closely aligned with what sponsor Google and other hyperscalers are advocating to FERC, as part of the large load interconnection proceeding kicked off by the Department of Energy earlier this fall.

The first round of filings in FERC’s docket show widespread support for fast-tracking flexible large loads, said Camus CEO Astrid Atkinson. “Specific comments from National Grid, Google, Microsoft, Constellation, Open AI, Critical Loop, and others are well aligned with the flexible connection and/or [bring your own] capacity approaches,” she added.

Broadly, the docket reflects a “growing convergence of opinion among diverse stakeholders that flexible load capabilities should be leveraged to bridge the gap between immediate interconnection needs and the longer timelines required for traditional transmission upgrades,” she added.

Google, for its part, urged FERC to approve expedited interconnection for loads that volunteer to be flexible and bring their own generation, which could be either onsite or “electrically proximate.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-05T115514.497.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:47.530123

But Hochul earlier this year backpedaled on her administration’s plans for a New York carbon market, citing affordability concerns.
‘Cap and invest’ New York was well on the way toward a carbon market just a few years ago.
New York would be only the third state with a statewide carbon market.
“There is robust evidence that by moving forward with a well-designed cap and invest program, the governor can actually be cutting costs for working families in New York,” she said.","The era of grand climate promises has given way to a new period for New York and other states: grappling with executing them.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced a long-awaited climate rule this week that will force companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions, but with one significant omission from earlier plans: the rollout of a cap-and-trade-style program that Hochul herself had initiated, writes my colleague Anne Mulkern.

The new reporting requirement, beginning in the summer of 2027, will make New York the third U.S. state to require top polluters to report their greenhouse gas output. But Hochul earlier this year backpedaled on her administration’s plans for a New York carbon market, citing affordability concerns. Its fate is now embroiled in litigation.

A similar gap between making climate promises and implementing policies to achieve them emerged at the United Nations’ COP30 climate conference in Brazil last month. And politicians all over are shifting from climate to cost-of-living issues as they talk about the broader economy, electricity prices and the tech industry’s unlimited appetite for energy.

Look no further than Tom Steyer, notes my colleague Noah Baustin. The billionaire environmentalist, who made a name for himself on the national political stage as a climate activist, pointedly announced he is running for California governor in a video last month without mentioning climate once.

‘Cap and invest’

New York was well on the way toward a carbon market just a few years ago.

In 2023, the state released a draft road map for how a statewide cap-and-trade market, which the state calls “cap-and-invest,” would work. A carbon market was seen as critical to delivering on the state’s 2019 climate law, which mandates an 85 percent cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a 100 percent zero-emission grid by 2040.

New York would be only the third state with a statewide carbon market. California and Washington state both run economywide carbon markets, while Oregon operates one that’s smaller in scope.

The cap-and-trade fight isn’t over for New York. Last month, a state judge ruled that Hochul’s administration had violated the 2019 climate law by not launching the carbon market. The court gave the state Department of Environmental Conservation until February to release an emissions-cutting rule. Hochul’s administration is appealing the ruling.

After the October court decision, Hochul defended her position as one about affordability: “My job is to ensure we have enough power to keep the lights on, keep rates affordable, and attract major economic development projects.”

Kate Courtin, the Environmental Defense Fund’s senior manager for state climate policy, disputes the notion that energy costs and a program designed to ratchet down emissions can’t be reconciled.

“There is robust evidence that by moving forward with a well-designed cap and invest program, the governor can actually be cutting costs for working families in New York,” she said.

Communities struggle with loss of EPA grants

Low-income communities that lost Environmental Protection Agency grants are wondering how to move forward on projects meant to protect their residents from vulnerabilities, Jean Chemnick writes.

Among the 105 recipients of EPA’s Community Change Grants Program awards is Kipnuk, a Native Alaskan settlement that had received $20 million to shore up a river bank that threatened the community. It was decimated in an October storm, and while it’s not known if the grant could have saved the village, its leaders don’t know how or if they can find another source of funding.

Trump canceled all 105 awards earlier this year, though recipients continue to challenge the decision.

“It’s been very difficult to work as long and as hard as we did and then to just have it jerked out from under you,” said Dorothy Darr, executive director of the North Carolina-based nonprofit Southwest Renewal Foundation of High Point, which lost an $18.4 million award to fix the city’s leaking sewer pipes.

Conservatives sound alarm on permitting bill

Members of the House Freedom Caucus are objecting to parts of a big permitting overhaul bill that Republican leaders had hoped to hold a vote on next week, Kelsey Brugger writes.

The bill from House Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) had a bipartisan amendment added in committee meant to protect permits. That was in response to the Trump administration’s attacks on renewable energy projects that had already been approved. And that has frustrated members like Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas).

“I don’t want to fast-track any of the wind and solar. It’s still not a neutral playing field because it’s subsidized,” said Roy, who also unsuccessfully pushed for the immediate repeal of renewable energy tax credits in the megalaw that Trump signed in July.

“The last thing we need to do with offshore wind is to tie the administration’s hands in stopping that ridiculously expensive source of energy that enriches foreign companies with American taxpayer dollars,” said Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.).

Two Central Valley residents have been recognized for their leadership in advancing the state’s clean energy goals.

On Dec. 4, the California Energy Commission held its 2025 Clean Energy Hall of Fame Awards ceremony at the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) Auditorium, honoring local leaders making significant contributions to help the state achieve a 100% clean energy future.

Award recipients for the 6th annual event include Judith Gomez, coordinator for Climate Action Pathways for Schools (CAPS) in Porterville, who took home the Youth Game-Changer award.

Cassandra Little, CEO of the Metro Black Chamber of Commerce in Fresno, won the Clean Energy Champion award.

Through her work with CAPS, Gomez helped reduce energy costs and a greenhouse emissions by 80% for seven local schools, designed high-efficiency lighting strategies for 21 schools throughout the Porterville Unified School District and participated in securing a $5.8 million Department of Energy grant to support energy efficiency upgrades for Porterville Unified.

Little is recognized for making transportation more sustainable, community owned and accessible in the Central Valley.

She helped the chamber launch the Fresno area’s first Clean Shared Mobility Network, which operates a fleet of 40 electric vehicles and 200 e-bikes in under resourced neighborhoods.

Little also created programs such as Van-Werx, an on-demand and EV van service and Betting Big, a capital and mentorship initiative for minority-owned clean energy startups.

She also developed a 2-week EV Accelerator to train entrepreneurs and small business owners in clean mobility innovation and mentor new leaders in the energy justice space.",https://thebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/van-werx-e1741387897916.png,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:34.163892

Despite PCEF’s evolution, the program has kept dedicated funding available for nonprofits working on climate projects.
Another $25 million will be split roughly equally among projects dedicated to transportation decarbonization ($8.1 million) climate workforce development ($9.3 million), and regenerative agriculture/green infrastructure ($7.5 million).","It’s been a tough year for climate work around the country, with the Trump administration slashing funding for programs intended to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the threats of the climate crisis. But Portland has a secret weapon for local environmental action: The Portland Clean Energy Community Benefits Fund, also known as PCEF. To date, the fund has allocated $1.71 billion in grants for climate projects. This year, the fund is set to dole out more than $60 million for climate projects in its latest round of grants to nonprofits.

The funding will help pay for 59 nonprofit-led projects addressing a range of climate issues, from energy efficiency in homes to transportation emissions. The funding is prioritized for projects targeting low-income communities and Portlanders of color, who are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

The city has calculated the grant-funded projects will result in a lifetime reduction of roughly 76,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. That’s about equal to the carbon emissions generated in one year by roughly 17,770 gas-powered cars. However, PCEF leaders say the project benefits to Portlanders extend beyond greenhouse gas reduction, with anticipated benefits including improved indoor air quality, connection to living-wage jobs, and access to high-quality, fresh foods.

""Together, these community-led projects demonstrate the power of collective action to advance the City's climate goals while creating lasting benefits for Portland's communities,” PCEF Program Manager Sam Baraso said in a press release.

PCEF was approved by voters as a 2018 ballot measure. The program, which is funded by a 1 percent tax on large retailers in Portland, was initially dedicated primarily to funding climate projects via grants to nonprofit organizations. But PCEF raked in significantly more money than initially anticipated. While early estimates calculated PCEF would generate $40 to $60 million annually, it’s currently raising about $200 million a year. As its funding capacity increased, so did its scope.

PCEF now provides funding to public agencies for large-scale climate projects. The fund has also been used to backfill budget shortfalls within the city’s own bureaus, as long as the money is used for projects that can be tied to carbon reduction or environmental justice goals. The decision to allow financially-constrained bureaus to tap into PCEF has been controversial among the program’s leaders, who don’t want to water down the climate fund into the city’s all-purpose piggy bank. Their fears aren’t baseless: The Portland Police Association is currently supporting an effort to reroute 25 percent of PCEF revenue toward police hiring.

Despite PCEF’s evolution, the program has kept dedicated funding available for nonprofits working on climate projects. Last year, the fund allocated nearly $92 million in grants to local nonprofits. This year, the program will distribute roughly $64 million to 59 organizations. About half of the money, or $33.6 million, will be allocated to organizations for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. Another $25 million will be split roughly equally among projects dedicated to transportation decarbonization ($8.1 million) climate workforce development ($9.3 million), and regenerative agriculture/green infrastructure ($7.5 million). Most of the money will be given to organizations to implement projects, though a fraction of the grants are intended for planning future programming.

PCEF received 216 applications for grant funding, with requests totaling more than $260 million. Program leaders took the strong response as a reflection of how “local organizations have continued to strengthen their capacity and maintain their ambition in recent years.” In other words, there’s a lot of demand for climate funding, and despite the program’s financial windfall, PCEF can’t meet it all.

The largest grants allocated in this cycle were two $4.9 million awards to the Williams and Russell Community Development Corporation (CDC) and Self Enhancement, Inc, both for energy efficiency projects. The former grant is for an energy-efficient Black business hub, intended to be an economic and community resource for the historically Black Albina district, while the second is meant for the construction of 31 net-zero emissions homes to address housing affordability and displacement in Northeast Portland.

Other notable projects include Earth Advantage, Inc’s plan to install 405 easy-install heat pumps in eligible affordable housing units across the city ($2.9 million), the Black American Chamber of Commerce’s plan to provide subsidies to small businesses for electric car purchases ($2 million), and Bike Bus PDX’s proposal to increase programming in support children biking to school together ($895,000).

Portland YouthBuilders was granted $1.5 million for a pre-apprenticeship program offering clean energy training and career development to 100 young adults from underserved communities,and the Columbia Land Trust was awarded nearly $1 million to provide landscaping services, trees, and plants to PCEF priority households and community spaces, enabling people and businesses to create backyard habitats that provide shade and capture stormwater, as well as providing habitat for wildlife.

The full list of grant awards is available here.

Applications were vetted by program staff and a review panel made up of PCEF committee volunteers, community representatives, and subject matter experts. City Administrator Michael Jordan ultimately approved the grant funding based on the recommendations.

This is a change from previous grant cycles, when the City Council was given the final say over the distribution of PCEF funds. While the Council’s approval was mostly seen as a formality, it gave PCEF leaders and grantees the opportunity to speak to city leaders in a public forum.

Councilor Steve Novick, who co-chairs the Climate and Sustainability Committee with Councilor Angelita Morillo, told the Mercury in theory, he’s fine with administrative staff taking over the PCEF grant approval process. Novick has been openly skeptical about the Council intervening in matters he considers administrative—for example, when a group of councilors moved to reject the recommendations of city staff and advisory bodies to overturn a slate of Portland Children’s Levy grants.

Novick said he thinks the City Council should be tasked with adopting broad initiatives, such as the Climate Investment Plan that guides PCEF’s investments, and let administrative staff take over the details.

“It doesn't make sense for Council to approve individual grants or even the slate of grants for a year,” Novick said. “There’s a process for awarding community grants that the Council is not involved with in a detailed way, and I think that’s the way it should work.”

But moving the process completely behind the scenes may limit opportunities for discussion and engagement between city leaders and residents. Novick said after looking through the latest slate of PCEF grants, he had some questions about the awards and how they were decided. Even if the City Council isn’t in charge of the decisions, Novick thinks it is in the councilors’ best interest to stay engaged with the program and how PCEF dollars are spent.

“I think in broad parameters, the Council is pretty well-informed [about PCEF], but that doesn't mean that there isn't room for us to be more engaged,” Novick said.

Novick said the Council’s engagement in PCEF is particularly important as the program faces threats from those who want to cash in on its earnings. He plans to look into opportunities for the Council’s Climate Committee to hear more from PCEF staff and grantees in a public forum.

“The amount of money we have in PCEF to spend on climate issues is far less than a reasonable society would be spending to address climate issues. The fact that it's bringing in more money than originally projected is a red herring,” Novick said. “But since we do want to be able to prove we’re getting the biggest bang for our buck, we should be constantly looking at that.”",https://media1.fdncms.com/portmerc/imager/u/large/48169524/eb068176-050d-483b-a8d8-95c5e2c29de1.webp,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:39.649883

This bipartisan bill would help make Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) more resilient by giving them the resources needed to install solar energy and energy storage systems.

“Federally Qualified Health Centers are a lifeline for families across the Central Valley, and we need to make sure they can stay open—even when emergencies happen,” said Congressman Valadao. “The CHARGE Act creates a new grant program to help FQHCs install reliable energy storage systems so they can keep serving patients without interruption. I’m proud to partner with Congressman Smith on this bipartisan effort to strengthen local healthcare and lower energy costs.”

“Community health centers are the backbone of care in underserved communities. Too many face dangerous gaps in power reliability during extreme weather or emergency situations,” said Congressman Smith. “The CHARGE Act is a smart and forward-looking investment that will help centers stay open, protect patients, and strengthen energy resilience across the country.”

“Community health centers are an essential part of the healthcare delivery system in rural and underserved regions across the country—especially here in the Central Valley. Central Valley Health Network applauds the leadership of Congressman Valadao and Smith in introducing the CHARGE Act of 2025, which will invest in improving healthcare in our communities while promoting renewable energy solutions,” said Jason Vega, Chief Executive Officer, Central Valley Health Network.

“When natural disasters and other grid-straining emergencies hit, solar and energy storage are critical to providing reliable power to those that need it most. We applaud Congressmen Smith and Valadao for championing this legislation which will enhance access to solar and storage for the Federally Qualified Community Health Centers working every day to provide essential care to communities across America,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, President and CEO, Solar Energy Industry Association (SEIA).

""Electricity powers every step of health care. When Community Health Centers lose power, diabetic patients miss visits, pregnant women miss prenatal care, children forgo vaccinations, and patients needing behavioral health services miss therapy. After Hurricane Helene alone, power outages caused more than 10,000 patient appointment cancellations in one state alone. The bipartisan CHARGE Act, led by US Representatives Adam Smith (D-WA) and David Valadao (R-CA) will help health centers deploy solar energy and battery storage systems so they can continue serving as lifelines for their communities during disasters,"" said Ben Money, SVP of Population Health, National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC).

“Ensuring clean, reliable, and safe energy technologies isn’t just smart policy—it’s a direct investment in the community health and the well-being of the diverse communities we serve,” said Healthpoint.

“We appreciate Rep. Smith’s work with community health centers to develop this program that advances clean energy goals, helps reduce long-term energy costs, and supports local renewable energy jobs,” said the Washington Association for Community Health.

The CHARGE Act would:

Establish a new grant program at the Department of Energy (DOE) to help Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) deploy solar energy systems and/or energy storage technologies.

Authorize $50 million per year to fund installation projects and technical assistance programs nationwide.

Allow broad participation by state and local governments, nonprofits, and a provider consortia or network that is majority owned or majority controlled by one of more FQHCs.

Support technical assistance to ensure that FQHCs can design, install, and operate these systems effectively and sustainably.

Background:

Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are the backbone of the healthcare system in underserved communities—providing critical care, including preventative healthcare, vaccinations, and chronic disease management to more than 34 million Americans per year. Yet, too many of these centers lack the reliable, affordable, and sustainable power needed to maintain operations during grid disruptions, extreme weather, or emergencies. The CHARGE Act provides a targeted, fiscally responsible solution to ensure community health centers have access to clean, resilient power while reducing long-term energy costs and supporting local renewable energy jobs. This bipartisan proposal promotes energy resilience, community health security, and economic efficiency—all while empowering local stakeholders to determine the best solutions for their communities.

The solar-powered battery facility strengthens India’s EV supply chain by delivering three gigawatt-hours (GWh) of battery capacity each year through dedicated clean energy.

Octillion, the California-based electric vehicle (EV) battery manufacturer, has completed its transition to solar energy at one of its major production sites in India. The Pune factory opened in June 2023. It began its solar conversion in June 2024 and reached full solar operation by July 2025. Moreover, the shift took only 13 months. The company announced the achievement in a recent statement, highlighting its commitment to long-term sustainability.

The facility covers 8,200 square metres, roughly the size of two football pitches. It produces 3 GWh of battery capacity every year for India’s fast-growing EV market. Additionally, the rooftop solar system now generates about 545 MWh of clean electricity annually. This output meets the plant’s entire energy demand. Consequently, Octillion now manufactures all EV battery systems using renewable power.

The Pune site is the first of Octillion’s Indian factories to operate entirely on solar energy. It also supports the firm’s goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations across all India-based sites by 2027. Octillion plans to apply this model to its remaining factories. Therefore, each stage of the EV battery life cycle will follow a cleaner and more sustainable energy pathway.

Octillion’s switch to solar reflects a broader trend of captive solar projects across Pune and Maharashtra. For example, Tata Motors expanded its on-site solar generation by adding a 12 MWp plant. This addition raised the total capacity to about 20.7 MWp at the Pune commercial vehicle unit. Meanwhile, ŠKODA-VW installed an 8.5 MWp rooftop system at its Chakan plant. The installation now meets around 15% of the plant’s annual energy needs. Additionally, smaller manufacturers, such as SKF, have adopted rooftop systems to reduce costs and carbon emissions. Maharashtra has also exceeded 1 GW of domestic rooftop installations.

Other lead applicants for the $900-million SMR federal funding included utility Arizona Public Service and developer Constellation, according to media reports.
The latter also closed a $1-billion DOE loan last month to restart the undamaged 835-MW reactor unit at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.","Small modular nuclear power reactors using light water cooling technology to be developed for U.S. commercial use by power provider Tennessee Valley Authority in its multi-state region and by private developer Holtec International in Michigan will gain up to $400 million each in federal cost-share funds to advance projects and related supply chains, the U.S, Energy Dept. announced this month.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the project investments in third-generation nuclear power technology will help advance Trump administration goals outlined earlier this year to boost that energy source domestically—particularly to insure U.S. energy security and gain global artificial intelligence dominance. “Advanced light water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need ... support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid,” he said.

The funding actually stems from a Biden-era solicitation released in October 2024 using 2021 federal infrastructure act funding that includes another $100 million to be awarded later this year to support more deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness, said DOE. But the Trump administration revised the solicitation last spring to remove required community benefit financial investments by winners.

DOE funding will assist TVA to build the first two-unit, estimated 600-MW GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Clinch River site in Tennessee by the early 2030s and plan future deployments with partners Indiana Michigan Power and BWX Technologies. The TVA development team also includes contractors Bechtel and Ontario-based Aecon, Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Electric Power Research Institute.

TVA's construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the BWRX-300 at Clinch River, submitted in May, still is under agency review. “This award affirms TVA’s continued leadership in shaping the nation’s nuclear energy future,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO of the independent federal corporate agency that supplies power to 10 million people in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and smaller areas of neighboring states.

“Unlike previous nuclear construction projects in the U.S., contractors will work with [GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy] and TVA as a highly integrated project team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1.” Bechtel said in January. “The integrated project delivery model is the preferred method that will make our project a true team effort,” said Bob Deacy, TVA senior vice president and its Clinch River project leader. “We will actively work together toward a target budget and schedule – creating a significant advantage to drive nuclear innovation, share risks and reduce costs.”

TVA also has signed public-private partnerships with other SMR developers in recent months, including Kairos Power and NuScale, as well as with nuclear fusion developer Type One Energy. TVA said it currently has about 11 GW of requested load for AI and data centers across its area, including from Google, Meta and xAI.

TVA’s technology collaboration partner Ontario Power Generation has started construction of four GE Vernova BWRX-300 units, with the first to be online by 2030 at its Darlington power plant. The province approved construction plans and awarded a contract in May to a partnership between Aecon and Kiewit Nuclear Canada for construction planning and execution, and project management. Aecon said its share of the contract is worth about $930 million.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and design-build firm Samsung C&T in October also announced a strategic alliance to advance BWRX-300 SMR deployment in markets outside North America.

Going Modular in Michigan

Holtec's funding will aid company plans to deploy its dual-unit SMR-300 reactors at the site of the 800-MW Palisades nuclear power plant it owns and also seeks to restart in January in Covert, Mich., adding an additional 600 MW. The developer also signed an expanded alliance agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction to build a 10-GW fleet of SMR-300s in North America through the 2030s, beginning with the Palisades project. The contractors will manage reactor construction, deployment, operation, supply chain and power selling. Project cost has been estimated at $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion per reactor.

“Targeting first power by 2030, our Mission 2030 initiative will position the Palisades SMR project as the reference plant for all future SMR-300 deployments—domestically and globally,” said Holtec.

Company founder, chairman & CEO Krishna Singh told attendees of an American Nuclear Society conference last month that the company's SMR-300 reactor ""was born the day after"" the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in Japan, but it did not win DOE funding at the time because of agency disagreement on its design. Holtec self-funded the project, Singh noted, and will submit its design next year to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for limited work authorization.

According to a Holtec statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support"" under the agency's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program dating to 2020.

Holtec also has a $1.52-billion conditional loan from DOE for the Palisades restart, although the action faces new litigation from anti nuclear groups that have sued the developer and the commission in federal court.

Gov. Bob Ferguson will permit a Swedish investment firm to build a solar and battery installation on about 2,000 acres of farmland in south-central Washington, despite opposition from the Yakama Nation.

The Carriger solar project will provide jobs and clean energy, Ferguson said Dec. 4. “This project is a win for our state,” he said in a statement

Cypress Creek Renewables, owned by Stockholm-based EQT Infrastructure, plans to install solar panels and batteries about 2 miles northeast of Goldendale in Klickitat County.

Yakima Nation

The installation will encroach on an annual food and medicine harvest, the Yakama Nation said in a statement. The tribe documented other negative impacts, but its concerns were dismissed by Ferguson, Yakima Nation Tribal Council Chairman Gerald Lewis said.

“It is alarming and bitterly discouraging to see that Gov. Ferguson is continuing former Gov. (Jay) Inslee’s approach to championing new industrial-scale, alternative-energy development at the expense of our land, our water, our wildlife and our sacred places,” Lewis said.

Ferguson last summer told the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council to consult with the tribe. He set a 60-day deadline to have a proposal on his desk.

The Yakama Nation sought further environmental study and formal hearings. But 60 days did not give EFSEC enough time for either. Cypress Creek must start construction by July 4 to qualify for federal tax credits, Ferguson noted. Although Washington is a “leader in climate policy,” it lags behind all other states in renewable energy growth, he said.

County opposed

Klickitat County commissioners also opposed the project. County residents said the project will mar views, take farmland and be a fire hazard. Ferguson addressed only the tribe’s concerns in his approval letter to EFSEC.

In the letter, Ferguson told EFSEC he expected the council to improve consultation with tribes.

EFSEC staff members consulted with the tribe and concluded the project will not significantly damage tribal culture.

Cypress Creek will plant vegetation or build berms to make panels and batteries less visible from roads. Cypress Creek also will give the tribe up to $100,000 over 10 years for archeological and history research.

The Yakama Nation proposed eliminating some solar panels. Cypress Creek said the tribe’s proposal would cut the installation’s power output by half and kill the project.

When the sun shines, the panels will generate up to 160 megawatts of power. The batteries will store 63 megawatts, according to Cypress Creek.

Carriger is the second major solar project approved over the objection of the Yakama Nation. The tribe says the Horse Heaven wind and solar project in Benton County will damage cultural sites. The tribe, Benton County and Tri-Cities CARES, a citizens group, are suing to stop the project.

Federal and state utility regulators should rein in the use of “construction work in progress” accounting to protect ratepayers from cost risks related to building energy infrastructure projects, according to an issue brief released Thursday by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank.

CWIP allows a utility to bill ratepayers for the cost of building a power plant, transmission line or other project as they are being built. In contrast, under “allowance for funds used during construction” accounting, ratepayers aren’t billed until the project comes online. This practice is preferable, even though it can cause ratepayer stickershock, the brief’s authors said.

The report — The Hidden Tax on Your Power Bill: Construction Work in Progress — comes as rising electricity bills have become a political issue in states like California, Connecticut and New Jersey.

Also, U.S. utilities are entering into an infrastructure-building super-cycle, with utilities preparing to spend $1.4 trillion from 2025 to 2030 to build out transmission and generation networks to meet demand from data centers. That spending would roughly double the amount utilities spent in the previous 10 years, Morningstar DBRS said in a report released in October.

The use of CWIP provides an incentive for utilities to “gold plate” projects and extend their construction timelines, according to the report’s authors.

“Under CWIP, utilities face little pressure to control costs or timelines because every additional dollar spent and every month of delay expands their rate base and increases their guaranteed returns,” they said. “Cost overruns become profit opportunities rather than financial penalties.”

The report’s authors — professors Eric Olson from the University of Tulsa, Jack Dorminey of West Virginia University, and Jason Walter from the University of Tulsa — pointed to Georgia Power’s majority-owned expansion of the Vogtle nuclear power plant as an example of how CWIP can affect ratepayers.

Georgia utility regulators approved the project in 2009 at a $14 billion estimated cost, but the two nuclear units started commercial service in 2023 and 2024 at a price tag of about $37 billion.

“Mounting construction setbacks from component redesigns, contractor bankruptcies, and pandemic-related labor shortages led to an explosion in the total price tag,” the authors said. “Rather than face punishment, Georgia Power was entitled to earn over 10% return on that growing sum each year because CWIP was already in the rate base. For management and shareholders, the mushrooming budget did not threaten the project’s profitability; it enhanced it.”

CWIP can make project financing less risky, and potentially less expensive, according to its proponents.

At the state level, the issue of how utilities recoup costs is usually decided by state regulators. But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allows transmission developers to use this accounting method as well, though not without controversy.

Mark Christie, then-FERC chair, opposed the use of CWIP as part of a suite of developer incentives he referred to as “FERC candy” in a dissent to the approval of such a package in May.

The CWIP Incentive, he wrote, “allows recovery of costs before a project has been put into service,” which runs the risk of making consumers “the bank” for the transmission developer.

“[B]ut, unlike a real bank, which gets to charge interest for the money it loans, under our existing incentives policies the consumer not only effectively ‘loans’ the money through the formula rates mechanism, but also pays the utility a profit, known as Return on Equity, or ‘ROE,’ for the privilege of serving as the utility’s de facto lender,” he said.

The Manhattan Institute report’s authors say utility regulators should stop allowing CWIP, adding that they have a range of options for limiting it to protect ratepayers.

FERC, for example, could make CWIP contingent on project developers meeting schedule and cost benchmarks, according to the brief. The agency could also include automatic clawback provisions to recover customer payments when projects are abandoned or there are cost overruns, they said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3VrTrfpCRfPA4IVdVv94cZktPajry7m8VVEMz9k68EA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Vbml0LTQtbGlmdC1jYjIwXzEuanBlZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:50.789776

These places shape life in the Prairie State, providing habitat for a variety of species and offering us opportunities to hike, paddle, watch wildlife and cool off on hot summer days.

Environment Illinois’ mission is simple, we work to protect that natural world, and help Illinois’ nature and people both thrive. We research problems, build public support, and work to win policies that reduce pollution, protect habitat and keep our air and water clean.

In 2025, that meant advancing wetland protections, safeguarding our waterways, cutting harmful plastic waste, supporting clean energy and much more.

Working to protect wetlands and parks

Illinois’ wetlands filter pollution, mitigate flooding and provide critical habitat for migrating birds and other wildlife such as frogs, beavers and turtles.

Illinois has already lost around 90% of our historic wetlands, and these special places are too precious to lose. Yet, many of the state’s remaining wetlands lack strong safeguards. And a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rollback of federal protections leaves them even more at risk. After the proposed rule, more than 80% of wetlands nationwide no longer receive protection under the Clean Water Act.

Environment Illinois and our allies are calling for a statewide wetlands program to protect and recover these crucial places. Together, we delivered more than 6,500 petition signatures urging Gov. JB Pritzker to protect these disappearing habitats.

Additionally, during our “Protect Illinois Wetlands Week,” we highlighted how wetlands support wildlife, clean drinking water and provide flood protection by participating in an expert panel at the University of Illinois Chicago. At the event Environment Illinois staff, representatives from Shedd Aquarium, and other partners spoke about the importance of these wetlands, and why their protections should be strengthened, not weakened.

This year, we also celebrated a new state park endowment fund that will help maintain and improve parks such as Starved Rock State Park and the Cache River area. Gov. Pritzker emphasized that these spaces must be protected for future generations to enjoy, keeping the land preserved and giving Illinois residents more spaces to explore and cherish for years to come.

Keeping Lake Michigan and other waters safe for swimming

Illinoisans should be able to enjoy a day at Lake Michigan and other swimming spots without worrying about getting sick.

But the latest Great Lakes “Safe for Swimming?” report, released by our partners at Environment Illinois Research & Education Center, found that in 2024 about 71% of tested Great Lake beaches had at least one day when bacteria reached potentially unsafe levels.

Even more concerning, every tested Lake Michigan beach in Illinois had at least one such day in which swimmers faced higher risks of gastrointestinal illness, respiratory issues, ear and eye infections and skin rashes.

To help people stay safe, the report featured tools beachgoers can use to easily check for local closures and health advisories before they head to the water.

But testing and closures do little to stop the source of this pollution.

That’s why we’re also calling for stronger investments in wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. By upgrading aging sewers, fixing leaky pipes and building newer infrastructure to better absorb runoff, we can reduce the flow of sewage and polluted water into Lake Michigan and other waterways.

Together, we can work to ensure that Illinois shores, waterways and swimming holes are safe and clean for your next day cooling off in the water.

Tackling plastic waste

Plastic waste continues to threaten Illinois’ rivers, parks and Lake Michigan shoreline, and an unnecessary source of this pollution is polystyrene foam food containers.

These single-use, takeout boxes may be convenient for bringing home leftovers, but in the environment polystyrene can break into tiny pieces that are nearly impossible to clean up. Instead, these pieces will drift through the environment, breaking down slowly, clogging waterways and threatening aquatic wildlife.

That’s why Environment Illinois supporters joined together to deliver thousands of petitions to lawmakers in Springfield in support of SB 1531, a bill that would phase out polystyrene foam foodware across the state.

Backed by Environment Illinois and other advocates, the bill advanced in the legislature in 2025. While the bill has not yet been fully approved, we will keep working to win its passage so we can help cut a significant source of plastic waste from entering our environment.

At the same time, we’re confronting another aquatic plastic threat: tiny pre-production plastic pellets known as nurdles. These pellets are used to create many of the plastic products you use everyday, but they often spill during manufacturing and transport, ending up in Illinois rivers, harming wildlife and polluting shorelines.

In response, we’re supporting the Illinois Plastic Pellet Free Waters Act (HB 3278), which would require facilities to take stronger steps to prevent plastic pellet spills and reduce the flow of this pollution into our waterways and environment. While the state House has done its part in passing the bill, it still needs approval from the Senate and the governor before it can take effect.

As we waited for that final step, Illinois volunteers joined the first-ever International Plastic Pellet Count, helping document pellet pollution along local waterways and building the case for stronger protections.

During the event, volunteers from across the world collected 49,256 pellets at 229 sites across 14 countries and 29 U.S. states, demonstrating just how widespread and often unseen this pellet pollution has become. In Illinois volunteers searched in parks and on sandy beaches, finding plastic pellets on the shores of Lake Michigan and along the Chicago River.

Although the worst contamination was recorded in other parts of the country, such as in Texas and on the Gulf coast, the findings further underscore the importance of preventing this pollution from growing in Illinois.

Advocating for more clean, renewable energy

Across Illinois, more families and businesses are turning to clean energy, cutting pollution and making our grid more resilient.

This year our partners at Environment Illinois Research & Education Center and Frontier Group, joined together to release their “Clean Energy Across America” report, which showcased the recent growth of renewables in Illinois and beyond.

In Illinois, the report found that:

159,840 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids are registered in the state.

131,112 homes have rooftop solar..

111,760 customers are buying clean power from their utilities.

Illinoisans have claimed more than 140,000 federal clean energy tax credits.

Taken all together, these numbers show that clean energy adoption in Illinois is growing steadily and quickly. To support and accelerate that already promising growth, the Illinois General Assembly passed a new clean energy bill that Gov. Pritzker has already committed to signing.

The law, once signed, would establish a “virtual power plant” program that links rooftop solar panels, home batteries and other energy resources together, allowing the grid to better handle high demand times, making our systems more flexible and resilient.

The bill also directs the state to add 3 gigawatts of battery storage by 2030, roughly enough power to keep about 500,000 homes running for a full day, ensuring we have enough storage to handle our continued renewable growth.

We’re also working to make it simpler and cheaper for families to go solar. The Environment Illinois-backed “Residential Automated Solar Permitting Act” would require local governments to offer online permitting for standard home solar and battery projects. By streamlining this process, we can cut red tape, reduce installation delays, and lower costs for households that want to install their own clean energy technology.

Overall, Illinois’ clean energy transformation is well underway, and we will continue building support to make that transition quicker, cheaper and more efficient for residents across the Prairie State.

And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers’ new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers’ growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle’s cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds’ Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

It’s going to come down to who can build power generation the fastest,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told the North American Gas Forum on Dec. 2.
He added that a lack of storage capacity ""is going to introduce a tremendous amount of volatility,” noting the stagnant pace of storage infrastructure growth over the past decade even as supply and demand have soared.
But while the gas is there, the pipelines and power plants are not.
“Between 2010 and 2022, natural gas demand rose by 49%, but pipeline (26% growth) and storage (2% growth) capacity grew far more slowly, creating bottlenecks that threaten economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness,” the report said.","Gas industry executives descended on Washington this week to sound alarm bells over the need for permitting reform to speed up infrastructure build-out, insisting the US could quickly fall behind in the global artificial intelligence race.

The warnings came as the National Petroleum Council (NPC) unveiled a list of recommendations on ways the Trump administration can make near-term permitting improvements while Congress works toward broader legislative reform.

“The winner of this AI race isn’t going to come down to who can get the chips. It’s not going to be about who can build the best apps. It’s going to come down to who can build power generation the fastest,” EQT CEO Toby Rice told the North American Gas Forum on Dec. 2.

Williams CEO Chad Zamarin likened today's situation to the pre-World War II race to build the first atomic bomb. ""This is our generation's moment, our Manhattan Project,” he told the forum. ""If we had to compete right now … just from a manufacturing and technology perspective, we would not be the world’s most dominant [AI] producer.”

During a separate NPC meeting on Dec. 3, TC Energy CEO Francis Poirier said gas and power infrastructure projects are key to meet surging energy demand, rising costs and rapid build-out of AI data centers.

“The current permitting process delays prevent the US from realizing those solutions in a timely manner. Even successful projects take far longer than they should,” Poirier said, referencing a recent TC Energy expansion project in the Pacific Northwest that took more than two years to obtain its permits.

“I think people are tired of us constantly saying it, but it really does depend on infrastructure,” to keep gas prices in check, Williams Executive Chairman and former CEO Alan Armstrong told the NPC meeting.

'Demand Signals Are Screaming'

Rice told reporters after the NPC event that gas pipeline transportation fees have risen significantly on “purely political risk” rather than supply chain or inflation, and he attributed that to permitting delays. “With this political risk, we’re getting quotes of $2-$3” per million Btu, Rice said.

He added that a lack of storage capacity ""is going to introduce a tremendous amount of volatility,” noting the stagnant pace of storage infrastructure growth over the past decade even as supply and demand have soared.

Rice, whose company is the second-largest US gas producer, told the North American Gas Forum that the US market will need 10 billion to 18 billion cubic feet per day of new gas production just to meet demand growth necessary to power AI data centers. But while the gas is there, the pipelines and power plants are not.

“We have the supply chain [and] the resources to make this work. But we need the purpose and the regulatory system that will allow market forces to work,” he said. “The demand signals are screaming for more energy.""

Because of regulatory and legal hurdles facing multibillion-dollar pipelines and power generation projects in the US, ""We’ve basically taken a pause of getting infrastructure built for the last 10 years,"" Rice argued. ""We’ve got to catch up on all that and get this additional capacity built over the next few years.”

A day later, newly minted Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Laura Swett sought to allay the gas industry's concerns, asserting that one of FERC's primary goals under her leadership will be expediting approval of gas pipelines and LNG export projects.

'Failing to Keep Up'

Meanwhile, the NPC recommendations run the gamut from a focus on modernizing and streamlining the National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa), which would need congressional action, to actions that could be done at the executive level, such as holding FERC to a 90-day authorization deadline after the completion of environmental reviews.

“Between 2010 and 2022, natural gas demand rose by 49%, but pipeline (26% growth) and storage (2% growth) capacity grew far more slowly, creating bottlenecks that threaten economic growth, national security, and global competitiveness,” the report said. “The current permitting process — bogged down by lengthy reviews, litigation risks, and overlapping regulations — is failing to keep up, leading to higher costs, supply insecurity, and missed opportunities in the global energy and technology race.”",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ae81b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5760x3024+0+408/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F1f%2Ffe%2F0375629b4c8ba02d375330753c6e%2Fss-1996700738-pipeline-construction-green.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 18:02:55.104598

The county’s announcement comes as Delaware is implementing new fees for electric and hybrid vehicles. Under changes made by the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles, EV owners now pay an annual registration surcharge designed to replace declining gasoline-tax revenue. State officials say the additional fee ensures that all vehicle owners contribute to road maintenance costs as fuel consumption patterns change. The move follows earlier debates surrounding the state’s long-term approach to emissions standards and zero-emission vehicle regulations, signaling an ongoing reassessment of Delaware’s EV strategy.

These local developments unfold against a shifting national backdrop. Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has reversed several federal initiatives intended to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles. The administration’s recently enacted legislative package, described by officials as a “big beautiful bill,” reduces EV-related incentives, cuts funding for charging-infrastructure programs, and rolls back federal emissions and fuel-efficiency standards established under prior law. Those changes were underscored during a meeting Trump held with major automakers this week, where he outlined plans to lower fleetwide efficiency targets from levels set by the previous administration. Auto executives at the meeting welcomed the regulatory shift, noting that it would enable a broader focus on gasoline-powered and hybrid vehicles.

Industry data shows the impact of these federal actions is being closely watched. Electric-vehicle sales in the United States reached record levels in 2024, but analysts report that the expiration of federal tax credits and relaxed regulatory pressure have produced signs of slowing demand. Some manufacturers have reported significant year-over-year drops in EV sales in recent month.

The combined effect leaves Delaware and its counties operating in a policy environment that no longer aligns neatly with federal priorities. New Castle County continues building chargers using previously awarded federal grant funding. The state is adjusting its fee structure to address the fiscal implications of EV adoption. The federal government is moving in the opposite direction, easing requirements and reducing EV-related spending. As a result, county, state and federal actions now point in distinctly different directions.

The county’s project is part of the “100 EV Plugs Plan,” launched in 2023, which set out to install more than one hundred charging stations across public sites. With the latest additions, the county reports that 72 chargers are active, with another six installed and awaiting activation, bringing the total to 78 once they come online.",https://firststateupdate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/image-7.png,N,,2025-12-05 19:01:51.396621

The Intermountain Power Project (IPP) in Utah, the last remaining source of coal-fired electricity serving the nation’s second-largest city, ceased operations just before Thanksgiving. The two-unit plant had roughly 1,800 MW of capacity when both units were online and supplied about 11 percent of Los Angeles’ electricity as recently as 2024.

LADWP continues to receive electricity from a new natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) project completed this year at the IPP site, part of a modernization effort known as “IPP Renewed.” The new units are designed to run on natural gas blended with up to 30 percent green hydrogen, with a long-term plan to transition to 100 percent green hydrogen. LADWP expects hydrogen to be introduced into the fuel mix in 2026.

LADWP’s goal is to reach 100% carbon-free energy by 2035. The city has made investments in solar, wind, battery storage and other renewable technologies and is working to expand local solar, energy efficiency, and demand response customer initiatives.

Over the summer, Los Angeles celebrated the completion of the Eland Solar-plus-Storage Center, which pairs 758 MWdc of solar generation with 300 MW/1,200 MWh of storage.

What’s next for coal in the U.s.?

Nationwide, the operating capacity of U.S. coal-fired power plants is scheduled to fall from 172 gigawatts (GW) in May 2025 to 145 GW by the end of 2028, according to what owners and operators have told the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Still, some U.S. regions generate more electricity from coal than from natural gas during certain months of the year. EIA is projecting plants in the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) regions to generate more electricity from coal than from natural gas in the upcoming winter months. Notably, EIA also says more than half of planned coal capacity retirements — roughly 58% — are located in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions.

The U.S. as a whole last generated more electricity from coal than from natural gas on a monthly basis in January 2018. Several regional electricity markets, such as those in California, Florida, New England and New York, have not generated more electricity from coal than from natural gas at any point since at least 2010, EIA reported.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under President Donald Trump has been more favorable to coal-fired generation. Notably, this includes rolling back a Biden-era rule which requires the longest-running existing coal-fired units and most heavily utilized new gas turbines to implement carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS) by various compliance dates in the 2030s.

Trump has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IPP-project.png,N,,2025-12-05 18:02:58.649099

The state is rapidly adding solar and wind power, which are cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants.","CRAIG, Colo. (AP) — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations, and in oil before that. That’s the end for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew, as one of three coal mines in the area closes amid a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope that Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change Hayden’s retirement dates, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased electricity demand.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial, and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis by Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases in operating aging plants and inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind power, which are cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth have remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits, used to make gin and vodka, on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level, from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one, aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”",https://coloradobiz.com/files/2025/12/AP25339002496399-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:03:08.537591

“We are proud to play a role in advancing the state’s clean energy goals,” Angeli Chandler, Cypress Creek’s director of communications, said in an email.
When completed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company’s website.","Gov. Bob Ferguson has approved a 1,300-acre solar farm in south-central Washington, calling the project a “win for our state.”

The Carriger Solar project in Klickitat County is expected to generate enough power for thousands of homes. Ferguson informed the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council on Tuesday that he was giving it the go-ahead. This is the first large-scale energy project Ferguson has acted on since taking office.

“Building more clean energy will provide affordable, carbon-free electricity to Washingtonians, create much needed construction jobs, boost economic development and keep our air clean,” Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement.

Ferguson’s decision isn’t a surprise. When he turned down the council’s initial recommendation to proceed with the Carriger project in August, he made clear that he viewed the undertaking as “consistent with state policies.”

And he stressed the importance of moving swiftly so developers could secure federal clean energy tax credits before they are ended by the Trump administration. Solar and wind projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 to fully qualify for the credits.

But Ferguson told the council to talk further with Yakama Nation leaders about their concerns that protections for cultural resources were not strict enough.

What emerged was the revised site certification agreement inked by Ferguson. It requires the developers provide $100,000 in one-time grant funding to the Yakama Nation Cultural Resources Program once the project is operational. Tribal access to traditional and cultural properties must be maintained during construction.

Even with the grant funding, the tribe remained opposed to the project, state officials said.

Ferguson, in his Dec. 2 letter to the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, said the final agreement “balances the need for affordable clean energy with mitigation requirements that protect Washington’s environment.”

He also reiterated the urgency of acting to take advantage of the federal credits.

“Our state already faces real challenges in building renewable electricity, and we now contend with a federal government that is hostile to renewable electricity development,” he wrote. “All of these elements factored into my decision.”

Cypress Creek Renewables, based in Santa Monica, California, plans to build the solar farm north of State Route 142 along Knight Road, about two miles west of Goldendale in unincorporated Klickitat County. The firm applied for state approval for the project in February 2023.

The company is “grateful” for Ferguson’s support, a spokesperson said Thursday.

“We are proud to play a role in advancing the state’s clean energy goals,” Angeli Chandler, Cypress Creek’s director of communications, said in an email.

“We are moving with urgency to ensure we retain federal tax treatment, which is critical to keeping this project on track,” she said. The project is expected to begin delivering power in the summer of 2028, she said.

When completed, Carriger Solar will have 160 megawatts of solar generating potential, enough to power up to 32,500 homes, according to the company’s website. The project, which also includes a 63 megawatt battery energy storage system, will tie into the Bonneville Power Administration transmission system.

Public developers like this are taking on the role of providing solar and other renewable energy projects for schools, low-income housing, and other municipal projects.

Gaps that Need to be Filled for Renewable Energy Projects

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law had been a boost for public financing of renewable energy projects. Through tax credits and public lending programs, capital cost reductions for energy projects became commonplace, as governments small and large could draw upon the federal government’s reasonable financing costs. The ability to lend for longer periods of time and across different fiscal capacities made all the difference in projects coming to communities across the US.

Of course, the second Trump administration is drilling down (pun intended) on limitations to energy subsidies. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” eliminates or phases out subsidies for electric cars, clean energy, and energy-efficient appliances, while providing tax breaks and subsidies for oil and gas companies and opening up more federal lands and offshore areas for drilling and mining.

The US is at a renewable energy crossroads, to the point where over 140 US solar companies have urged Congress to reconsider changes to permitting that they say have resulted in “a nearly complete moratorium” on solar project permits. An open letter addressed to the Senate and House of Representatives called for changes to a July memo from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, which called for increased scrutiny on solar project permits for projects on federal land and using Department of the Interior resources. The order expands federal oversight of solar and wind approvals, in line with the Trump administration’s efforts to eliminate subsidies and what it sees as “preferential treatment” for these energy sources.

The open letter from the industry reiterates the argument that solar represents the cheapest and fastest way to add new US energy capacity to meet the forecast growth in demand from AI and data centers.

Generation 180 says there are still pathways for renewable energy deployment. “Even under hostile federal political conditions, public finance institutions — like the existing 50-state network of development finance agencies (DFAs) and green banks — can continue to finance essential infrastructure,” they explained in a 2025 report.

Public financing seems similar to public developers, but these are really two separate entities. Public developers undertake capital investment and manage the resulting assets on behalf of the public. While they can include some project financing, public developers are more on-the-ground consultants that assist with project development and planning, legalities, workforce enhancement, procurement, construction, operations, maintenance, portfolio management, and even service delivery.

In the energy sector, the US has numerous entities at the regional, state, and local level endowed with public development capacities. You probably recognize a lot of them: Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), New York Power Authority (NYPA), the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP), Long Island Power Authority (LIPA), New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority — and so many more.

As the Center for Public Enterprise notes, public developers understand how renewable energy deployments require extensive construction and operation management as well as coordinating skilled labor and acquiring special materials. Capital projects have high upfront costs, operate in complex regulatory environments, and have long payback periods. These complexities create coordination problems, especially when non-financial barriers make the commitment of time and financial resources by key stakeholders demanding.

Case Study: Connecticut Green Bank’s Public Developer Function

A green bank accelerates the green economy using limited public dollars to attract multiples of private capital investment. In doing so, clean energy is more affordable and accessible to consumers. Established by the Connecticut General Assembly in July 2011, the Connecticut Green Bank supports the Governor’s and Legislature’s energy strategy to achieve cleaner, less expensive, and more reliable sources of energy while creating jobs and supporting local economic development.

In 2021, the Green Bank’s model was expanded to include new areas of environmental infrastructure, related to climate adaptation and resiliency, land conservation, parks and recreation, agriculture, water, waste and recycling, and environmental markets, including carbon offsets and ecosystem services.

Through its open Request for Proposals for Green Bank Capital Solutions, the Green Bank provides access to capital to Connecticut projects that catalyze clean energy deployment and energy efficiency, reduction of greenhouse gasses, environmental infrastructure, improved public health outcomes, job creation and economic development. The RFP is open to technologies that have already proven to be commercially viable or have demonstrated clear potential for commercial viability through well-documented feasibility studies or pilot programs with clear evidence of a viable business model and path to sustainable impact. True to the green bank model, this open RFP allows the Green Bank to leverage public dollars to bring in private investment and potentially other investment partners.

Connecticut’s Solar MAP+ is an offshoot of the Connecticut Green Bank, the first green bank in the US. It works with municipalities to develop solar and storage projects in four easy steps.

Site Analysis. They work with stakeholders to perform an analysis of all eligible locations to identify opportunities for solar and storage projects.

Project Development. They conduct site visits, confirm project eligibility, and develop system designs for each project to determine project economics.

Execute. They present project specs and pricing to execute a project agreement.

Trusted Partner. They solicit competitive proposals from solar contractors and select the best, bundling participating projects together to achieve economies of scale. After a qualified contractor is selected, the team manages all final steps of development, construction, and energization of the project. This process includes submittal for eligible state and federal incentives.

For example, since 2014, the Green Bank has facilitated the deployment of solar at 80 K-12 schools in the state. According to data from Generation180, nearly 10% of K-12 public schools in the US have an on-site solar project. Nationwide, 20% of K-12 solar capacity is owned directly by school districts, and 80% of K-12 solar capacity is owned by third parties — typically for-profit developers — and paid for over time through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) or leases.

According to the Justice Department, the deal will require divestiture of six power plants in order to resolve antitrust concerns arising from Constellation Energy’s $26.6 billion acquisition of the Calpine Corporation.

The Justice Department says its Antitrust Division had filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block this proposed acquisition.

At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that, if approved, would resolve the Division’s concerns to allow the acquisition to continue.

These divested power plants include the following:

Bethlehem Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania

York Energy Center (York 1 and York 2), a dual-fuel combined cycle plant, located southeast of the city of York, Pennsylvania

Hay Road Energy Center, a dual-fuel combined cycle plant, located in Wilmington, Delaware

Edge Moor Energy Center, a simple cycle natural gas plant, located in Wilmington, Delaware

Jack A. Fusco Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located southwest of Houston, Texas

Gregory Power Plant, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills. When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said. “This settlement includes a six-plant divestiture to an acquisition that risked harming tens of millions of electricity consumers in the mid-Atlantic and Texas. I am appreciative of the partnership with our co-plaintiff, the State of Texas, to secure relief for consumers.”

This is now the first settlement consent degree that the Division has filed in an electricity merger in 14 years.

According to Constellation Energy, this approval now represents the most recent and final regulatory approval in the transaction, following earlier approvals by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the New York Public Service Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Texas.

“We are very pleased to reach a settlement that allows us to bring together two magnificent companies to create a new Constellation with unprecedented scale, talent and capability to better serve our customers and communities while building the foundation for America’s next great era of growth and innovation,” Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation said. “We thank the Department for its professionalism and tireless work reviewing this transaction through these many months. It’s now time for us to complete the transaction, welcome our new colleagues from Calpine, and together begin our journey to light the way to a brilliant tomorrow for all.”

Article content

Constellation is expanding its fleet to meet surging US demand for electricity. Manufacturers, homes and especially data centers are all clamoring for more power, but that’s also driving up prices. Soaring utility bills have become a major political issue, and were a key factor in the November elections that led to strong results for Democratic candidates. US regulators said the divestments were a response to concerns the combined companies would be able to manipulate power supplies to boost profits.

The process releases 18-20 kilograms of CO₂ per kilogram of hydrogen gas production compared to 8-12 kilograms from the natural gas process.
For this reason, this process has been referred to as “black hydrogen” owing to the linkage with the black nature of coal.
Plans unveiled by the China Hydrogen Alliance include the deployment of 100 gigawatts of electrolyzers in 2030 that are all renewable-energy-based.
Even if China accounts for the majority of the world’s hydrogen production, producing “black hydrogen” through coal technologies renders the fuel anything but clean.","The promising clean energy resource of the 21st century turned out to be hydrogen fuel, gaining world attention as an alternative fuel source in different sectors in substitution for fossil fuels. The existence of a vast industry in China regarding hydrogen fuel production has dramatically changed the clean fuel story with the use of coal-based production technologies, yielding what is referred to today as “black hydrogen.”

China dominates global hydrogen production with coal-based methods

China emerged as the world’s biggest producer of hydrogen with the production of 25 million metric tons per year, accounting for nearly one-third of the world’s production of 70 million metric tons. The production process in China has many significant differences from other major hydrogen producers in the world. This results in serious environmental issues.

Unlike other nations that use natural gas in the steam methane reforming process to obtain hydrogen gas, China produces most of its hydrogen from coal gasification. The use of this process not only consumes more carbon gases but also releases significant amounts of CO₂ in the process. The process releases 18-20 kilograms of CO₂ per kilogram of hydrogen gas production compared to 8-12 kilograms from the natural gas process.

The coal gasification process creates unprecedented carbon emissions

The coal gasification process involves the use of high temperatures in the process of synthesizing gas from the coal in order to yield hydrogen. This process yields vast amounts of carbon dioxide gas. For this reason, this process has been referred to as “black hydrogen” owing to the linkage with the black nature of coal. The other type of hydrogen generation, termed “brown hydrogen,” involves lignite coal.

Environmental impact reveals staggering carbon footprint from black hydrogen

The dependence of China’s hydrogen fuels on coal leaves the country in an environmental paradox in terms of the use of clean fuel, yet ending up with one of the most carbon-intensive fuels in existence. It has been noted that China’s dependence on coal in the production of hydrogen fuels poses one of the biggest threats to the world in fighting climate change through the use of hydrogen fuels.

The magnitude of black hydrogen production in China means that millions of tons of additional CO2 are released each year compared with clean methods of producing hydrogen. Environmental analysts have warned that if black hydrogen production in China continues to grow in the future, this may undermine progress that has been made in other forms of renewables. The Chinese are aware of this and are starting to look for ways to switch to clean methods of producing hydrogen.

“China produces 25 million tonnes of hydrogen every year, out of a global total of about 70 million. Some 62% of its hydrogen comes from coal gasification, 19% is from natural gas, 18% is a by-product from industrial processes, while less than 1% is actually green.”

Transition plans involve changing from black hydrogen to green hydrogen

The Chinese government recognizes the challenges faced by black hydrogen and has plans in place to create clean fuel solutions. Plans unveiled by the China Hydrogen Alliance include the deployment of 100 gigawatts of electrolyzers in 2030 that are all renewable-energy-based. This is a monumental change from the current production of hydrogen and moving towards clean production.

The Chinese hydrogen experience demonstrates the key role production technologies play in ensuring hydrogen can be considered a clean fuel. Even if China accounts for the majority of the world’s hydrogen production, producing “black hydrogen” through coal technologies renders the fuel anything but clean. Whether the hydrogen sector in China can be the solution to the problem or remain the cause now largely depends on the future of green hydrogen production in this country.

The MPSC today took steps to improve electric service resilience for critical and priority community facilities such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, police and fire stations, 911 call centers and more (Case No. U-21388).

The Commission today approved 13 recommendations from MPSC Staff to strengthen reliability requirements for important critical and priority facilities important to a community’s health and safety and to better align the MPSC’s Service Quality Rules and Technical Standards with industry requirements for reslience of specific critical facilities.

As part of the MPSC’s work to improve outcomes for customers during extreme weather events, the Commission in 2023 directed MPSC Staff to review service quality rules and the resilience requirements of critical facilities so they could continue to operate during a power outage or be restored quickly thereafter. The Commission also directed Staff to file a straw proposal by December 2024 with recommendations to improve critical facility energy resilience.

Staff filed the proposal Dec. 2, 2024, that outlined a set of more than a dozen recommendations, and the Commission sought additional comment on the proposal. The staff recommendations included:

Requiring representatives from DTE Electric and Consumers Energy to meet annually with critical facility customers to discuss resilience needs and develop appropriate communications plans.

Requiring all regulated utilities to inform MPSC Staff in advance of major weather events of the anticipated number of customer outages, actions taken to prepare, and appropriate company contacts during storm events.

Mandating service restoration to critical facilities within 72 hours of an outage and if not met, requiring utilities to provide evidence explaining why a restoration couldn’t be completed in that timeline. This requirement aligns with other state and federal regulations, including Michigan rules that require hospitals to be able to withstand a power outage of up to 72 hours, to ensure continuity of service at critical facilities even during times of extended utility outages. The Commission directed Indiana Michigan Power Co., to provide detailed plans to MPSC Staff, within six months, on how the company will meet the objectives of this requirement with its Priority 1 through Priority 5 service restoration coding system.

Directing utilities to hold annual meetings with local government emergency managers to discuss restoration and reliability issues with critical facility customers located within their city or county, and for utilities to review lists of critical facilities for accuracy with state emergency management coordinators and review critical facility designation biennially.

Requiring MPSC Staff and utility representatives to determine potential areas of improvement for identifying and prioritizing individual households with critical care customers during sustained outages.

Directing regulated utilities to file summary outage reports after major interruptions that includes a cumulative outage total, the number of wires down, the number of outside crews called in to assist restoration, and other info within 14 days of service restoration.

Authorizing utilities to release private customer data — limited to a customer’s name, address and contact info — to the Michigan State Police Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division and the State Emergency Operations Center, which coordinates emergency response, during and after major interruptions, for the purposes of customer health and safety or for federal disaster reimbursement.

The work is part of the MPSC’s intensive focus on improving the electric grid’s reliability and resilience, spurred by significant storms in February 2023 that left about a million customers of DTE Electric Co. and Consumers Energy Co. without power.

Other steps the Commission has taken in recent years include:

Initiating a first-ever comprehensive, third-party audit of the electric systems of DTE Electric and Consumers Energy, the state’s two largest electric utilities.

Approving additional funding for utility tree trimming to shorten the cycle of how often trees and other vegetation are trimmed, resulting in significant reductions in service interruptions on circuits with stepped-up vegetation management.

Increasing customer power outage credits from a one-time $25 credit to a daily credit — currently $42 per day, 68% higher than before the Commission revamped outage credits in 2023 — that is indexed annually to inflation and automatically paid by utilities to affected customers, who previously had to request it from their energy provider.

In separate matters, the Commission today approved two matters dealing with Alpena Power Co. and the catastrophic March 28-30 ice storm that paralyzed northern Michigan.

The Commission approved a settlement agreement governing customer outage bill credits that Alpena Power will pay to customers who endured lengthy outages from the storm (Case No. U-21912). Alpena Power had sought an exemption from having to pay outage credits because the ice storm impacted its entire service territory and all of its 16,755 customers as the region dealt with downed trees, impassable roads, downed and damaged power lines, damage to other utility equipment, and loss of cellular phone service and other communication. Under the settlement agreement between the utility, the Michigan Department of Attorney General, and MPSC Staff, Alpena Power will calculate and pay outage credits to customers within 90 days.

The Commission also approved Alpena Power’s application for accounting authority to defer operations and maintenance expenses from the storm. The utility estimates the storm will cost it $2.25 million in total restoration expenses, while the utility had budgeted for a normal year of about $500,000 for storm and outage response. The Commission noted that approval of the accounting treatment, which will not increase rates or charges for customers, does not mean approval of expenses themselves. The utility will still have to seek recovery of the restoration expenses in a future proceeding in which the Commission will evaluate the costs for reasonableness and prudence.

MPSC OKS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON DTE ELECTRIC CO.’S INTERCONNECTION PROCEDURES

The MPSC today approved DTE Electric Co.’s application for approval of its interconnection procedures, accepting a settlement agreement that resolves all matters in the case (Case No. U-21482). Among other elements, the settlement agreement approved today includes a new process for how DTE Electric evaluates sizing of distributed generation systems, provides greater detail about when studies relating to the islanding of distributed energy systems will be required and how they will be conducted and clarifies the screening requirements for projects with a limited ability to export power to the broader electrical grid. The Commission in 2023 adopted new Interconnection and Distributed Generation Standards, which detail the rules and procedures for connecting distributed energy resources such as solar or battery storage to the electric grid. DTE Electric filed an initial application in May 2023. But new statutory requirements under the 2023 Michigan energy law revamp ultimately required DTE Electric to file a new application, which the utility filed in May 2024. Intervenors in the case were the Ecology Center; Environmental Law & Policy Center; Union of Concerned Scientists; Vote Solar; Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council; Institute for Energy Innovation; Advanced Energy United; and Energy Michigan. MPSC Staff also participated in the case. The participating organizations worked throughout much of 2025 to finalize the settlement agreement.

COMMISSION APPROVES CONSUMERS ENERGY’S POWER SUPPLY COST RECOVERY RECONCILIATION

The MPSC approved Consumers Energy Company’s application for approval of its power supply cost recovery (PSCR) reconciliation for the 2023 calendar year (Case No. U-21258). The Commission set a net PSCR underrecovery balance of $255,961,382, including interest, as the utility’s 2024 PSCR reconciliation beginning balance. The Commission also approved unopposed cost recovery amounts of $17,043,240 in capped costs and $2,386,253 in recoverable uncapped costs incurred by a number of biomass merchant plants that sell power to Consumers Energy. The Commission directed Consumers and the biomass plants to work ahead proactively to reconcile differences in recorded costs before testimony is filed in future cases. The MPSC set Consumers’ net financial compensation mechanism overrecovery balance of $2,518,161, including interest, as the company’s 2024 financial compensation mechanism calculation beginning balance. The Michigan Department of Attorney General intervened in the case, as did the Residential Customer Group, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, and the biomass plants. MPSC Staff also participated.

CONSUMERS ENERGY’S GAS COST RECOVERY RECONCILIATION APPROVED

The Commission approved Consumers Energy Co.’s application for approval of its gas cost recovery (GCR) plan reconciliation for the 12 months ending March 31, 2024 (Case No. U-21270). The Commission set a net overrecovery of $2,560,299, including interest, as the utility’s 2024-2025 GCR reconciliation beginning balance. The Michigan Department of Attorney General and the Retail Energy Supply Association intervened in the case. MPSC Staff also participated.

MPSC APPROVES DTE ELECTRIC CO.’S DECKERVILLE SOLAR PARK PROJECT

The MPSC approved DTE Electric Co.’s application for approval to build a new solar project in Michigan’s Thumb meant to supply Ford Motor Co. with electricity generated from renewable sources (Case No. U-21285). The Commission approved DTE Electric’s Deckerville Solar Park Project, a 200-megawatt (MW) array to be located in Marion and Wheatland townships in Sanilac County. DTE Electric’s engineering procurement and construction master service agreement with Burns and McDonnell Michigan Inc. and a master supply agreement for solar panel modules with New East Solar Energy (America) Inc. also were approved. The Commission in December 2024 approved an amended and restated special solar energy contract between DTE Electric and Ford, updating a contract the Commission approved in 2022 for the utility to build up to 675 MW of dedicated solar projects through DTE Electric’s voluntary green pricing program to help the automaker meet its goal of powering its Michigan manufacturing plants with 100% renewable energy. Both the application in the current case and the original and updated 675 MW renewable power supply contracts between DTE Electric and Ford were approved by the Commission on an ex parte basis.

COMMISSION OKS INDIANA MICHIGAN POWER CO.’S POWER SUPPLY COST RECOVERY PLAN BUT WARNS SOME COSTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE

The MPSC approved Indiana Michigan Power Co.’s (I&M) application for approval to implement a power supply cost recovery (PSCR) plan for the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 2025, but the Commission warned the utility that it may not be permitted to recover all of its costs associated with a pair of coal plants operating in Indiana and Ohio (Case No. U-21596). The Commission approved I&M’s proposed PSCR factor of 3.74 mills per kilowatt-hour for January and February 2025 and 3.58 mills per kilowatt-hour March through December 2025, as well as the utility’s five-year forecast. The Commission, however, issued a Section 7 warning that I&M may not be able to recover its full costs under the Ohio Valley Electric Corp.’s intercompany power agreement, similar to previous warnings that ultimately led to the Commission disallowing the ability of I&M to recover any excessive costs associated with these plants from Michigan customers.

MPSC APPROVES UPDATES TO GAS SAFETY RULES

The MPSC today approved amendments to rules governing gas safety (Case No. U-21847). The Commission approved amending the state’s gas safety rules so that they adopt current federal gas safety standards and raise the threshold at which gas operators must report incidents to the MPSC, to $25,000 in estimated property damage from the current $10,000. With today’s approval, the Commission now submits the rule changes to the Legislative Service Bureau and the Michigan Office of Administrative Hearings and Rules for their formal approvals before the matter is transmitted to the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules.

BW BROADBAND INC. RECEIVES PERMANENT BASIC LOCAL EXCHANGE PHONE SERVICE LICENSE

The MPSC today approved an application for a permanent license to provide basic local exchange phone service in Isabella County (Case No. U-21934). The Commission granted BW Broadband Inc. a permanent license to provide phone service in the Winn Exchange currently served by Winn Telephone Co. The Commission granted the company a temporary license on Aug. 21.

Forward-Looking Statements The information in this press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future.","Market reactions that move this quickly rarely happen because of a single headline. They happen when investors, institutions, regulators, and commercial partners realize they have been looking at a company through the wrong lens. That is the moment unfolding around SMX (NASDAQ:SMX). What the market is responding to is not hype and not speculation. It is a recalibration that began when multiple industries recognized that SMX is not positioned within a single vertical. It is positioned beneath several of them.

Gold markets were the first to show the shift. For centuries, authenticity depended on paperwork and trust because molten metal forgets its history the moment heat touches it. When SMX demonstrated that gold can retain a molecular identity through smelting, recasting, and storage, a structural problem that shaped the entire bullion industry effectively disappeared. That alone would have been enough to draw interest. What the market noticed next was far more important.

Rare earth minerals face the same identity problem, but on a geopolitical scale. These materials power electric vehicles, aerospace systems, robotics, defense platforms, and the global clean energy transition. Their supply chains are notoriously opaque because ore blending, separation, and processing erase all visible signatures of origin. When industry players realized SMX could track rare earth identity from extraction to alloy formation, an entirely different sector began reacting to the same technology gold markets were evaluating.

A Convergence of Interest

This convergence continued through ESG. Brands, regulators, and auditors have spent years wrestling with unverifiable recycling claims and lifecycle reporting. SMX allows plastics, textiles, chemicals, and industrial materials to retain identity through shredding, melting, and reprocessing. ESG suddenly becomes measurable rather than narrative-driven. Once again, a separate industry recognized the same capability that gold and rare earths were responding to.

Digital markets completed the picture. The Plastic Cycle Token translates authenticated physical performance into digital signals. Recovery becomes data. Data becomes value. A digital asset finally has a real-world anchor that cannot be guessed or modeled.

These sectors may appear unrelated, but they share one structural flaw: the world has never had a universal method to verify material identity after transformation. SMX solved that flaw. When a single capability resolves bottlenecks across multiple global systems simultaneously, markets move fast. They are not reacting to a company update. They are reacting to information about the scale of the technology and its addressable impact.

How is Infrastructure Priced?

It is the discovery phase, when the market begins pricing infrastructure instead of assuming it is looking at a niche product company. Gold validation strengthens rare earth demand. Rare earth validation reinforces ESG credibility. ESG validation feeds the digital economy. Every sector amplifies the others, creating a multiplier effect that forces rapid re-evaluation.

SMX is not defining its value. Markets do that. What is happening now is a recalibration that occurs when multiple industries align around a single foundational capability. The interest is not an accident. It is a recognition event.

About SMX

As global businesses face new and complex challenges relating to carbon neutrality and meeting new governmental and regional regulations and standards, SMX is able to offer players along the value chain access to its marking, tracking, measuring and digital platform technology to transition more successfully to a low-carbon economy.

Environmentalist groups and some Cameron Parish residents are disgruntled after Louisiana officials recently gave the go-ahead for construction of a liquified natural gas export facility after a state judge suspended the project.

Judge Penelope Richard of the 38th Judicial District Court, which includes Cameron Parish, suspended Commonwealth LNG’s permit last month in response to a lawsuit from the Sierra Club. She ruled the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy hadn’t considered the effects of climate change, the high density of gas export facilities already in the area and the disproportionate impact of pollution on nearby communities when it approved the permit.

The state agency then issued updated reasons Nov. 18 for approving Commonwealth’s permit, allowing the project to move forward. Officials again determined the proposed benefits of the project “outweigh the costs” of its environmental impact on Southwest Louisiana’s coast and communities.

“Economic benefit outweighing all of these things is frustrating to me,” said John Allaire, a Cameron Parish resident who lives within 30 miles of three existing LNG export facilities and six more planned or under construction. “The economic benefits of their facility outweigh flooding me out, outweigh the commercial fishing industry, outweigh the eastern black rail, outweigh protecting our cheniers … I don’t agree with that. How much is enough?”

The Department of Conservation and Energy’s new permit approval was based on an “independent analysis” of documents from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Those agencies considered the effects of climate change, environmental justice concerns and the cumulative impacts of multiple LNG facilities within a small area. All reached the same conclusion that the project’s benefits overshadow its costs.

Environmental groups staunchly disagree with the decision to reissue the permit.

The Sierra Club said in a statement through its managing attorney, Eric Huber, that the permit was approved “without any notice to the plaintiffs or the public,” who he said learned about it through the news reports. Turtle Island Restoration Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, also plaintiffs in the lawsuit, declined to comment.

Sierra Club attorneys are reviewing the latest permit approval to decide whether they will take further legal action. By reissuing the permit, the state Department of Conservation and Energy “continues to neglect its responsibility to protect the public health and welfare of all Louisianans,” their statement said.

In its new reasons for approving the permit, Conservation and Energy officials determined it was in the “best interest of the state” not to delay in reassessing the permit as reason for their speedy decision. This is, in part, related to the Trump administration’s “energy dominance” agenda, which calls for further expansion of industries like liquified natural gas.

The agency also justified its use of these external documents rather than doing its own research by citing the federal government’s decision to abandon its environmental justice analysis tools, following an executive order from President Donald Trump the day after he took office in January.

Benefits cited in the state’s permit approval include job creation. Commonwealth estimates it will employ an average of 800 construction workers per month, with a peak of 2,000, over the three-year period. Half of all these construction employees are expected to come from Cameron and Calcasieu parishes, according to the document.

The permit approval explanation did list downsides to the project, including the destruction of around 90 acres of coastal wetlands in Cameron Parish. State officials accounted for this, saying “these wetland impacts would be mitigated and would not have a significant cumulative impact on environmental justice communities.”

Community advocates like James Hiatt, director of nonprofit For a Better Bayou, question whether the state is acting in the best interests of its residents.

“The job is not to expedite permits and do whatever corporations want. Their job is to protect national resources, the public good, the public interest,” Hiatt said, citing ongoing issues in Cameron Parish with rapidly eroding coastal land and disproportionately high pollution levels in communities closest to the LNG export sites.

The Commonwealth LNG facility will be built 750 feet away from Allaire’s property line, he said, adding that he feels Cameron Parish won’t see enough of the economic benefit from these facilities to make up for all of the drawbacks.

“They keep saying, ‘Well, it’ll be mitigated by economic benefit to the community,’” he said. “But come on down here and see where the economic benefit to the community is. It’s not here.”",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LNG-tanker-Cameron-Parish-1536x1024-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:03:57.335570

December 5, 2025 – Thunder Bay, ON – Federal Economic Development Agency for Northern Ontario – FedNor

The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Jobs and Families and Minister responsible for FedNor, today announced the creation of the Northern Ontario Indigenous Clean Energy Initiative (NOICE), which aims to help establish, optimize, and expand Indigenous-led clean energy projects in the region. Minister Hajdu also announced a total FedNor investment of $4,774,515 in 10 Indigenous economic development projects across the region.

The Northern Ontario Indigenous Clean Energy Initiative (NOICE), which is funded through the Government of Canada Strategic Partnerships Initiative and delivered by FedNor, is helping Indigenous communities move forward with clean energy projects by supporting local ideas, improving planning, and building the skills needed to get projects off the ground. Through focused investments and hands-on support, the initiative is opening the door to new clean energy opportunities and stronger community infrastructure. Together, these projects are helping shape a cleaner, more resilient future for Northern Ontario.

These projects will help to diversify and stimulate business investment and growth, and will enhance collaboration in planning and realizing Indigenous-led clean energy projects in Northern Ontario. NOICE will specifically target Indigenous communities and organizations, as well as Indigenous-owned businesses and organizations.

Also announced today was $4,774,515 in FedNor funds for 10 Indigenous economic development projects throughout Northern Ontario. This funding will create new jobs, develop and implement new tourism infrastructure and attractions, and support important research, design, and planning work. Each project is receiving FedNor support to help foster self-directed, Indigenous-led economic development opportunities in a variety of sectors for Indigenous communities and businesses across Northern Ontario.

These investments are steps toward economic reconciliation, working hand-in-hand with Indigenous communities and supporting self-directed economic growth in Indigenous-led business spaces and communities throughout Northern Ontario. Creating opportunities that honour traditional territories and strengthen local economies will help build stronger partnerships between Indigenous businesses, organizations, communities, and industry, ensuring that prosperity is shared and that growth reflects the vision and leadership of Indigenous Peoples across Northern Ontario.",https://www.canada.ca/etc/designs/canada/wet-boew/assets/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-05 19:59:49.625136

Other lead applicants for the $900-million SMR federal funding included utility Arizona Public Service and developer Constellation, according to media reports.
The latter also closed a $1-billion DOE loan last month to restart the undamaged 835-MW reactor unit at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.","Small modular nuclear power reactors using light water cooling technology to be developed for U.S. commercial use by power provider Tennessee Valley Authority in its multi-state region and by private developer Holtec International in Michigan will gain up to $400 million each in federal cost-share funds to advance projects and related supply chains, the U.S, Energy Dept. announced this month.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the project investments in third-generation nuclear power technology will help advance Trump administration goals outlined earlier this year to boost that energy source domestically—particularly to insure U.S. energy security and gain global artificial intelligence dominance. “Advanced light water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need ... support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid,” he said.

The funding actually stems from a Biden-era solicitation released in October 2024 using 2021 federal infrastructure act funding that includes another $100 million to be awarded later this year to support more deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness, said DOE. But the Trump administration revised the solicitation last spring to remove required community benefit financial investments by winners.

DOE funding will assist TVA to build the first two-unit, estimated 600-MW GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Clinch River site in Tennessee by the early 2030s and plan future deployments with partners Indiana Michigan Power and BWX Technologies. The TVA development team also includes contractors Bechtel and Ontario-based Aecon, Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Electric Power Research Institute.

TVA's construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the BWRX-300 at Clinch River, submitted in May, still is under agency review. “This award affirms TVA’s continued leadership in shaping the nation’s nuclear energy future,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO of the independent federal corporate agency that supplies power to 10 million people in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and smaller areas of neighboring states.

“Unlike previous nuclear construction projects in the U.S., contractors will work with [GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy] and TVA as a highly integrated project team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1.” Bechtel said in January. “The integrated project delivery model is the preferred method that will make our project a true team effort,” said Bob Deacy, TVA senior vice president and its Clinch River project leader. “We will actively work together toward a target budget and schedule – creating a significant advantage to drive nuclear innovation, share risks and reduce costs.”

TVA also has signed public-private partnerships with other SMR developers in recent months, including Kairos Power and NuScale, as well as with nuclear fusion developer Type One Energy. TVA said it currently has about 11 GW of requested load for AI and data centers across its area, including from Google, Meta and xAI.

TVA’s technology collaboration partner Ontario Power Generation has started construction of four GE Vernova BWRX-300 units, with the first to be online by 2030 at its Darlington power plant. The province approved construction plans and awarded a contract in May to a partnership between Aecon and Kiewit Nuclear Canada for construction planning and execution, and project management. Aecon said its share of the contract is worth about $930 million.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and design-build firm Samsung C&T in October also announced a strategic alliance to advance BWRX-300 SMR deployment in markets outside North America.

Going Modular in Michigan

Holtec's funding will aid company plans to deploy its dual-unit SMR-300 reactors at the site of the 800-MW Palisades nuclear power plant it owns and also seeks to restart in January in Covert, Mich., adding an additional 600 MW. The developer also signed an expanded alliance agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction to build a 10-GW fleet of SMR-300s in North America through the 2030s, beginning with the Palisades project. The contractors will manage reactor construction, deployment, operation, supply chain and power selling. Project cost has been estimated at $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion per reactor.

“Targeting first power by 2030, our Mission 2030 initiative will position the Palisades SMR project as the reference plant for all future SMR-300 deployments—domestically and globally,” said Holtec.

Company founder, chairman & CEO Krishna Singh told attendees of an American Nuclear Society conference last month that the company's SMR-300 reactor ""was born the day after"" the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in Japan, but it did not win DOE funding at the time because of agency disagreement on its design. Holtec self-funded the project, Singh noted, and will submit its design next year to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for limited work authorization.

According to a Holtec statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support"" under the agency's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program dating to 2020.

Holtec also has a $1.52-billion conditional loan from DOE for the Palisades restart, although the action faces new litigation from anti nuclear groups that have sued the developer and the commission in federal court.

Other lead applicants for the $900-million SMR federal funding included utility Arizona Public Service and developer Constellation, according to media reports.

DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers’ new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers’ growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle’s cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds’ Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

The infrastructure transformation extends beyond individual mine sites to regional electrical grid capacity. Multiple mining operations adopting electric fleets simultaneously could require coordinated grid infrastructure investment to support increased electrical demand.

Mining operations typically consume substantial electrical power for ore processing facilities. Electric haul truck charging represents additional electrical demand that must integrate with existing mine site power systems without disrupting processing operations.

How Do Operating Costs Compare Between Electric and Diesel Haul Trucks?

Total Cost of Ownership Analysis Framework

Operating cost comparisons between Caterpillar battery-electric haul trucks and diesel alternatives require comprehensive total cost of ownership analysis encompassing purchase price, energy costs, maintenance expenses, and operational efficiency factors. Early Learner program data collection will provide validated cost structure information for commercial deployment decisions.

Projected Annual Operating Cost Structure:

Cost Category Diesel Operations Electric Operations Variance Energy/Fuel $180,000-240,000 $60,000-90,000 -60% to -70% Maintenance $85,000-120,000 $45,000-65,000 -45% to -50% Parts & Components $35,000-50,000 $25,000-35,000 -30% to -35% Training & Skills $8,000-12,000 $12,000-18,000 +50%

Note: Cost figures are estimates based on industry analysis and require validation through operational trials. Actual costs depend on electricity rates, battery performance, and maintenance protocols developed during Early Learner testing.

Energy cost advantages depend heavily on electricity pricing compared to diesel fuel costs. Remote mining locations may face higher electricity costs due to transmission infrastructure requirements or on-site generation expenses that reduce cost advantages.

Productivity and Efficiency Metrics

Electric drivetrain technology offers potential productivity advantages through improved operational characteristics and reduced downtime requirements. Regenerative braking systems capture energy during loaded descents, improving overall energy efficiency compared to diesel alternatives that convert braking energy to waste heat.

Operational Efficiency Factors:

Reduced maintenance downtime through fewer moving parts and simplified drivetrain systems

Predictive maintenance capabilities enabled by advanced electric system monitoring and diagnostics

Consistent power delivery across operating conditions without engine performance variation

Quieter operation potentially enabling extended operating hours in noise-sensitive areas

Electric motor torque characteristics provide immediate maximum torque availability compared to diesel engines requiring optimal RPM ranges for peak performance. This characteristic could improve acceleration and hill climbing performance while reducing operator skill requirements for optimal efficiency.

Advanced telematics integration with electric systems enables real-time energy management optimisation, route planning for maximum efficiency, and predictive maintenance scheduling based on battery and component condition monitoring.

What Technical Challenges Must Be Overcome for Large-Scale Deployment?

Battery Technology and Energy Density Limitations

Current lithium-ion battery technology faces significant challenges in mining applications due to energy density limitations, charging time requirements, and performance degradation under extreme operating conditions. The Pilbara region's temperature extremes and dust exposure represent accelerated stress testing for battery system durability.

(AP) — The Cooper family knows how to work heavy machinery. The kids could run a hay baler by their early teens, and two of the three ran monster-sized drills at the coal mines along with their dad.

But learning to maneuver the shiny red drill they use to tap into underground heat feels different. It’s a critical part of the new family business, High Altitude Geothermal, which installs geothermal heat pumps that use the Earth’s constant temperature to heat and cool buildings. At stake is not just their livelihood but a century-long family legacy of producing energy in Moffat County.

Like many families here, the Coopers have worked in coal for generations — and in oil before that. That’s ending for Matt Cooper and his son Matthew as one of three coal mines in the area closes in a statewide shift to cleaner energy.

“People have to start looking beyond coal,” said Matt Cooper. “And that can be a multitude of things. Our economy has been so focused on coal and coal-fired power plants. And we need the diversity.”

Many countries and about half of U.S. states are moving away from coal, citing environmental impacts and high costs. Burning coal emits carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet.

President Donald Trump has boosted coal as part of his agenda to promote fossil fuels. He’s trying to save a declining industry with executive orders, large sales of coal from public lands, regulatory relief and offers of hundreds of millions of dollars to restore coal plants.

That’s created uncertainty in places like Craig. As some families like the Coopers plan for the next stage of their careers, others hold out hope Trump will save their plants, mines and high-paying jobs.

Matt and Matthew Cooper work at the Colowyo Mine near Meeker, though active mining has ended and site cleanup begins in January.

The mine employs about 130 workers and supplies Craig Generating Station, a 1,400-megawatt coal-fired plant. Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is planning to close Craig’s Unit 1 by year’s end for economic reasons and to meet legal requirements for reducing emissions. The other two units will close in 2028.

Xcel Energy owns coal-fired Hayden Station, about 30 minutes away. It said it doesn’t plan to change retirement dates for Hayden, though it’s extending another coal unit in Pueblo in part due to increased demand for electricity.

The Craig and Hayden plants together employ about 200 people.

Craig residents have always been entrepreneurial and that spirit will get them through this transition, said Kirstie McPherson, board president for the Craig Chamber of Commerce. Still, she said, just about everybody here is connected to coal.

“You have a whole community who has always been told you are an energy town, you’re a coal town,” she said. “When that starts going away, beyond just the individuals that are having the identity crisis, you have an entire culture, an entire community that is also having that same crisis.”

Phasing out coal

Coal has been central to Colorado’s economy since before statehood, but it’s generally the most expensive energy on today’s grid, said Democratic Gov. Jared Polis.

“We are not going to let this administration drag us backwards into an overreliance on expensive fossil fuels,” Polis said in a statement.

Nationwide, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021, costing consumers $6.2 billion more, according to a June analysis from Energy Innovation. The nonpartisan think tank cited significant increases to run aging plants as well as inflation.

Colorado’s six remaining coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close or convert to natural gas, which emits about half the carbon dioxide as coal, by 2031. The state is rapidly adding solar and wind that’s cheaper and cleaner than legacy coal plants. Renewable energy provides more than 40% of Colorado’s power now and will pass 70% by the end of the decade, according to statewide utility plans.

Nationwide, wind and solar growth has remained strong, producing more electricity than coal in 2025, as of the latest data in October, according to energy think tank Ember.

But some states want to increase or at least maintain coal production. That includes top coal state Wyoming, where the Wyoming Energy Authority said Trump is breathing welcome new life into its coal and mining industry.

Planning for the future

The Coopers have gone all-in on geothermal.

“Maybe we’ll never go back to coal,” Matt Cooper said. “We haven’t (gone) back to oil and gas, so we might just be geothermal people for quite some time, maybe generations, and then eventually something else will come along.”

While the Coopers were learning to use their drill in October, Wade Gerber was in downtown Craig distilling grain neutral spirits — used to make gin and vodka — on a day off from the Craig Station power plant. Gerber stepped over his corgis, Ali and Boss, and onto a stepladder to peer into a massive stainless steel pot where he was heating wheat and barley.

Gerber’s spent three decades in coal. When closure plans were announced four years ago, he, his wife Tenniel and their friend McPherson brainstormed business ideas.

“With my background in plumbing and electrical from the plant it’s like, oh yeah, I can handle that part of it,” Gerber said about distilling. “This is the easy part.”

He used Tri-State’s education subsidies for classes in distilling, while other co-workers learned to fix vehicles or repair guns to find new careers. While some plan to leave town, Gerber is opening Bad Alibi Distillery. McPherson and Tenniel Gerber are opening a cocktail bar next door.

Everyone in town hopes Trump will step in to extend the plant’s life, Gerber said. Meanwhile, they’re trying to define a new future for Craig in a nerve-wracking time.

“For me, my products can go elsewhere. I don’t necessarily have to sell it in Craig, there’s that avenue. For someone relying on Craig, it’s even scarier,” he said.

Questioning the coal rollback

Tammy Villard owns a gift shop, Moffat Mercantile, with her husband. After the coal closures were announced, they opened a commercial print shop too, seeing it as a practical choice for when so many high-paying jobs go away.

Villard, who spent a decade at Colowyo as administrative staff, said she doesn’t understand how the state can throw the switch to turn off coal and still have reliable electricity. She wants the state to slow down.

Villard describes herself as a moderate Republican. She said political swings at the federal level — from the green energy push in the last administration to doubling down on fossil fuels in this one — aren’t helpful.

“The pendulum has to come back to the middle,” she said, “and we are so far out to either side that I don’t know how we get back to that middle.”

Other lead applicants for the $900-million SMR federal funding included utility Arizona Public Service and developer Constellation, according to media reports.
The latter also closed a $1-billion DOE loan last month to restart the undamaged 835-MW reactor unit at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania.","Small modular nuclear power reactors using light water cooling technology to be developed for U.S. commercial use by power provider Tennessee Valley Authority in its multi-state region and by private developer Holtec International in Michigan will gain up to $400 million each in federal cost-share funds to advance projects and related supply chains, the U.S, Energy Dept. announced this month.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the project investments in third-generation nuclear power technology will help advance Trump administration goals outlined earlier this year to boost that energy source domestically—particularly to insure U.S. energy security and gain global artificial intelligence dominance. “Advanced light water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need ... support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid,” he said.

The funding actually stems from a Biden-era solicitation released in October 2024 using 2021 federal infrastructure act funding that includes another $100 million to be awarded later this year to support more deployments and address barriers in design, licensing, supply chain and site readiness, said DOE. But the Trump administration revised the solicitation last spring to remove required community benefit financial investments by winners.

DOE funding will assist TVA to build the first two-unit, estimated 600-MW GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Clinch River site in Tennessee by the early 2030s and plan future deployments with partners Indiana Michigan Power and BWX Technologies. The TVA development team also includes contractors Bechtel and Ontario-based Aecon, Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities and the Electric Power Research Institute.

TVA's construction permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the BWRX-300 at Clinch River, submitted in May, still is under agency review. “This award affirms TVA’s continued leadership in shaping the nation’s nuclear energy future,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO of the independent federal corporate agency that supplies power to 10 million people in most of Tennessee, northern Alabama, northeastern Mississippi, southwestern Kentucky and smaller areas of neighboring states.

“Unlike previous nuclear construction projects in the U.S., contractors will work with [GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy] and TVA as a highly integrated project team to plan, design and potentially procure, construct and commission Clinch River Unit 1.” Bechtel said in January. “The integrated project delivery model is the preferred method that will make our project a true team effort,” said Bob Deacy, TVA senior vice president and its Clinch River project leader. “We will actively work together toward a target budget and schedule – creating a significant advantage to drive nuclear innovation, share risks and reduce costs.”

TVA also has signed public-private partnerships with other SMR developers in recent months, including Kairos Power and NuScale, as well as with nuclear fusion developer Type One Energy. TVA said it currently has about 11 GW of requested load for AI and data centers across its area, including from Google, Meta and xAI.

TVA’s technology collaboration partner Ontario Power Generation has started construction of four GE Vernova BWRX-300 units, with the first to be online by 2030 at its Darlington power plant. The province approved construction plans and awarded a contract in May to a partnership between Aecon and Kiewit Nuclear Canada for construction planning and execution, and project management. Aecon said its share of the contract is worth about $930 million.

GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy and design-build firm Samsung C&T in October also announced a strategic alliance to advance BWRX-300 SMR deployment in markets outside North America.

Going Modular in Michigan

Holtec's funding will aid company plans to deploy its dual-unit SMR-300 reactors at the site of the 800-MW Palisades nuclear power plant it owns and also seeks to restart in January in Covert, Mich., adding an additional 600 MW. The developer also signed an expanded alliance agreement with Hyundai Engineering & Construction to build a 10-GW fleet of SMR-300s in North America through the 2030s, beginning with the Palisades project. The contractors will manage reactor construction, deployment, operation, supply chain and power selling. Project cost has been estimated at $2.1 billion to $2.7 billion per reactor.

“Targeting first power by 2030, our Mission 2030 initiative will position the Palisades SMR project as the reference plant for all future SMR-300 deployments—domestically and globally,” said Holtec.

Company founder, chairman & CEO Krishna Singh told attendees of an American Nuclear Society conference last month that the company's SMR-300 reactor ""was born the day after"" the 2011 Fukushima nuclear plant meltdown in Japan, but it did not win DOE funding at the time because of agency disagreement on its design. Holtec self-funded the project, Singh noted, and will submit its design next year to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for limited work authorization.

According to a Holtec statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support"" under the agency's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program dating to 2020.

Holtec also has a $1.52-billion conditional loan from DOE for the Palisades restart, although the action faces new litigation from anti nuclear groups that have sued the developer and the commission in federal court.

The EPA recently approved the use of pesticide products that some experts say contain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The agency approved two chemicals, cyclobutrifluram and isocycloseram, for use on various agricultural crops and/or turf and ornamental plants. While the EPA defines PFAS as chemicals that contain two or more fluorinated carbons, other scientific organizations and regulatory bodies define PFAS as chemicals that contain at least one fully fluorinated carbon, which would include the two EPA-approved chemicals. The pesticides won’t be sprayed on California crops until a state review process is complete and the chemicals are approved, which could take months or years.

Chevron fined $900K for air pollution monitoring failures at Richmond refinery, air district says

ABC7 News – December 3

Bay Area air quality regulators announced this Tuesday that Chevron was assessed with a $900,000 fine for air pollution monitoring failures at its Richmond refinery. Bay Area Air District officials said that portions of Chevron's air monitoring system were not “configured to detect the full range of potential emissions and were limited in how much emissions they could measure.” A Chevron spokesperson said that the company agreed to add a second set of monitors “that go above and beyond federal regulations,” a concession that “comes at high cost with little benefit.”

And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT (AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers’ new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It’s true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers’ growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle’s cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds’ Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

While the long-term impacts of the elimination of the United States’ federal electric vehicle tax credit remain unknown, it’s clear that battery manufacturers in the country are starting to shift their approach toward grid-scale storage rather than EV batteries. LG Energy Solution, for instance, plans to expand its ESS facility in Michigan, and OEMs like SK and Samsung are entering the U.S. market as EV demand softens.

Still, for Ravi Manghani, the senior director of strategic sourcing at Anza Renewables, it’s more of a step-on-the-acceleration moment than a sudden change in strategy.

“We’ve seen the early signs of divergence take shape over the past several years, largely due to the way the Inflation Reduction Act structured its incentives,” he told ESS News, pointing out that the $7,500 federal EV credit required both the battery and its upstream materials to come from the US or allied countries with the storage investment tax credit (ITC) being tied mainly to domestic content. That’s part of what drove EV-focused battery OEMs to localize their US manufacturing footprints first.

Healthy forests are a key part of the climate puzzle — and they’ve been a big part of our advocacy in 2025!

In January of this year, CCL volunteers sent 7,100 messages to Congress urging them to work together to reduce wildfire risk. Soon after, the Fix Our Forests Act was introduced in the House as H.R. 471 and passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 279–141.

At our Conservative Climate Conference and Lobby Day in March, we raised the Fix Our Forests Act as a secondary ask in 47 lobby meetings on Capitol Hill. The next month, an improved version of the bill was then introduced in the Senate as S. 1462 and referred to the Senate Agriculture Committee.

The bill was scheduled for a committee vote in October. CCLers placed more than 2,000 calls to senators on the committee and generated a flurry of local media in their states before the vote. In October, the bill passed the Senate Agriculture Committee with strong bipartisan support.

It’s clear that this legislation has momentum! As the Fix Our Forests Act now awaits a floor vote in the Senate, let’s take a look back at our 2025 advocacy efforts to advance this bill — and why it’s so important.

Protecting forests and improving climate outcomes

Wildfires are getting worse. In the U.S., the annual area burned by wildfires has more than doubled over the past 30 years. In California alone, the acreage burned by wildfires every year has more than tripled over the past 40 years.

American forests currently offset 12% of our annual climate pollution, with the potential to do even more. We need to take action to reduce wildfire, so forests can keep doing their important work pulling climate pollution out of the atmosphere.

The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act:

Protects America’s forests by supporting time-tested tools, like prescribed fire and reforestation, that make our forests healthy and able to better withstand and recover from severe wildfire and other extreme weather.

Protects communities across the nation by reducing wildfire risks to people, homes, and water supplies and adopting new technologies.

Protects livelihoods by supporting rural jobs and recreation areas and sustaining the forests that house and feed us.

CCL supports this bill alongside many organizations including American Forests, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, National Audubon Society, The Western Fire Chiefs Association, The Federation of American Scientists and more.

A deeper dive into our efforts

All year long, CCL’s Government Relations staff has been in conversation with congressional offices to share CCL’s perspective on the legislation and understand the opportunities and challenges facing the bill. Our Government Relations team played a key role in helping us understand when and how to provide an extra grassroots push to keep the bill moving.

Starting Sept. 9 through the committee vote, CCLers represented by senators on the Senate Agriculture Committee made 2,022 calls to committee members in support of FOFA. CCL also signed a national coalition letter to Senate leadership in support of the bill, joining organizations like the American Conservation Coalition Action, Bipartisan Policy Center Action, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and more.

In October, we launched a local media initiative in support of FOFA, focused on states with senators on the Agriculture Committee. Volunteers published letters to the editor and op-eds in California, Minnesota, Colorado, and more. In one state, the senator’s office saw a CCLer’s op-ed in the local newspaper, and reached out to schedule a meeting with those volunteers to discuss the bill! CCL’s Government Relations team joined in to make the most of the conversation.

As soon as the committee vote was scheduled for October 21, our Government Relations staff put out a call for volunteers to generate local endorsement letters from trusted messengers. CCL staff prepared short endorsement letter templates for each state that chapters could personalize and submit to their senator’s office. Each version included clear instructions, contact info, and space for volunteers to add their local context, like a short story or relevant example of how wildfires have impacted their area.

Then, CCL state coordinators worked with the CCL chapters in their states to make sure they prepared and sent the signed letters to the appropriate senate office, and to alert CCL’s Government Affairs staff so they could follow up and keep the conversation going on Capitol Hill.

Individually, our voices as climate advocates struggle to break through and make change. But it’s this kind of coordinated nationwide effort, with well-informed staff partnering with motivated local volunteers, that makes CCL effective at moving the needle in Congress.

On October 21, the Fix Our Forests Act officially passed the Senate Agriculture Committee with a vote of 18-5.

Building on the momentum

After committee passage, FOFA is now waiting to be taken up by the full Senate for a floor vote. It’s not clear yet if it will move as a standalone bill or included in a package of other legislation.

But to continue building support, we spent a large portion of our Fall Conference training our volunteers on the latest information about the bill, and we included FOFA as a primary ask in our Fall Lobby Week meetings.

Volunteers are now messaging all senators in support of FOFA. If you haven’t already, add your voice by sending messages to your senators about this legislation. With strategy, organization, and a group of dedicated people, we can help pass the Fix Our Forests Act, reducing wildfire risk and helping forests remove more climate pollution.",https://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/FOFA-header-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 18:02:43.187185

This came after many gathered to protest the data center outside of DTE’s Detroit headquarters earlier in the day, calling for more transparency.

Many raised concerns during the meeting that the approval process is being rushed, with many echoing Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s continued calls for a contested case hearing to fully explore the impact to DTE ratepayers and the environment.

“We really need to take our time with these things,” said Rachel Brown during public comment. “I don’t believe we have a lot of recourse once everything is completed to go back and fix the harms that they might be causing.”

DTE requested its expedited application be decided by Dec. 5, with Oracle, OpenAI and Related Digital planning to begin construction of the data center in early 2026. DTE said that their agreement with these companies includes a clause that could allow them to terminate it with 30 days' notice if the MPSC does not reach a decision by then. However, DTE’s application is not included in the MPSC’s Dec. 5 agenda.

Many questioned DTE’s claims that the data center contracts will not raise energy rates for its more than 1 million Michigan customers, which the company laid out in its 142-page, partially redacted application.

“We should not be taking DTE’s word here that rates won’t be impacted,” said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy manager for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition. “This project is unprecedented in Michigan’s history.”

“No one in the public knows the details of the heavily redacted plans, no one knows exactly how DTE plans to generate the 1.4 gigawatts of electricity,” said Bryan Smigielski, who also attended the Wednesday protest.

Others spoke in favor of the data center due to the construction jobs it would create, which Related Digital estimates to be more than 2,500.

“I think it's going to represent a historic opportunity for Michigan skilled trades,” said Dustin Bird, IBEW Local 252 union member. “I think this project is a win for the workers and it's a win for Michigan.”

In addition to those speaking during the two hours MSPC permitted for public comment, the commission received more than 5,000 comments online about the application.

You know, in terms of the impact it has on tax administration and tax policy, it’s significant.
Now, in terms of effect on tax policy, I think it’s jury still out.
And, you know, you have business taxpayers who maybe aren’t filing on the same timeline as individuals.
But there are a couple of provisions like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.","Terry Gerton We’re a few weeks past the longest lapse in federal appropriations and maybe looking at another one in the end of January. So I want to work with you to put October and November into context. You’ve seen many shutdowns in your time on the Hill and now at Deloitte. How would you say this one differs from previous episodes, especially when it comes to your area of expertise, tax policy?

Anna Taylor Well, I do think it was different than what we’ve seen in years past. And part of that starts with just the way folks on the hill operated in it. I was really shocked that — my first sign that something was different was — I was shocked when I heard reporting that … the members and the staff that work in the Capitol building had left before we even hit midnight the night that we entered the shutdown. That’s not normal. In years past in shutdowns, you have frantic work happening behind the scenes where they’re trying to see if there’s any way to find a deal. And it was just obviously clear to all of them that they were so far away from a deal at that point that there was nothing to do. And so they left the building. And that was my first sign that this one was not normal and we were in for a longer shutdown. You know, in terms of the impact it has on tax administration and tax policy, it’s significant. You know, the fact that you had so many furloughed workers in the federal workforce and specifically at IRS and in Treasury, during that extended period definitely has an effect on customer service. It has an effect on their ability to move forward with their reg writing and guidance plans, which is in this moment, you know, where we’re just getting through a big piece of legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law back in the summer, and they’re in a very significant guidance process to go along with that bill right now. There’s a lot of work that needs to get done … I know that you know, the treasury and the IRS said much of that work went on during the shutdown. So I do think that there was some of that that didn’t stop, which is a good thing for taxpayers, but had to slow it down in some capacity. And when you think about just customer service for taxpayers and not being able to call and find somebody on the phone to talk to, certainly there were challenges there as well. So I do think there was that, you know, kind of tangible direct effect. Now, in terms of effect on tax policy, I think it’s jury still out. Obviously there wasn’t any sort of deal that ended the shutdown with additional legislation. So we didn’t have some big tax package coming out of the — sometimes you do see some sort of legislative deal come out of a — well, not often with a shutdown. Normally nobody wins in a shutdown. But when you’re reaching appropriations deals that don’t end in shutdown, sometimes you’ll see tax legislation attached to those kinds of deals. And, you know, we didn’t have that … There were not regular hearings and regular markups happening in the tax writing committees while we were in shutdown. And so there was probably a slowdown in some bills that are maybe under consideration because they weren’t being considered during the shutdown. And so I do think that probably it definitely had a direct effect on taxpayers who may have had an impact on customer service, but there’s also that effect of maybe slowing down policymaking as well.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Anna Taylor. She’s managing principal of the Tax Policy Group at Deloitte. Well, let’s talk about the specific impact on taxpayers. I mean, filing season is going to open in just a few weeks. Is there a reasonable expectation that the IRS and all of the companies that support tax filing will have written in the rules for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provisions and anything else that might come up before the year end? Are tax filers going to have the systems ready to go?

Anna Taylor Well, I think that the Treasury and IRS have done a — they’ve made a real effort to try to get to the things from that bill first that were going to need to be implemented for taxpayers at the beginning of 2026. So I think in most cases, you have … already seen guidance come out on those things that are affecting individual taxpayers, like … the tipped income deduction and overtime pay, things like that. So they have already put out quite a bit of guidance in those spaces that will have a direct effect on individual taxpayers. There’s still a lot to go though. And, you know, you have business taxpayers who maybe aren’t filing on the same timeline as individuals. Some of that important guidance is still yet to come. But I do think that because of the thinking about the kind of end year for individuals, the administration has tried to prioritize those things that are going to need to be known on day one of the new year.

Terry Gerton That’s good to hear. You also mentioned the congressional tax writing committees and certainly as Congress has come back, the committees have quite a backlog. Can you give us any insight as to what they may be talking about in those committees?

Anna Taylor Well, they do have a full agenda. I mean, I think the first thing that you’re hearing a lot about if you turn on any news outlet right now is of course the thing that landed them in the shutdown to begin with, finding some sort of path forward on those Affordable Care Act premium tax credit — the enhancements for those credits. They didn’t reach any deal before they came out of the shutdown, but they did agree to keep working on it. So there was an agreement as part of coming out of that shutdown where Majority Leader Thune in the Senate said he will hold another round of votes on those credit extensions by the middle of December. So I do think that there’s conversations happening, both bipartisan and partisan, to see if there’s a path forward on figuring out a way to deal with health care costs and insurance premium costs. So that’s taking up a lot of time right now. In addition to that, there is interest from the committees to try to move some things that they’ve been working on for a while on a bipartisan basis. These are things that have been in works for years, honestly, and have pretty broad consensus support. Things like, you know, there’s a tax treaty with Taiwan that has moved through regular order in both the House and the Senate that I think people would like to see get over the finish line. There is, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee have worked on — they haven’t actually processed legislation, but they’ve put out a joint white paper on tax administration. So just some changes to make the system work better for taxpayers. I think that’s something they’re interested in trying to see if there’s opportunities to move together. And then there are a few expiring tax provisions on the business side of the ledger that haven’t been dealt with this year. You know, a lot of the expiring provisions on the individual side were included in that one big beautiful bill act back in the summer. But there are a couple of provisions like the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. That’s an important one that does have an effect on people’s ability to get a job and on business’s ability to hire. And so that’s one that is set to expire at the end of this year that I do think there’s probably bipartisan interest in extending. So those are all things I think on the near-term agenda, if they’re in an environment to be able to move some bipartisan legislation. And we all know right now that’s a big no.

Terry Gerton Well, speaking of that environment, 2026 is an election year for many members of Congress. Do you think in that environment they really will be able to move some of these big pieces of tax legislation or will they maybe just nibble around the edges?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Congress_Tax_Cuts_23265-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:03:42.720419

Energy affordability is now a national concern, and many energy experts are saying we’d be lucky to stabilize costs, that cutting bills isn’t even possible. That’s wrong. We can actually cut energy bills a lot.

How? We’ll give you three ways:

Upgrade home tech: 20–50 percent lower bills

Fix who pays: 5–40 percent lower bills for the half of US households that most need it

Cut red tape and invest faster: 5–25 percent lower bills

To be clear, these are quick, high-level calculations based on reputable sources. But we also have deeper analysis underway to provide more specifics. In the meantime, the conversation today around energy affordability is too often muddled. Many people are unclear on the interlinked causes and potential solutions for rising energy costs, despite seeing it as a crucial issue.

In this article we will:

Clarify the challenge, the stakes. and our focus;

Outline the causes of the problem; and

Provide solutions and a holistic framework that includes new solutions and specific insights for states and regions.

What are we trying to solve?

Energy affordability is a critical issue for America. People need affordable energy to ensure a decent quality of life and be financially stable. We also require affordable energy to support a strong and growing economy.

Yet energy costs are rising, and more Americans are feeling the pinch. Electricity rates rose 6.6 percent in the past year nationally, but over 20 percent in some states. Worse yet, natural gas prices are up 80 percent since 2024 and will double by 2026. That will further increase electricity costs since 40 percent of US electricity comes from natural gas. In fact, electricity rates rose twice as fast and natural gas four times as fast as inflation this year.

Even before these latest increases, one in three US households have had to reduce or forgo food or other basic necessities and one in seven families live in severe energy poverty in the United States.

In 2024, President Trump declared a goal of cutting energy bills in half. It’s a worthy goal. Can we bring it to fruition?

What is energy affordability?

Energy affordability is the ability of a household to pay for their energy use while also paying for other basic living expenses without forgoing basic necessities or risking health and safety. This matters because people often skip food or medical needs to pay for energy. They need to keep driving to work and keep the heat on. High bills can lead to disconnections that can result in health problems or even death.

Many people talk about energy burdens and energy affordability only in terms of their home utility bills. But transportation costs can also have a huge energy cost and create a greater energy burden.

What are people spending on energy?

A report from EPRI shows that the average US household spent $5,530 on energy in 2024, and over half of that was on gasoline. Many energy affordability conversations only focus on utility bills, but gasoline bills are often more than electricity and natural gas combined.

With the median US household income at $83,730 in 2024, energy costs — including transportation — make up 6.6 percent of a family’s income.

But averages and medians don’t tell the real story here. The real affordability challenge is for the lower half of US households by income, where most households spend over 10 percent of their income on energy.

What causes unaffordable energy?

In order to make energy bills affordable, we must first understand what makes them un-affordable. The energy system is complex and varied. Many efforts to address affordability only look at one area. This is like the old story about people in a dark building encountering different parts of an elephant and thinking each part is something else. We want to look at the whole elephant.

Some parts of the elephant will matter more or less for different people, but all of it is relevant. States have different laws and weather risks, utilities manage their costs differently, and people have different homes, equipment, cars, etc. All of this can change what the biggest causes are for high energy costs.

Our focus here is on energy bills — this is where people run into the sum of all these factors in one tangible question: how much do they have to pay for energy? It’s an important matter that gets discussed at kitchen tables across the country.

To clarify the complexity and capture all the major factors, we offer this framework:

People’s energy bills are based on four things:

Energy Use How much energy we use, which we have the most control over. The causes of high bills include:

Inefficient buildings, appliances, and vehicles

User actions

Who Pays What How the rules are set up for who pays for what parts of our energy system:

The fuel or electricity delivered to us

Upgrades to pipes and wires

Emergency responses

Market fluctuations

A variety of utility incentives that are misaligned with social and/or consumer goals

Energy System The costs built into how we provide and deliver energy. These are institutional structures that generally require market or policy changes. This includes:

Supply chain costs (including electricity generation)

Transmission and distribution costs

Natural gas, coal, and oil prices, which are highly volatile

Wider World Impacts These factors are less predictable and are not part of the energy system’s design, but they have big impacts on the above. This includes:

Extreme weather and wildfires

New external pressures such as AI development, inflation, tariffs, geopolitics, etc.

Financing costs and cost of capital

How do we make energy affordable?

We can take action on each of these causes to unlock big savings. And we can do this without losing the quality of energy services. In fact, these solutions often make reliability and security better. Here’s what we have to do to increase affordability:

Specifically, here are some options for each:

Efficiency already saves average American more than $1,000/year. And energy saved at home creates big savings across the whole energy system. Here are some of the top actions:

Fix the shell: Fixing a home’s air leaks can save 10–20 percent. And insulation can do more.

Better home equipment: Upgrading thermostats, lights, AC, and heating systems offers big bill savings.

Better vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs) offer better performance with less energy and maintenance. This includes cars and e-bikes. And used EVs are often cheaper to buy than gas counterparts.

Use the best rates: Make use of time-of-use rates to use electricity at its lowest costs, such as running your dishwasher overnight instead of during the evening. Also, use dedicated EV or heat pump rates where available. This can drive down costs for all customers

Participate in virtual power plants (VPPs): A VPP lets customers get paid for helping the grid. Get paid when you hold off on using power (with smart appliances) or provide power to the grid through home or EV batteries. Most states have VPP programs.

Policymakers have four main tools to change the rules of who pays for what:

Fix utility incentives: Our current system gives utilities some incentives that make prices go up. Economic dispatch, fuel cost sharing, and performance-based ratemaking can help.

Create guardrails for homes: We can end energy poverty while benefitting the entire energy system through things like percentage-of-income payment plans (PIPPs), debt management plans, and large-load tariffs (to make sure energy customers like AI data centers don’t put a strain on customers).

Reform transportation funding: Who pays and who benefits from highway funding isn’t aligned. This includes making commercial trucks pay for their share of road upkeep (as the Cato Institute has proposed) and investing in more transportation options so people can save $750 a year on average by reducing fuel and maintenance costs.

Public investments in infrastructure: We can invest public funds in wildfire response, grid resilience, or long-distance transmission expansion, instead of putting that on customers.

We can accelerate investment in energy infrastructure and affordable resources to improve costs for consumers. There are many ways to do this, but here are some of our favorites:

Interconnection and permitting reform: Upgrade the bureaucracy or get it out of the way, so we can build faster and lower the costs of new resources.

Virtual power plants: As discussed above, these can benefits customers, but they also strengthen the grid and can cut utility costs by 20 percent.

Upgrade the grid: Installing or replacing grid equipment with grid-enhancing-technologies is cost-effective and lets us bring affordable energy online faster.

Power couples: Marry needs by building new facilities near existing grid connection sites allowing us to build faster and cheaper.

Lowering bills now and later

For immediate relief, homeowners should look for opportunities to improve their energy use, especially when they replace equipment or vehicles. Policymakers can also take action on fast-acting solutions. We will need longer-term solutions as well, which need to be launched now to create benefits down the road.

We can use this framework to understand the specific causes and solutions needed on a state-by-state basis. Some of that work is already captured in our Energy Poverty Policy Simulator, and we will build out more state-by-state insights in the year ahead.

RMI is also working to support decision makers to match energy bill solutions to their authority (for example: best practices for governors and our electricity affordability toolkit for policymakers). We are also creating spaces for peer learning to scale up the cost-saving ideas that can work quickly (for example: Reg Lab).

We can enact the solutions above now in most places. We don’t have to wait for new solutions, but innovations are welcome. RMI will continue to work with leaders across the country to make energy affordable.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-2165132898-energy-bills-e1764715926889.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:03:33.938638

Thanks to President Donald Trump and his toadies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is in disarray. The past couple of weeks at the agency have been particularly tumultuous. A second unqualified acting administrator, David Richardson, resigned. Meanwhile, Trump’s FEMA Review Council missed its deadline to publish recommendations for “reform.” Ordinary people are already paying the price for Trump’s assault on the agency.

Still, on the whole we’ve been lucky this year. No hurricanes made landfall in the United States in 2025—the first time that’s happened in a decade. This was very fortunate considering how badly things probably would have gone had a major storm hit a society weakened by Trump’s government demolition blitz.

In any case, our meteorological luck will eventually run out. Within U.S borders, it was a quiet hurricane season, but nearby Jamaica got smashed by Melissa, a climate change–fueled storm that grew from Category 1 to 4 in less than 24 hours, eventually reaching Category 5 status. Melissa was tied for the strongest hurricane in Atlantic history at landfall, and it also set a new record for fastest wind gust ever measured at 252 miles per hour. Something like that will hit America, almost certainly before 2028, and when it does, the devastating effects of Trump’s FEMA attacks should be indisputable—if effectively broadcast to the public.

What has he done? The usual Trump formula. He’s slashed agency staff and unlawfully impeded the flow of congressionally appropriated funds. He’s politicized disaster relief, delaying or denying funding for regions hit by crisis, especially places he perceives as anti-Trump. And he’s axed long-term initiatives to protect and ruggedize communities at risk of climate disasters. In short, the Trump administration has effectively outsourced soaring disaster costs to ill-equipped states, profit-seeking insurers, and, ultimately, helpless individuals. We might call it “build back worse.”

One might say that at least the agency hasn’t been abolished outright, as Trump and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem have repeatedly called for. And the Review Council’s report, still anticipated before the end of the year, is not expected to endorse the elimination of FEMA.

However, on closer examination, the goal appears to be de facto rather than overt destruction of FEMA. Noem’s comments have often used a variation of ending the agency “as it exists,” including after the July floods that killed more than 130 people in Central Texas, and Trump has used phrases like “getting rid of,” “overhauling,” and “reforming” interchangeably. The common denominator has been forcing states to shoulder the burden of disaster management even though they lack sufficient personnel and fiscal resources—a reality made worse by the Trump administration’s moves to choke off relevant funding. Trump’s devolution playbook comes straight from Project 2025. That right-wing policy blueprint, the brainchild of Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, calls for shrinking the federal government’s role in emergency management by shifting “the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities.” Underneath the semantic inconsistency, the reality is that the White House has been dismantling FEMA for ten months.

In her role as FEMA Review Council co-chair, Noem is tasked with finalizing the body’s (nonbinding) guidance before sending it to Trump’s desk. Noem and her top adviser, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, are reportedly reshaping the document in significant ways. Among other things, the council’s original, 160-page draft advocated for elevating FEMA to an independent, cabinet-level office and enabling communities to rebuild in ways that reduce disaster risk. In contrast, Noem’s unfinished, 20-page report recommends keeping the agency within DHS, and it “removes any mention of mitigation programs and slashes preparedness dollars for local emergency management agencies,” two unnamed sources told the Associated Press.

It’s quite obvious what is going on here. Trump, Noem, and Vought have demonstrated that it’s possible to critically incapacitate an agency without formally quashing it.

How Trump Paralyzed FEMA

By early May, the Trump administration had pushed out more than 2,000 FEMA workers, nearly one-third of the agency’s full-time staff, with decades of combined experience. That includes most senior executives, who were replaced by DHS personnel with little to no disaster management expertise.

In addition to downsizing FEMA, the Trump administration has used several tactics to illegally withhold billions of dollars in federal disaster-related funding. In January and February, DHS implemented multiple spending reviews and freezes in a cruel effort to avoid assisting undocumented immigrants even “incidentally.” Since March, DHS has made the disbursement of certain funds contingent on cooperation with Trump’s racist mass deportation agenda, provoking a legal battle. The administration has continued to block funding despite being ordered multiple times to stop. It recently threw up additional roadblocks, prompting another lawsuit.

Among other things, the Trump administration’s lawless and punitive funding moves have disrupted the Emergency Management Performance Grant program, which is used to train and pay state and local emergency management staff—that is, the people the White House says should be taking on a greater share of disaster planning and response. Another key source of paralysis has been Noem’s requirement, established in June, that she personally approve every contract or grant valued over $100,000.

The lethal consequences of all this were on full display in Central Texas over the July 4th weekend. When a heavy storm dumped more than 20 inches of rain in some locations, driving the Guadalupe River up 26 feet in just 45 minutes, the damage to local communities was apocalyptic. In response, Noem waited more than 72 hours to authorize the deployment of FEMA’s Urban Search and Rescue teams. Texas officials’ request for aerial imagery, which FEMA provides to help search and rescue operations, was also needlessly delayed as it awaited Noem’s approval. In addition, Noem let the contracts for hundreds of call center workers lapse on July 5 and didn’t renew the contracts until July 10. Thousands of calls to FEMA’s disaster assistance line went unanswered as a result.

Agency employees made clear that Noem’s onerous grant approval rule “is absolutely hampering our ability to provide immediate assistance.” One FEMA worker bluntly stated that if the White House were to respond to a hurricane in the same manner it responded to the Texas flooding disaster, the results would be catastrophic.

Naturally, administration officials refused to admit error. Noem insisted she had done nothing wrong. Then-acting FEMA chief Richardson told a House panel that the Trump administration’s response to the deadly Texas floods is a “model of how disasters should be handled.” The Washington Post later reported that Richardson, who didn’t visit the disaster zone until nine days after flooding began, had been unreachable for more than 24 hours, contradicting his testimony to lawmakers.

The United States was fortuitously spared from hurricanes this year. But there have been plenty of other extreme weather events during Trump’s second term—from severe winter storms to tornadoes and flash floods. In every case, his administration has bungled the response, even in loyal MAGA regions.

Weaponizing Disaster Relief

Trump’s record is even worse in blue regions. As of December 4, he had approved 37 major disaster declarations requested by governors and tribal chief executives. All but one have included partial rejections of certain items. He has also denied at least 12 extreme weather–related requests. A dozen weather-related requests, including five appeals, are pending. All of that is according to the Revolving Door Project’s tally, which is based on information gleaned from FEMA’s daily operations briefing and other publicly available records.

With a handful of exceptions, Trump has been letting major disaster declaration requests accumulate for weeks at a time before dealing with them in batches. This approach keeps disaster-stricken communities waiting far longer than they would if Trump processed requests on a running basis. It’s not unusual for Trump to take more than six weeks to approve requests. Such avoidable delays force state and local governments to confront disasters without federal emergency response support for extended periods of time, needlessly imperiling lives and infrastructure.

On October 22, his most recent “decision day,” Trump partially approved four requests. When announcing his decisions on Truth Social, the president heaped praise on Alaska, North Dakota, and Nebraska—states he’s won multiple times. The same day, Trump denied a pair of requests from Illinois (a state he lost by 11 points in 2024) and another from Vermont (31 points). In addition, he rejected an appeal from Maryland (29 points). All three states had previously sued the Trump administration for withholding emergency preparedness funding and shuttering FEMA’s foremost pre-disaster mitigation program. Trump’s aggressively partisan rhetoric elicited concerns about the extent to which his aid allocations are politically motivated.

The Illinois rejections were particularly noteworthy given the scale of destruction documented by FEMA. According to E&E News, since FEMA began publishing damage assessments in 2007 and calculating damage-to-wealth ratios in 2019, presidents have approved requests for individual assistance every time the ratio exceeded 12.5—until now. Trump denied Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s requests even though late-July and mid-August storms in the Chicago metro area yielded respective damage-to-wealth ratios of 39 and 71 (the latter being an all-time high). The denial letters, which state that aid “is not warranted,” came two weeks after Trump said that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “should be in jail.” Both are Democrats who have criticized and resisted Trump’s efforts to terrorize immigrants. Pritzker appealed both rejections on November 21.

There is certainly reason to worry about Trump transforming post-disaster relief into a political weapon. But it’s also worth noting that he has spurned Republican-controlled states on multiple occasions, too. That includes Tennessee and Arkansas, whose governor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, is a major Trump ally. So while recent rejections could herald a ramping up of politicized aid denials, we shouldn’t lose sight of Trump’s broader abdication of the federal government’s disaster-related responsibilities, which has also hurt red states and counties (which exist in blue states, too).

Disaster recovery is a long-term process, so FEMA’s obligations extend beyond providing immediate relief to individual victims. Historically, state and local governments have fronted money for disaster recovery. Then, after submitting receipts and invoices to FEMA, they get repaid through the public assistance program, often for several years, as rebuilding takes time. In addition to denying several new requests for public assistance, Trump has stalled the outlay of money meant to compensate jurisdictions for past recovery spending. As the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has explained, this is endangering the budgets of cash-strapped localities as they attempt to bounce back from earlier disasters.

On April 12, then-acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton sent a memo to an Office of Management and Budget official outlining ways to reduce the federal government’s financial contributions to disaster-torn communities. The memo called for quadrupling the damage threshold a state would need to meet to qualify for public assistance. It also called for strictly limiting the federal cost share for disaster recovery to 75 percent. Under current guidelines, the federal government covers at least 75 percent of costs, though it will temporarily reimburse states up to 100 percent in certain cases.

After Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina in 2024, for instance, the Biden administration agreed to cover 100 percent of the costs of debris removal and some other forms of assistance. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein (D) asked the Trump administration to extend this arrangement for an additional six months. But on April 11, one day before his memo was published, Hamilton denied Stein’s request. In an appeal letter, Stein explained how much even a three-month extension would help, but the Trump administration rejected his request in May. The decision will cost North Carolina hundreds of millions of dollars and derail the recovery process.

By the time North Carolina’s appeal was rejected, Hamilton had been fired—one day after telling members of Congress that FEMA should not be abolished. (Noem reportedly had been planning to oust Hamilton for some time before that for not moving aggressively enough to dismantle the agency.) This is ironic given the extent to which the policies promoted by Hamilton—including in his April 12 memo as well as a March 25 memo titled “Abolishing FEMA”—would undermine the country’s disaster response system in practice. An Urban Institute analysis estimated that if the provisions in Hamilton’s April 12 memo had been in place, 71 percent of major disasters declared from 2008 to 2024 would not have qualified for public assistance, and state and local governments would have lost out on $41 billion in aid.

Although the FEMA Review Council recommended maintaining the current cost share arrangements, Noem is reportedly seeking to reduce the federal cost share to 50 percent. That would prevent tens of billions of dollars from reaching disaster-stricken cities and towns in desperate need of federal resources, ultimately making full recoveries impossible.

Killing Disaster Mitigation

In addition to raising the public assistance threshold, Hamilton’s April 12 memo also advocated for halting the automatic approval of hazard mitigation grants when issuing major disaster declarations. When governors ask the president for a major disaster declaration, they typically request hazard mitigation funding—which enables statewide investments to prevent the occurrence and diminish the impacts of future disasters—along with individual and public assistance.

Historically, those requests have been rubber-stamped as part of a disaster declaration. However, after greenlighting three requests for hazard mitigation grants early in his term, Trump has not approved a request for such funding since March. On April 4, Trump approved Virginia’s request for a major disaster declaration but chose not to include hazard mitigation money as part of the federal aid package. According to E&E News, that marked the first time on record that a president excluded hazard mitigation funding when declaring a major disaster. Trump has gone on to repeat this pattern.

Trump’s ongoing suspension of the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program is just one example of how his administration has stymied risk reduction and climate adaptation. In February, the Trump administration ordered FEMA to cease work related to improving building codes. FEMA also announced that it would stop enforcing a standard requiring public buildings damaged in flood zones to be rebuilt in a way that averts future flood damage to qualify for federal funding.

On April 4, the Trump administration took down a notice announcing $600 million in Flood Mitigation Assistance funding for 2025. It also canceled FEMA’s flagship Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program and clawed back more than $3 billion for projects that had been authorized but not started. In mid-July, 20 states sued the White House for axing this initiative, which aims to proactively buttress neighborhoods before wildfires and storms arrive. Litigation is ongoing.

Most of the aforementioned attacks came after Noem ordered FEMA to halt work related to climate change and to eradicate the use of climate-related terms, citing executive orders issued by Trump. That the White House is cutting risk reduction programs now—as billion-dollar disasters increase in frequency and the average length of time between such events decreases, from 82 days in the 1980s to 19 days over the past decade—is yet another example of the economic madness of climate denialism.

Indeed, investing to prepare for severe weather actually saves money—an estimated $6 to $13 for every $1 invested—as well as lives. It is much cheaper to build a stronger house than rebuild an entirely new one after it blows down.

Looking Ahead

It’s difficult to overstate how much harm Trump’s assault on FEMA has unleashed. On August 25, a few days before the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina’s landfall, more than 180 FEMA workers tried their best to sound the alarm. In an open letter, they warned that the Trump administration’s actions are increasing the odds of a Katrina-scale calamity. The next day, several of the whistleblowers were placed on administrative leave, and FEMA subsequently opened an investigation into the letter’s anonymous signatories. Some of the suspended workers were reinstated on December 1, but that decision was quickly reversed after DHS leaders found out.

In early September, the Government Accountability Office published the first report in a series designed to communicate the growing vulnerability of the country’s disaster response system. In mid-October, current and former FEMA staff issued additional warnings at a rally in front of the agency’s headquarters. Though FEMA’s problems predate Trump, he has exacerbated them, and his administration’s retaliatory streak only exemplifies its recklessness.

On December 1, DHS official Karen Evans, a key player in suppressing disaster-related spending, replaced Richardson as acting FEMA chief. Like both of her predecessors, Evans lacks emergency management experience, a statutory requirement that Trump has circumvented by appointing acting leaders.

Long term, the Trump administration is reportedly considering relocating FEMA’s headquarters to Texas and putting Nim Kidd, leader of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, in charge of the national agency. White House officials interviewed Kidd for the gig in February, but he declined, opting to stay in Texas. Kidd and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) are members of the FEMA Review Council, which is expected to recommend moving the agency’s headquarters to the state.

Even as extreme weather increases in frequency and intensity due to past and present planet-heating emissions, the Trump administration is pulling out all the stops to expand fossil fuel pollution—guaranteeing worse conditions for years to come. Through its crusade against science and forecasting, the administration is blunting our ability to understand and warn people about the fatal reverberations of climate breakdown. The administration’s hostility toward disaster prevention and its abandonment of victims in their moment of greatest need—including ending door-to-door canvassing in disaster zones—are the final nails in the coffin.

Ultimately, whoever ends up leading Trump’s FEMA will be tasked with advancing the president’s war on our collective ability to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters of all kinds. That task, one of the original purposes of government, elicits nothing but contempt from MAGA.

This is worse than negligence. It is among the clearest evidence we have of the Trump administration’s disdain for human life itself.",https://prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RDP-120525.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:03:18.620719

Wealthy coal plant owners – like NRG and Luminant – now have permission to avoid installing readily available, common-sense pollution controls and move forward with spewing more toxic emissions into the air.

Today’s EPA decision withdraws a strong federal rule for Texas, finalized during the Obama Administration, that would have required upgraded or new pollution control equipment to be installed at 15 of Texas’s dirtiest coal units (see list below). In its place, Trump's EPA approved a regional haze plan from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that would require no pollution reductions. EPA also approved a different yet related regional haze plan from the Texas government that would likewise require zero pollution reductions from massive polluters.

Regional haze impairs visibility in natural spaces and national parks. It is produced when large industrial sources, especially coal-burning power plants, emit harmful pollution that mixes with sunlight. The Clean Air Act calls for states to propose their own plans for reducing regional haze, and if those aren’t adequate, EPA is required to implement its own federal plans that comply with the law. In Texas, haze plans from TCEQ – whose commissioners have all been appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott – have consistently been so weak they would do nothing to reduce haze in any meaningful way.

Statement from Emma Pabst, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Manager

“For the last 20 years, Texas and EPA failed to properly implement the Clean Air Act’s requirements to reduce haze pollution in Texas, and today’s decision makes clear that both care little about clear skies on our public lands. Monitoring shows that the majority of haze comes from coal-burning power plants, and TCEQ and EPA have an obligation to reduce emissions from these facilities. But both agencies continue to blatantly disregard public input and show us – again and again – that our skies and our health aren’t important to them, especially when it comes to giving wealthy donors a pass to pollute. Americans are getting sicker, and this Administration is paving the way.”

The following coal plants would have been required to install pollution control equipment under the federal EPA haze plan, but no longer have to due to the Trump EPA withdrawal of the rule (some plants have multiple units):

Martin Lake – Beckville (East Texas), owned by Luminant/Vistra

CONGRESS

Congress lacks consensus on addressing healthcare affordability. With the December 31, 2025, expiration date of the enhanced APTCs quickly approaching, discussions – both partisan and bipartisan – continued on Capitol Hill this week, although agreement on a path forward remains elusive. As part of the agreement to reopen the government last month, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) promised Democrats an APTC floor vote in December. This vote is expected to occur on December 11. On December 4, Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) announced that Democrats will offer a bill on the Senate floor at that time to provide a clean three-year extension of enhanced APTCs. That bill is unlikely to garner much, if any, Republican support. It is still unknown whether Senate Republicans plan to offer an alternative bill.

Partisan differences on APTCs were on display during this week’s Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on healthcare affordability, with Democrats pressing for a straightforward extension of the enhanced APTCs and Republicans split on whether to extend the credits with revisions or focus on other measures to bring down health insurance costs, such as health savings accounts, price transparency efforts, and reforms to promote competition. Some Senate Republicans agreed that, in the short term, APTCs should be extended to avoid immediate harm to families while broader reforms are debated.

House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee examines organ procurement organizations. During the hearing, committee members agreed on the need for systemic reform, including stronger oversight, penalties for violations, and improved data transparency within organ procurement organizations (OPOs). Witnesses emphasized the urgent need for accountability within OPOs to prevent harm to patients and families. Republican committee members focused their questions on accountability and transparency within OPOs, highlighting allegations of fraud, misuse of federal funds, and unethical practices. Democrats on the committee stressed the importance of maintaining health insurance coverage for transplant patients, warning that cuts to Medicaid and failure to extend the enhanced APTCs would leave millions uninsured and jeopardize access to organ transplants.

Senate Aging Committee holds hearing on aging in place and community support. During the hearing, members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for reauthorizing the Older Americans Act and encouraging aging in place by shifting resources from institutions to home- and community-based services. Witnesses spoke to the importance of Older Americans Act programs in supporting older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. Republican committee members expressed support for other solutions to aid caregivers and reduce senior loneliness, such as a multigenerational home caregiver tax credit and partnerships with community-based organizations. Democrats on the committee voiced concern about Medicaid cuts and recent administration actions, such as reductions in force in the Administration for Community Living and US Department of Education, and rulemaking related to travel accessibility and the direct care workforce.

Senate Finance Committee leaders introduce bipartisan pharmacy benefit manager reform legislation. Chair Crapo (R-ID) and Ranking Member Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act in an effort to increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs and lower drug prices for patients. The legislation would delink PBMs’ compensation from their negotiated rebates and increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and HHS. It would also require retail community pharmacies to participate in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost survey to ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies, and would mandate that PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies in order to ensure transparency in drug costs.

ADMINISTRATION

CMS releases MA and Part D proposed rule. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule with policy and technical changes to the MA and Part D programs for 2027 and beyond. Key takeaways include:

Significant star ratings changes. CMS proposes to remove 12 measures from the star ratings beginning with the 2027 measurement year and remove the EHO4all reward (also known as the Health Equity Index) from the 2027 star ratings. CMS would continue applying the existing reward factor, which was scheduled to end with the 2027 ratings.

Codifying Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) provisions. As required by the IRA, CMS proposes to eliminate the coverage gap phase and the annual out-of-pocket threshold, remove cost sharing for enrollees in the catastrophic phase, and implement the manufacturer discount program. While these IRA provisions are already in effect, CMS implemented them using temporary authority and now proposes to codify the provisions in regulation.

Changes to marketing and communications. CMS proposes to reduce restrictions on beneficiary outreach and third-party marketing organizations. CMS notes that if finalized for the 2027 contract year, these changes would take effect on October 1, 2026, when marketing for the 2027 plan year begins.

Special enrollment periods (SEPs). CMS proposes to modify the SEP that allows an enrollee to change plans when a provider they see leaves the network. CMS proposes to eliminate the requirement that the network change be deemed “significant” to trigger the SEP. CMS also proposes to codify existing policy that certain SEPs require prior CMS approval.

Improvements for special needs plans (SNPs). CMS’s proposals focus on passive enrollment, continuity of care, contract modifications, and model of care off-cycle submissions.

Requests for information (RFIs). The rule includes several RFIs on topics such as risk adjustment, stars and quality bonus payments, well-being and nutrition, chronic condition SNPs, marketing oversight and agent and broker regulations, and reducing data collection and reporting burdens.

Comments on the proposed rule are due by January 26, 2026. Read CMS’s fact sheet on the proposed rule here. You can also read our Regs & Eggs blog post on this topic.

CMS announces negotiated prices for 15 drugs selected for Medicare Part D. In a press release, CMS announced the agreed-upon maximum fair prices for 15 drugs selected for the 2027 Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. CMS estimated that about 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used these drugs in 2024 to treat a variety of conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, and that these drugs accounted for about $42.5 billion in total gross covered prescription drug costs under Medicare Part D in 2024, or about 15%. Had these negotiated prices been in effect in 2024, net savings to the Medicare program would have approximately $12 billion, according to CMS.

The 15 Part D-covered drugs selected for 2027 will join the 10 Part D-covered drugs previously selected for negotiation, with those prices going into effect January 1, 2026. A fact sheet detailing the negotiated prices for the 15 selected drugs can be found here.

CMS repeals minimum staffing requirements for long-term care facilities. CMS issued an interim final rule effectively repealing the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting final rule. Released by the Biden administration in 2024, the repealed rule established minimum staffing standards for long-term facilities. These standards would have required a registered nurse (RN) to be onsite 24 hours, seven days per week, and would have required each facility to provide a minimum of 0.55 RN, 2.45 nurse aide (NA), and 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident day, for a specified time period. The 2024 rule has been challenged in court, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act prohibited CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards until September 30, 2034. Thus, the standards have never been enforced.

CMS will reinstate prior regulatory requirements, including the minimum statutory RN staffing requirement for long-term care facilities to use the services of an RN for at least eight consecutive hours a day, seven days a week, and to designate an RN to serve as the director of nursing on a full-time basis except when waived. CMS is accepting comments, but the changes are effective 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register (both the comment due date and the rule’s effective date are estimated to be February 1, 2026).

CMS Innovation Center announces new digital health model. The ACCESS model is a 10-year voluntary model designed to expand access to new technology-supported care options that help Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries improve their health and prevent and manage chronic disease. Examples of technology-supported care that would be covered by this model include medication management, therapy and counseling, and the use or monitoring of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized devices or software.

The ACCESS model will test outcome-aligned payments for care organizations enrolled in Medicare Part B and will include four clinical tracks focused on common chronic conditions:

Early cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Hypertension, dyslipidemia (abnormal or elevated lipids, including cholesterol), obesity or overweight with marker of central obesity, and prediabetes.

Cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Musculoskeletal conditions: Chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Behavioral health conditions: Depression or anxiety.

During a December 4, 2025, live stream event, CMS officials announced that applications are expected to open in January 2026 and close in April 2026, with rolling admissions. The model is scheduled to begin in July 2026 and will run for 10 years. During the same event, FDA and CMS officials announced the TEMPO (Technology-Enabled Meaningful Patient Outcomes for digital health devices) pilot project, an FDA initiative that will help health device manufacturers offer their device inside of the ACCESS model with exemption from the FDA market access process. Applications for the TEMPO pilot are expected to open in early 2026.

The 15 projects approved for entry into the Expedited Resource Addition Study comprise seven natural gas-fired units, three solar plants, three battery energy storage systems, and two wind farms. The projects represent a combined 6.1 GW of proposed new generating capacity, with targeted in-service dates ranging from December 2027 to August 2028, the grid operator said in a statement. ERAS is a temporary process designed to expedite the entry of new power generation into service, addressing near-term resource adequacy and reliability concerns across the MISO footprint, which spans 15 states in the US Midwest and South. The process, which is separate from MISO's standard interconnection queue, allows eligible projects to be studied quarterly and granted expedited generator interconnection agreements within 90 days. The ERAS queue is limited to a total of 68 projects, and no more than 15 will be studied on a first-come, first-served basis. ERAS will sunset at the completion of the 68-project study or Aug. 31, 2027, whichever is earlier. The quarterly study process had been limited to 10 projects before the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved MISO's request to increase the threshold to 15 projects Nov. 25. The first quarterly cycle, which opened Sept. 2, included 10 projects representing roughly 4.7 GW of proposed new capacity, according to an analysis of MISO data. Three of the first 10 projects have executed generator interconnection agreements, and the remaining seven are expected to do so later in December, MISO said. To date, 51 projects totaling nearly 30 GW of proposed new capacity have been accepted or are pending validation into ERAS, MISO said. ""Cycle 2 builds on the momentum of Cycle 1 and reflects the continued demand for timely, reliable interconnection solutions,"" Aubrey Johnson, MISO's vice president for system planning, said in a statement. ""These projects are essential to meeting near-term reliability needs and ensuring new resource additions are online to meet load growth."" PROPOSED NEW PROJECTS The largest of the 15 projects in ERAS Cycle 2 is Invenergy's proposed 1.2 GW simple-cycle gas plant in Calumet County, Wisconsin. The plant has a proposed in-service date of Dec. 1, 2027, and is needed to help address a resource adequacy need of 2.25-2.50 GW for Wisconsin Electric customers located within MISO's Local Resource Zone 2, according to a non-confidential summary that the grid operator published. The largest renewable energy project is the proposed 426-MW Red Butte wind farm in Morton and Oliver counties, North Dakota.

Although some EVs have higher upfront costs, they have lower fuel and maintenance costs, making them more economical in the long run.
Atlas founder Nick Nigro noted that EVs ""continue to offer compelling cost advantages for many drivers,"" even as incentives shift.

Using solar panels to charge EVs can cut charging costs by up to 60%, based on estimates by EnergySage.","Here's another green flag for going electric: four out of five electric vehicles beat their gas-powered counterparts in total cost savings — showing that going electric is kinder to the planet and easier on the wallet.

A cost analysis by Atlas EV Hub showed that it's generally cheaper to own EVs than gas cars. Although some EVs have higher upfront costs, they have lower fuel and maintenance costs, making them more economical in the long run.

Atlas founder Nick Nigro noted that EVs ""continue to offer compelling cost advantages for many drivers,"" even as incentives shift. Of the five comparisons made, four showed EVs winning on cost. The only exception was the electric pickup, which remained slightly more expensive than its gas version over seven years of use.

The analysis also noted that most EVs remain cheaper to own despite the repeal of the federal tax credit, though buyers now see smaller savings than before.

Charging EVs at home rather than using public chargers can further reduce fuel costs, especially overnight when power rates are typically lowest. When drivers plug in their cars while they sleep, they can slash fuel costs by hundreds of dollars per year.

For homeowners ready to set up their own charging station, Qmerit is a good place to start. They offer free estimates on Level 2 chargers customized to specific electrical panels and garage setups.

Home solar can stretch those benefits even further. Using solar panels to charge EVs can cut charging costs by up to 60%, based on estimates by EnergySage. Solar charging for a small EV would only cost $200 to $300 annually — a fraction of what many drivers spend on gas in a single month.

Beyond personal cost savings, going electric can help save the planet. Every mile powered by electricity — instead of gasoline — reduces pollution. Moreover, when EV owners use solar to charge at home, those benefits multiply.

After reviewing multiple studies, the International Council on Clean Transportation found that EVs are significantly cleaner than combustion vehicles. Electric SUVs, for instance, contribute 71% fewer heat-trapping gases than their gas counterparts.

EVs also convert energy more efficiently. EVs can convert up to 91% of stored energy into motion, compared to about 25% for gas-powered vehicles, with the rest lost as heat and mechanical inefficiencies, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

As more data points to lower lifetime costs and improved efficiency, EV adoption continues to expand among drivers who previously remained undecided.

Consumers who want to switch to EVs and maximize cost savings can get started by requesting a free quote from Qmerit and checking out solar solutions in the Solar Explorer — a great place to find reliable providers and TCD's partners who help homeowners save up to $10,000 on solar installation, get solar panels installed at zero upfront costs, and gain more savings through tax credits.

For many households, pairing home charging with solar remains one of the most cost-effective ways to manage long-term vehicle and energy expenses.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/electric-vehiclesimage-recd2xA7Egzha2jfX.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:01:13.165578

Congress lacks consensus on addressing healthcare affordability. Bipartisan talks on the soon-to-expire enhanced advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) are ongoing, and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee held a hearing on healthcare affordability, but no bipartisan agreement has been reached. Senate Democrats are poised to offer a clean three-year enhanced APTC extension bill next week.

House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee examines organ procurement organizations. Committee members and witnesses agreed on the need for greater accountability and reform within organ procurement organizations (OPOs).

Senate Aging Committee holds hearing on aging in place and community support. The hearing highlighted successful programs under the Older Americans Act and explored how strong community networks can support older adults during the holiday season, when isolation peaks.

CONGRESS

Congress lacks consensus on addressing healthcare affordability. With the December 31, 2025, expiration date of the enhanced APTCs quickly approaching, discussions – both partisan and bipartisan – continued on Capitol Hill this week, although agreement on a path forward remains elusive. As part of the agreement to reopen the government last month, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) promised Democrats an APTC floor vote in December. This vote is expected to occur on December 11. On December 4, Senate Minority Leader Schumer (D-NY) announced that Democrats will offer a bill on the Senate floor at that time to provide a clean three-year extension of enhanced APTCs. That bill is unlikely to garner much, if any, Republican support. It is still unknown whether Senate Republicans plan to offer an alternative bill.

Partisan differences on APTCs were on display during this week’s Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee hearing on healthcare affordability, with Democrats pressing for a straightforward extension of the enhanced APTCs and Republicans split on whether to extend the credits with revisions or focus on other measures to bring down health insurance costs, such as health savings accounts, price transparency efforts, and reforms to promote competition. Some Senate Republicans agreed that, in the short term, APTCs should be extended to avoid immediate harm to families while broader reforms are debated.

House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee examines organ procurement organizations. During the hearing, committee members agreed on the need for systemic reform, including stronger oversight, penalties for violations, and improved data transparency within organ procurement organizations (OPOs). Witnesses emphasized the urgent need for accountability within OPOs to prevent harm to patients and families. Republican committee members focused their questions on accountability and transparency within OPOs, highlighting allegations of fraud, misuse of federal funds, and unethical practices. Democrats on the committee stressed the importance of maintaining health insurance coverage for transplant patients, warning that cuts to Medicaid and failure to extend the enhanced APTCs would leave millions uninsured and jeopardize access to organ transplants.

Senate Aging Committee holds hearing on aging in place and community support. During the hearing, members on both sides of the aisle expressed support for reauthorizing the Older Americans Act and encouraging aging in place by shifting resources from institutions to home- and community-based services. Witnesses spoke to the importance of Older Americans Act programs in supporting older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. Republican committee members expressed support for other solutions to aid caregivers and reduce senior loneliness, such as a multigenerational home caregiver tax credit and partnerships with community-based organizations. Democrats on the committee voiced concern about Medicaid cuts and recent administration actions, such as reductions in force in the Administration for Community Living and US Department of Education, and rulemaking related to travel accessibility and the direct care workforce.

Senate Finance Committee leaders introduce bipartisan pharmacy benefit manager reform legislation. Chair Crapo (R-ID) and Ranking Member Wyden (D-OR) introduced the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) Price Transparency and Accountability Act in an effort to increase transparency in federal prescription drug programs and lower drug prices for patients. The legislation would delink PBMs’ compensation from their negotiated rebates and increase PBM reporting requirements to Medicare Part D plan sponsors and HHS. It would also require retail community pharmacies to participate in the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost survey to ensure accurate Medicaid payments to pharmacies, and would mandate that PBMs pass Medicaid payments directly to pharmacies in order to ensure transparency in drug costs.

ADMINISTRATION

CMS releases MA and Part D proposed rule. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a proposed rule with policy and technical changes to the MA and Part D programs for 2027 and beyond. Key takeaways include:

Significant star ratings changes. CMS proposes to remove 12 measures from the star ratings beginning with the 2027 measurement year and remove the EHO4all reward (also known as the Health Equity Index) from the 2027 star ratings. CMS would continue applying the existing reward factor, which was scheduled to end with the 2027 ratings.

Codifying Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) provisions. As required by the IRA, CMS proposes to eliminate the coverage gap phase and the annual out-of-pocket threshold, remove cost sharing for enrollees in the catastrophic phase, and implement the manufacturer discount program. While these IRA provisions are already in effect, CMS implemented them using temporary authority and now proposes to codify the provisions in regulation.

Changes to marketing and communications. CMS proposes to reduce restrictions on beneficiary outreach and third-party marketing organizations. CMS notes that if finalized for the 2027 contract year, these changes would take effect on October 1, 2026, when marketing for the 2027 plan year begins.

Special enrollment periods (SEPs). CMS proposes to modify the SEP that allows an enrollee to change plans when a provider they see leaves the network. CMS proposes to eliminate the requirement that the network change be deemed “significant” to trigger the SEP. CMS also proposes to codify existing policy that certain SEPs require prior CMS approval.

Improvements for special needs plans (SNPs). CMS’s proposals focus on passive enrollment, continuity of care, contract modifications, and model of care off-cycle submissions.

Requests for information (RFIs). The rule includes several RFIs on topics such as risk adjustment, stars and quality bonus payments, well-being and nutrition, chronic condition SNPs, marketing oversight and agent and broker regulations, and reducing data collection and reporting burdens.

Comments on the proposed rule are due by January 26, 2026. Read CMS’s fact sheet on the proposed rule here. You can also read our Regs & Eggs blog post on this topic.

CMS announces negotiated prices for 15 drugs selected for Medicare Part D. In a press release, CMS announced the agreed-upon maximum fair prices for 15 drugs selected for the 2027 Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. CMS estimated that about 5.3 million people with Medicare Part D coverage used these drugs in 2024 to treat a variety of conditions, such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and asthma, and that these drugs accounted for about $42.5 billion in total gross covered prescription drug costs under Medicare Part D in 2024, or about 15%. Had these negotiated prices been in effect in 2024, net savings to the Medicare program would have approximately $12 billion, according to CMS.

The 15 Part D-covered drugs selected for 2027 will join the 10 Part D-covered drugs previously selected for negotiation, with those prices going into effect January 1, 2026. A fact sheet detailing the negotiated prices for the 15 selected drugs can be found here.

CMS repeals minimum staffing requirements for long-term care facilities. CMS issued an interim final rule effectively repealing the Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting final rule. Released by the Biden administration in 2024, the repealed rule established minimum staffing standards for long-term facilities. These standards would have required a registered nurse (RN) to be onsite 24 hours, seven days per week, and would have required each facility to provide a minimum of 0.55 RN, 2.45 nurse aide (NA), and 3.48 total nurse staffing hours per resident day, for a specified time period. The 2024 rule has been challenged in court, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act prohibited CMS from implementing, administering, or enforcing the minimum staffing standards until September 30, 2034. Thus, the standards have never been enforced.

CMS will reinstate prior regulatory requirements, including the minimum statutory RN staffing requirement for long-term care facilities to use the services of an RN for at least eight consecutive hours a day, seven days a week, and to designate an RN to serve as the director of nursing on a full-time basis except when waived. CMS is accepting comments, but the changes are effective 60 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register (both the comment due date and the rule’s effective date are estimated to be February 1, 2026).

CMS Innovation Center announces new digital health model. The ACCESS model is a 10-year voluntary model designed to expand access to new technology-supported care options that help Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries improve their health and prevent and manage chronic disease. Examples of technology-supported care that would be covered by this model include medication management, therapy and counseling, and the use or monitoring of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized devices or software.

The ACCESS model will test outcome-aligned payments for care organizations enrolled in Medicare Part B and will include four clinical tracks focused on common chronic conditions:

Early cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Hypertension, dyslipidemia (abnormal or elevated lipids, including cholesterol), obesity or overweight with marker of central obesity, and prediabetes.

Cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions: Diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Musculoskeletal conditions: Chronic musculoskeletal pain.

Behavioral health conditions: Depression or anxiety.

During a December 4, 2025, live stream event, CMS officials announced that applications are expected to open in January 2026 and close in April 2026, with rolling admissions. The model is scheduled to begin in July 2026 and will run for 10 years. During the same event, FDA and CMS officials announced the TEMPO (Technology-Enabled Meaningful Patient Outcomes for digital health devices) pilot project, an FDA initiative that will help health device manufacturers offer their device inside of the ACCESS model with exemption from the FDA market access process. Applications for the TEMPO pilot are expected to open in early 2026.

FAQs on the ACCESS model can be found here.

HHS unveils AI strategy. HHS announced its AI action plan focused on integrating AI via a “OneHHS” approach in which all HHS divisions will use a collaborative department-wide AI infrastructure. The strategy focuses on five pillars:

Ensure governance and risk management for public trust.

Design infrastructure and platforms for user needs.

Promote workforce development and burden reduction for efficiency.

Foster health research and reproducibility through gold standard science.

Enable care and public health delivery modernization for better outcomes.

QUICK HITS

CMS releases home health final rule. The calendar year (CY) 2026 final rule decreases payments to home health agencies by an estimated 1.3%, or $220 million, compared to CY 2025, significantly below the estimated 6.4% aggregate reduction in the proposed rule. The rule also finalized changes to the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies Competitive Bidding Program. A fact sheet on the final rule can be found here, and a fact sheet on the competitive bidding updates can be found here.

GAO releases report on fraud risks in APTCs. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) report asserts that tens of thousands of Social Security numbers (SSNs) were used to obtain more than one year’s worth of subsidized coverage in a single plan year, with CMS permitting multiple enrollments per SSN to account for potential identity theft or data entry issues. The report identifies vulnerabilities related to unauthorized agent or broker changes and notes that CMS’s outdated fraud-risk assessments limit its ability to effectively manage APTC fraud risks. Read the full report here.

Administration announces pharmaceutical trade agreement with UK. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, the US Department of Commerce, and HHS announced a pharmaceutical trade agreement between the US and the United Kingdom, in which the UK will increase net prices it pays for new drugs by 25%. In return, the US will exempt UK pharmaceutical products from Section 232 tariffs, avoid Section 301 actions on UK drug pricing, and support access to advanced medicines for UK patients.

MedPAC hosts December public meeting. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) agenda included sessions on fee-for-service payment policies, payment adequacy for skilled nursing facility services, hospital inpatient and outpatient services, and outpatient dialysis services, as well as sessions addressing several mandated reports on topics such as the Medicare ground ambulance data collection system and the home health prospective payment system.

### About the National Grocers Association","Unrealistic timelines and excessive compliance costs harm grocery stores and their customers

Washington, D.C. – The National Grocers Association (NGA), the leading trade association for the nation’s independent grocers and wholesalers, today announced it has petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to revise its Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Management Rule because of unrealistic timelines, excessive compliance costs, and regulatory requirements that go beyond what Congress mandated.

NGA’s petition argues that the HFC Management Rule imposes several impractical and overly burdensome requirements on food retailers, including drastically increasing the number of covered refrigeration appliances and setting a leak-rate limit that does not align with real-world systems. NGA also contends that the rule’s repair, testing, and retrofit deadlines are unrealistically short, given national shortages of technicians and parts, and requests more time to comply with automatic leak-detection system mandates.

“Independent grocers are committed to environmental sustainability and responsible refrigerant management,” said Max Wengroff, NGA senior manager of government relations. “But the EPA’s rule places unrealistic obligations on retailers that simply cannot be met under the timelines and thresholds imposed. These unnecessary obligations will raise costs for businesses and families.”

The independent grocery sector accounts for nearly one-third of all U.S. grocery sales, more than $250 billion annually, and over one million jobs. NGA contends that without reasonable rule revisions, the HFC Management Rule will impose costs that many independent grocers simply cannot absorb and will ultimately be passed onto consumers.

With big goals like 500 GW of non-fossil fuel power by 2030 and programs like the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for local solar manufacturing, this isn’t just a side project—it’s key to our economy and security.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) ranks India as the world’s third-largest solar producer, ahead of Japan. We’re aiming for 280 GW from solar alone. But rural areas still struggle with energy access due to money, geography, infrastructure, social issues, and policy gaps. Reliance on old-school fuels like wood and kerosene slows growth.

Since FY21, electricity use has jumped 9 per cent yearly—double the 5 per cent average from before. Coal keeps the grid steady and secures fuel as demand soars, but it causes over 40 per cent of energy-related CO2 emissions. Recent U.S. Energy Information Administration data shows that about 60 percent of our electricity still comes from fossil fuels like coal, gas, and oil. This heavy fossil fuel use harms the environment, from air pollution to climate change.

Yet, India is at a turning point. Our rich homegrown resources—sun, wind, water, and farm waste—meet strong policies, sparking a fast shift to clean energy. This cuts deep carbon emissions while fueling steady growth.

Tapping India’s vast energy treasures

The heart of this change is our huge natural gifts. States like Rajasthan, Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh shine with top solar potential, fueling huge solar farm booms. By late October 2025, solar capacity hit 129.9 GW. India’s total power capacity tops 500 GW, with non-fossil sources (mostly renewables) at about 51 per cent or 256 GW—including 227 GW renewables and 8.8 GW nuclear.

Wind power, a steady player, leads in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra with big onshore projects.

Hydro power is getting a major revival. With 15 GW under construction, total hydro capacity should rise from 42 GW to 67 GW by FY31-32—a 50 per cent+ jump. Biomass adds reliable local power, using over 450 million tonnes of farm waste yearly to boost rural jobs and energy.

To hit these targets, policies now empower everyday people and businesses to make their own clean power. The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana gives big subsidies for rooftop solar, letting homes install panels and sell extra power to the grid. New rules let factories and shops build solar or wind setups—even across states—with low fees. This cuts coal reliance and puts cheap, green control in local hands.

Government cash is pouring in to ditch fossil fuels. The Union Budget 2025-26 ramps up green spending: over ₹26,500 crore for solar (including local making), ₹20,000 crore for green hydrogen and electrolysers, ₹10,000 crore+ for pumped hydro storage, and boosts for small nuclear reactors in private hands. These funds slash import needs and build a fossil-free backbone.

But manufacturing lags behind goals. To reach 500 GW by 2030, we need 40-50 GW added yearly, yet local solar module production is just 18-20 GW annually—far short, forcing imports. Indian firms like Adani and Tata are racing to expand, with PLI schemes adding 48 GW module capacity. This boom eyes the huge demand, creating jobs and cutting foreign buys.

Green energy draws smart money, too. FDI hit $3.4 billion in the first nine months of FY25—up 8 per cent of total inflows—and $23 billion since April 2020. It’s investor-friendly: quick approvals, stable rules, and 100 per cent foreign ownership pull in global giants for solar, wind, and storage.

Tackling roadblocks in the shift

The potential is clear, but hurdles like weather-dependent solar and wind output demand fixes. We need big battery storage (BESS), smart grids, and better weather forecasts to keep power steady.

Non-tech issues bite hard: huge land needs spark fights over farms, wildlife, and locals. Investments need smoother permits, less red tape, and steady rules to lure global cash.

Why this matters: Leading the world

To keep Paris promises, India must split growth from carbon and pollution. Homegrown renewables secure power for our booming population, cut climate risks, and show the global how-to on energy freedom.

Tech, policy, and markets align for a clean energy boom—building a healthier, greener, richer India.

A 5-year plan for rock-solid energy

The next five years flip from just building to smart integration and steady supply. I see renewables topping 250 GW by 2030, leading all new adds for cleaner air and fewer fuel imports.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/12/05/Gurang-Shah.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:02:43.656799

At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Division’s competitive concerns.
When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.
The divestitures resolve the Division’s concerns that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices on consumers reliant on the ERCOT and PJM electricity grids.
Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT.","Note: View proposed settlement here.

The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, together with the Attorney General of Texas, announced today that it will require divestiture of six power plants in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Texas to resolve antitrust concerns arising from Constellation Energy Corporation, Inc.’s $26.6 billion acquisition of Calpine Corporation.

The Antitrust Division filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed acquisition. At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that, if approved by the court, would resolve the Division’s competitive concerns.

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills. When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “This settlement includes a six-plant divestiture to an acquisition that risked harming tens of millions of electricity consumers in the mid-Atlantic and Texas. I am appreciative of the partnership with our co-plaintiff, the State of Texas, to secure relief for consumers.”

As detailed in the complaint, the acquisition would create the largest wholesale power generator in the United States and increase the likelihood that the combined firm would profitably withhold electricity from one or more of its plants. The result would be higher electricity prices for customers in Texas, where the electricity grid is operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and in New Jersey, Delaware, southeastern Pennsylvania, and the eastern shores of Maryland and Virginia, where the electricity grid is operated by PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM).

The divestitures resolve the Division’s concerns that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices on consumers reliant on the ERCOT and PJM electricity grids. Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT. The divested plants are:

Bethlehem Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania;

York Energy Center (York 1 and York 2), a dual-fuel combined cycle plant, located southeast of the city of York, Pennsylvania;

Hay Road Energy Center, a dual-fuel combined cycle plant, located in Wilmington, Delaware;

Edge Moor Energy Center, a simple cycle natural gas plant, located in Wilmington, Delaware;

Jack A. Fusco Energy Center, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located southwest of Houston, Texas; and

Gregory Power Plant, a natural gas combined cycle plant, located northeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.

This is the first settlement consent decree that the Division has filed in an electricity merger in 14 years.

Constellation is a publicly traded Pennsylvania corporation headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. It is one of the largest owners of electric generation assets in the United States. In 2024, the company earned $23.6 billion in revenue. It currently controls more than 20,000 megawatts of generating capacity in PJM and approximately 5,000 megawatts in ERCOT.

Calpine is a privately held Delaware corporation headquartered in Houston, Texas. Calpine is the largest generator of electricity from natural gas and geothermal in the United States. The company controls approximately 9,000 megawatts of generating capacity in ERCOT and 5,000 megawatts in PJM.

As required by the Tunney Act, the proposed settlement, along with a competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any person should submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days following the publication to Patricia Corcoran, Acting Chief, Transportation, Energy & Agriculture Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street NW, Suite 8000, Washington, DC 20530. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the court may enter the final judgment upon finding it is in the public interest.",https://www.justice.gov/themes/custom/usdoj_uswds/images/metatag-image--press-release.png,N,,2025-12-05 15:01:55.313066

,Indiana Environment,2025-12-05 18:54:00+00:00,AgriNews,New Ag Climate Dashboard makes climate resources more accessible for Midwest farmers,AgriNews Staff,,,,,https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/news/science/2025/12/05/new-ag-climate-dashboard-makes-climate-resources-more-accessible-for-midwest-farmers/,"— The Midwestern Regional Climate Center, with support from the United Soybean Board, has launched the Ag Climate Dashboard — a centralized digital hub offering streamlined access to integrated climate and agricultural data and decision-support tools for producers, advisers and researchers in the Midwest.
Designed to support on-farm decision-making, the Ag Climate Dashboard offers up-to-date weather data, National Weather Service forecasts, Climate Prediction Center outlooks, historical records and interactive tools for monitoring crop growth, pest threats, climate anomalies and extreme weather events.
The dashboard also connects users to regional ag climate products and a variety of state-specific resources.

Designed to support on-farm decision-making, the Ag Climate Dashboard offers up-to-date weather data, National Weather Service forecasts, Climate Prediction Center outlooks, historical records and interactive tools for monitoring crop growth, pest threats, climate anomalies and extreme weather events.

The dashboard also connects users to regional ag climate products and a variety of state-specific resources. State-specific pages, such as Indiana’s, link to tools and resources like the Purdue Mesonet and the Indiana State Climate Office.

“We want to provide as much clear, well-organized information to producers and advisers as possible so they can make confident management decisions, whether that’s on their own farms or helping clients,” said Austin Pearson, climatologist at the MRCC and Indiana State Climate Office.

By placing these tools in a single, easy-to-navigate platform, the dashboard allows users to make better-informed decisions and support profitability and yield.

The idea for the dashboard stemmed directly from farmers.

“In 2023, we hosted workshops with farmers and one of the biggest takeaways was that while many ag climate tools exist, they aren’t found in one location,” Pearson said.

The dashboard hosts tools both developed by Purdue University and trusted external sources. For example, MRCC’s Corn Growing Degree Day tool helps track crop progress and predict maturity, while the Pest Forecasting Map from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet alerts farmers to threats like alfalfa weevil.

Within the dashboard, users also have access to the Climate Prediction Center outlooks for temperature and precipitation, interactive maps, crop and disease forecasting, fieldwork planning tools and localized climate summaries — all designed to support timely, informed decision-making throughout the year.

“The forecasting tools help farmers understand what pests — whether weeds, insects or diseases — could be an issue and when management is crucial,” Pearson said. “I encourage users to get into the dashboard and explore, as new tools are frequently added.”

Users can also consult climatologies through the platform to gain insights into historical weather patterns that may influence marketing and management strategies.

Beth Hall, director of the MRCC and Indiana State Climate Office, emphasized the broader vision of the project.

“We’re discovering that individual states provide tools that are limited geographically,” she said. “While searching for information, we found that there are missing tools — those that cover the full soybean production region.

“This inspires us to keep growing the dashboard to create a dynamic system that’s helpful for both a small geographic area and the whole region.”

Future enhancements will be guided by feedback from farmers and advisers. One requested addition is an irrigation planning tool, as several farmers are seeking region-specific guidance on how much water to apply to minimize waste.

While isolated tools like this exist, they often lack the geographic specificity needed for practical field use.

Looking ahead, the MRCC plans to incorporate more interactive, user-friendly features, such as location-based maps that respond to ZIP code input, providing a customized experience for each user.

“This is just round one of the dashboard,” Hall said. “We really wanted to provide people a taste and hopefully get them excited about the future. I envision more and more of our tools offering a greater user experience.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/Asn4ZHIidvmnmgsZ_YRsmKN1T_U=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/AKLRR6XHF5GOJGLHRLFB276GO4.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:02:22.608652

Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion.","President Trump has made increasingly sweeping claims about new investments flowing into the United States, citing figures as high as $21 trillion since taking office.

""Twenty-one trillion dollars will be the amount invested in the United States — or committed to invest — in one year,"" the president said in a November meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

In an Oval Office event this Wednesday, President Trump said, ""In 10 months, we have $18 trillion being invested.""

But a CBS News review found no evidence that total commitments or new investments approach the scale the president has cited. While companies and foreign governments have announced large-scale projects since Mr. Trump's inauguration, the White House has not provided documentation showing total investments approaching $21 trillion — an amount roughly two-thirds of the annual GDP.

The administration's own list of major investments ""made possible by President Trump's leadership"" totaled $9.6 trillion as of the latest update in November, but even that figure is exaggerated. It includes some investments announced under President Biden and trade goals that the U.S. is also partially responsible for.

The White House did not directly respond to CBS News' questions about these inclusions or the discrepancies between the administration's total and the much higher figures the president has claimed in his remarks.

""President Trump's dealmaking has secured trillions in investments to make and hire in America, trillions in commercial opportunities for American companies, and trillions in new export opportunities,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.

Federal data shows corporate investment levels are roughly in line with last year, with companies on track to invest over $5 trillion in 2025. The $20 trillion surge Mr. Trump has claimed does not appear in the available data.

Here's a closer look at some of the investment claims.

Trump claims credit for some corporate investments announced under Biden

The White House list includes more than 100 corporate commitments totaling over $3 trillion. Yet some of the largest were originally unveiled years before Mr. Trump took office and were backed by federal funding under President Biden's administration.

The administration lists a $200 billion investment by Micron Technology in semiconductor manufacturing and research. However, a company spokesman confirmed $120 billion of that was previously announced in 2022 and supported by $6 billion in funding from Biden's Chips and Science Act.

Similarly, the White House attributes a $16 billion GlobalFoundries investment in U.S. chip production to Mr. Trump. However, only $3 billion is newly promised this year. A company spokesperson said the remaining $13 billion was originally announced under Biden and backed by tax credits from the Chips and Science Act.

The Trump administration also claims credit for some major clean-energy manufacturing investments, even though its own policies have undercut projects in the sector, said Tom Taylor, a senior policy analyst at Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S.

The administration cited Invenergy's $1.7 billion commitment to a clean-energy transmission project announced in May. However, in July, the U.S. Department of Energy canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee to Invenergy that had been issued under Biden. A spokesman for Invenergy said the company is continuing its transmission project, but did not respond to a CBS News inquiry about whether the loan cancellation impacted the scale of its investment.

""The administration has kind of been on a tear this year about canceling clean energy projects,"" Taylor said. His research shows the administration's funding cuts and policy shifts have halted over $20.8 billion in clean manufacturing investments this year.

The White House list also contains apparent errors, including a $3 billion pledge by Kraft Heinz that appears twice. The administration has not responded to a CBS News request for clarification.

Foreign trade goals and aspirational pledges inflate totals

Foreign governments account for nearly $6 trillion on the White House's list, but several of the largest entries are trade targets — not investments in the U.S.

For example, in a joint announcement, the U.S. and Qatar committed to ""generate an economic exchange worth at least $1.2 trillion,"" without specifying what portion Qatar would spend or when. The figure is also more than five times the gross domestic product of Qatar in 2024.

Similarly, India and the U.S. agreed to ""more than double total bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030"" — a trade target, not a singular investment commitment.

Some foreign investment pledges touted by Mr. Trump also appear aspirational to some economists.

Saudi Arabia promised to invest roughly $1 trillion in the U.S. during the crown prince's visit to the White House in November. But economists, including Maya Senussi at the Wall Street advisory firm Oxford Economics, have questioned whether the oil-rich country could afford an investment that size with global energy prices declining.

History also offers reason for skepticism: Mr. Trump touted in 2017 that Saudi Arabia had agreed to buy $400 billion in U.S. goods, but exports of American goods and services amounted to less than one-fourth of that total over his first term, according to analysis by the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.

Current U.S. investment levels remain typical

Federal data suggests that real investment spending — as opposed to announced commitments — remains roughly in line with last year's levels.

Within the U.S., gross private domestic investment, the broadest measure of what U.S. companies are spending to expand their businesses, is projected to total about $5.4 trillion this year, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, or BEA. That's up roughly $100 billion from the same point last year, but far below the multitrillion-dollar surge Mr. Trump has mentioned.

""Trump may be talking about commitments that have yet to happen. But on actual investment spending — so new equipment, buildings and machinery — 2025 is similar to 2024,"" Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University, told CBS News in an email.

Some research suggests that foreign corporations have sharply increased the number of spending pledges under Mr. Trump. They've promised to invest over $270 billion from January to October, more than double the volume announced under Biden in the same period, according to fDi intelligence, which is part of the Financial Times.

But experts say announcements do not always translate into realized investment.

New foreign direct investment — the actual amount that foreign companies put into U.S. subsidiaries and projects — also remains steady. Foreign companies made roughly $145 billion worth of new investment in the U.S. in the first half of the year, nearly identical to the $144 billion invested in the same time period last year, BEA data shows.

Analysts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an independent think tank, estimate foreign investments will come in under $400 billion this year, well below record levels.

""He's got a lot more in terms of announcements and promises than any prior president. But how much does that really mean in terms of money coming in?"" said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/30/5f08e8f8-5ada-4c92-8352-18c93f085404/thumbnail/1200x630/24660cad72b09f8efda1c2a38381be95/gettyimages-2247836355.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:01:46.674717

Central to this agenda is the growing urgency around AI-driven electricity demand — a priority already underscored by the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) chair and DOE’s issuance of a loan guarantee for the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. The administration’s rebuild of the domestic capacity in critical minerals continues with additional award announcements. At the same time, bipartisan momentum on permitting reform has reemerged, signaling potential shifts in how energy and infrastructure projects move forward.

This month’s newsletter examines these developments in detail and considers their implications for market players, state and local leaders, and companies navigating the federal energy policy landscape.

DOE Announces Major Realignment

On November 20, DOE unveiled a sweeping internal restructuring that will sunset several clean-energy offices while establishing new divisions dedicated to artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and fusion energy. The changes come as the Trump administration prioritizes expanded nuclear and fossil-fuel generation to counter rising utility bills and sharpen US competitiveness in AI.

The new organization chart removes references to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), Grid Deployment Office (GDO), Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP), Office of Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), and Office of the Ombudsman.

DOE instead would create several new offices that align with the Trump administration’s energy priorities. The new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI) will combine EERE, MESC, FEMP, and SCEP. The new office will also assume certain functions of GDO and OCED, as those offices are scheduled to be closed by the administration. The Office of Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy would combine the Geothermal Office, previously part of EERE, with FECM. A new Office of Fusion would be created outside of the Office of Science, a step that many early-stage fusion companies had been calling for. The org chart also shows the new Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), previously the Loan Programs Office (LPO), as announced last month.

While every new administration has implemented some level of reorganization, the changes announced by DOE potentially disregard previous Congressional authorization language, which could be problematic. The changes may take time to fully implement and could be subject to revision based on discussions with authorizing committees. Currently, the DOE website does not seem to reflect the new organizational names and structures. One interesting feature of the proposed organizational structure is that CMEI reports directly to the DOE Secretary, in contrast to EERE, which reported through an Under Secretary.

Energy Security a Key Priority Across the Administration

Energy security, and specifically electrical supply, continues to be a topic receiving strong emphasis across the federal government.

FERC Refocuses on AI-Driven Power Demand

At her first monthly open meeting, FERC Chair Laura Swett announced that the commission will prioritize rapid interconnection and power delivery for AI data centers. Calling this a “critical juncture” for US energy dominance, she stressed that keeping American data on US soil is essential to national and economic security.

Senate Natural Resources Committee chair and ranking member Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) sent a letter expressing their support for FERC to accelerate data-center grid connections, reflecting new bipartisan concern over energy constraints tied to AI deployment.

DOE Seeks Input on Gas Turbines Supply

Already, DOE’s new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office issued a request for information seeking input on “how to ensure timely supply of gas turbines and relieve constraints in the supply chain” amid a supply crunch for the power generation equipment. The request seeks input concerning manufacturing technology limitations, workforce constraints, component challenges from sub-suppliers, and obstacles for materials, such as raw materials, critical minerals, or rare-earth elements. Responses are due by January 30, 2026.

Winter Reliability Assessment Shows Grid Concerns

The 2025 Winter Reliability Assessment released by the National Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in November warns that sharply rising electricity demand — driven by electrification, population growth, and surging data-center development — is outpacing the growth of dependable winter resources across much of North America. While all regions retain adequate capacity for normal winter conditions, the report emphasizes that several areas face heightened risks under extreme cold, particularly where natural gas deliverability, thermal generator retirements, and the limited winter contribution of solar and wind constrain system flexibility. Compared to last year, the 2025 assessment identifies a broader and more acute set of risks, including in New England, the Maritimes, SERC East and Central, ERCOT, and parts of the Western Interconnection, where dependence on imports or batteries may be stressed by prolonged cold snaps. NERC notes improvements in generator weatherization and gas-electric coordination since Winter Storms Uri and Elliott, but underscores that fuel security, battery state-of-charge management, and the changing peak-load shape created by year-round data-center demand remain priority challenges for operators heading into the winter season.

EDF Loan for Nuclear

DOE’s Loan Programs Office, through the Energy Dominance Financing Program established under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, finalized a $1 billion loan to restart Pennsylvania’s shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant and provide power to Microsoft data centers. The loan to Constellation Energy Generation would help finance the Crane Clean Energy Center, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor at the plant, formerly known as Three Mile Island, located in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania. The move reinforces the administration’s push to lean on nuclear power to meet surging electricity demand and ease pressure on household budgets.

House Natural Resources Advances Permitting Reform

On November 18, the House Natural Resources Committee approved Chair Bruce Westerman’s (R-AR) SPEED Act, a bipartisan permitting overhaul intended to shorten environmental reviews and limit legal challenges for new energy and infrastructure projects.

The SPEED Act would limit the scope of environmental reviews, saying the law requires agencies to consider only the direct impacts of a project rather than its broader effects. The bill would also build on National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) reforms included as part of the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act that established a two-year limit on conducting Environmental Impact Statements and a one-year limit for environmental assessments.

It would also preclude agencies from evaluating impacts outside the immediate causal result of the proposed action, in an attempt to eliminate any consideration of upstream or downstream consequences of a project. And it would narrow the definition of “major federal action,” which is the condition for triggering the NEPA process, by specifying that the allocation of federal funds, loans, or loan guarantees are not sufficient actions on their own to trigger NEPA.

The SPEED Act would also impose limitations on judicial challenges against projects, requiring litigants to sue within 150 days, in a bid to make it more difficult for environmentalists to sue to stop them, and establish a 180-day deadline for courts to issue judgment on suits. The current statute of limitations is six years. It would only allow parties who provided substantive comments during the public review period the opportunity to issue a legal challenge and it would limit a court’s ability to remand an agency decision, specifying that the agency decision will hold while it corrects errors or deficiencies.

In passing the bill, the House Natural Resources Committee also adopted a bipartisan amendment, negotiated with Democrats and introduced by Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) and Rep. Pete Stauber (R-MN), to prevent a federal agency from revoking, suspending, altering, or otherwise interfering with an approved permit except in certain circumstances, such as a court order or if the action “is necessary to prevent specific, immediate, substantial, and proximate harm.” Chair Westerman said he hopes the amendment will “provide certainty that can get many more people on board to support” the SPEED Act, framing it as a response to concerns about the Trump administration’s revocation of permits for wind and solar projects. Several committee Democrats said they backed the amendment but are pushing for stronger language to rework all solar and wind projects needing personal approval from Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.

Chair Westerman is reportedly targeting a House floor vote on the SPEED Act before the end of the year.

New Rare Earth Investments

The US Export-Import Bank (EXIM) approved a $27 million direct loan to 6K Additive LLC to expand advanced-materials production in Pennsylvania, including the construction of four new buildings and the acquisition of advanced equipment to refine titanium, nickel, and alloy powders. The project is the latest approval under EXIM’s Make More in America Initiative, designed to revitalize US manufacturing and secure critical supply chains; it is also the first deal in history conducted in coordination with the US Department of War’s Defense Production Act (DPA) Title III program.

The CHIPS Program Office signed a preliminary letter of intent to provide $50 million in CHIPS Act incentives to Vulcan Elements to acquire equipment for domestic neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet production. The Department of Commerce will receive $50 million equity in the company. Vulcan plans to produce up to 10,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnet material in the coming years, significantly strengthening US rare-earth magnet supply chains.

Energy Bills Advance

Also on November 20, the House passed two bipartisan bills aimed at unlocking domestic liquified natural gas (LNG):

R. 3109, the REFINER Act (Rep. Bob Latta, R-OH) — Requires the National Petroleum Council to collect and examine critical information regarding the role of petrochemical refineries in the United States, analyzing opportunities to expand capacity against current risks or negative implications.

R.1949, the Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act (Rep. August Pfluger, R-TX) — Amends the Natural Gas Act to repeal all restrictions on the import and export of natural gas. Also gives FERC the exclusive authority to approve or deny any application for the siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a facility to export natural gas from the United States to a foreign country or import natural gas from a foreign country.

Meanwhile, on November 19, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy advanced multiple bills to the full Committee related to energy efficiency.

R. 4626, Don’t Mess with My Home Appliance Act (Rep. Rick Allen, R-GA) — Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from prescribing any new or amended energy conservation standard for a product that is “not technologically feasible and economically justified.”

R. 3699, Energy Choice Act (Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-NY) — Prohibits state and local governments from restricting energy connections based on fuel type.

R. 5184, Affordable HOMES Act (Rep. Erin Houchin, R-IN) — Prohibits the Secretary of Energy from enforcing energy efficiency standards applicable to manufactured housing.

R. 4758, Homeowner Energy Freedom Act (Rep. Craig Goldman, R-TX) — Repeals Inflation Reduction Act subsidies for home electrification.

R. 4690, Reliable Federal Infrastructure Act (Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-NY) —Repeals certain federal building energy efficiency performance standards.

R. 4593, SHOWER Act (Rep. Russell Fry, R-SC) — Revises the federal definition of a showerhead.

R. 1355, Weatherization Enhancement and Readiness Act of 2025 (Rep. Paul Tonko, D-NY) — Reauthorizes DOE’s Weatherization Assistance Program through 2030.

R. 3474, Federal Mechanical Insulation Act (Rep. Randy Weber, R-TX) — Clarifies that mechanical insulation qualifies as an energy-efficiency measure in federal buildings.

EPA Endangerment Finding Repeal Slips to 2026

Although EPA signaled in September that it planned to finalize its repeal of the 2009 endangerment finding by the end of 2025, multiple industry and former agency officials now anticipate a January 2026 release. The repeal is central to the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda, eliminating the foundation underpinning Clean Air Act climate rules. Back in May, ML Strategies wrote about the potential fallout if the endangerment finding is rescinded.

The Energy Capital of the World Needs the Coastal Texas Project

Senator John Cornyn

The Houston Chronicle

December 5, 2025

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/cornyn-energy-capital-world-needs-coastal-texas-21221940.php

It’s well-known that Houston is the Energy Capital of the World — home to a vast and dense concentration of refineries, petrochemical plants, and energy infrastructure stretching along the Houston Ship Channel. This industrial corridor is critical to producing and transporting the fuels, chemicals, and materials that power our nation and support economies across the globe. But with so much essential infrastructure concentrated in a single region, we must confront a sobering truth: The Bayou City is just one major hurricane away from a potential energy and ecological crisis.

A direct hit from a powerful storm — particularly one pushing a significant storm surge up Galveston Bay and into the Ship Channel — could not only disrupt national and global energy supplies, but also trigger an ecological disaster. Floodwaters from such a surge could damage industrial facilities and overwhelm containment systems, releasing an unimaginable cascade of hazardous materials into the surrounding environment, threatening both public health and fragile ecosystems. This dual risk underscores the urgent need to accelerate resilience planning, environmental safeguards, and infrastructure protection before the next storm arrives.

A report from the Severe Storm Prediction, Education and Evacuation from Disasters, or SSPEED, Center at Rice University concluded that a Category 4 or 5 hurricane could result in a severe storm surge slamming into petrochemical facilities and thousands of above ground tanks that dot the Houston area, wiping out billions of dollars of refineries and more. This would be devastating to Houston’s energy production and would send the price of gasoline soaring nationwide.

The Houston-Galveston region has long been susceptible to hurricanes, but recent storms still loom large for Southeast Texans: Hurricane Ike in 2008, Harvey in 2017, and Beryl last year. This reality is something that Texans accept, but there is a way we can make these storms less devastating.

The good news is that we are already taking steps to protect coastal Texas from the storms of tomorrow through the creation of what is referred to as the Coastal Texas Project, often referred to as the Ike Dike. While progress on this takes time, funding, and multiple acts of Congress, we know that Texas families, the U.S. energy industry, and the entire globe will reap lasting rewards. Building a coastal storm barrier to protect at-risk petrochemical infrastructure and the Texas Gulf Coast is urgent not just for Houston and its residents, but for our entire nation and all who source their energy from the free world.

This is an ambitious project, but we are already on the path toward protecting Texas communities from the whims of Mother Nature. I successfully fought to fund for the Coastal Texas Study, a critical first step in identifying the scope of the project. Three years ago, I helped secure congressional authorization of the project through the Water Resources and Development Act, or WRDA. The only remaining hurdle before construction begins is funding.

The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that the Coastal Texas Project would require up to $34.4 billion to build, and once funded, the construction could take up to two decades. I secured some of the initial funding in the Army Corps of Engineers 2024 Work Plan, and the State of Texas has already allocated $950 million.

However, there is much more to be done.

Due to the sheer scale of the project, it will take years of consistent funding from Congress to fully pay for the storm barrier. The project will have to compete with others for resources during the appropriations process. I was pleased that my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives secured an additional $5 million, and I have secured language in the Senate’s Energy & Water Development appropriations bill that encourages the Army Corps to prioritize funding of the coastal storm barrier. While this may feel like a drop in the bucket, it is an important step toward securing our energy supply.

This will require a whole of government effort from Texas’ congressional delegation. I’m proud to lead the charge, and I’d encourage you to reach out to your congressional representatives and urge them to join this fight. There are naysayers who think this is impossible, but here’s my message to them: Since when did Texas quit when the going got tough? The repercussions of failing to bring the Coastal Texas Project to the finish would be costly both financially and in loss of precious Texans’ lives.

This storm barrier system is imperative, not just for Houston and the surrounding areas, but for our entire country and all who rely on American energy. Fortifying the Energy Capital of the World will come at a price, but we cannot afford to fail.",https://www.cornyn.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Twitter-Card-Dec-23-1024x535.png,N,,2025-12-05 15:02:17.264896

And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.
This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case.","DETROIT(AP) — President Donald Trump this week announced plans to weaken rules for how far automakers' new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, set under former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration said the rules, known formally as Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, are why new vehicles are too expensive, and that cutting them will drive down costs and make driving safer for Americans.

The new standards would drop the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles to roughly 34.5 mpg (55.5 kpg) in the 2031 model year, down from the goal of about 50.4 mpg (81.1 kpg) that year under the Biden-era rule.

Here are the facts.

Affordability

TRUMP: EV-friendly policies “forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse.”

THE FACTS: It's true that gas mileage standards have played a role in rising vehicle prices in recent years, but experts say plenty of other factors have contributed, and some much more.

Pandemic-era inventory shortages, supply chain challenges, tariffs and other trade dynamics, and even automakers' growing investments in their businesses have also sent prices soaring. Average prices have also skewed higher as automakers have leaned into the costly big pickups and SUVs that many American consumers love.

The average transaction price of a new vehicle hit $49,105 in October, according to car shopping guide Edmunds.

A Consumer Reports analysis of vehicles for model years 2003 to 2021 — a period in which average fuel economy improved 30% — found no significant increase in inflation-adjusted vehicle prices caused by the requirements. At the same time, it found an average of $7,000 in lifetime fuel savings per vehicle for 2021 model year vehicles compared with 2003. That analysis, done primarily before the coronavirus pandemic, attributed much of the average sticker price increase to the shift toward bigger and more expensive vehicles.

Cutting the fuel economy standards is unlikely to provide any fast relief on sticker prices, said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds' head of insights. And while looser standards may eventually mean lower car prices, their lower efficiency means that those savings could be eaten up by higher fuel costs, she said.

Ending the gas car?

TRUMP: Biden’s policies were “a quest to end the gasoline-powered car.”

THE FACTS: The Biden administration did enact several policies to increase electric vehicle adoption, including setting a target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030.

The Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act included tax incentives that gave car buyers up to $7,500 off the price of an EV and dedicated billions of dollars to nationwide charging — funding that Trump tried to stop. The Biden administration increased fuel economy requirements and set stricter tailpipe emissions limits.

While those moves sought to help build the EV market, there was no requirement that automakers sell EVs or consumers buy them. And gasoline cars still make up the vast majority of the U.S. market.

EV charging

TRUMP: “We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them.”

THE FACTS: While many potential EV buyers still worry about charging them, the availability of public charging has significantly improved in recent years.

Biden-era funding and private investment have increased charging across the nation. There are now more than 232,000 individual Level 2 and fast charging ports in the U.S. As of this year, enough fast charging ports have been installed to average one for every mile (1.6 kilometers) of National Highway System roads in the U.S., according to an AP analysis of data from the Department of Energy.

However, those fast charging stations aren’t evenly dispersed. Many are concentrated in the far West and the Northeast, where sales of EVs are highest.

Experts note that most EV charging can be done at home.

Safety

TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY SEAN DUFFY: The reduced requirements will make drivers “safer on the roads because of all the great new technology we have that save lives.”

THE FACTS: Newer vehicles — gas and electric — are full of advanced safety features, including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping, collision warnings and more.

Duffy suggested that consumers will be more likely to buy new vehicles if they are more affordable — meaning fewer old cars on the streets without the safety technology. This assumes vehicle prices will actually go down with eased requirements, which experts say might not be the case. Besides, high tech adds to a vehicle's cost.

“If Americans purchased more new vehicles equipped with the latest safety technologies, we would expect overall on-road safety to improve,” Edmunds' Caldwell said. “However, it’s unclear whether easing fuel-economy standards will meaningfully increase new-vehicle sales.”

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent automotive research nonprofit, also says electric or hybrid vehicles are as safe as or safer than gasoline-powered cars.

Another part of safety is public health. Efficiency requirements put into place to address the 1970s oil crisis were also a way to reduce pollution that is harmful to humans and the environment.

“This rollback would move the auto industry backwards, keeping polluting cars on our roads for years to come and threatening the health of millions of Americans,” said Katherine García, director of the Sierra Club's Clean Transportation for All campaign. “This dangerous proposal adds to the long list of ways the Trump administration is dismantling our clean air and public health protections.”

Meet our newest Net-Zero Hero, Colleen Dieter! With more than two decades of experience helping Austinites understand our region’s unique climate, Colleen has dedicated her career to making gardening accessible and joyful. As a landscape consultant, certified arborist, and founder of Central Texas Seed Savers, she’s taken her passion for local, seasonal, and sustainable gardening and turned it into a resource for gardeners of all levels through her consulting work and growing ATXGardens podcast. By sharing practical, Austin-specific guidance on everything from tree care to vegetable planting timelines, Colleen is empowering residents to grow healthier landscapes and support local ecosystems.

What inspired you to take action?

There’s not much information available to gardeners about when to plant or trim plants in Austin. Gardening is very confusing here, and most gardening information applies to other parts of the world. Our climate is unlike any other on Earth, and the proper timing of gardening tasks is puzzling. Throughout my career, I found gardeners were asking me the same questions repeatedly, and I saw folks making the same mistakes — like planting at the wrong time of year, and trimming at the wrong times. These mistakes were leading folks to give up on gardening and say, “I have a brown thumb,” or “I kill everything.” With just a few key bits of information, they could be awesome gardeners. I started wondering how I could reach a larger audience and have a bigger impact.

Top to bottom: Colleen stands, smiling, in her client’s front yard that she designed; Colleen points out the different types of plants in the yard.

How did you do it?

Lots of practice! I have over 20 years of experience helping Central Texans with their yards as a landscape consultant at ATXGardens. I am also a certified arborist, sustainable landscape designer, and founder of Central Texas Seed Savers. You may have seen me on PBS Austin’s Central Texas Gardener, KXAN’s Weekend Gardener, or Spectrum News’ Garden Journeys, or heard me on The Horticulturati podcast and KLBJ’s Horticulture Hangover. I am passionate about making gardening approachable. I needed a steady outlet for specific how-to information for local gardeners. Podcasts are low-cost and easy to DIY compared to other types of media, so I borrowed a microphone from a friend and got started recording on Zoom. I was connected to a podcast manager through a friend. She walked me through the steps to get started, and I hired her to edit my show.

Left to right: Colleen smiles, holding seeds she picked from the front yard; Colleen stops to smell the flowers.

What’s been most rewarding about getting involved in this way?

It’s rewarding to get the information about all kinds of plants — vegetables, fruit trees, native plants, and more — on one platform. Often, gardening information is too esoteric for an average gardener, with experts on one type of plant, drilling down into intense details that don’t really apply to hobby growers. I combined the gardening information with updates from the gardening community about upcoming events, like seed swaps. There’s a strong need for Austin-specific gardening information, and I am happy to be filling that gap. It feels sort of old-fashioned and quaint — like a farmer’s almanac combined with a community calendar — but on a high-tech platform.

Left to right: Colleen reaches up to pick a few seed pods from a catalpa tree; Seeds picked from the catalpa tree.

What’s been the toughest part?

Just getting started from scratch and figuring it out as I go along. I didn’t have any great examples to follow for creating a local, calendar-based gardening podcast, so I am making notes on what works and what doesn’t as I go, always wanting to grow and improve.

Top to bottom: “Before” photo of Colleen’s client’s front yard; “After” photo of Colleen’s client’s front yard.

How do you see gardening and landscape design playing a role in Austin’s larger sustainability and climate resilience goals?

I believe that gardening is key to solving global, local, and personal problems. I want to empower more Austinites to start gardening and help them succeed. Trees and plants are crucial to fighting climate change because they pull carbon out of the atmosphere and use it to make their body parts. They breathe out oxygen that we need to survive. They also have relationships with soil microbes that store even more carbon in the soil.

Left to right: Colleen at a Central Texas Seed Savers tabling event; Colleen smiles with Austin Public Library’s seed collection that she started.

Native trees and plants are crucial for preventing mass extinction because they provide food and shelter for insects that are food for larger animals. These same plants also support pollinators that we need to produce our own food. Speaking of food, I also believe it’s important for Austin gardeners to produce more of our own food locally, rather than bring food in from out of state. Importing food into Texas requires more energy for shipping and refrigeration, which contributes to climate change. The key to growing fruits and vegetables in Austin is knowing the right time to plant, so I am sharing that information on my podcast. Trees and plants prevent flash flooding, erosion, and filter pollution out of our air and water.

Top to bottom: Colleen walking in her client’s side yard; Colleen pointing out one of the flowers in the side garden.

On a personal level, gardening is great for your physical and mental health. It builds confidence, teaches you how to overcome adversity, and accept what you can’t control. Environmentalists often feel discouraged about humanity and can be weighed down by cynical ideas about humans only as destroyers, but I see humans as gardeners who plant seeds to nurture other forms of life.

Left to right: Colleen leans on the catalpa tree in the front yard; Colleen stands in front of the tree, holding catalpa seed pods.

What advice do you have for others?

Get out of your own way. For years, I talked myself out of this type of project. I made a lot of excuses for not putting myself out there. I was worried about indulging in something that didn’t directly make money, and I thought that I needed to focus only on my income. I was also worried about looking like an egomaniac just talking by myself to an audience without sharing the podcast with another host, which is something I think a lot of women or other marginalized folks feel is improper or immodest. If you find yourself trying to talk yourself out of a passion project that could truly help others or improve your community, try to be real with yourself instead.

U.S. states are getting about $4 billion in payments from the federal government this year from energy development revenue on federal land.

The federal government collects these dollars from energy companies for rent, royalties and lease fees. Then it disperses some of that back to individual states. States later use the funds to pay for day-to-day spending and savings.

New Mexico continues to receive the largest payments, accounting for nearly 70% of state disbursements. It received almost $3 billion in the 2025 fiscal year.

That’s because the state partially sits on top of the oil-rich Permian Basin, according to Kristin Smith, a researcher at the Montana-based nonprofit, Headwater Economics.

“If you took out New Mexico, there’d be a different story in these numbers,” Smith said.

For Wyoming, the next largest recipient of revenue payments, Smith said the story is all about declining coal revenues. The state received $544.87 million this fiscal year. That’s nearly $50,000 less than 2024 and almost $300,000 less than 2023, according to federal data.

Utah also saw drops, though it did gain more revenue from geothermal energy production ($5 million). Montana and Colorado saw upticks, largely due to oil and gas development.

Mountain West State Energy Revenue Disbursement (FY 2025) New Mexico $2.76 billion Wyoming $544.87 million Colorado $90.77 million Utah $81.72 million Montana $27.02 million Nevada $11.97 million Idaho $6.36 million Arizona $354.52

Overall, the state revenue total was down slightly from previous years, which the Trump administration blamed on a drop in commodity prices. A U.S. Department of Interior press release said the administration’s efforts to unleash American energy helped unlock those dollars.

However, Smith said the market often plays a bigger role in revenue totals than federal policy.

“When you think about where are the places that are benefiting the most or the least, or who’s experiencing changes, that is often dictated by market and commodity prices,” Smith said.

She added that this revenue source is volatile, and states should rely on it less for day-to-day spending and invest more in long-term savings.

“ There’s always a risk of economic dependance,” Smith said. “You don’t wanna be dependent on revenue that just goes poof and isn’t there next year.”

Louisiana, North Dakota, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, California and Alaska also received millions in energy revenue payments.

The federal government also disburses the money to tribal nations, the Reclamation Fund, the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund and other federal agencies.",https://891khol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-28.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 16:03:38.041369

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-05 18:00:06+00:00,Solar Power World,Filling the gap: Why storage belongs in every community solar program,"SPW, Stephanie Burgos-Veras, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2025/12/filling-the-gap-why-storage-belongs-in-every-community-solar-program/,"But one of the most transformative pieces is the development of a new large-scale battery and community solar + storage program.
Community solar, which is available in 23 states has brought clean energy to renters, low-income households and those unable to access rooftop solar.
Traditional community solar helps households access clean energy and save through bill credits, but without energy storage, community solar is fundamentally an access-only tool — it gives people access to clean energy when the sun is shining.
Community solar + storage fits that need better than any other energy source on the market.
Community solar + storage is the next frontier of energy equity, reliability and affordability — and Illinois is leading the way.","In late October, the Illinois General Assembly passed the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA), a major landmark legislation that will make Illinois’ grid more resilient, add new clean energy capacity and meaningfully reduce ratepayers’ energy bills. The bill is nearly 1,000 pages long, with dozens of provisions focused on affordability. But one of the most transformative pieces is the development of a new large-scale battery and community solar + storage program.

The timing could not be more timely. The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects to see 63 GW of new utility-scale electric-generating capacity to be added in the United States in 2025, which is nearly a 30% increase over 2024. Of the projected 63 GW for 2025, solar and battery storage together account for about 81% of the additions.

While existing projections are focused on utility-scale development, what those projections miss is the untapped potential on the distributed energy scale. Community solar, which is available in 23 states has brought clean energy to renters, low-income households and those unable to access rooftop solar. Energy storage is the missing piece community solar has been waiting for: It ensures that the sun keeps powering things even when the sun goes down. The CRGA is turning clean energy access into true resilience, and other states should take note and implement similar policies.

Lower ratepayers’ bills

After one of the most expensive summers on record for electricity bills, states urgently need solutions that can bring immediate and lasting relief to ratepayers. Solar + storage is one of the most effective solutions available. Traditional community solar helps households access clean energy and save through bill credits, but without energy storage, community solar is fundamentally an access-only tool — it gives people access to clean energy when the sun is shining. When low-cost daytime solar power is stored and used during the expensive evening peak hours, families see direct, measurable reductions on their monthly bills.

Build resiliency

Beyond savings, community solar + storage strengthens local grids and reduces the need for costly, grid upgrades and emergency utility measures that often get passed back to customers. Storage can relieve congestion, smooth demand spikes and help utilities avoid expensive capacity price spikes.

Storage also enables communities to maintain critical services when the grid does go down. Paired with community solar, batteries can keep critical infrastructure powered during emergencies.

Growing energy demand

With energy demand rising nationwide, states need to deploy resources quickly and cost-effectively. Community solar + storage fits that need better than any other energy source on the market. Solar projects can be permitted and built in a fraction of the time it takes to construct gas plants or transmission lines, and battery storage can be added modularly, scaled as needed.

Distributed projects also support local economic development and provide capacity close to load, reducing strain on high-voltage infrastructure. In a time of growing energy demand, states that prioritize community-based solar + storage will be best equipped to keep pace with growing demand.

A strategic response to OBBBA

With the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) now in effect, federal tax credits for most clean energy technologies are being phased out, creating uncertainty for states trying to meet their climate, reliability and affordability goals. But one critical exception remains: battery storage still qualifies for the federal investment tax credit (ITC). Under the current rules, storage projects that begin construction before January 1, 2033, remain fully eligible, and the credit does not fully phase out until December 31, 2035. This gives states a meaningful but limited runway to expand storage deployment while federal support is still available.

By rapidly scaling solar + storage programs, states can ensure that the clean energy they’ve already built continues to deliver value despite federal rollbacks.

Integrating storage into community solar is not only a climate strategy, it’s an affordability and reliability strategy. States that act now will protect ratepayers, stabilize their grids and preserve clean energy progress. States that move quickly to integrate storage into community solar and broader energy programs can provide clean energy reliability, affordability, and protection — exactly when customers need it most.

Illinois has shown the nation what forward-looking clean energy policy can achieve. With rising energy demand, escalating climate risks, and shifting federal policy, states cannot afford to wait. Community solar + storage is the next frontier of energy equity, reliability and affordability — and Illinois is leading the way. It’s time for other states to follow.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-solar-storage-forefront-california-easterly.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:16.071930

Electric vehicles, drones, aircraft, defense systems, grid storage, consumer electronics—the entire future runs on electrons stuffed into metal boxes. They are so crucial that they may ultimately determine whether the U.S. remains a global technology leader or cedes that advantage to China, which is racing ahead in electrification.

2025 was a massive year on the battery front, packed full of promising breakthroughs and disappointing setbacks. Below, we've compiled some of the biggest battery developments of the year. But first, let's explore how we got to this moment.

Batteries in 2025: A Recap

The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was a shot of adrenaline for battery projects. It injected hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies into the space, helping sprout sprawling factories (or at least plans for them) nationwide. We all know what happened next.

After President Trump returned to the White House in January, there was immediate whiplash on the policy front. Several battery plants either paused or shut down, jobs evaporated and automakers scrambled to redirect investment into stationary storage systems to soften the blow from the EV slowdown.

Still, 2025 proved that the the ship had already sailed. Projects announced in the Biden era that had come far along marched toward completion. EV prototypes with solid-state batteries hit the road as automakers continued to make bolder promises about the “holy grail” tech.

Meanwhile, today’s lithium-ion batteries continued to improve. Automakers released new or refreshed EVs with more efficient batteries delivering longer range at more competitive prices. We also saw lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) technology return to America, along with novel approaches such as the lithium-manganese-rich (LMR) battery chemistry to address affordability concerns.

The torrent of battery news in 2025 felt like five years compressed into one. And because this industry impacts everything from how we drive to how we power our homes and how we deal with natural disasters, the InsideEVs team covered it all obsessively, with scoops, technical deep dives, factory visits and interviews with industry leaders.

General Motors and Ford are working on a breakthrough battery chemistry called lithium-manganese-rich (LMR), which aims to deliver driving range closer to current nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs at costs comparable to cheaper lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. I visited General Motors’ top-secret battery facilities in Warren, Michigan, this Spring to learn how these LMR batteries are made and what their implications are for the EV industry. I also spoke to engineers at Ford who described LMR tech as “LFP of the West” and the answer to “what’s next?”

This year, Western automakers inched closer to bringing their solid-state dreams to reality. These batteries promise longer range, faster charging times and improved thermal safety. A Mercedes-Benz EQS equipped with U.S.-based start-up Factorial’s semi-solid-state battery began road tests in Europe this year. BMW seems to have gone a step further, installing an all-solid-state (ASSB) pack from another U.S.-based start-up, Solid Power, in a prototype i7. While their roadworthiness is now being tested, expect more such announcements in the coming months as the technology continues to mature.

Ford’s Affordable EV Comeback Starts Here. But Not Without Controversy

Ford's LFP battery cells.

LFP batteries are central to making EVs more affordable, as they’re cheaper to produce and don’t use expensive nickel or cobalt. But most LFP batteries today are made in China. Ford is working hard to change that. The company is building its $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan, where it will make LFP batteries for its future EVs, licensing CATL’s tech. Patrick George visited the plant in June and reported that reaching this stage for Ford wasn’t without difficulties or controversy.

GM Is Bringing LFP Battery Production To America

GM had a huge year in the battery department. Not only did it surpass Tesla to become America’s largest battery cell manufacturer, but it’s also planning to bring LFP battery production stateside. The automakers’ two main battery suppliers, LG Energy Solution and Samsung SDI, will retrofit part of their U.S. plants, originally designed for NMC batteries, to assemble LFP packs. Both the Chevy Bolt EV and the Silverado EV have been confirmed to get LFP packs, but local production won’t begin until the end of 2027. Until then, GM will reportedly import LFP batteries from China’s CATL.

Targa Badlands LLC pleaded guilty to this offense on February 18, 2025.

As stated in the criminal information and plea agreement, Targa Badlands LLC operates six natural gas compressor stations on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. Between 2018 and 2022, Targa Badlands LLC operated the Johnson Compressor Station, located in Dunn County, North Dakota, but failed to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems on two Johnson Compressor Station engines when required to do so under NESHAP. Continuous parameter monitoring systems monitor and collect data on temperature and pressure for engine operations to ensure the catalyst is being utilized properly, thus ensuring the engine not producing excess emissions. Failure to timely install a required continuous parameter monitoring system can lead to increased hazardous air pollutants being released into the environment.

Additionally, as described in the plea agreement, on two prior occasions, in 2019 and 2021, Targa Badlands LLC had previously agreed to pay civil penalties to the United States—and entered into Consent Agreement and Final Order’s with the EPA—for separate NESHAP violations pertaining to natural gas compressor stations it operates on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation.

Finally, as noted in the plea agreement, Targa Badlands LLC self-identified, self-reported, and corrected the failure to timely install continuous parameter monitoring systems at the Johnson Compressor Station and has since adopted an implemented policy and procedural best practices to improve its environmental permit review and implementation requirements.

“Today’s sentence underscores the importance of enforcing our environmental laws, which protect the land, water, and communities,” said US Attorney Chase. “At the same time, we recognize that Targa Badlands LLC took responsibility for its actions and self-reported the violation. Natural gas production is vital to our state’s economy, and it must be done responsibly. This case demonstrates that we can support strong energy production while holding companies accountable when they fall short of their legal obligations.”

About one-third was directed towards renewable energy technologies, pushing renewable energy investment to USD 807 billion.

Despite this milestone, year-on-year growth of renewables slowed significantly, with annual investments increasing by 7.3% in 2024, compared to 32% the year before, a new report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) finds.

Global Landscape of Energy Transition Finance 2025 was released ahead of the UN Climate Conference COP30 in Belém, Brazil. It aims to inform the global finance dialogue and support delegations by tracking investments in renewable energy technologies and their supply chains, looking at regional trends as well as finance sources and instruments.

Key findings:

• 96% of renewable energy investments went to the power sector, continuing a long-term trend.

• Global investment in solar PV hit a record with USD 554 billion in 2024, up by 49%.

• Investment in renewable power, grids, and battery storage exceeded fossil fuels investment in 2024, though fossil spending is on the rise.

• Investment in energy transition technologies grew globally, but 90% remained concentrated in advanced economies and China, leaving emerging and developing countries behind.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA said: “Investments in energy transition continue to grow but not at the pace needed to achieve the global goal of tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Funding for renewables is soaring but remains highly concentrated in the most advanced economies. As countries gather at COP30 to advance the ‘Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3 trillion’, scaling finance for emerging and developing countries is essential to make the transition truly inclusive and global.”

IRENA’s report shows advanced and major economies can draw on domestic financial resources to fund energy transitions. In contrast, lower-income countries depend on external support due to underdeveloped financial markets, limited fiscal capacity, high capital costs, and debt vulnerabilities amongst others.

Globally, nearly half of total investment in 2023 was provided as debt, most of it at market rates. The rest was invested through equity. Grants accounted for less than 1%. The urgent need to mobilise investments, combined with a scarcity of impact-driven capital such as low-cost debt and grants, risks exacerbating debt burdens.

Mr. Francesco La Camera added: “IRENA has long called for smarter use of public funds to unlock private investment through risk-mitigation tools. Yet the heavy reliance on profit-driven capital is leaving developing countries behind. Where private finance won’t flow, the public sector must lead, backed by stronger multilateral and bilateral cooperation and scaled-up climate finance.”

IRENA’s new report also highlights that investment in energy transition supply chains and manufacturing remains critical, but highly concentrated. China accounts for 80% of global investment in manufacturing facilities for solar, wind, battery and hydrogen technologies between 2018 and 2024. Positively, new factories are emerging outside advanced economies and China expanding energy security and socio-economic benefits of the transition to other developing economies.

Overall, global investment in factories producing solar, wind, battery and hydrogen fell by 21% to USD 102 billion in 2024, driven by a significant drop in investments for solar PV manufacturing. In contrast, battery factory investment nearly doubled to USD 74 billion, reflecting rising demand for storage in grids, electric vehicles (EVs) and data centres.

Foreign direct investment, through joint ventures, technology partnerships and knowledge sharing, will be vital to strengthen international cooperation and expand energy transition manufacturing in emerging and developing economies, including through South-South collaboration.

In addition, dedicated policies are needed to ensure these activities are undertaken in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner and that their benefits are shared equitably.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PPAs-are-transforming-the-renewable-energy-sector-in-Portugal.png,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:20.083198

The Nov. 18 permit dismayed environmental groups and advocates, who saw the judge's previous order as a marginal win against the rapid industrial expansion in southwest Louisiana.

Commonwealth is one of more than a dozen LNG export terminals existing, approved or proposed in Louisiana, which has become the global epicenter of the industry. The technology at these massive facilities converts natural gas into liquid form by supercooling it, allowing the fuel to be loaded on tankers and exported worldwide.

Proponents of LNG tout job creation, revenue and the importance of supplying U.S. allies with fuel long seen as burning cleaner than coal. The state's basis for the decision for the permit also notes the ""national significance"" of LNG exports.

But making LNG is more energy-intensive than burning gas alone, leading to more emissions. Recent studies have also found that natural gas may be no better than coal when it comes to climate-warming emissions due to methane leaks throughout the supply chain.

In October, Judge Penelope Richard of Louisiana's 38th Judicial District Court struck down a key environmental permit that the Louisiana energy department had granted to Commonwealth. Richard said the department needed to consider the impacts the terminal will have on the coastal zone and nearby communities, specifically mentioning people living in poverty and recreational fishers.

Her judgment also noted that Commonwealth would be the third LNG facility in the Calcasieu Ship Channel, and that state regulators were obligated to consider the ""potential impacts on storm severity or sea level rise in the coastal zone together with two other LNG facilities,"" she stated.

The Louisiana Bucket Brigade and two national nonprofits, the Sierra Club and the Turtle Island Restoration Network, brought the case against the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy (formerly the Department of Energy and Natural Resources).

Environmental groups applauded the October ruling as an unprecedented win — the first time that a court has invalidated an LNG permit based on climate change and environmental justice.

Last month, the Louisiana regulators determined that the project was ""in the best interest of the state"" and reissued the permit.

Eric Huber, an attorney for the Sierra Club, said that the group's attorneys are reviewing the decision and will decide ""whether further legal action is in order."" Anne Rolfes, who runs the Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said the state failed to get to the bottom of the problems the environmental groups raised.

""In particular, the agency didn't go and talk to the fishermen and did not investigate the really serious claims that the fishing industry is being destroyed by the gas export tankers and pollution,"" Rolfes said.

Commonwealth did not respond to requests for comment. The state energy agency declined to comment.

Using federal, state analysis

Around 90 acres of wetlands will be impacted, which will be ""sufficiently mitigated"" and not significantly harm environmental justice communities, according to the state.

Louisiana officials relied on analysis from other agencies — the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state's Department of Environmental Quality — in their determination of the climate change-related impacts from Commonwealth's project.

""The information being considered herein was already located within the administrative record of this permit application,"" the state's basis of decision states.

It similarly states that the record ""already contains environmental justice analysis surrounding the proposed facility,"" and points to the state and federal agencies. The state also says that re-creating the other agencies' environmental justice analyses is no longer possible due to a January executive order by President Donald Trump that eliminated a federal environmental justice tool that FERC and LDEQ used.

Environmental groups opposing the LNG buildout criticized the state for not conducting its own analysis beyond information already in the record. James Hiatt, who leads the southwest Louisiana nonprofit For a Better Bayou, said the agency is simply ""rubber-stamping"" the requests of the LNG corporations.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/ee/7eee3999-c815-5211-8033-90cd5ae1d17e/6317ca4081a99.image.jpg?crop=1920%2C1008%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-05 14:04:27.324446

The LCDA approval represents an important milestone in the project finance process, allowing the sponsors, working through LCDA as a conduit issuer, to seek an allocation of “volume cap” from the Louisiana State Bond Commission in the same US$402m amount. The volume‑cap request is scheduled for the week of December 15. The final step will be an executive order from the governor of Louisiana, expected in January.

The revenue bonds contemplated under the LCDA resolution are expected to be limited obligations of the issuer payable solely from project‑related revenues and other pledged security, and not from the general funds of the State of Louisiana. Final terms, including interest rates, maturities, security, and covenants, will be determined at the time of any bond issuance and remain subject to additional approvals, documentation and market conditions.

Groups frequently volunteered for cleanups and other park projects, McDonald said, but Thomas surprised him.
The teen’s father, Alex Thomas, credits the program for teaching his son organizational skills and discipline.
“That initiative of his, I think scouting just helped fuel it,” Alex Thomas said.
“He seems to be service driven,” Alex Thomas said.","A dirty creek at a North Texas park started a middle school student on the path to environmental advocacy.

“I noticed there was a lot of plastic in the creek,” said Daniel Thomas, now a 17-year-old senior at Colleyville Heritage High School.

Thomas, who was 11 at the time, went home and started to research why trash ends up in waterways. He learned most of it comes from the land. The teen told the Star-Telegram he realized what a difference it would make if litter could be properly disposed of before it ended up in the water.

Thomas began his environmental efforts by emailing Ray McDonald, at that time the director of parks and recreation in Euless. McDonald said the student’s proposal for a cleanup at 47-acre Bob Eden Park read like a master’s thesis.

“He had a well-thought-out plan of how he wanted to execute that,” McDonald said.

Groups frequently volunteered for cleanups and other park projects, McDonald said, but Thomas surprised him. For one thing, the student didn’t ask for any supplies or equipment from the city. And when McDonald went by Bob Eden Park later, he saw Thomas and his group of volunteers had bagged all the trash and hauled it away themselves instead of leaving it for the Parks Department to deal with.

Since that time, Thomas has conducted monthly litter cleanups in multiple North Texas parks. He’s removed 45,000 pounds of plastic and other trash from local waterways and cleaned over 730 miles of roads. The city of Euless named him Volunteer Youth of the Year in 2022.

“This guy’s special,” McDonald said. “He’s not just doing it to check a box.”

In September, Thomas received the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes for his environmental work. The teen was one of 25 students chosen for the honor out of 700 applicants.

Thomas continues to look for creative ways to combat environmental problems. An app he designed for mobile phones — Litter Scout — allows users to report the location of trash and then check off when an area has been cleaned. His YouTube channel of the same name has nearly 9,000 subscribers. The teen has also published four children’s books on conservation.

“He never fails to amaze me with what he’s doing,” said Tegan Brennen, Thomas’ Scoutmaster.

Thomas joined Boy Scout Troop 1905 in Colleyville when he was 11. At age 12 he earned Eagle Scout, the highest rank available. Thomas said he was inspired by Ross Perot, who achieved that rank at 13.

The teen’s father, Alex Thomas, credits the program for teaching his son organizational skills and discipline.

“That initiative of his, I think scouting just helped fuel it,” Alex Thomas said.

Brennen said he jokingly calls Daniel Thomas a “friend to the bees.” In 2023, the teen, with help from some of his fellow Scouts, built and installed over 50 bee houses for Keep Grapevine Beautiful Pollinator Week.

“He was just very focused,” Brennen said. “I mean, he still has fun, but he was very, very focused.”

In 2022, Thomas was a finalist in the 3M Young Scientist Challenge. He got the idea for his entry — a dosing pump to prevent clogs and bacterial overgrowth in air conditioner condensate lines — from watching his father and HVAC technicians repair the clogged line at his house. The pump’s components only cost $33 in contrast to the hundreds of dollars condensate line repairs can cost.

Community service is another theme in Thomas’ life. In 2019, he started an annual pie drive to thank first responders. He served as Colleyville’s “Mayor for a Day” that year and got to see how much work police officers and firefighters do to keep the community safe. Every Thanksgiving, Thomas and a group of friends deliver 4-pound pies and thank you notes to more than 40 police and fire stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.

“He seems to be service driven,” Alex Thomas said.

Alex Thomas said from an early age his son has seen family members volunteer their time in various community projects, and he’s just taken that to another level.

Daniel Thomas is already looking into university options for next year. He told the Star-Telegram that he’s still trying to decide where to attend, but he knows he wants to study environmental science.

“I’m really excited about that,” he said.

Thomas said he finds fulfillment in educating other young people about the importance of environmental stewardship. He gives presentations at local elementary school garden clubs and loves sharing what he’s learned with others.

On one cleanup, Thomas and an elementary student found a banana peel on the ground. Thomas asked the boy how long it would take the peel to decompose. The boy guessed it would only take a short time, but Thomas explained it could take several years. Later that day, Thomas saw the student excitedly sharing what he’d learned.

“When you educate youth, you really see the impact,” Thomas said.",https://www.star-telegram.com/public/latest-news/p03a5z/picture313325302/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Daniel%20Thomas%201.png,N,,2025-12-05 14:03:07.665725

What’s going on: “The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21%,” Webb, of the Memphis-headquartered global paper company, told a House Ways and Means tax subcommittee hearing on competitiveness on Wednesday. “It established a competitive international tax system, one that made it easier to make things here in America and export them around the world.”

H.R. 1, passed in July, made the pro-growth tax provisions from the TCJA permanent and revived measures that had since expired, “solidifying the U.S. as a hub for manufacturing investment,” Webb continued.

A recipe for success: Sylvamo can employ 1,800 American workers across three locations and support 5,000 additional manufacturing jobs in rural U.S. mill communities in large part because of the benefits of the TCJA and H.R. 1, Webb told the subcommittee.

The tax code prior to TCJA “was an outdated tax code that locked companies’ profits overseas and made it more costly to manufacture here in the U.S.,” she went on.

“The TCJA helped Sylvamo tap into the location, the infrastructure and the skilled workforce here in America, creating jobs for thousands of hardworking Americans. . . . [It] worked, and this year Congress stepped up to make those provisions work for the long term.”

The details: H.R. 1 made industry-preserving changes to the global intangible low-taxed income, foreign-derived intangible income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax provisions that helped manufacturers avoid tax hikes, Webb said in response to a question from senior House Ways and Means Committee member Mike Kelly (R-PA).

In addition, modifications to expense allocation mean Sylvamo is no longer double-taxed due to some of its facilities being overseas, she told Kelly.

“This bipartisan legislation takes critical steps to reforming a permitting system that too often chills investment, creates uncertainty, and increases costs and delays for essential energy infrastructure projects,” wrote the executives.

The letter is signed by Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President and CEO Drew Maloney; Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the American Gas Association; Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute; American Exploration & Production Council President and CEO Anne Bradbury; Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association; Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America; Edith Naegele, president and CEO of the Independent Petroleum Association of America; Natural Gas Supply Association President and CEO Dena Wiggins; and Andrew Black, president and CEO of the Liquid Energy Pipeline Association.

They argue that H.R. 4776 is essential to lowering energy costs, cutting red tape, and providing greater certainty for long-term investments, and said rising energy demand and higher power costs underscore the need for more efficient development of energy infrastructure.

The execs also warned that weaknesses in the current permitting system — including lengthy reviews, shifting political priorities and frequent litigation — stall major projects and increase costs for consumers.

“The SPEED Act directly addresses these challenges and represents meaningful bipartisan progress toward a more stable and dependable permitting framework,” wrote the groups’ leaders. “The legislation reduces delays and provides greater confidence for investments in energy infrastructure by establishing clear permitting milestones and reinforcing the certainty of fully permitted projects.”

Additionally, H.R. 4776 would improve environmental reviews by streamlining existing procedures under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and reducing unnecessary litigation — helping well-supported projects move forward without prolonged delays, according to their letter.

U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman (R-AR) sponsored H.R. 4776 on July 25 alongside lead original cosponsor U.S. Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) specifically to amend NEPA, clarify ambiguous provisions, and facilitate a more efficient, effective, and timely environmental review process.

As the House works to refine the proposed bill, the executives added that lawmakers should include enforceability provisions to ensure accountability when deadlines are missed.

While praising the legislation as an important step, the organizations wrote that additional reforms may be needed as Congress continues working on a broader permitting package.

The latest official numbers on generating capacity offer a reality check for those predicting a rise in fossil fuels and nuclear at the expense of renewables. Big infrastructure takes time to finance, approve and build, thus solar and wind dominate the projects coming online over the next several years.

In other news, the Trump administration has fired shots at “established monopolist” Duke Energy as officials test antitrust tools in power markets, and a fight over capacity auctions highlights the risk of phantom data centers.

Here are those and other fascinating figures for your week in numbers.

By the Numbers

88%

Solar and wind’s proportion of the 28 GW of generation capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2025, with solar accounting for the lion’s share. For all the talk about reinvesting in nuclear and gas, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s monthly infrastructure report is a reminder that rhetoric and reality can diverge when it comes to what is actually coming online every month and what makes up the bulk of the queue for the next three years, at least. Wind and solar account for about 84% of “high probability” additions through September 2028, FERC says. The report does not include storage or rooftop solar.

750 MW

The capacity American Electric Power utilities are accused of trying to offload in an upcoming PJM “incremental” capacity auction after anticipated data center load failed to materialize. That’s according to independent power producers and the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor, which are urging FERC to reject a waiver request for the AEP utilities to participate in the auction. The utilities — Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power and Wheeling Power — are “fixed resource requirement” entities that don’t typically participate in PJM’s capacity market.

11 hours

The average total duration of blackout U.S. electricity customers experienced in 2024 — nearly double the average of the last 10 years, according to the Energy Information Administration. Hurricanes accounted for 80% of those lost hours. “Interruptions attributed to major events averaged nearly nine hours in 2024, compared with an average of nearly four hours per year in 2014 through 2023,” EIA said. “Service interruptions that aren’t triggered by major events routinely average about two hours per year.”

$325M

The value of incentives Duke Energy allegedly offered the city of Fayetteville, North Carolina, to undercut competition from independent power producer NTE Energy, according to a brief filed at the U.S. Supreme Court by U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer. Sauer urged the justices to deny “established monopolist” Duke’s appeal of a lower court decision allowing an antitrust lawsuit brought by NTE to move forward. “This suggests that the Trump Solicitor General’s Office thinks that antitrust should be a viable tool in electricity markets,” Joshua Macey, a Yale Law School associate professor, told Utility Dive.

In the past decade, the 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill and the 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill have further demonstrated the immense risks of offshore drilling expansion.
As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb.
The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history.
The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.","U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) joined U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) and 27 members of the California Democratic congressional delegation in condemning the Trump Administration’s official draft 2027-2032 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that includes six lease proposals off the coast of Northern, Central, and Southern California. The plan proposes opening vast swaths of previously protected federal waters to new oil and gas drilling for the first time in over 40 years, disregarding bipartisan opposition.

The Trump Administration’s overwhelmingly unpopular proposal directly targets areas former President Joe Biden withdrew from future leasing in January 2025, when he protected 625 million acres. In their letter to President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the lawmakers stressed that this plan would undermine state laws that prohibit new offshore drilling along its 1,110-mile coastline and ban new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters.

“We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast,” wrote the lawmakers. “This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless.”

“As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb,” continued the lawmakers. “Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.”

The lawmakers emphasized the devastating impacts new oil and gas leasing would have on California’s environment, military readiness, and diverse coastal economy, threatening the state’s tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and defense infrastructure industries. California’s marine economy accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages, and pollution off its coast would significantly damage the state’s world-leading economy.

California began efforts to block offshore drilling in 1969 when an oil rig off the coast of Santa Barbara leaked 3 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, blanketing beaches with a thick layer of oil and killing thousands of marine mammals and birds. It was the largest oil spill in U.S. history until the Exxon Valdez spill 20 years later. In the past decade, the 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill and the 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill have further demonstrated the immense risks of offshore drilling expansion.

Last month, Carbajal hosted a press call with Central Coast public officials, environmental advocates, and business leaders to condemn the Trump Administration’s plan immediately after it was announced. In addition, Carbajal spoke at a national press conference hosted by Senator Padilla and House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-CA-02).

In April, Carbajal announced the reintroduction of the California Clean Coast Act. The California Clean Coast Act was the first bill Congressman Carbajal introduced as a Member of Congress, demonstrating his longstanding commitment to protecting California’s coast from offshore drilling and the devastating impact of oil spills.

Full text of the letter is available here and below:

Dear Mr. President and Secretary Burgum:

We write in strong opposition to the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition.

We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast. This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless. As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb. Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.

In April 2025, California officially became the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind only the United States, China, and Germany in global rankings. Our economy is diverse and robust, including sectors such as tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and Department of Defense infrastructure. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), California’s marine economy alone accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages in 2021. The economic well-being of these sectors is dependent upon a healthy and clean coastline. Further industrialization off our coast will inevitably pollute our beaches, spelling disaster for California’s economy and detrimentally impacting the rest of the country, which relies on California as an economic engine.

California is all too familiar with the devastating impacts of oil spills. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history. Immediate damage to birds, intertidal organisms, beaches, and the economy was severe. That experience galvanized Californians and secured an unshakable commitment to protecting our coastline. The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.

Our Congressional delegation, state leaders, and dozens of California municipalities and Tribes have expressed their opposition through resolutions or comment letters, along with state groups and citizens. The bipartisan consensus against expanded offshore drilling has been clear and consistent over five decades. This has resulted in current state laws that include a permanent ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along California’s 1,110-mile coastline and a prohibition on new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters that enable increased oil and gas production from federal waters. As stated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)’s Request for Information and reinforced by the comments BOEM received from our state, “As a result of Congressional moratoria, subsequent Presidential actions, and consistent opposition by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to any activity off their coasts, the Pacific OCS has not been included in any National OCS Program since the 1987–1992 Program.”

In addition to the economic and environmental reasons for not expanding drilling off California’s coasts, our national defense would be better served by keeping additional oil rigs away from our shores. California’s waters and coastline are strategically vital, hosting a significant number of military installations, key logistics routes, and special-use airspace. Allowing oil and gas development, or the risk of spills, in areas where our servicemembers routinely operate would undermine military readiness and pose risks to national security.

For these reasons and more, we write in strong opposition to the Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition. We appreciate your attention to this matter.",https://[lastname].house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 14:02:27.837815

“There’s a lot of pent up demand” for new data centers and energy to power them, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Bustos said in an interview in Mexico City.

While Mexico is among Latin America’s fastest-growing markets for new data centers, the nation is trailing Brazil, Argentina and Chile on a per-capita basis, according to Bustos. To gain ground, the country, which faces near-constant droughts and an energy grid that’s vulnerable to seasonal rolling blackouts, has to improve its energy capacity, he said.

Esentia plans to use proceeds from a recent share sale and private placement to boost its capacity for transporting natural gas. The company currently operates a private-gas network that runs from Waha, Texas, to the center of Mexico. Eventually, the company will have to look at doubling the size of its system, Bustos said, without providing a timeline.

“There’s a gap on energy security that needs to be closed, and we believe we’re going to be one of the leaders in doing so,” he said.

The data-center industry in Mexico will likely attract more than $9.2 billion of new investments between 2024 and 2029, according to Prodensa, which helps foreign companies establish operations in the country.

New data centers in Mexico will increasingly rely on imported gas, and that means demand for pipeline infrastructure will likely rise.

Currently, Mexico’s imports of US natural gas are at record highs, driven by the nation’s growing electric-power sector, according to the US Energy Information Administration. About 60% of Mexico’s energy grid runs on natural gas — and roughly 70% of that gas is imported from Texas.

In August 2024, the three states – California, Washington and Oregon – were selected for an award in round 1B of the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program.
Howell said the funding for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is subject to a 20 percent minimum match requirement.

During a webinar on Wednesday, ODOT gave an overview of its plans for the public fleet EV charging stations on both highways.

The Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is a discretionary grant program that was created by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Its main purpose is to fund alternative fuel infrastructure projects along major highways and interstates throughout the state and communities, with a special focus on medium and heavy-duty infrastructure, said Brett Howell, ODOT’s transportation electrification coordinator.

In 2023, ODOT, the California Department of Transportation and the Washington State Department of Transportation applied for the program. In August 2024, the three states – California, Washington and Oregon – were selected for an award in round 1B of the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program. The total award was roughly $102 million to support the development of medium and heavy-duty focused charging infrastructure, as well as a limited number of hydrogen refueling stations along Interstate 5 in all three states and a few additional corridors in California, Howell said.

Oregon received about $21.1 million to develop two medium and heavy-duty charging stations, and one hydrogen refueling station, all to be located along the I-5 corridor.

Howell said the funding for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program is subject to a 20 percent minimum match requirement. ODOT intends to issue a notice of funding opportunity application sometime next fall.

The Carbon Reduction Program provides money to reduce carbon emissions. Oregon received $4.5 million for installation of an EV charging station along I-84, likely between Portland and The Dalles, Howell said.

For the Carbon Reduction Program, there is a funding match of 10.27 percent. ODOT plans to issue a funding opportunity application for in the spring or summer.

The webinar also addressed a new provision for a program through the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. Oregon DEQ‘s Clean Fuels Program is providing financial incentives for public fleets and their contractors through advance crediting. The financial incentives allow fleets to get an up-front loan of Clean Fuels Program credits when they put a new medium- or heavy- duty electric vehicle into service.

Courtney Herbolsheimer, of Oregon DEQ, said the program, which began in 2016, is a market-based program that reduces the overall carbon intensity of transportation fuels used in Oregon.

“Each type of fuel is assigned a carbon intensity value or level of carbon emissions,” Herbolsheimer said. “Over time, each year, DEQ gradually lowers the amount of carbon intensity average that’s allowed in fuel to meet our annual reduction goals.”

Lower carbon fuels will generate credits, while higher carbon fuels will generate deficits. An entity reports on a quarterly basis the number of kilowatt hours of electricity that are dispensed from its chargers each quarter.

With this new provision – advance crediting – DEQ is able to grant up to six years of credits to an entity up front. Those credits would be received when the vehicle is put into service, Herbolsheimer said.

The program will have one application period per year and will launch in early to mid-2026. Advance credits will apply only to vehicles when they are first put into service. Applicants must remain the owner of the vehicle until they have paid back the advance credits. Oregon DEQ will determine if an application meets the requirements. After an agreement is made, DEQ will issue advance credits.

The entity would pay back those credits over a period spanning at least one year and no later than three years after receiving the credits. Once the credits are repaid, they can go back to the regular program.",https://djcoregon.com/files/2025/12/fleet-ev-charging-scaled.jpg?_t=1764954443,N,,2025-12-05 13:02:04.494556

A coalition of six business groups sent a letter last week to House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Ann Bollin, R-Brighton, asking for movement on legislation from both chambers that would codify the program.

In the letter, the groups cited the state’s source for education data, MI School Data, which shows 53.4% of high school seniors enrolled in postsecondary education within six months. This was the lowest in the Great Lakes region and is down significantly from 10 years ago, they said.

The letter requested the committee take up SB 382 and SB 383, along with HB 4955 and HB 4956, which were introduced in September.

“This legislation provides transparency metrics business organizations requested – income levels, persistence and graduation rates, and the types of credentials earned,” the groups wrote. “These measures will help policymakers assess the program’s impact on Michigan’s talent pipeline and economic mobility.”

Having the program in statute would ensure a reliable program with accountability standards in place, the groups said.

“Michigan’s prosperity depends on the skills of its workforce,” the groups wrote. “Codifying the Michigan Achievement Scholarship is a vital step toward building a nation-leading talent infrastructure.”

The Senate bills passed that chamber in September with some bipartisan support (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Sept. 25, 2025). A Senate Fiscal Agency analysis of the bills estimated the cost for the program and the Michigan Achievement Skills Scholarship program at about $270.7 million for the recently completed 2024-25 fiscal year, growing to $590 million by 2027-28.

The president of the Detroit Regional Chamber signed the letter as well as the presidents of Business Leaders for Michigan, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business Association of Michigan, TalentFirst, and the Grand Rapids Chamber of Commerce.

Mike Duggan would like to see his proposed Detroit land value tax brought back before the Legislature under his successor, Mayor-elect Mary Sheffield, and the state’s next governor – hopefully, he said at a Tuesday event, himself.

During a discussion with Rocket Mortgage billionaire Dan Gilbert at an event hosted in his honor by the Detroit Regional Chamber, Duggan recounted the swing-and-a-miss he experienced trying to get the tax reform through the Legislature last session, which he said motivated him to run for governor – and to not do it as a Democrat.

Under the land value tax, which Duggan initially shopped around to lawmakers at the 2023 Mackinac Policy Conference, land taxes in the city of Detroit would be tripled and building taxes would be cut by 30%. He said it would allow the city to cut its 86 mills collected from property taxes down to 60 mills, eliminating the Detroit operating tax (20 mills) and its state school levy (6 mills).

The tax went without a vote at the end of 2023 after being left on the board in the House for more than an hour (See Gongwer Michigan Report, Nov. 28, 2023) and was brought back in 2024, only to become one of the many casualties of the chaotic lame duck session and again fail to see a vote.

Duggan said Tuesday he’d like to see Sheffield renew the city’s efforts to reform its property tax system, ideally alongside himself as a newly elected independent governor in 2027, but regardless of who’s in office, it will require bipartisan cooperation that wasn’t present in 2023 and 2024.

“I do think you will see the new mayor, hopefully with the help of a new governor, take up the land value tax,” he said. “But we have to fundamentally cut property taxes (and) we don’t have the ability to do that without help from Lansing. And maybe we’ll get both parties to finally go along.”

Duggan recalled leadership from both parties in the Legislature telling him the policy would have their support in meetings. However, that was before Rep. Joe Tate, D-Detroit, then the House speaker, “did something I didn’t give any thought to at the time,” Duggan said.

Tate signed on to sponsor the land value tax bill – “Joe thought this was going to be easy, no big deal,” Duggan said – and suddenly, Republican support evaporated and Democrats were unable to reach a 56-vote consensus within Tate’s own caucus.

“As soon as he said, ‘when the Republicans aren’t with us, I need all 56 of you,’ the first one (said) you haven’t taken up my defund the police bill, Mr. Speaker, you haven’t taken up my rent control bill, and now the people on the left of the Democratic Party refuse to vote for it unless he took those up,” Duggan said. “I never got a vote because the two parties were so obsessed with fighting with each other. I literally walked out of that room.”

It was that experience, he said, which sealed the deal on his departure from the Democratic Party.

“I decided that day I was not going to run for governor as a Democrat,” Duggan said. “That decision was made, and that started me thinking, how is the state ever going to change if we keep going this way? And it ultimately led to where we are, and whether people want a third choice, we’re going to find out next year.”

State regulators heard passionate and divided comments Wednesday evening from residents, labor groups, and environmentalists over whether to allow DTE Energy Company to fast-track special contracts with a company pursuing a large data center project.

Supporters of the project to allow OpenAI and its partners to build a multibillion-dollar data center in Saline Township told Public Service Commission members that the project would provide a huge investment opportunity for the state as well as significant good-paying jobs during its construction and for the long term.

Countering were opponents listing a myriad of concerns, including that residential ratepayers would be left holding the bag if the project failed, that the electrical grid cannot handle such a massive influx of energy, and environmental concerns.

DTE is seeking to obtain ex parte approval of special contracts for electric service for the proposed data center, which moves more quickly than a contested hearing process and bypasses public hearings.

PSC Chair Dan Scripps said the public interest in the proposal has been enormous since DTE filed its request for fast-tracking the special contracts. He acknowledged that many of those submitting comments have expressed concerns over the cost to ratepayers and potential impacts on the electric grid.

“As we review the contracts before us for DTE to provide electricity to the proposed data center, we’re closely reviewing some of these same issues around power demand, stress to the grid, costs, and the impact on customer bills,” Scripps said.

He added that there are some concerns raised that fall outside of the purview of the PSC, including siting approvals, construction issues, and air and water permits.

In its filing with the PSC, DTE cited statute that says an amendment in rates or rate schedules applied for a public utility that will not lead to an increase in cost to its customers may be approved without notice or hearing. The utility has used this mechanism to make its case for bypassing public hearings.

The proposed special contracts would provide electricity through Feb. 28, 2045, according to DTE in its filing.

As of Wednesday evening, there were more than 4,850 public comments filed with the PSC in the case.

Among those who submitted written comments was Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who supports the project. She highlighted the estimated 2,500 construction jobs that would be created for the building of the center and about 450 permanent jobs on-site.

“The reality is that data centers are going to be a big part of America’s future. The question isn’t whether they will be built, but rather: can Michigan benefit from these jobs and build data centers in a smarter way while upholding our strong environmental laws to protect our precious natural resources?” Whitmer wrote. “We have an opportunity to do both. We can set an example for the rest of the nation on how to build these facilities the right way and grow our economy at the same time.”

Dozens provided comments to the PSC during a two-and-a-half hour virtual meeting, not all of them sharing Whitmer’s optimism.

Bryan Smigielski, campaign organizer for the Michigan Chapter of the Sierra Club, said ratepayers are being asked to subsidize “a gigawatt-scale gamble for a speculative AI project that has never turned a profit.”

“No one knows if DTE’s renewable build schedule will be able to keep up with this data center’s needs … and no one knows if AI will be ever be profitable enough to pay the billions of new construction and energy costs that could get pushed onto the rest of us,” Smigielski said. “With all these risks, it is reckless, genuinely dangerous, to fast-track this project or any future AI data center project.”

Saline Township resident Tim Bruneau was also opposed, saying the state is under siege by “corporate greed and political overreach from a billion-dollar company and a monopolizing utility company bullying a small rural township with limited resources.”

“We need guarantees that we will not be paying for the infrastructure to support this data center,” Bruneau said.

Randall Whitaker, Washtenaw County Skilled Building Trades Council president, was supportive of the proposal, citing job creation and that it would deliver millions of dollars in local tax revenue and benefits to Saline Township.

“This project also helps keep high-tech work anchored here in Michigan by investing in Michigan’s strong skilled workforce and bringing advanced infrastructure to our area,” Whitaker said. “This project helps keep high-tech work anchored locally rather than being outsourced. That means better opportunities for our workers, their families and the next generation entering skilled trades or tech fields.”

Josh Fraley, who lives adjacent to the project site in Saline Township, was also supportive. . He said learning more about the project has addressed many of his initial concerns.

“Of course, I wish it would stay as farmland, but the property was going to be sold and developed into some non-farm use, and I believe this project is actually the least objectionable path forward for that land,” Fraley said.

Fraley said regardless of whether the fast-tracking of the project is approved, his main concern is that the contract specifically guarantees that the costs are not borne by other customers, asking that the PSC work to ensure that is the case.

Chris Morgan, a Saline Township resident who is group vice president for Walbridge, the general contractor for the project, said it would boost the regional workforce.

“These workers will spend their hard-earned dollars locally, regionally and all in the state of Michigan,” Morgan said. “Too often, younger people shy away from a career in construction because of job security or the travel requirements. This project will provide an incredible opportunity to attract and grow this critical Michigan industry.”

Washtenaw County resident Rima Mohammad said the project would affect the water of the surrounding communities and raise costs for residents.

“Our rural township and county should not bear the environmental and infrastructural cost so that distant companies can profit,” Mohammad said.

Sen. Sue Shink, D-Northfield Township, said she is among nearly two dozen lawmakers who wish to see the PSC hold a contested proceeding in the case.

“The concern is that this is a historic precedent-setting request,” Shink said. “It’s important to set a good precedent. It’s also important that this not be done in secrecy.”

Shink said an ex parte proceeding does not protect the interests of area residents and DTE ratepayers, nor does it allow certain questions to be vetted, such as what happens if the company were to enter bankruptcy and if there is adequate electricity to power all customers in the area.

Attorney General Dana Nessel, in a statement following the meeting, repeated her call for the PSC to grant a contested case hearing regarding the special contracts.

“It is overwhelmingly clear from both the comments shared tonight and the majority of the nearly 5,000 public comments submitted online that Michigan’s residents share in our concerns and demand transparency,” Nessel said. “I again urge the MPSC to listen to the people of the state, to whom they should feel dutybound to represent and defend, to do the right thing and deny DTE’s request to approve these special contracts without a full, contested hearing.”

Nick Occhipinti, senior policy director for the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, in a statement also urged that a contested case hearing be granted.

“Private developers and DTE Energy need to prove that everyday Michiganders won’t be forced to subsidize corporate investments in their energy bills, and projects like this won’t hinder or block our transition to the clean energy future that we’ve set together as a state,” Occhipinti said.

The PSC’s next scheduled regular meeting is on Friday, which would be the earliest time at which a decision could be issued on the contracts.

The ‘More Jobs for Michigan’ package looks to reinvigorate an old program as a new economic development tool the sponsor hopes could be the answer to the post-Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve question.

The Senate Regulatory Affairs Committee took testimony Tuesday on two bills sponsored by Sen. Sam Singh, D-East Lansing, SB 471 and SB 472, that would create a payroll tax capture Singh believes was an effective tool before the Legislature decided to let a similar program expire.

The package is similar to the Good Jobs for Michigan program, which was swapped out for SOAR. Singh said SOAR has “lived its life” and has not “found anybody in either party or either chamber that is very excited about (it).”

Although the bills were first introduced in June, they are now being considered amid pressure to put economic development legislation on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer‘s desk per budget negotiations with House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids.

The House Republicans introduced the “Real Jobs for Michigan” package last month, which would create a payroll credit, not capture, equal to 50% of income tax withheld for each new job a company creates for up to 10 years. The program is capped at $50 million annually with some funds set aside for smaller companies.

The plan would also require the rolling of Michigan Economic Growth Authority into the Corporate Income Tax, necessitating a refinancing of the credits that have been in place since 2009.

Singh said he is having conversations with Hall and what will come out of those conversations is something similar but may be slightly different than what he presented on Tuesday, maybe using aspects of both plans.

In the tax capture, an applicant could receive all withholding tax capture revenues for new jobs up to 10 years with possible extension and up to 20 years for protected jobs.

The program was not simply a “2.0” version of Good Jobs for Michigan, Singh said, but added different provisions including claw backs, environmental protections, a timeline for performance, and local feedback on the front end of the project.

There is no upfront money leaving the state going to the company, Singh said, saying “if the company fails to create the minimum number of jobs, it will never collect any of the revenue.”

The Department of Treasury would certify the number of jobs.

For businesses building in the state, there would have to be a breaking ground within two years of the capture and then a first hire within three years. For businesses not needing to construct facilities, the first hire still must be within three years.

Singh said in conversations with Senate Republicans, he moved the business eligibility for the capture in job requirements down from 50 to 25 positions, with those new jobs needing to pay 175% the prosperity region median wage.

For larger companies able to create 250 new jobs, they would pay 150% of the median wage. In projects with 1,000 or more new jobs, it would require $1 billion investment by a company as well.

He said he could be open to getting the number down to 10 jobs in the program or creating a separate program for microbusinesses.

Another change from the Good Jobs for Michigan program is the addition of retaining jobs as a pathway to the capture, wanting to also protect jobs from leaving the state. The company would have to maintain 50 or more full-time jobs that may be at risk of elimination or moving.

The program would be administered by the Michigan Strategic Fund. House Republicans recently set forth a package to abolish the MEDC that would also fold MSF’s economic development responsibilities.

Chair Sen. Jeremy Moss, D-Bloomfield Township, championed the local control component of the program because he said there must be local buy-in from the community for a project to work.

Singh told reporters after committee that the local aspect partly stemmed from claims that local opposition killed large projects like Gotion and wanting to ensure locals want to see these facilities develop.

Daniel Witt, head of state and local policy at Lucid Motors, which is currently considering an expansion of its engineering and research center in Southfield, praised the program as something that could ensure Michigan is a “magnet” for business attraction.

However, he said Lucid is in a position to consider multiple options in the future due to a competitive landscape for growth in other states but knows that Lucid could meet the requirements in the bill to receive support in hiring and scaling operations.

“Refundable or tax capture-based incentives bridge that gap and make Michigan competitive today, not years down the road,” Witt said.

Maureen Krauss, president and chief executive officer of the Detroit Regional Partnership, said the state needs a modernized income tax capture tool like this for growth in the state, as Michigan continues to fall behind other neighboring states.

However, she suggested net new jobs be part of the commitment, to prevent the tax capture being used to move business from one part of the state to another.

Mike Johnston, executive vice president of government affairs and workforce development for the Michigan Manufacturers Association, opposed the median wage requirements, saying they were too high to attract businesses.

He said many times, the manufacturers set the median wage in the area with their payroll, and that setting the wage standards higher, “forces companies to compete against themselves for wages and benefits.”

James Hohman, director of fiscal policy for the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, also opposed the bills because he believes job creation incentives don’t work as well in comparison to incentivizing companies to not eliminate jobs like the MEGA credits.

Singh said likely what will be seen as the legislature moves closer to the end of the year is a melding of both the Real Jobs and More Jobs proposal.

He said the biggest differences between the plans include a retainment program for all businesses, larger investments and focusing on workforce development overall.

Hall has said before that he wants to see an official elimination of the SOAR statute, which still has $607 million in the pot, and MEGA tax credit continuation as development talks continue.

Singh said he would be open to looking at the elimination of SOAR but being at the heel end of the MEGA credits, sunsetting in 2029, the Legislature may run into legal issues if they don’t repurpose contracts that are already in existence. He said they would have to honor them.

When it comes to hitting the development plan deadline, Singh said he is an optimist and wants to give it a try even as the session days draw fewer.

Having a smoother budget process and maintaining funding for programs and education that will have a long-term positive effect on residents across Michigan are key goals for Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks as she approaches her final year in office.

In a year-end interview this week with Gongwer News Service, Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, stressed that momentum on programs for education, health care, and housing will strengthen the state for the long haul.

During her final year in office, she said a critical priority will be to see passage of a budget that builds on Democrats’ legislative wins of recent years, including expanding the Rx Kids program, expanded school meals, programs enabling more people to earn credentials to boost the state’s skilled workforce, and funding to build new housing.

Funding for various educational programs and science of reading legislation also needs to continue moving forward, she added.

“We hear a lot about education and how we need to improve third grade reading scores,” Brinks said. “We have to support that with our dollars and with our commitment to teachers and students. It will take a couple of years for us to see those results, so maintaining those commitments is going to be critical.”

Expanding the Freedom of Information Act to include the Legislature and governor’s office is another top priority, she said.

“There is no reason we should continue the embarrassment of having Michigan be dead-last in the nation when it comes to ethics and transparency,” Brinks said.

Brinks took aim at House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, over his refusal to take up the FOIA package that passed the Senate earlier this year. The speaker has said the FOIA package is not strong enough for him to support.

“For him to flip-flop on that is really nothing short of a travesty,” Brinks said.

To get FOIA expansion to the governor’s desk before she leaves office at the end of 2026 would be a great achievement, Brinks said.

To meet many of her goals, Brinks said next year’s budget process will need to be more collaborative and transparent than what transpired during 2025 between the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House.

The Legislature this year, for the first time since the late 2000s, went beyond midnight on Sept. 30 to complete work on a state budget.

A few hours after midnight on Sept. 30, lawmakers passed a seven-day short-term spending measure to keep the state government open while final negotiations were completed. The budget was passed early in the morning on Oct. 3. It included a long-term road funding proposal that was a key part of the holdup between the two chambers.

The Senate passed its budget proposal in May, but it took the House until late August to pass their proposal. Both chambers acknowledged they were far apart on many items in the competing proposals, with negotiations proceeding at a glacial pace until late in September.

Brinks placed the blame on Hall for this year’s budget delays, adding that she would like to see more transparency in the budget process in 2026 to see it completed by the end of June.

“Instead, the process was sort of hoarded into the speaker’s office, and staff had more to say about budget decisions over there than members did,” Brinks said. “Countless times, we heard from their members that they didn’t know what was going on or that those decisions were made above them. That’s not what legislators are elected to do, to just follow orders from the top.”

Passing changes to the legislative earmarks process was the only significant procedural improvement Brinks said she saw during the most recent budget cycle.

Hall has touted the legislative earmarks legislation, which passed last month and includes a 45-day wait from when an earmark is introduced to when the Legislature can take it up for a vote.(See Gongwer Michigan Report, Nov. 13, 2025).

After obtaining a Democratic Senate majority for the first time since the 1980s, Brinks said she is optimistic about the party’s chances to hold its majority after next year’s elections.

“We’ve got candidates that are unmatched in their work ethic and their ability to communicate with the people in their district, so we feel very positive about the prospect of who we will be able to make the case with to voters in the coming months,” Brinks said.

She said the political environment has favored Democrats in recent months as well, with the party’s special election candidates exhibiting strong showings across the country ahead of next year’s midterm elections and taking into consideration President Donald Trump’s declining approval ratings.

“And then you add to that our track record of really being able to get things done, to effectively work together to shepherd legislation, to be the chamber and the party that people could count on to do really good policy work … I think our returning members are really strongly situated to maintain that and to bring in new members to be able to continue that legacy,” Brinks said. “I think we have an excellent case to make to voters.”

Brinks said candidates will need to talki to voters about issues that matter, including cost-of-living issues, education, efforts to improve neighborhoods and communities, and housing affordability and infrastructure needs.

“We just have to keep telling our story, and they have to hear that there’s somebody who cares enough about what they think, that they’re willing to knock on their door and have a conversation with your average voter without the filters of all the political baloney, and make sure that they understand that we have solid candidates who really care about what they think, who are going to bring their voices into the Capitol every day when we go to work,” Brinks said.

As for the much-anticipated special election to fill the vacant 35th Senate District seat, Brinks said she believes Democrats are well-positioned to hold onto the seat formerly held by U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet of Bay City. Brinks said the party has a rich field of candidates and that the district, on paper, has a Democratic lean.

“I think you’ve seen prominent Republicans take a pass here because they know it’s going to be really, really tough for them, so we’re in a really good position,” Brinks said. “I’m very confident that we’ll be able to win that. We’ve tested it and proven it with Kristen McDonald Rivet and that district is really in its new form, solidly Democratic leaning.”",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wayne-State-University_Crains_featured.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:01:37.580530

Finding an old car isn’t really a Hackaday story in itself, but now it’s landed in [The Questionable Garage]. It’s being subjected to a teardown as a prelude to its restoration, offering a unique opportunity to look at the state of the art in 1990s electric automotive technology.

The special thing about this car is that by a murky chain of events it ended up as an abandoned vehicle. GM’s legal net covers the rest of the surviving cars, but buying this car as an abandoned vehicle gives the owner legal title over it and frees him from their restrictions. The video is long, but well worth a watch as we see pieces of automotive tech never before shown in public. As we understand it the intention is to bring it to life using parts from GM’s contemporary S10 electric pickup truck — itself a rare vehicle — so we learn quite a bit about those machines too.

Along the way they find an EV1 charger hiding among a stock of pickup chargers, take us through the vehicle electronics, and find some galvanic corrosion in the car’s structure due to water ingress. The windscreen has a huge hole, which they cover with a plastic wrap in order to 3D scan so they can create a replacement.

This car will undoubtedly become a star of the automotive show circuit due to its unique status, so there will be plenty of chances to look at it from the outside in future. Seeing it this close up in parts though is as unique an opportunity as the car itself. We’ve certainly seen far more crusty conventional cars restored to the road, but without the challenge of zero parts availability and no donor cars.

While projected 2030 methane emissions are lower than previous forecasts, the report warns that emissions continue to rise.

It states that only full-scale implementation of control measures will close the gap on the Global Methane Pledge's goals.

Produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), the report assesses progress in cutting methane emissions to date.

Inger Andersen, Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations and Executive Director of UNEP, says: “Reducing methane emissions is one of the most immediate and effective steps we can take to slow the climate crisis while protecting human health.

“Reducing methane also reduces crop losses, essential for both agriculture productivity and food security.

“UNEP is committed to helping countries turn ambition into action to ensure the solutions in this report deliver real benefits for people and the planet.”

The Global Methane Pledge

The Global Methane Pledge is a partnership launched by the United States (US) and European Union (EU) at COP26 to collectively reduce global methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 compared to 2020 levels.

More than 150 countries have joined the pledge, representing nearly half of global human-caused methane emissions.

The Pledge is working across six action areas:

Energy

Waste

Food and agriculture

Plans and policies

Data

Finance.

Meeting the Pledge's goals has the potential to reduce warming by at least 0.2°C by 2050, according to the report.

Economic benefits of methane reduction

Achieving the goals of the Global Methane Pledge will deliver benefits that exceed US$330bn in value annually, the report says.

When factoring in the broader social cost of methane, the benefit would be even greater.

The report estimates the total annual cost of achieving the full maximum technically feasible reductions (MTFR) at US$127bn.

More than 80% of the MTFR could be implemented for a low annual cost and tackle 109 Mt per year.

In the waste sector, methane capture and other methods could deliver US$9bn annually through energy savings.

In the energy sector, the report estimates the combined total annual cost for MFTR measures at US$98bn, equivalent to 2-4% of the sector’s income in 2023, without including environmental benefits.

Julie Dabrusin, Canada’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change and Co-Convener of the Global Methane Pledge, says: “This report is a crucial assessment of our progress and a key indicator of the work that’s required to meet the Global Methane Pledge goal.

“In just four years, we have made improvements, but we must continue to drive faster, deeper methane cuts.

“Every tonne reduced brings us closer to cleaner air, more resilient communities, and a thriving global economy.”

Regulatory landscape and compliance

Despite more than 150 countries participating in the Global Methane Pledge, just six have adopted quantified methane reduction targets: Canada, Japan, Norway, the US, the Republic of Moldova and Vietnam.

The EU Methane Regulation mandates measurement, reporting and verification alongside leak detection and repair for fossil fuel operations.

It also introduced the first methane import standard, requiring importers of oil, gas and coal to demonstrate equivalent monitoring standards from 2027.

Denmark agreed in June 2024 to implement the world's first carbon tax on agriculture, effective from 2030, that will tax livestock farmers on methane emissions.

South Korea requires public and private entities to convert organic waste into biogas, aiming for an 80% conversion rate by 2050.

The US Environmental Protection Agency finalised NSPS OOOOb and EG OOOOc in 2024 to cut methane from oil and gas operations.

However, there have been moves to delay US compliance deadlines and potentially reconsider these regulations.

New Zealand also officially scrapped its world-first plan to price agricultural emissions, the ""farm levy"", in October 2025.

Julie says: “It is important for all countries that have agreed to the Global Methane Pledge to continue to work closely together to drive momentum on methane mitigation, turning ambition into tangible benefits for the planet.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8116b0e9e4a237080aa591ee9490d417:c5fd820c76b5659bc676d155235b9b32/gettyimages-1394039015.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:01:55.618221

Proponents try to beat back data centre scepticism

Region has lost population, income sources

BRISTOL, Virginia - The demise of the coal industry left the U.S. Appalachian region in tatters, with lost jobs, spoiled water and countless miles of abandoned underground mines.

Now entrepreneurs are eyeing the rural region with ambitious visions to rebuild its economy by converting old mines into solar power systems and data centres that could help fuel the increasing power demands of the artificial intelligence boom.

One such project is underway by a non-profit team calling itself Energy DELTA (Discovery, Education, Learning & Technology Accelerator) Lab, which is looking to develop energy sources on roughly 65,000 acres of old coal land in southwest Virginia.

Will Clear and Will Payne, who help manage Energy DELTA Lab, say they imagine building a massive 450-acre Data Center Ridge on top of old mining lands that could be powered and cooled using the billions of gallons of water that naturally replenish below.

Unlike in some neighbouring areas, there is no acid mine drainage, which deposits sulphuric acid and heavy metals from exposed mine rock faces, rendering water unusable, Payne said.

The difference has to do with geology, he said, as Wise County and other area coal fields lack the mineral pyrite, a key culprit in acid mine drainage.

""So the water quality is there. Obviously the cost to use, to circulate this water is low,"" Payne said.

In support, a handful of localities, including Wise County, have a special tax rate on data centre equipment and resolutions aimed at welcoming regional data centre investments.

Payne acknowledges that their plan could meet with resistance in an area hard-hit by coal's decline.

""Anyone looking at expanding in the region, there is scepticism because there have been so many stories of promises made but not kept,"" Payne said at Squabble State Hard Cider & Spirits, a cider-making business he and Clear run near the state border with Tennessee.

Appalachia was once the heart of the nation's coal industry, whose decline decimated local communities.

Amid issues of cost, worker health and the fossil fuel's contributions to global warming, coal has been dropping as a top source of U.S. fuel for decades.

""If you go through coal mining communities, they're ghost towns,"" said Erin Bates with the United Mine Workers of America, a trade union.

""The number of bankruptcies that have happened in the last three decades have destroyed these communities.""

Ambitious vision

Financially, the Data Center Ridge vision is ambitious. Constructing an average-sized data centre facility can cost between $500 million and $2 billion, according to Allianz, a financial services company.

The entrepreneurs hope to prove the feasibility of their idea to Texas-based Energy Transfer, which owns the land in question. The land is managed by Penn Virginia Operating Co.

""They're willing to think about the future, whereas others maybe just don't have the time or don't have the interest,"" Payne said.

Energy Transfer did not respond to interview requests.

Other coal mine repurposing projects are seeing success, at least on a local scale.

The Mineral Gap Data Center, also in Wise County, came online in 2023 and touts itself as the first abandoned mine land to be converted to solar in the state.

In Martin County, Kentucky, a utility-scale solar project on an old mine site that powers some 18,000 homes, came online in December.

The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit group, is a partner in a 10 MW solar project in Wise County built on the former Indian Creek Surface Mine. Start of construction is planned for next year.

The nonprofit is working on a broader conservation effort spanning more than 250,000 acres in Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee that could include additional solar development, said Brad Kreps, the Conservancy's Clinch Valley Program director.

""Our projects are definitely among the first that are moving forward in central Appalachia,"" Kreps said.

Public interest test

Building new data centres will need on-site renewable energy to be viable, said Jean Su with the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit group.

However, she questioned building data centres generally.

""That should be up to every single jurisdiction to have that type of public interest test to figure out whether it is actually serving their constituency or not – understanding environmental harms, water issues and drainage,"" Su said.

Environmental groups criticize the expansion of data centres, which strain power grids and likely require significantly more energy than can be made available.

Some critics like Bates say data centres might not bring the jobs the area desperately needs, but Payne maintains there will be work for local residents.

A typical data centre can add up to 1,500 workers on-site during construction and employ some 50 full-time workers when up and running, according to a 2024 Virginia state report.

Based on average spending by the industry from 2021-2023, overall the data centre industry is estimated to contribute 74,000 jobs, $5.5 billion in labour income and $9.1 billion in GDP to Virginia's economy each year - mostly in the construction phase, the report said.

Those estimates were just over 1 percent of total statewide employment, income and Virginia GDP for those years, it found.

Authors Luke Metzger Executive Director, Environment Texas As the executive director of Environment Texas, Luke is a leading voice in the state for clean air and water, parks and wildlife, and a livable climate.
He has been named one of the ""Top Lobbyists for Causes"" by Capitol Inside, received the President's Award from the Texas Recreation and Parks Society for his work to protect Texas parks.","Texas is home to wide-open skies, desert canyons, pine forests and Gulf Coast beaches that harbor diverse wildlife, support communities and shape life across the state.

From the red rocks of Palo Duro Canyon to the flowing waters of the Rio Grande, these places are what make Texas special, offering us room to explore, connect with nature and enjoy the many landscapes that define the Lone Star State.

Environment Texas’ goal is simple: to protect that natural world.

We research problems, build public support, and advance solutions that keep our air and water clean, our parks accessible and our environment healthy.

In 2025, that meant defending parks and rivers, holding polluters accountable, cleaning up our waterways, protecting wildlife, advancing clean energy and more.

Supporting our state parks

Building on our 2023 success, in which our staff and supporters helped convince Texas voters’ to approve the $1 billion Centennial Parks Conservation Fund, Environment Texas has continued to urge investments in parks and wild places so more Texans can hike, camp and hunt close to home.

In 2025, those investments started to take shape, with new parks opening and preparing to open soon.

For instance, at the newly opened Devils River State Natural Area’s Dan A. Hughes Unit, visitors can paddle some of the clearest water in Texas, hike more than 25 miles of trails, and enjoy possibly the darkest skies in the state.

Farther north, the Palo Pinto Mountains State Park will be the first new state park opened in North Texas in decades. Located about 70 miles west of Fort Worth, the park houses dramatic canyons, steep slopes, long ridges and a 90-acre lake for swimming, boating and fishing. The park infrastructure is still under construction, with the area set to open to the public sometime in 2026.

Meanwhile, on the coast, Powderhorn State Park, opening in 2030, will protect one of the largest remaining undisturbed coastal prairies in the state, home to dolphins, sea turtles, fish and more than 200 bird species, including the highly endangered whooping crane.

These are just a few of the new parks and recreational areas that will be opened and maintained using this funding. But while the Centennial Parks Conservation Fund is helping create and preserve the state’s land, our lawmakers have also been hard at work protecting the wild places that make Texas special.

A bipartisan Big Bend National Park boundary adjustment bill would add 6,100 acres along Terlingua Creek, expanding habitat for hundreds of plant and bird species and protecting some of the darkest skies in the nation. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Austin worked to create the Land, Water and Wildlife Conservation Fund to help preserve Texas’ natural beauty even as development spreads and populations grow.

Between our state park work and the work of decision makers in Austin, this year, Texans got access to even more land to explore, cherish and use.

Keeping Texas waters and beaches clean

Texans should be able to enjoy our beaches, rivers and waterfronts without worrying about getting sick when they swim.

But the Texas “Safe for Swimming” report from our partners at Environment Texas Research & Policy Center found that, on at least one day in the past year, up to 94% of the state’s tested coastal beaches had fecal bacteria levels that were high enough to pose a risk to swimmers. Even worse, nearly half had potentially unsafe levels on at least a quarter of testing days.

That’s why Environment Texas is calling for stronger investments in wastewater and stormwater infrastructure in order to reduce the flow of sewage and bacteria into our waterways. In addition, we’re also working for better water testing and monitoring so families can count on jumping into clean, safe water at their favorite beaches.

Outside of bacterial pollution, Texas coastlines and waterways face another unseen threat. Nurdles, tiny pre-production plastic pellets, remain a persistent issue in Texas bays, streams, marshes and beaches.

These pellets are the raw material used to make many common plastic products, but due to their size and abundance they can often spill or leak during manufacturing and transport. Once they spill into the environment, these nurdles are nearly impossible to fully clean up.

In response, Environment Texas is working with a diverse coalition of recreational fishermen, oyster harvesters, tourism leaders and conservation groups to urge state leaders to adopt stronger limits on this often unseen, yet still impactful, plastic pellet pollution.

This broad coalition is calling on the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, as well as the governor, to help hold pellet polluters accountable and protect beaches, wildlife and coastal communities from this waste.

While we continue urging our lawmakers to act, we are also engaging in much-needed public education and local pellet cleanup events. For example, at Sylvan Beach in La Porte, we joined 55 Rice University students for a plastic pellet count and cleanup. The students collected nurdles and other trash, learned about environmental advocacy, and even called Gov. Abbott’s comment line to support the passage of stronger environmental standards for marine microplastic pollution.

Holding polluters accountable for air emissions

Communities and individuals living near ExxonMobil’s Baytown complex have lived with illegal air pollution for years.

But, after a 15-year legal battle waged by Environment Texas and Sierra Club, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Exxon’s final appeal, instead allowing a $14.25 million civil penalty for more than 16,000 Clean Air Act violations at the facility to stand.

That’s the largest penalty ever imposed in a citizen-initiated Clean Air Act case.

Our lawsuit documented more than 10 million pounds of illegal emissions, including toxic, carcinogenic and ozone-forming chemicals, and relied on heartfelt testimony from brave neighbors who discussed what it is like to live in the shadow of the large, polluting complex. After we sued, ExxonMobil installed pollution controls which cut illegal emissions 82%.

The case reaffirmed the idea that people harmed by illegal pollution can still go to the courts to enforce environmental laws when lawmakers and regulators fail to act. While it’s just one facility, this case shows how persistent citizen support can help hold even the largest of polluters accountable.

Outside of our Exxon case, Environment Texas also worked to cut atmospheric methane pollution from oil and gas operations. Through public outreach and discussion, Environment Texas coordinated discussions and mobilized public support for stronger state and federal standards against methane pollution

We helped to deliver comments to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and the governor, engaged partners across the state, and collected more than 1,000 public comments in defense of EPA’s methane regulations.

Promoting clean, renewable solar power

Texas leads the nation in wind power and is second in solar, and recent policy changes will help keep that clean energy momentum going.

A new Environment Texas-backed law will streamline rooftop solar permitting by allowing certified third parties to review simple residential applications, reducing delays that have slowed installations and delayed implementation. By making the permitting process quicker, easier and more predictable, we can help more Texans put solar on their roofs quicker, cutting pollution and saving money on their energy bills.

Research suggests that this streamlining could reduce the cost of rooftop solar installation by over $2,000 by 2030, eventually saving Texas families up $3,500 a year in their utility bills.

Aside from winning bills, Environment Texas and our allies also worked to block a slate of anti-renewable energy legislation that would have made it harder and more expensive to build new wind and solar projects. By making a strong case against these discriminatory fees, fossil fuel mandates and unnecessary hurdles in the legislature, we helped protect Texas’ position as a national leader in clean energy, making it more likely that renewable power will continue growing unhindered for years to come.

Protecting birds, bees and other wildlife

Nearly 2 billion birds, or roughly one in four of all U.S. birds, migrate through Texas each year along the “Central Flyway,” but bright nighttime lighting and large, reflective glass in cities is making migrating around buildings a major threat.

All in all, about a billion bird collision deaths occur annually in the United States. While not the sole factor, these collisions are certainly contributing to an overall major decline in America’s bird populations.

That’s why Environment Texas is working to make cities safer for migrating birds by promoting “Lights Out” policies and bird-friendly building design.

For instance, in Dallas, we organized a petition and built public support calling on the Dallas City Council to adopt stronger and longer Lights Out policies, asking large buildings to limit nonessential night-time lighting during peak migration seasons. We also urged the council to better adopt bird-safe designs, such as bird-safe glass. This glass is covered with small translucent dots, which make it easier for incoming birds to notice and avoid, saving lives and reducing cleanup costs.

These efforts in Dallas, Austin and other cities can reduce collisions and make the Texas’ skyline safer for the millions of migrating birds that have to pass through our state, and cities, each spring and fall.

But it’s not just our birds that are under threat from human activity, many native pollinators are also under pressure.

We’ve been raising awareness of the steep declines in native bees, butterflies and other pollinators. In response the Texas House voted to create a pollinator health task force, charged with identifying ways to help prevent habitat loss, reduce pesticide use, and promote new pollinator habitat across the Lone Star State.

This year, Environment Texas has worked to defend public lands and rivers, hold polluters accountable, tackle pellet pollution and accelerate clean energy growth across the state.

But our work is far from finished. We will keep working to ensure Texas’ parks, rivers, coasts, forests, plains and other natural areas, as well as the wildlife they support, are protected and preserved for generations to come.

In 2026, Environment Texas remains committed to working for a cleaner, greener, healthier Lone Star State, but we can’t power campaigns, engage in research, and advocate for Texas’ natural world by ourselves.

That’s where supporters like you come in.

If you’d like to help keep Texas’ skies clear, our waters clean and our wild places thriving consider making a donation to Environment Texas today.

A fast energy transition would spur investment in construction, creating more jobs across the sector.

In its annual World Energy Employment report, the Paris-based watchdog said on Friday that the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), which it reintroduced under pressure from the Trump administration, has “more muted” employment growth than the Stated Policies Scenario.

The CPS sees oil and gas demand continuing to rise until at least 2050 – a scenario that the IEA described as “cautious” and “anchored in enacted laws and measures” and was widely criticised by clean energy experts.

A fast energy transition would spur investment in construction, creating more jobs across the sector. New roles for electricians, building insulators, solar panel and energy-efficient lightbulb installers, and transition mineral miners would more than offset job losses in coal mines, power plants and oil and gas fields, the report found.

Anabella Rosemberg, Just Transition lead at Climate Action Network International, lamented that the clean energy sector is “being undermined at a time when employment creation is of utmost priority”.

“Climate ambition and decent job creation must go hand in hand – but as the recent conversations at COP30 showed, there is a need for both the right targets and just transition strategies to make it happen,” she added.

A more ambitious Net Zero Emissions scenario, aligned with the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C, would see roughly ten million more energy jobs created than under the CPS, report author Daniel Wetzel told Climate Home News at a press conference.

Bottleneck warnings

The IEA warned that governments must act to train workers for these roles or risk facing shortages of electricians, welders, and grid specialists – a gap that could slow the energy transition and drive up wages and energy costs.

IEA head Fatih Birol highlighted a particular shortage of qualified workers in the nuclear industry, warning that the problem could worsen as the sector’s workforce continues to age. “I hear nuclear is making a comeback, but the interest in the nuclear sector for the jobs is rather weak,” he said.

Laura Cozzi, IEA’s Director of Sustainability, Technology and Outlooks, warned of a shortage of skilled workers in electricity grids. “That is one of the key ingredients why we are not seeing grids ramp up as [they] should,” she said. Over 60 governments pledged at COP29 to improve and expand their grids to enable clean electricity to flow to where it is needed.

Bert De Wel, Global Coordinator for Climate Policy at the International Trade Union Confederation, celebrated that the energy transition is creating jobs but added that they should be good jobs with decent pay, conditions and union rights. Decent work would attract skilled workers, he added.

The report found that wages in the oil and gas industry have generally risen faster over the past year than in the solar – and especially the wind – sectors. It noted that the oil and gas industry has a “historical tendency to offer highly competitive wages to attract and retain top talent”.

At the COP30 climate summit, governments agreed to set up the Belém Action Mechanism to try and make the energy transition fairer to groups such as workers in the energy industry. It will give trade unions a formal role in shaping just transition policies, for what the ITUC says is the first time.

ITUC General Secretary Luc Triangle called it a “decisive win for the union movement and working people across the world, in all sectors but especially those in transition industries.”",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/04/Climate-Home-News-Solar-rooftop-in-Nakhon-Pathom-3-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:01:09.378850

Two new data centers in Silicon Valley have been built but can’t begin processing information: The equipment that would supply them with electricity isn’t available.

It’s just one example of a crisis facing the U.S. power grid that can’t be solved simply by building more power lines, approving new power generation or changing out grid software. The equipment needed to keep the grid running – transformers that regulate voltage, circuit breakers that protect against faults, high-voltage cables that carry power across regions, and steel poles that hold the network together – is hard to make, and materials are limited. Supply-chain bottlenecks are taking years to clear, delaying projects, inflating costs and threatening reliability.

Meanwhile, U.S. electricity demand is surging from several sources – electrification of home and business appliances and equipment, increased domestic manufacturing and growth in AI data centers. Without the right equipment, these efforts may take years longer and cost vast sums more than planners expect.

Not enough transformers to replace aging units

Transformers are key to the electricity grid: They regulate voltage as power travels across the wires, increasing voltage for more efficient long-distance transmission, and decreasing it for medium-distance travel and again for delivery to buildings.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that the U.S. has about 60 million to 80 million high-voltage distribution transformers in service. More than half of them are over 33 years old – approaching or exceeding their expected lifespans.

Replacing them has become costly and time-consuming, with utilities reporting that transformers cost four to six times what they cost before 2022, in addition to the multiyear wait times.

To meet rising electricity demand, the country will need many more of them – perhaps twice as many as already exist.

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation says the lead time, the wait between placing an order and the product being delivered, hit roughly 120 weeks – more than two years – in 2024, with large power transformers taking as long as 210 weeks – up to four years. Even smaller transformers used to reduce voltage for distribution to homes and businesses are back-ordered as much as two years. Those delays have slowed both maintenance and new construction across much of the grid.

Transformer production depends heavily on a handful of materials and suppliers. The cores of most U.S transformers use grain-oriented electrical steel, a special type of steel with particular magnetic properties, which is made domestically only by Cleveland-Cliffs at plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Imports have long filled the gap: Roughly 80% of large transformers have historically been imported from Mexico, China and Thailand. But global demand has also surged, tightening access to steel, as well as copper, a soft metal that conducts electricity well and is crucial in wiring.

In partial recognition of these shortages, in April 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy delayed the enforcement of new energy-efficiency rules for transformers, to avoid making the situation worse.

Further slowing progress, these items cannot be mass-produced. They must be designed, tested and certified individually.

Even when units are built, getting them to where they are needed can be a feat. Large power transformers often weigh between 100 tons and 400 tons and require specialized transport – sometimes needing one of only about 10 suitable super-heavy-load railcars in the country. Those logistics alone can add months to a replacement project, according to the Department of Energy.

Other key equipment

Transformers are not the only grid machinery facing delays. A Duke University Nicholas Institute study, citing data from research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, shows that high-voltage circuit-breaker lead times reached about 151 weeks – nearly three years – by late 2023, roughly double pre-pandemic norms.

Facing similar delays are a range of equipment types, such as transmission cables that can handle high voltages, switchgear – a technical category that includes switches, circuit breakers and fuses – and insulators to keep electricity from going where it would be dangerous.

For transmission projects, equipment delays can derail timelines. High-voltage direct-current cables now take more than 24 months to procure, and offshore wind projects are particularly strained: Orders for undersea cables can take more than a decade to fill. And fewer than 50 cable-laying vessels operate worldwide, limiting how quickly manufacturers can install them, even once they are manufactured.

Supply-chain strains are hitting even the workhorse of the power grid: natural gas turbines. Manufacturers including Siemens Energy and GE Vernova have multiyear backlogs as new data centers, industrial electrification and peaking-capacity projects flood the order books. Siemens recently reported a record $158 billion backlog, with some turbine frames sold out for as long as seven years.

Alternate approaches

As a result of these delays, utility companies are finding other ways to meet demand, such as battery storage, actively managing electricity demand, upgrading existing equipment to produce more power, or even reviving decommissioned generation sites.

Some utilities are stockpiling materials for their own use or to sell to other companies, which can shrink delays from years to weeks.

There have been various other efforts, too. In addition to delaying transformer efficiency requirements, the Biden administration awarded Cleveland-Cliffs $500 million to upgrade its electrical-steel plants – but key elements of that grant were canceled by the Trump administration.

Utilities and industry groups are exploring standardized designs and modular substations to cut lead times – but acknowledge that those are medium-term fixes, not quick solutions.

Large government incentives, including grants, loans and guaranteed-purchase agreements, could help expand domestic production of these materials and supplies. But for now, the numbers remain stark: roughly 120 weeks for transformers, up to four years for large units, nearly three years for breakers and more than two years for high-voltage cable manufacturing.

Until the underlying supply-chain choke points – steel, copper, insulation materials and heavy transport – expand meaningfully, utilities are managing reliability not through construction, but through choreography.

Port Arthur is one of the most economically disadvantaged cities in Texas, with a poverty rate of 27.2% in 2021.”","TEXAS — Texas is expanding its petrochemical industry with new facilities, but that could affect the health of the lower-income communities where the new plants will be located.

A release published by Texas Southern University claims that the people living near the 89 new facilities in five different regions (Port Arthur/Beaumont, Greater Houston, the Coastal Bend, the Southern Coast and Inland Texas) will likely disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.

“The findings show that nine out of ten petrochemical facilities are proposed in Texas counties with higher demographic vulnerability (in the form of higher numbers of people of color, or higher numbers of people in poverty, or both) than other areas of the state or the nation—in neighborhoods where residents are already living with significantly higher pollution and health risks than most communities in the country,” the report said.

The report then talked more about how the expansion historically affects the communities in negative ways.

“Earlier studies show Black and Latino Americans face increased risk of experiencing chemical disasters because there are disproportionately home to industrial facilities that release deadly toxins through fires, explosions, leaks, and spills. Overall, 93% of facilities in our study are located near other high-risk facilities covered by federal Risk Management Plans (RMP), compounding health and safety dangers for nearby residents,” the report said.

Among the most affected is Jefferson County, whose county seat is Beaumont, which has some of the worst exposure to toxic air in the United States, according to the report.

“In Jefferson County, 90% of the facilities are proposed in communities that rank among the most overburdened in the nation, enduring worse particulate matter, toxic air releases concentration of risk management facilities, and deeper social vulnerability than 75% of the United States,” the report said.

The petrochemical industry might represent up to 50% of crude oil production, and, according to the Texas Campaign for the Environment, plastic pollution is expected to rise to three times what it is in 2025.

“With communities of color along the Texas and Louisiana coast already heavily burdened with industrial pollution, a proliferation of new and expanded petrochemical and plastics infrastructure would only deepen the cruel pattern of environmental racism across the Gulf South,” the TCE said.

The long-term effects of these new plants have yet to be seen, but historical records do not represent a good outcome, even economically, according to the Bullard Center for Environmental & Climate Justice at TSU.

“Residents who live closest to these facilities face elevated health threats from both pollution and poverty, compared with the general population,” the report said. “Having so many industrial facilities clustered in Port Arthur/Beaumont has not brought about an ‘economic renaissance’ for its fence line residents.

If we do this, abundant clean energy becomes not a dream but a reality.
A Future Worth Choosing Humanity’s greatest advances have always come from overcoming fear—fear of sea voyaging, fear of flight, fear of the unknown.","Imagine a world where electricity is so abundant and inexpensive that energy scarcity ceases to exist. A world where every home, every town, every factory and data center has access to reliable, carbon-free power 24 hours a day. Where desalination plants turn seawater into fresh water for drought-stricken regions. Where synthetic fuels such as hydrogen are made cleanly, cheaply, and at scale. Where heavy industries—steel, cement, ammonia—emit almost no carbon. Where the price of energy no longer constrains economic opportunity anywhere on Earth.

This future is not speculative. It is not distant. It is technically available today.

The technologies required to deliver effectively limitless clean energy exist. We have known how to build safe, high-output nuclear reactors for well more than half a century. Moreover, the hundreds of reactors that have been running for the last 70 years have a better safety record than any other power source—that’s right, even better than solar and wind. Modern designs are even safer and simpler than what came before, and they can be built modularly, quickly, and at costs low enough to transform the global economy. We know how to build them; other countries are doing it.

What stands between us and abundant clean energy is not physics, engineering, or economics. It is a cultural fear—a deep, reflexive anxiety about the danger of radiation that has shaped public opinion, education, regulatory frameworks, and policy choices for three generations.

This fear has cost humanity more than almost any other scientific misunderstanding of the modern age.

The Promise We’ve Postponed

If nuclear energy had been allowed to scale naturally after the 1970s, analysts estimate that:

atmospheric carbon might be almost 100 gigatons lower,

millions of lives lost to air pollution would have been saved,

energy prices would be lower and far more stable,

and nations would be less dependent on volatile fuel markets.

Every credible study shows the same thing: Nuclear energy is the safest, cleanest, and most reliable high-density power source humanity has discovered. In the late 1970s, France nuclearized almost all of its fossil-fueled generation. Their experience—abundant clean electricity, minimal carbon emissions, low household power costs—is just a modest glimpse of what widespread nuclear adoption could have provided globally.

We could be living in an age of clean plenty. Instead, we argue about scarcity.

Why Didn’t This Happen?

It didn’t happen because in the late 1950s and ’60s, at the dawn of the nuclear age, the world became deeply—and understandably—frightened. Atmospheric nuclear weapons tests spread fear across continents. Scientists and policy leaders adopted an extremely cautious framework to predict the effect of radiation exposure: the Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model. The model assumes that any dose of radiation, no matter how small, carries health risks.

This was not based on low-dose human data. It was impossible to find low-dose harm in the data. So the model made a precautionary extrapolation from high-dose observations. This was a choice made because the world needed a simple, conservative way to discourage nuclear brinkmanship. In retrospect, it helped shape the visceral global fear of any nuclear radiation.

But the unintended result was that a fear designed to restrain warfare began to restrain peaceful technology and the path to a safer, cleaner world.

Fear Hardened Into Dogma

Over time, the LNT—and the anxieties that accompanied it—ossified into regulation. Agencies mandated that nuclear plants must prevent even radiation releases so small that they are drowned out by natural background variation. Evacuation standards assumed danger at levels far below those ever shown to produce harm. Licensing processes grew lengthier, more expensive, and more extremely risk averse.

Public belief followed. People began to fear even medical imaging. A radiation dose from a CT scan, a dental X-ray, or even an intercontinental flight felt ominous—even though these exposures are tiny compared with the daily exposure experienced by people living with high natural background radiation. In places like Ramsar, Iran, and Kerala, India, tens of thousands live with background radiation levels that the LNT predicts will be fatal. Yet their health and longevity are as good as or better than that of surrounding populations.

Decades of scientific study, including large-scale investigations by the United Nations Scientific Committee and others, have shown that negative health effects from chronic low-dose radiation, if they exist, are too small to detect. Yet though challenged, the LNT continues to direct policy, regulation, and fear.

The human body is not fragile. It is resilient. Our biology evolved in a sea of natural radiation and its repair mechanisms handle low-dose exposure easily. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be here.

The Real Consequences of Imaginary Danger

Treating minuscule potential risk as if it were to bring certain harm has had profound global consequences:

The United States abandoned a clean, safe energy technology just as it was maturing.

Developing nations grew dependent on coal because nuclear projects were deemed too “dangerous.”

The world poured trillions into fossil fuels—the energy source that is actually deadly, actually polluting, and actually destabilizing our climate.

Medical, industrial, and research uses of radiation were slowed, discouraged, or made prohibitively expensive.

In short, it is fear of radiation—not radiation itself—that has done measurable harm to human health and well-being.

A Better Approach for a Better Century

We should not ignore real hazards. High-dose radiation, delivered quickly, can be dangerous, even fatal, and must be regulated. But it is time to distinguish genuine risk from imagined peril.

That means:

updating regulatory frameworks so they reflect modern biological knowledge;

ending policies that treat micro-dose exposure as morally unacceptable;

accelerating licensing for new reactors and, especially, advanced reactor designs;

and allowing communities to weigh the real, enormous benefits of nuclear energy against its actual—if almost unmeasurable—risks.

If we do this, abundant clean energy becomes not a dream but a reality.

A Future Worth Choosing

Humanity’s greatest advances have always come from overcoming fear—fear of sea voyaging, fear of flight, fear of the unknown. Radiation belongs on that list.

For 70 years, fear blocked the path to an energy-rich future. The science now makes clear: The danger was never low-level radiation. The danger was the fear.

If we choose evidence over anxiety and possibility over fear, we can finally build the world we should already have—cleaner, safer, and more affordable and abundant than we ever allowed ourselves to imagine.",https://democracyjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/france-nuclear-resize.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 12:02:19.385408

“If you can connect your data center years earlier, that’s a lot of revenue and a lot of compute time,” said Jesse Jenkins, the Princeton associate professor who leads the ZERO Lab.
Flexible data centers also are cheaper because they require less new infrastructure, he added.
After years of relatively stable US power consumption, demand is rising quickly thanks to the artificial-intelligence boom, new factories and electrification of the broader economy.
However, the idea that data centers can shut down when demand soars has drawn criticism.","(Bloomberg) -- Big data centers equipped to supply their own power during heatwaves and other emergencies can begin operations much more quickly than those reliant solely on traditional utility hookups, according to a new study.

Installing onsite natural gas turbines, solar panels or batteries means data centers can achieve a speedier connection to the grid because they will represent less of a demand stress when electricity is tight, according to a study Princeton University’s Zero Lab carried out in conjunction with energy software firms Camus Energy and Encoord.

In some cases, the wait time can be cut by as much as five years – a significant difference in an industry where grid hookups can stretch up to seven years.

“If you can connect your data center years earlier, that’s a lot of revenue and a lot of compute time,” said Jesse Jenkins, the Princeton associate professor who leads the ZERO Lab.

Flexible data centers also are cheaper because they require less new infrastructure, he added.

“It doesn’t make sense to build a whole new transmission line that sits there 365 days a year when you only need it for a few hours a year,” Jenkins said.

Lowering costs are a key issue because data-center projects have driven up power bills in some parts of the US, angering neighbors and drawing political pushback. After years of relatively stable US power consumption, demand is rising quickly thanks to the artificial-intelligence boom, new factories and electrification of the broader economy.

The new research builds on a Duke University study that said in February the grid could handle another 76 gigawatts – about 10% of current peak demand – if large users such as data centers would curtail their demand during the rare periods when the system is stressed. Bitcoin miners, which also have voracious appetites for electricity, have employed that strategy for years.

However, the idea that data centers can shut down when demand soars has drawn criticism. The independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, the 13-state power grid stretching from the mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, called the idea that data centers will interrupt the operations and not require new generation “a regulatory fiction.”

The new analysis released on Thursday addresses that critique by modeling how data centers would replace grid power with their own sources, rather than by interrupting computing operations. “There’s a lot of other ways you can provide site flexibility that aren’t just reducing demand,” said Astrid Atkinson, chief executive officer of Camus Energy.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt8eb3cdfc1fce5194/blt1bf6eef12a48d218/6851a91723679e211eecd3a3/Solar-Power.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-05 12:02:43.881328

DOE Opens Its Checkbook for SMRs; Plans to Spend $800M

The Department of Energy has opened its checkbook and is now funding the middle ground between large 1000MW+ reactors and microreactors with power ratings of less than 25MW. The agency has selected two developers of small modular reactors (SMRs) awarding each of them $400 million in cost shared funding.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is selected by DOE to deploy the GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee. Also, the funds will be used to accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl.

Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute. As the lead applicant, TVA and DOE will now enter further discussion around project milestones and co-applicant awards.

Don Moul, TVA President and CEO said that TVA is the first utility in the U.S. to have a construction permit application for a BWRX-300 SMR accepted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The agency assessed that the application as complete and ready for review last July.

“The Clinch River project will serve as a national model for how to deploy SMRs safely, efficiently, and affordably – laying the groundwork for a new era of American nuclear energy leadership, Moul said.

A spokesman for TVA told Neutron Bytes that the design for the BWRX300 is not yet complete so it is premature to discuss the cost of building the first unit. He added that a key focus at this time for TVA and GE Vernova Hitachi is to develop the supply chain for the SMR.

In addition to its work to develop the BWRX300 at Clinch River, TN, TVA is also collaborating with Ontario Power Generation which is planning to build four of the SMRs at its Darlington, ON, site.

The agreement allows the companies to coordinate their explorations into the design, licensing, construction and operation of small modular reactors. While no exchange of funding is involved, the collaboration agreement will help OPG and TVA reduce the financial risk that comes from development of innovative technology, as well as future deployment costs.

Holtec Funded for SMRs at Palisades Plant in Michigan

Holtec is the second firm to received $400 million to support its plans for SMRs. The firm plans to deploy two SMR-300 PWR type reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, MI. The twin units will also fulfill a role as demonstrator units telling a story of the viability of SMRs which will promote additional orders both domestically and abroad.

Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and as an electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

Holtec said in a press statement the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) project, which will add 680 MW in a dual unit (340 MW per unit) configuration. The firm that that the twin SMRs are envisaged to be built by Holtec with construction financing from the DOE’s Loan Programs Office. Holtec added that with the financial pathway secured, the firm expects the SMRs to enter revenue service in the early 2030s.

As part of the program, DOE will provide milestone-based cost-share support to the company that is intended to support licensing, pre-construction, and supply-chain mobilization for the Palisades SMR-300 project. Holtec’s proposal includes a multi-site deployment pathway that establishes a repeatable, fleet-scale model — a core requirement of the DOE SMR Tier 1 program intended to drive down costs and shorten construction durations through standardization and manufacturing efficiency.

Holtec added in a press statement, “DOE’s support is an essential enabler of the Palisades SMR-300 project, moving it from development to deployment by building on the government’s prior support for Holtec’s SMR technology under the 2020 DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) Risk Reduction for Future Demonstrations to support commercial readiness.”

Dr. Kris Singh, CEO and Executive Chairman of Holtec International, said in the same press statement, “We are energized by DOE’s confidence in our SMR-300 reactor, which we view as validation of our 14-year quest to develop a walk-away-safe and cost-competitive nuclear reactor. This grant positions Holtec to accelerate deployment of a standardized SMR-300 fleet that strengthens U.S. energy security and grid resilience.”

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

NRC Completes Safety Review of TerraPower Construction Permit Application

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff has completed its final safety evaluation for the application submitted by TerraPower to build Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 in Kemmerer, WY. The evaluation concludes there are no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the construction permit.

“We’ve finished our technical work on the Kemmerer review a month ahead of our already accelerated schedule, as we aim to make licensing decisions for new, advanced reactors in no more than 18 months,” said Jeremy Groom, acting director of the NRC’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation.

“We thank TerraPower for promptly addressing the agency’s questions to ensure safety and enable the NRC to efficiently process the application.”

The staff will provide the safety evaluation and the final environmental impact statement to the Commission for the final phase of the licensing process in the coming weeks. The Commission will determine whether the staff’s review supports the findings necessary to issue the permit. Following its deliberations, the Commission will vote on whether to direct the staff to issue the permit.

The NRC’s Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards independently reviewed new and novel safety-related aspects of the Kemmerer Power Station Unit 1 application. The committee provided the results of its review to the Commission on 11/16/25.

TerraPower filed the application in March 2024, requesting a permit to build the sodium-cooled, advanced reactor design on a site near an existing coal-fired power plant. The NRC staff accepted the application and began its formal review in May 2024.

The 345 MWe plant includes an energy storage system to temporarily boost output up to 500 MWe, when needed. If the NRC ultimately issues the permit, the firm would need to submit a separate operating license application before it would be authorized to operate the facility.

TerraPower CEO Statement on NRC’s Findings

TerraPower President and CEO, Chris Levesque, issues a statement on the announcement of the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s completion of the Final Safety Evaluation for the first Natrium plant1, Kemmerer Unit 1, construction permit application:

“Today is a momentous occasion for TerraPower, our project partners and the Natrium design. This favorable safety evaluation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reflects years of rigorous evaluation, thoughtful collaboration with the NRC, and an unwavering commitment to both safety and innovation.”

“I am deeply proud of our team’s efforts in pioneering the design and licensing of America’s first, commercial-scale, advanced nuclear power plant. TerraPower remains focused on delivering the next generation of reliable, flexible power to the grid and long-term jobs for the Kemmerer community.”

BWXT Delivers TRISO Nuclear Fuel to INL for Project Pele Microreactor

BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: BWXT), the Idaho National Laboratory, the U.S. Army and the Department of War Strategic Capabilities Office announce the delivery at INL of TRISO nuclear fuel for the Project Pele microreactor. The full Pele prototype will be tested at INL.

Project Pele is the pathfinder design effort for advanced microreactors and is focused on designing, building and testing a 1.5 MW transportable power system. Pele is a Generation IV high-temperature gas- cooled reactor (HTGR). The entire system is designed to fit into four standard-sized shipping containers.

The fuel, called tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel, is composed of uranium, carbon and oxygen, which are formed into a small kernel. This kernel is coated in multiple ceramic layers including silicon carbide that make it extremely durable under high heat, radiation, and corrosive conditions. Thousands of these poppy seed-sized particles are combined into compact fuel forms used in advanced reactors like the one being developed under Project Pele.

BWXT manufactured and shipped the fuel from its facilities in Lynchburg, VA. The company’s Specialty Fuels Fabrication Group has more than 20 years of experience in the design and manufacturing of TRISO fuel for government applications.

Jeff Waksman, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, said, “This is real nuclear microreactor fuel delivered at its final destination, rather than some letter or memorandum promising to make fuel at a later date.”

“Project Pele is a transformational leap toward Gen-IV nuclear power, and the Army’s Janus Program will follow on to deliver affordable, reliable, commercial nuclear power to ensure that our critical infrastructure has the power they need, whenever they need it, even if the electric grid is disrupted.”

BWXT is constructing the Pele prototype at its Innovation Campus in Lynchburg, and it will ship the completed prototype to INL. The team plans to begin formal system testing as early as 2027.

BWXT is collaborating with Rolls-Royce LibertyWorks, Northrop Grumman and Torch Technologies on the full-system components, including thermal and power conversion modules and instrument and control systems.

INL Produces Fuel for Molten Salt Reactor

It is the first-ever fuel for fast molten salt reactor experiment, opening door to use for maritime applications

Scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have achieved a breakthrough in nuclear energy by launching full-scale production of enriched fuel salt for the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE). It is the world’s first test of a molten chloride salt fast reactor.

Results from the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment will help inform the commercial deployment of TerraPower and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor that could be deployed in the 2030s.

The fuel salt production process began in 2020. INL scientists set out to convert 90% of uranium metal into uranium chloride and produce 18 kilograms of fuel salt per batch—an ambitious target. Early attempts yielded less than the target amount with only an 80% conversion. But in 2024, the team achieved a breakthrough: 95% conversion and full-batch production. They’ve since demonstrated they can produce a batch in as little as one day.

The team delivered the first fuel salt production batch at the end of September and will produce four additional batches by March 2026.

“This is the first time in history that chloride-based molten salt fuel has been produced for a fast reactor,” said Bill Phillips, technical lead for salt synthesis.

“It’s a major milestone for American innovation and a clear signal of our national commitment to advanced nuclear energy.”

The MCRE project is a public-private collaboration between Southern Company, TerraPower, CORE POWER, and the U.S. Department of Energy to demonstrate advanced nuclear technologies. It is the first planned reactor experiment to be hosted at the Laboratory for Operation and Testing in the United States (LOTUS) test bed, which DOE’s National Reactor Innovation Center is building at INL. Operations are expected to begin as soon as 2030.

Unlike traditional reactors that use solid fuel rods and water as a coolant, most molten salt reactors rely on liquid fuel—a mixture of salts containing fissile material. This design allows for higher operating temperatures, better fuel efficiency, and enhanced safety. It also opens the door to new applications, including compact nuclear systems for ships and remote installations.

Jeff Latkowski, senior vice president of TerraPower and program director for the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor, said, “The Molten Chloride Fast Reactor represents a paradigm shift in the nuclear fuel cycle, and MCRE will directly inform the commercialization of that reactor.”

Microreactor Developer Antares Raises $96M in Series B Funding

Idaho Falls, ID, based nuclear startup Antares announced it has raised $96 million in Series B funding to fund further development of its microreactor.

Investors include Shine Capital with participation from Alt Capital, Caffeinated, FiftyThree Stations, Industrious, and others, consists of $71 million in equity and $25 million in debt.

Antares says it is targeting commercial, defense, and space-based applications with its R1 microreactor. The reactors is expected to produce between 100 KW and 1 MW electricity. The design uses TRISO fuel. Sodium heat pipes enable redundant, high-temperature, entirely passive heat transfer. Simple recuperated N2 closed Brayton cycle enables efficient power conversion at < 300 psi.

The firm reports on its website that in 2025 it hit critical design and safety milestones including Conceptual Design Review (CDR) and Nuclear Safety Design Agreement (NDSA). The firm is conducting hardware development at a new 145,000 sq-ft facility in Torrance, CA to accelerate in-house manufacturing. It initiated fabrication of TRISO fuel that will support multiple reactor demonstrations.

In August, Antares was named one of 11 participants in the Department of Energy’s reactor pilot program. The goal of the program, which has 10 other competing participants, is for three of them to demonstrate criticality of their respective reactors by July 2026.

In terms of future milestones, in 2026 the firm plans to complete the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) and Preliminary Documented Safety Analysis (PDSA), along with finishing qualification campaigns for a majority of the reactor’s subsystems including the core, heat exchanger, and power conversion system.

In 2027, the firm plans to manufacture, assemble, and turn on a full-power, electricity-producing advanced reactor. It will have completed all remaining design, operations, and safety reviews in partnership with Idaho National Laboratory, Department of Energy, and others. Key actions include evaluating reactor performance and validate system design ahead of producing additional demonstration and customer units in 2028.

TAE Technologies and UKAEA Partner to Commercialize Fusion Power

A joint venture with TAE Technologies and the UK Atomic Energy Agency (UKAEA) will develop neutral beams for fusion and non-fusion applications establishing a critical supply chain and a high paying jobs. The UK government plans to make an equity investment of GBP5.6 million ($7.4 million) in this new venture. TAE has raised $1.3 billion since its launch from private investors.

TAE Technologies, a U.S. private fusion energy firm announced a bilateral and reciprocal investment commitment with the United Kingdom’s national fusion laboratory, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to commercialize TAE’s proprietary particle accelerator technology for the global market.

At the center of the partnership is the new joint venture TAE Beam UK. It is a collaborative entity that will develop particle accelerator technology beginning with neutral beams for fusion. The venture aims to design, develop, and ultimately manufacture and service neutral beams for a wide range of fusion approaches, as well as adapt the accelerator technology for state-of-the-art cancer therapeutics, and other applications like food safety and homeland security.

TAE, with more than two decades of patented intellectual property and particle accelerator R&D, is an industry leader in neutral beams, which are critical for commercial fusion. For a fusion machine to produce electricity, it must keep plasma steadily confined at fusion-relevant conditions.

On TAE’s current fusion machine, eight powerful neutral beams are placed at precise angles to meet those requirements. Inside each neutral beam canister, protons are accelerated and then combined with electrons to create a stream of neutral, high-energy hydrogen atoms (a.k.a., the ‘neutral beam’).

Because the particles have no charge, they can bypass the fusion reactor’s magnetic field to provide heating, current drive and plasma stability. TAE is the first to use neutral beams for both FRC plasma formation and high-quality plasma sustainment – resulting in a streamlined design that is smaller, more efficient and more cost-effective.

The same accelerator technology that produced TAE’s sophisticated neutral beam system for fusion has also been adapted for TAE’s medtech subsidiary, TAE Life Sciences, to provide a non-invasive, targeted treatment for complex and often inoperable cancers.

TAE Beam UK will operate out of UKAEA’s Culham Campus, in Oxfordshire, U.K., establishing a global hub for fusion technology. TAE already has additional facilities in the UK; its power management subsidiary, TAE Power Solutions, is based in the West Midlands – and TAE Beam UK. Together these entities will anchor a fusion supply chain.

Google Continues as a Major Partner with TAE

Last June Google took part in a $150 million funding round of TAE Technologies. Google says it has been associated with TAE since 2015, when Google Research collaborated with the company, applying AI to drive improvements in plasma temperature and lifetime. The project plans to deliver the first short-pulse beams within 18-24 months of the start of work.

Google’s integration into TAE’s engineering teams has helped the company unlock a practical path to economic fusion and was instrumental in enabling the technical breakthrough that now paves the way for TAE’s next milestone: validating net energy capability in its Copernicus reactor. Google’s renewed commitment to TAE follows a thorough technical and commercial evaluation of TAE’s distinctive fusion approach.

IAEA Signs Agreement with Atomic Canyon for AI Software

The IAEA has signed an agreement with Atomic Canyon developing AI-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector. Under this pact, the IAEA and Atomic Canyon will explore opportunities for collaboration and evaluate a proof of concept to lay the groundwork for AI solutions in nuclear information management.

IAEA Director General Mariano Grossi and Trey Lauderdale, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Atomic Canyon, signed an agreement to advance cooperation on AI models that help navigate IAEA publications and other open resources.

In a press statement, Atomic Canyon said, “This isn’t just a milestone for us, it’s a turning point for the industry. Together with the IAEA, we’re building the frameworks, benchmarks, and guidelines that will define how AI transforms nuclear operations worldwide, from design and licensing to maintenance and regulatory reviews.”

CEO Trey Lauderdale said in a post on Linkedin, “Every aspect of the nuclear power lifecycle is going to be transformed.” And now, American innovation will help lead that transformation on a global scale.”

The signing ceremony took place at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria as global energy and technology leaders met at IAEA headquarters on 12/03/25 in Vienna for the first ever International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Nuclear Energy.

The two-day event included senior representatives from government ministries, international organizations, the nuclear industry and major tech firms — including Google and Oracle — to discuss how nuclear energy can help meet the surging electricity demand of AI data centers, and how AI can support nuclear technology development. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said at the opening ceremony:

“Two forces are reshaping humanity’s horizon at an unprecedented pace: the rise of artificial intelligence and the global transition towards clean, reliable energy. The world’s energy map is being redrawn before our eyes. The essential point, our opportunity and our responsibility, is that these forces are not unfolding separately. They are converging and redefining the new global economy.”

With regard to the partnership with Atomic Canyon he added that nuclear energy is the only source capable of low-carbon generation, round-the-clock reliability, high power density, grid stability and scalability. He described the link between nuclear and AI as structural alliance of “Atoms for Algorithms.”

Studsvik To Provide Key Reactor Design and Verification System For Romania SMR

Software will verify core and operational safety of NuScale reactor

(NucNet) Studsvik has announced its first sale of design evaluation and verification software to a small modular reactor (SMR) utility customer. Sweden-based Studsvik, which offers technical services to the nuclear power industry, said RoPower Nuclear SA in Romania has selected Studsvik’s Core Management System 5 (CMS5) as its methodology to support the country’s first SMR project.

Romania is planning to build what could be the first European SMR power station using six, 77 MW reactor modules deigned by US-based NuScale.

RoPower Nuclear, the joint venture established for the SMR project, intends to use NuScale’s technology for the facility at a former coal site in Doicesti, about 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest.

With CMS5, RoPower will be equipped to perform the design evaluation and verification of the SMR plant’s core and operational safety. Studsvik said.

“This new collaboration with RoPower extends the use of Studsvik’s proven technology from the reactor designer to the first utility deploying an SMR fleet,” a statement said.

Final Investment Decision for NuScale Romania Project Delayed

Delay is due to a change in ownership among the Romanian firms involved in the project

New customers for NuScale expected since NRC approved the firm’s 77 MW SMR design

(NucNet) The final investment decision for a 462 MW small modular reactor (SMR) at a former coal plant site in Romania could be delayed to early 2027, according to John Hopkins, chief executive officer of US-based reactor developer NuScale.

RoPower Nuclear, the joint venture established for the SMR project, intends to use NuScale’s technology for the facility in Doicesti, about 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest.

NuScale expected RoPower to make the final investment decision early in the second quarter of 2026 at the latest. It is scheduled to be made after the completion of the front-end engineering design (Feed) process. US engineering and construction company Fluor was hired for the job in July, with its subsidiary NuScale as a subcontractor. Infrastructure from the former coal-fired power plant has now been removed. The company is working with Fluor regarding input for the final investment decision.

Hopkins clarified the project is alive and kicking.

“RoPower and the Romanian government continue to pay their bills, and we’re keeping our finger on the pulse and watching it very closely. We have almost weekly conversations on progress”, of the Feed study. The final investment decision looks to be probably between mid-to-late 2026 and early 2027.”

RoPower Nuclear intends to deploy six 77 MW NuScale reactor modules at the planned facility. Deployment had originally been scheduled for around 2029.

The RoPower joint venture is undergoing a change in ownership. Its current owners, each with 50%, are now state-controlled Nuclearelectrica, which operates Romania’s only nuclear plant, Cernavodă, and Nova Power and Gas, a subsidiary of E-Infra, a Romanian group of companies with operations in energy and telecom infrastructure, energy and civil construction.

Last year the US official export credit agency, the Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank), approved a financial commitment of up to $99 Million to support the development of the Doicesti SMR project.

NuScale CEO Bullish on Prospects for New Customers

NuScale Power aims to have “hard contracts” with “two or three major customers” by the end of 2025, chief executive officer John Hopkins told investors and analysts in a 3Q2025 briefing.

NuScale and its developer partner Entra1, a US-based energy production company which is developing, financing and owning plants, have yet to ink a binding contract, but Hopkins said, “we’re getting inundated now” with prospective customers following the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) approval in May of NuScale’s 77-MW power module. Entra1 holds the global exclusive rights to the commercialization, distribution and deployment of NuScale’s SMRs.

According to Hopkins, NuScale’s 77-MW module supplanted an earlier 50-MW design the NRC approved in 2023. Some prospective customers had been waiting as the commission considered NuScale’s application for the uprated module.

INL Selects 1st Round of Firms for MARVEL Experiments

The Idaho National Laboratory announced initial selections for the Microreactor Application Research Validation and Evaluation (MARVEL) end user experiments. The five competitively selected teams will demonstrate several test cases, including desalination of remote operations and advanced sensors.

Marvel is a liquid metal thermal reactor. It uses UZrH TRIGA Fuel with enrichment 19.75 U235. MARVEL is to be installed at INL’s Materials and Fuels Complex in 2027. (MARVEL Fact Sheet PDF File)

The experiments will also be among the first to demonstrate the viability of powering data centers with advanced nuclear technologies, a cutting-edge use of nuclear energy that ensures America remains the leader in innovation to dominate the artificial intelligence race.

“Nowhere else in the world will you find this level of support for public sector innovation in nuclear energy,” said John Jackson, national technical director for the Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy’s Microreactor Program.

MARVEL is a sodium-potassium-cooled microreactor that is being developed by the Department of Energy. It will generate 85 KW of thermal energy and up to 20 KW of electricity. Slated to be at the Transient Reactor Test Facility at the Idaho National Laboratory, MARVEL will provide a platform where the private sector can gain access to an operational microreactor to demonstrate innovative new use cases for the technology.

The following companies were selected as the first potential end users for MARVEL. The next step will be for them to work with Department of Energy and national laboratory staff members to create implementation plans for their proposed projects:

Amazon Web Services Inc. proposes coupling the MARVEL reactor with a modular data center, a new service that makes it simple and cost-effective for defense and government agencies to build data centers anywhere in the world by enabling the creation of a self-sustaining, rapidly deployable system that can operate independently of traditional power infrastructure.

DCX USA and Arizona State University propose to use MARVEL to demonstrate the feasibility of a microreactor to power a data center for artificial intelligence to yield valuable data on how to provide a stable, continuous power supply capable of handling the unique demands of AI processing.

General Electric Vernova proposes to use MARVEL to demonstrate remote and autonomous reactor operations and establish controls standards for broader application of the technology with commercial reactors.

Radiation Detection Technologies Inc. proposes to use MARVEL to test advanced high-performance sensor technologies that could help monitor the performance of advanced reactors.

Shepherd Power, NOV and ConocoPhillips propose to leverage MARVEL for a pilot-scale desalination project using nuclear-generated process heat to demonstrate the viability of advanced nuclear energy for addressing produced water challenges in oil and gas operations.

Selected firms will coordinate with national laboratory experts to determine the feasibility of their proposed application using MARVEL. This may lead to the opportunity to use MARVEL for demonstration. Final agreements for proposed projects are anticipated to be announced in 2026.

INL Fuel Rods Mimic Nature

INL scientists are experimenting with a fuel concept that replaces traditional cylindrical rods with a continuous 3D lattice modelled on triply periodic minimal surfaces that mimic patterns found in nature.

Early tests show the Influx design can transfer heat roughly three times more efficiently than conventional fuel rods while improving neutron interactions in the core.

The team is now evaluating which reactor types stand to gain the most from the geometry and whether TPMS-based heat exchangers could provide a practical bridge to full fuel adoption.

He called the Biden-era decision to lay a path for their removal “crazy.” “That’s an energy subtraction policy and the Trump administration, we’re about energy addition,” Wright said.
But not just any type of energy, federal policies show.
“Today we’ve got less than 10 minutes of storage from batteries across the country,” Wright said.
The federal government has been aggressively fighting wind and solar energy projects, even blocking permits for many projects, especially offshore wind.","ICE HARBOR DAM — U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright arrived in the Tri-Cities this week on a tour of some of Washington state’s energy infrastructure, including a dam on the Lower Snake River.

The visit comes on the heels of President Donald Trump exploding a hard-fought deal this summer over river operations that could have led to dam removal to help struggling salmon runs.

Wright underscored the administration’s position, and reinforced a series of contradictions rife within the administration’s energy policies.

This country needs more electricity, Wright said on a gray and rainy morning overlooking the Ice Harbor Dam outside of Burbank, Walla Walla County: affordable and dispatchable energy, and these dams represent both.

“Everything we can do to lower the price of electricity, lower the price of gasoline, lower the price of energy of all kinds,” Wright said. “That’s what makes people’s lives better. That’s what makes businesses and opportunities thrive in our country.”

Wright inflated the importance of the Lower Snake River dams to the electrical grid but sidestepped the environmental consequences, moves likely taken as salt in the wound by those who fought for the 2023 Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, which provided a path to remove the four dams on the Lower Snake River.

The federal government, under the Biden administration, committed $1 billion to the work, which would have included boosting clean-energy production led by tribal nations and replacing other services of the dams, like transportation and irrigation infrastructure.

President Donald Trump in June clawed back the agreement.

The four dams offer 3,000 megawatts of electricity, Wright said. He called the Biden-era decision to lay a path for their removal “crazy.”

“That’s an energy subtraction policy and the Trump administration, we’re about energy addition,” Wright said.

In reality, the four dams generate perhaps a third that much electricity every year, even less during droughts, which are becoming more common in our region as the planet warms. And while the administration has backed some types of energy projects (largely fossil fuel and nuclear), it has repeatedly attacked renewable power sources like wind, solar and battery storage while rejecting the growing body of scientific evidence warning of climate change.

Advertising

Wright’s tour covered a series of facilities left reeling this year by federal budget cuts and layoffs. Now they’re hiring again, Wright said.

The administration wants American energy dominance, but is undercutting a wide range of once-booming electrical projects.

The country badly needs more energy and affordable energy. But not just any type of energy, federal policies show. Wind and solar don’t much qualify, and Wright downplayed the ability of battery storage, which can be paired with renewables to make power available when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.

“Today we’ve got less than 10 minutes of storage from batteries across the country,” Wright said.

As of last year, the country’s grid had about 26 gigawatt hours of battery storage in use, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That figure is expected to perhaps triple by the end of the decade, Canary Media reported this fall.

For context, energy demand for all of Seattle City Light’s customers peaked at around 2 gigawatt hours.

Should the country invest in these growing battery storage technologies? Not at the expense of government subsidies, Wright said.

The Trump administration slashed billions of dollars in renewable energy subsidies this summer. Washington alone stands to lose an estimated $8.7 billion in clean-energy investment funding.

Instead, the administration is now doubling down on subsidies for fossil fuels. Wright, himself a former fracking executive, downplayed the significance of that shift, however.

“There are no meaningful subsidies on fossil fuels,” he said.

For years the federal government has subsidized the fossil fuel industry, to the tune of an estimated $34 billion each year. And Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” looks to add an additional $4 billion in subsidies annually over the next decade, for a total of $40 billion more from the federal government.

Energy projects should compete on a level playing field, Wright said Thursday morning.

The federal government has been aggressively fighting wind and solar energy projects, even blocking permits for many projects, especially offshore wind. At the same time the administration is pushing to keep fossil fuel plants open longer.

State law in Washington requires the closure of all coal plants by the end of the year, and requires the state to free its electrical grid of greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. The federal government’s repeated attacks on new renewable projects is making it increasingly difficult and time-consuming to build new sources of electricity.

Federal officials say they’re pursuing affordable energy and working to bring prices down. During the campaign, Trump promised to halve electricity rates within the year.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12042025_TZR_Chris_Wright-2_tzr_135816.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-05 11:05:29.505636

I've never been happier to be wrong. It turns out that the new iX3, which packs 400 miles of range, some next-level charging speeds, impressive performance and a leap ahead in technology from past electric BMWs, will start around $60,000 in the United States.

Granted, that's not exactly cheap. But it's also not mind-bogglingly expensive. In fact, it's pretty comparable to a nicely equipped gas-powered BMW X3, but with some of the best specs we've seen so far from any modern EV.

We're going to talk about why we're excited for the iX3 on this week's Plugged-In Podcast.

My co-host Tim Levin drove the iX3 in Spain recently, and you should check out his article and video review if you haven't already. But it's clear from his experience, and other glowing reviews we've seen, that BMW's first 800-volt EV is a cut way above even the good stuff the automaker has cranked out so far.

And it's nearly at cost parity with the gas X3. That's the important part, really. Isn't this what we've all been waiting for? An EV that's priced well, packed with great specs, and can stand on its own in the marketplace without needing tax credits and subsidies to make a case for itself? I think so, and I'm excited for more EVs like this in the years to come.

But the iX3 launches at a tough time in America. Just this week, President Donald Trump finished the work of gutting fuel economy regulations, which means gas-car drivers will pay more at the pump and automakers have less incentive to advance their electric fleets by the 2030s. We'll dig into the downstream effects of that policy change.

And then Tim scored a great interview with John Harris, cofounder and CEO of Harbinger Motors, about the future of commercial EVs—and what automakers are getting wrong about the whole electric market. Harris has a lot of hard truths for the whole field, so I suggest tuning into their full chat.

Nexus 7 Elements LLC formed to deploy CHIPS™ technology across ACRG’s nationwide critical minerals operations

RENO, Nev., Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Clean Resources Group Inc. (OTC: ACRG), a critical minerals processing company, announced the formation of Nexus 7 Elements LLC, a joint venture with Energ4 Mining Company LLC to commercialize rare earth element and mineral recovery technology across ACRG’s processing hub network.

“By combining our feedstock access and infrastructure with Energ4's CHIPS™ technology, we're creating a scalable platform to help meet America’s demand for domestically sourced critical minerals,” said Tawana Bain, CEO and chairwoman of ACRG. “This joint venture supports our mission to recover valuable minerals responsibly and strengthen national security and clean energy goals.”

Beyond mining tailings, the joint venture positions ACRG to process coal ash, fly ash and legacy coal dumps, feedstocks abundant in the eastern United States, especially Appalachia. These materials contain concentrations of rare earth elements and critical minerals, and their processing supports domestic supply chains and remediation of legacy energy sites. This extends ACRG’s CMPH strategy from the western United States to a national footprint.

The joint venture combines ACRG’s feedstocks, infrastructure and public platform with Energ4's patented Clean Mineral Processing – CHIPS™ (Chemelectrosonication Ionization Precipitation System) technology for extracting rare earth elements from existing feedstocks of gold, silver, platinum-group metals and vanadium. The REEs from these feedstocks are critical to U.S. manufacturing independence for renewable energy technologies (wind turbines, EVs), military equipment, electronics, key automotive components and chemical manufacturing.

“This partnership with ACRG is about building plants, not science projects,” said Trever Leamon, CEO of Energ4 Mining Company LLC. “ACRG's critical minerals processing hub is the place to run CHIPS™ at full commercial speed on domestic feedstocks and prove how effectively we can recover rare earths and other critical minerals from material already here in the United States. It’s a step toward cutting dependence on imported minerals and proving this platform can scale.”

Work will begin at the 207-acre site in Winnie, Texas, which offers expansion capacity and outdoor processing areas with access to shipping channels, Interstate 10 and air transportation. The facility will test and validate CHIPS™ technology across domestic feedstocks and support scale-up and applications for federal funding for commercial deployment, with the site serving as a technology development and customer testing center before commercial deployment at ACRG’s critical minerals processing hub in Nevada. Commercial-scale deployment is expected within 12 to 18 months, a rapid timeline for bringing a new critical minerals recovery technology to market, with additional hubs planned across the western United States as the model is proven.

Critical Minerals Processing Hub Model

Nexus 7 Elements will serve as the technology backbone for ACRG's critical minerals processing hub strategy. Rather than developing traditional mining operations, the CMPH model establishes regional processing centers that:

process tailings and other feedstocks from multiple sources in a geographic region

prove technologies like CHIPS™ to recover minerals efficiently

minimize environmental impact through closed-loop processing systems

create centralized infrastructure that can serve multiple feedstock suppliers

support domestic supply chains for minerals essential to clean energy and national security

The first CMPH deployment will be at ACRG's facility in Nevada, with additional hubs planned across the western United States as the model is proven and scaled.

Transaction Structure

Under the terms of the agreement:

ACRG holds 51 percent ownership through its wholly owned subsidiary, providing governance oversight and strategic direction

Energ4’s newly formed entity holds 49 percent ownership and will manage day-to-day operations

Energ4’s team will serve in key operational roles, including CEO and president of the joint venture

Technology Overview

The CHIPS™ technology is a multi-stage electrochemical and sonochemical process that selectively recovers precious metals, platinum-group metals, rare earth elements and other critical minerals from tailings, clays and other complex feedstocks. The process emphasizes:

high recovery rates across multiple target elements

minimal environmental impact through closed-loop water and reagent recycling

scalability from pilot to commercial operations

compatibility with diverse feedstock types

recovery of rare earth elements from coal ash, fly ash and legacy coal materials, enabling CMPH expansion into eastern U.S. feedstock regions

Strategic Benefits

For ACRG:

access to proven REE and critical mineral processing technology

capability to process diverse feedstocks across the CMPH network

stronger positioning for Department of Energy grants

expanded revenue streams beyond precious metals recovery

alignment with federal priorities for domestic critical mineral production

For Energ4:

access to feedstocks and processing infrastructure

a public company platform for capital formation and partnerships

opportunity to demonstrate technology at commercial scale

partnership with a NYSE-bound entity with institutional relationships

For U.S. critical minerals strategy:

advancement of domestic rare earth element processing capacit

reduced dependence on foreign sources

support for clean energy and national security supply chains

demonstration of responsible extraction methods

Market Opportunity

The United States imports more than 80 percent of its rare earth elements, and China controls about 70 percent of global processing capacity. Rare earth elements and critical minerals are designated as essential to national security, energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. With bipartisan recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities, federal agencies including the Departments of Defense and Energy continue to allocate resources to domestic production. This policy consensus, combined with demand from defense, technology and clean energy sectors, creates a strong market for domestic processing.

ACRG and Energ4 believe Nexus 7 Elements is positioned to capitalize through:

domestic feedstocks that require no new mining

processing technology applicable to multiple feedstock types

a strategic location in Nevada, a tier-one mining jurisdiction

alignment with federal funding priorities

a scalable CMPH model that will expand across the United States

We also hosted a Black Climate Leadership Summit in October this year, which provided a dedicated space for connection, vision and strategy for Black leaders advancing climate justice across regions and sectors.","Taproot Earth is a frontline-rooted climate justice organization with roots in the Gulf South and Appalachia and partners across the Global Black diaspora. In this Q&A, Eliane Lakam, campaign manager of global climate reparations at Taproot Earth, shares how they are building power across borders to advance global climate reparations—from convening more than 200 Black and Indigenous leaders from 22 countries to craft a shared working statement on climate reparations, to bringing frontline voices into international climate negotiations at COP30 in Brazil.

Q: Can you share what the “People’s Movement Assembly Process” is and looks like in practice?

A: The People’s Movement Assembly organizing process centers the voices and experiences of grassroots leadership on the front lines. It has a long tradition in Global South movements and in the radical Black tradition of southern U.S. freedom movements. This process facilitates community self-governance, bringing together frontline leaders to build shared analysis, identify challenges, cultivate and name solutions, and make collective decisions that build the power and systems of democracy needed to advance self-determination and sovereignty.

In August 2024, Taproot Earth convened more than 200 frontline community leaders from 22 countries, representing Black and Indigenous leaders who bear the worth impacts of the climate crisis. Through a democratic decision-making process modeled after a People’s Movement Assembly, these leaders crafted the following working statement:

“[Global] Climate reparations is the restoration of healthy and balanced relationships with all that comprise a shared global ecosystem. Reparative action begins with those who benefit most from the historic and current systems of oppression. It requires the abolition of debt, restitution for injustice and the establishment of accountable systems rooted in Black and Indigenous liberation for all oppressed people and future generations.”

This statement guided Taproot Earth’s engagements at COP30 in Belém Brazil. It shaped our involvement in the People’s Summit, where we co-facilitated two sessions with cross-regional partners, including CIDSE, SINFRAJUPE, CLOC, the World Council of Churches, Development and Peace—Caritas Canada, and KAIROS Canada. Some have worked with us to advance Global Climate Reparations within the Church and have helped carry frontline solutions into global civil society spaces. Their partnership has been essential in continuing the vision of the people’s movement assembly process and strengthening the push for climate reparations in multiple venues.

At the summit, Taproot also supported the implementation of language justice infrastructure. This infrastructure will serve tens of thousands of grassroot movement participants and frontline communities from more than 60 nations. Advancing language justice has been a core commitment of ours. We share lessons learned from Kenya, Rome and other convenings to strengthen partners’ capacity to create accessible spaces. Taproot also co-facilitated a global mapping activity on false vs. real climate solutions. The statement also informed our interventions in press conferences and panel discussions in the Blue Zone and our convenings with faith communities, Brazilian leaders and other global frontline partners.

In these critical spaces, the decisions and statements developed through the Assembly in Kenya were carried forward and opened for deeper engagement and collective action.

Why is it important to foster connections among climate justice leaders in the Gulf South, Appalachia region and Global South? What opportunities come from those connections?

A: It’s often said that you cannot tie a knot with one hand, and the same is true for climate justice. Fostering connections among leaders from the Gulf South, Appalachia, and the Global South is essential because these regions share intertwined histories shaped by colonial legacies and extractive economies that have fueled the climate crisis.

They also share some of the richest traditions of resistance, care and frontline-led solutions. Even across different geographies, they are fighting the same systems: fossil fuel expansion, mining, land grabs, pollution, climate migration, and the ongoing impacts of colonialism.

When leaders come together across these regions, they are able to learn from one another, develop shared analysis, create more robust, frontline-grounded solutions, deepen solidarity, and heal together.

In 2023, we hosted convenings in Cabo Verde and New York centered on Black Joy, Liberation, and Climate Reparations. These spaces were instrumental in testing assumptions, exchanging knowledge, and grounding our work in lived experience. In 2024, we continued to strengthen these bonds by launching a Global Climate Reparations Fellowship connecting leaders from the Gulf South, Appalachia, and the global Black diaspora. This initiative helped deepen our collective understanding of the climate crisis and allows us to develop stronger solutions together.

We expanded these cross-regional ties at COP30 by hosting two joint strategy sessions on Global Climate Reparations at the People’s Summit, convening lawyers working on climate justice through our Just Transition Lawyering Network, hosting intentional dinners with faith-based, Indigenous, and Afro-Brazilian leaders, and providing resources that enabled more than 20 Black Global South leaders (who otherwise would have been excluded) to attend COP30. These exchanges have been crucial in strengthening the movement, expanding opportunities for solidarity and collective action, and deepening our shared capacity to develop and implement solutions that are both well-informed and grounded in frontline realities.

What are some of the ways that communities are practicing stewardship of reclaimed land, water and energy resources?

A: Communities across the Gulf South, Appalachia and the Global South are practicing stewardship of reclaimed land, water and energy resources in ways that repair historical harm, restore ecological balance and strengthen frontline governance. This includes regenerative land management through various practices, including agroecology. Stewardship also includes safeguarding sacred sites and cultural landscapes, renewing spiritual and cultural practices tied to the land and our relationship with the Earth, and building democratic governance and resource management structures such as land trusts, cooperatives and community-controlled funds.

A tangible example is The Gulf South for a Green New Deal Community Controlled Fund , which presents a transformational model in climate justice investment. In this model, communities most impacted by the climate crisis lead in directing resources and shaping solutions that safeguard their futures.

How should public finance and other funds move to communities?

A: Public finance and other funds must move to communities in ways that repair historic harm, remove barriers to access and support community control and autonomy. This requires placing frontline communities at the center of decision-making and ensuring that climate finance is non-extractive, meaning no debt, no austerity conditions, and no cost-sharing requirements that effectively exclude those most impacted by the climate crisis.

Instead, funding should be guided by principles of Global Climate Reparations, including debt cancellation, the return of stolen resources, and other investments that repair the conditions needed for frontline communities to thrive. We must move away from finance moved through extractive loans toward grant-based and direct pay programs as well.

Climate finance must also shift from being treated as charity to being understood as repair. Taproot Earth recently released the executive summary of Toward a Liberation Economy of Climate Finance, a climate finance report that offers some insights on how funds should move to communities.

How have you convened global community leaders and partners?

A: At Taproot Earth, convening global community leaders and partners is central to our work. Last year, we brought together more than 200 Black and Indigenous frontline leaders from 22 countries for the Global Climate Reparations Assembly in Nairobi, Kenya, where participants drafted a shared working statement on Global Climate Reparations (GCR).

Building on this foundation, we facilitated a Jubilee Convening on Global Climate Reparations in Rome in March this Jubilee year, bringing more than 100 frontline and Catholic leaders together in the spirit of synodality to advance the GCR statement within the Catholic Church and help repair our broken relationship with each other and the Earth.

One of our key convenings this year was Katrina 20 in the Gulf South, which brought movement elders and allies together to reflect on two decades of post-Katrina and chart a people-led path forward. At the heart of this convening was the Monarch Forum, a two-day gathering dedicated to sharing testimony, lessons and visions on climate migration and to advance the rights to remain, migrate and return.

We also hosted a Black Climate Leadership Summit in October this year, which provided a dedicated space for connection, vision and strategy for Black leaders advancing climate justice across regions and sectors. We expanded this global convening work at COP30 in Belém by creating intentional spaces and opportunities for frontline leaders to build relationships, learn from each other and move together. Leaders from our Gulf South to Appalachia (GS2A) Governance Assemblies and our GCR assembly in Kenya remain interwoven in all of our gatherings, and all these spaces are part of our ongoing strategy to continue to strengthen movement infrastructure and build power to advance the climate solutions our communities deserve.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/Taproot-Earth-Nov-2025.jpeg,N,,2025-12-05 11:06:10.056130

Fission startup First American Nuclear Co. is developing a power plant, first using natural gas and then shifting to a reactor expected to run on fuel produced from its own nuclear waste.

The Indiana-based company expects to start delivering electricity in 2028 using gas, and then deploy its liquid-metal fast reactor by 2032, according to Chief Executive Officer Mike Reinboth. The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

“Data centers are driving the demand for power,” he said.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.
