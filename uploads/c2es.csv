And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models.","(CNN) — Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1, leaving automakers and car buyers wondering where prices will go.

The tax credit, which was passed in 2022 as part of the Biden administration’s legislative push to support EVs and green energy, is going away as part of President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill that passed in July. The move came after US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

The end of the tax credit means demand for EVs is expected to fall, which means prices in real terms will rise — a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September. But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.

With fewer people buying EVs in the coming months, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand. But it’s not clear how much savings that will provide buyers, and it likely won’t make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US electric vehicles rose more than three times as fast as the 2% rise in non-electric passenger vehicles, according to data from the BTS.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

“If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms or cash-back offers for buyers.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

“I think we’ll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,” Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won’t kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they’ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey from Cox found that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment, were all more important factors than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models. It’s not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won’t necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a “moving target,” said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

“I think there’s going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,” Green said.

Car shopping experts report a surge in consumer demand for EVs as the deadline approaches.

Some analysts predict a significant drop in EV sales once the federal incentive is no longer available.

Car shopping experts say consumers are rushing to buy electric vehicles as the clock winds down to just seven days before the federal EV tax credit expires on Sept. 30.

But some warn that once the incentives are gone, EV sales will all but halt.

As part of the mega-tax bill signed into law in July, the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit was pushed up to Sept. 30 from its original expiration date of 2032. That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying new EV, and up to $4,000 on a used EV is closing in.

New data from car-shopping website Cars.com released on Sept. 18 showed that nearly half of consumers considering buying an EV are now accelerating their purchases. Cars.com said demand on its site is up 33% for new EVs compared with this time a year ago. And demand for used EVs is up by 22% compared with the year-ago period.

Cars.com said nearly three-fourths of consumers surveyed said the federal credit is a ""major or contributing factor"" in their decision to purchase an EV. Cars.com said it conducted the survey Aug. 25-26 and said it got 950 respondents.

Cars.com said its research showed that 70% of EV and plug-in hybrid shoppers are aware of the federal tax credit, and just over half, or 53%, know when it ends.

How long will incentives last?

The federal EV tax credit helped make EVs more affordable. While its expiration at the end of the month might slow demand in the near term, it doesn’t mean the end of affordable EVs, said Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief at Cars.com.

“Shoppers are moving quickly to lock in savings, and Cars.com’s Top EV Picks, including the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Ioniq 5, Kia EV9 and Chevrolet Equinox EV, show there are strong options for every type of buyer,"" Bragman said in a statement. ""And even after Sept. 30, deals won’t disappear — many state and local incentives remain, and automakers like Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai have already announced new lower-priced models. ”

Karl Brauer,executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said once the federal tax credit ends, EV sales are ""going to crater. It’s going to be quite the whipsaw effect. You’ve got the rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives now ... but what’s going to happen in the next three to six months? There’ll be almost no buyers.”

Brauer said EVs comprise about 8% of the total U.S. new vehicle marketshare, he expects that to drop to 1% to 3% by year's end and settle in at 4% of total marketshare by early next year.

""The consumer is going to think, 'I don’t get $7,500 off the car and it already is priced more than a gasoline vehicle ... and it loses range in cold weather so, why am I buying this car?' "" Brauer said.

Edmunds.com's Director of Insights Ivan Drury said his data also showed that as the EV tax credit deadline nears, shoppers are beginning to at least research EVs at a higher rate than all last year. He said there is still rich inventory for buyers to choose from if they do decide to go electric.

""Availability shouldn't be too much of an issue, EVs still make up 4.2% or roughly one out of every 25 pieces of inventory on dealer lots,"" Drury said, citing that data as of Sept. 21. ""This is down from the same time last year at 5.6%, but needless to say, past the 30th, there will certainly be inventory, the only question is what kind of deals will there be?""

Affordability the key to adoption

Many automakers have said the key to accelerating mass adoption of EVs is to offer more EVs for a cheaper price point, especially if the automakers are to compete with the Chinese globally for EV marketshare. The Chinese automakers are known for making high-quality and affordable EVs.

According to Cox Automotive, the average transaction price of a new EV in August was $57,245, a slight decrease of 0.1% year-over-year. The average transaction price is what car buyers paid after incentives and trade-in amounts were deducted from the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Cox Automotive said EVs carry an average price premium of $9,000 above the average transaction price of gasoline-powered vehicle.

Ford Motor Co., which saw sales of its EVs soar in August driven largely by the nation's car buyers hurrying to get ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, announced in August the creation of a new electric vehicle production system and a new EV platform that will allow the automaker to more efficiently bring several lower-cost EVs to market in the future. The first of those will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup that seats five, to launch in 2027. That vehicle is expected to be priced at about $30,000.

Dealers expect slower sales going forward

At Cox Automotive, spokesman Mark Schirmer said, ""While we don't have a shareable measure on September yet, the activity in August was strong and total new EV sales blew past the previous monthly all-time sales record by 7.5%.""

Schirmer said the previous EV sales record was in December 2024 when the industry sold about 135,000 new EVs. In August, the industry sold 146,000.

Schirmer said a majority of franchised automobile dealers, according to Cox Automotive's quarterly sentiment index, believe that the tax credits offered by the government are having ""a positive effect on EV sales at their dealership.""

But, similar to Brauer's prediction, dealers expect EV sales to halt after the incentives dry up.

When asked about expectation for EV sales three months from now, the majority of dealers expected sales to be declining, Schirmer said. He said third-quarter 2023 was the last time franchised dealers expected ""growing EV sales"" in the next three months, ""but the third-quarter 2025 score was the lowest we've ever seen.""

Last month, Cars.com said new EV inventory grew by 1.4% compared with August 2024, with Chevrolet and Honda scaling back supply due to five EV launches last year as most other brands expanded. They did not provide a figure for how many new EVs remain in inventory.

Sales of used EVs pick up

On the used side, inventory is moving faster this year — spending just 46 days on the lot in August, down from 66 days the same time a year ago, Cars.com said. Tesla, which makes up about one-third of used EV listings, saw average prices fall 16.2% year-over-year, pulling the overall used-EV average down 3.8%. A spokesman for Cars.com did not provide the average transaction price for used Tesla.

With 77 EV models now available, Cars.com’s editors identified the best EVs for 2026 looking at value, use, performance and technology and selected the following models for their range, affordability, family-friendliness and technological innovation as follows:

Best value EV — The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV which starts at $33,600. Cars.com showed the feedback on it is that it has speedy DC fast-charging capability and multiple regenerative-braking settings.

Constellation’s restart announcement stands as a defining moment for American nuclear power, riding a wave of public support and launching widespread commercial interest in nuclear energy to power the digital economy and strengthen grid reliability

LONDONDERRY, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.”

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, “In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power. As an all-of-the-above energy Governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear. I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians.”

Project Milestones Achieved in the Past Year

Workforce and Site Development

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain an NRC license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside significant enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and Regulatory Progress

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a dedicated Restart Panel overseeing comprehensive review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan. A video on his legacy can be viewed on our website.

Continued progress with state and local environmental agencies to secure permits for water usage and environmental protection.

Economic Impact and Community Engagement

An independent economic study confirmed the plant will result in approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, over $16 billion added to Pennsylvania’s GDP and more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

Constellation is making good on its commitment to community investment, including more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations. In 2025, the company donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Crane’s community engagement manager Dave Marcheskie has been meeting frequently with residents and community groups to gather feedback and offer philanthropic support. Follow Crane’s progress on our website and recently launched Instagram channel @CraneUnit1.

The invitation-only event brought together policymakers, scientists, food industry leaders, nonprofit organizations, and cultural influencers to explore the intersection of food loss and waste, climate action, consumer behavior, and scalable innovations. Panelists focused on how food waste solutions offer a win-win for multiple crises facing the world today.

“You can’t really talk about climate change without talking about food waste,” says Luiz Beling, CEO of Apeel Sciences.

Speakers agreed that tackling food waste is one of the most immediately effective climate solutions that countries, communities, and individuals can implement right now.

“You get food out of landfills today, and you’re saving methane emissions within the year,” says Dana Gunders, President of ReFED, who is seeing positivity around food waste solutions from both sides of the political aisle in the United States.

“It has to be a whole of society approach…We have to press upon the leaders of the world to work together on climate,” says Jamil Ahmad, Director, New York Office, UN Environment Programme.

Multiple speakers pointed to portion sizes as a low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing food waste. Research supports this: According to Gunders, 59 percent of people surveyed say they would go to a different restaurant if it offered different portion sizes.

“The most impactful thing we can do to decrease food waste is changing portion sizes…Giving consumers options like that can enable them to make changes,” says Roni Neff, Professor at Johns Hopkins University, who researches ways to reduce food waste and address climate change through food systems.

And technology plays a big role: Harry Chrispin, Senior Manager of ESG EMEA at Hilton, uses the artificial intelligence system Winnow to track food waste in hotel kitchens automatically. With Winnow, “the previously invisible food waste in the bin is now visible, and chefs can make decisions based on that,” says Chrispin. “Just changing the way we cut fruit and portion fruit, all of these small changes can make a really big difference in food waste,” without compromising the customer experience.

Many factors influence what eaters do and don’t eat, and how they dispose of their food choices: “We make at least 200 different food decisions in a day. Many of them you don’t know you’re making,” says Caleb McClennan, President of RARE. This creates opportunities throughout each day to make positive change. But while small changes like composting and repurposing leftovers and scraps are important tools for change, consumers should also go easy on themselves, says U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree.

“You’re not going to be perfect every day of the week,” says Rep. Pingree. “But the things that you do at home…changing our habits and getting into new habits…all of these things are important to do.”

Eaters can also look to their freezers to help make small but meaningful changes to reduce food waste at home.

“Take advantage of your freezer,” says Alison Bodor, President and CEO of the American Frozen Food Institute. “Whether that’s freezing your own leftovers or buying resealable packages. Be part of the solution because it will take all of us.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Dexter, MD, says that consumers should not forget the power of their voices: “Consumer behavior needs to drive the changes,” she says. “If we are demanding it, it’s easier for people like me to pass the laws.”

“As someone who represents about 800,000 people, getting that outreach really drives our perspective. Reaching out to your elected leaders, sharing what you want—even if you know they’re not aligned—is really important,” says Rep. Dexter. “Americans need to demand better from their government. Politicians need to demand more from themselves.”

Stacy Blondin, Behavioral Science Associate at the World Resources Institute, emphasizes that while there is a significant consumer will to reduce waste, eaters need support from the government, nonprofit, and private sectors. “A large percentage of Americans are already motivated to reduce food waste, but we need these underlying societal support systems” that will enable people to make meaningful change, says Blondin.

The Summit’s conversations continually turned to collaborations as an effective way to amplify change across sectors.

“Co-developing together a solution is truly energizing and powerful. Your coworkers have the answers and power; they meet the customers every day,” says Lorena Lourido Gomez, Head of IKEA Food, IKEA Retail Services, Ingka.

“Nobody really wants to waste food. People are looking for advice on how to do that,” says David Rogers, Director of International Development at WRAP. “And if you can reach people through the cities they live in or the shops they go to, you can really reach everyone.”

Michael Grunwald, Food & Climate Columnist at Canary Media and also a Contributing Writer for The New York Times Opinion, left the audience with a simple call to action for eaters:

“Eat less beef, waste less food. I can give you 50 things to do, and the other 48 combined wouldn’t have as much impact as that,” says Grunwald. And “right now, food waste is an area where we can actually make progress.”

These kinds of home improvement projects will pad your wallet in the long run and also make your house more resilient as rising global temperatures threaten communities around the world. More frequent and severe extreme weather events are one consequence of the changing climate, and that leads to power outages and increases strain on the electric grid. Clean energy solutions bolster neighborhoods and cut the production of heat-trapping gases that drive these shifts, as well as unstable dirty energy prices.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack, slashing your energy costs to or near $0. Like LG, EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted contractors, helping you save up to $10,000 on a solar system.

It's Not As Rosy[ 1 ], its broader financial performance reveals a mixed picture. This analysis examines Volvo's capital allocation strategies and their implications for long-term shareholder value, highlighting both the opportunities and risks inherent in its U.S. EV expansion.

Capital Allocation Strategies: Local Production and Cost Optimization

Volvo's approach to the U.S. EV market hinges on two pillars: localized production to mitigate tariff impacts and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The company has announced a $1.86 billion (SEK 18 billion) cost and cash action plan to offset financial pressures, including U.S. tariffs and development delaysHow U.S. Tariffs and EV Delays Caused a 64% Profit Crash at Volvo[ 2 ]. A key component of this strategy involves shifting production to its U.S. facilities, particularly in South Carolina. By 2026, Volvo will begin manufacturing its best-selling XC60 model at the Ridgeville plant, a move designed to avoid tariffs on imported vehicles and reduce costsVolvo Shifts to US Production Amid Tariffs, CEO Warns[ 3 ].

The South Carolina plant, which has already received $1.3 billion in investments over the past decadeVolvo to build its most popular car in Ridgeville[ 4 ], will also introduce a next-generation hybrid model by 2030 to cater to U.S. market preferences. This dual focus on electrification and hybrid technologies reflects Volvo's adaptability to regulatory and consumer dynamics. However, the company's recent $1.19 billion non-cash impairment charge—linked to reduced profitability for the EX90 and ES90 platforms—underscores the financial risks of delayed launches and shifting trade policiesVolvo’s billion Dollar setback: How US Tariffs and EV delays …[ 5 ].

Shareholder Value: Balancing Short-Term Pain and Long-Term Gains

Volvo's Q2 2025 financial results highlight the tension between short-term challenges and long-term strategic goals. Adjusted operating profit plummeted by 64% year-over-year, driven by U.S. tariffs and EV launch delaysAutos: Volvo Cars switches gears in the U.S. as Trump's tariffs bite[ 6 ]. Yet, the company remains committed to its 2030 target of 90–100% electrified sales (including plug-in hybrids and mild hybrids), a revision from its earlier 100% EV-only goalVolvo Cars adjusts electrification ambitions, remains committed to fully electric future[ 7 ]. This adjustment, while pragmatic, signals a recalibration of expectations in response to slower charging infrastructure rollout and evolving consumer demandVolvo Cars cuts margin aims after ditching electric[ 8 ].

For shareholders, the immediate outlook is cautious. Volvo projects an EBIT margin of 7–8% by 2026, supported by cost reductions and improved cash flowVolvo Cars adjusts core business ambitions for 2026 and beyond[ 9 ]. However, the path to profitability is fraught with headwinds. Tesla's dominance in the U.S. EV market (46% share in Q2 2025Electric Vehicle Sales and Market Share (US - Q3 2025 Updates)[ 10 ]) and regulatory changes affecting tax credit eligibility for Volvo's EVs—due to battery sourcing restrictions—pose significant challengesVolvo’s Ambitious Plans for US Electric Vehicle Production Expansion[ 11 ]. The company's deepening partnership with Northvolt to produce batteries in North America is a critical step to address these issuesVolvo’s Ambitious Plans for US Electric Vehicle Production Expansion[ 11 ].

Volvo's U.S. expansion is not without risks. Global EV sales declined by 15% in Q1 2025, with Europe and China experiencing sharper declinesVolvo EV Sales In The U.S. Are Up. It's Not As Rosy[ 1 ]. This geographic imbalance raises questions about the sustainability of relying heavily on the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's revised electrification strategy—allowing for mild hybrids—may dilute its brand's premium positioning in the EV space.

Yet, the opportunities are substantial. By aligning production with consumption (producing where it sells), Volvo can reduce costs and enhance supply chain resilience. The XC60's local production, for instance, is expected to leverage underutilized capacity at the Ridgeville plant, justifying its $1.4 billion investmentVolvo’s little-used U.S. assembly plant is $1.4 billion migraine[ 12 ]. Furthermore, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers incentives for U.S. EV manufacturing, which Volvo is actively exploring to bolster its competitive edgeVolvo Cars exploring investment into US expansion[ 13 ].

After talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the two leaders have made a bilateral trade agreement targeting nuclear power development to meet the energy demands of AI infrastructure.

The Tech Prosperity Deal, unveiled by President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, positions nuclear energy as the backbone for powering AI data centres.

Keir Starmer describes the agreement as a “landmark nuclear partnership” that would power economic growth, saying the commitments would set Britain “well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.”

Google, Nvidia and Microsoft have also committed to expanding UK operations as part of the broader agreement.

Why nuclear power?

AI data centres consume hundreds of megawatts of power continuously to run the parallel processing systems that enable machine learning (ML) applications.

Chris Wright, the US Energy Secretary, frames nuclear power as essential for supporting America’s AI ambitions.

He says that America has been looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution.

“Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”

The partnership promises to slash regulatory red tape through the UK-US Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, which aims to halve licensing times to approximately two years.

Both countries will accept each other’s safety assessments, eliminating duplicative approval processes that have historically slowed nuclear deployment.

Why the nuclear push will be at a former coal plant

The centrepiece of the nuclear push is an ambitious US$11bn project at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire.

Nuclear technology company Holtec International will partner with EDF Energy and property developer Tritax to build small modular reactors specifically designed for AI data centres.

These smaller nuclear units produce between 50 and 300 megawatts of power, compared with traditional plants that generate over 1,000 megawatts.

The modular approach allows components to be manufactured in factories and transported to sites, potentially reducing both construction times and costs.

EDF Energy, which operates Britain’s existing nuclear fleet and supplies electricity to 5.8 million customers, sees the partnership as its entry into next-generation nuclear technologies targeting AI infrastructure.

Meanwhile, nuclear startup Last Energy will team up with ports operator DP World to develop micro-modular plants at the London Gateway port and business park, where automated cargo systems require reliable power.

Ed Miliband, the UK’s Energy Secretary, says: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the US to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.”

The promise of thousands of new jobs

Beyond the headline projects, energy supplier Centrica will partner with reactor developer X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool.

The project could create 2,500 jobs in England’s North East, where traditional heavy industries have declined.

The Hartlepool facility alone is expected to generate enough electricity to power 1.5 million homes.

By 2028, the new reactors could collectively provide up to 6 gigawatts of power across the UK – matching the country’s current nuclear output.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/cb07a9369b5485698aa27a0263963fed:a89409712449ba76344d3b50347516d6/54354197632-dc2a4f2c65-b.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:36.780266

Astroelectricity: America’s national energy security imperative

In July, President Donald J. Trump announced a trade deal with the European Union (EU) in which they will purchase $750 billion of US energy resources over the next three years. At a price of $60 per barrel of oil, this would buy about 12.5 billion barrels of American oil. In terms of energy content, this would roughly equal one year’s worth of consumption of oil and natural gas used in America. With the presumption that this purchase will predominantly be oil and natural gas, it would substantially increase the demand on US oil and natural gas production—and this is without adding any other exports such as to Japan, South Korea, and China.

If oil and natural gas were renewable energy sources, this would be a tremendously beneficial trade deal. Recognizing that the geopolitics surrounding this trade deal is very complicated, it is important to recognize that exporting American oil and natural gas accelerates the depletion of affordable supplies of these non-sustainable fuels—the very fuels of which just a generation earlier, America was dangerously short of.

Periodically, the US Geological Survey publishes estimates of the amount of “technically recoverable” coal, oil, and natural gas remaining in the US. Technically recoverable means that portion of the remaining identified in situ resources that “can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices.” Importantly, market price is not a consideration in determining how much technically recoverable resources remain.

Figure 1: US technically recoverable crude oil and dry natural gas resources as of 1 January 2020. The energy unit “BOE” is an abbreviation for barrels of oil equivalent. References: US Energy Information Administration National Energy Modeling System’s Oil and Gas Supply Module, Tables 1 and 2, dated March 2022.

Oil and natural gas now supply about 70% of the total energy used in America. Based on the pre-COVID-19 use of these two fuels—and prior to these recent trade deals—at the 2019 consumption rate of 12 billion BOE, the technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources would last about 75 years. Should US oil and natural gas exports be substantial and ongoing, then this lifetime estimate would obviously be shorter—perhaps, much shorter! Within the lifetime of today’s young children, these vital energy resources will likely be exhausted, leaving America dangerously energy insecure.

Figure 2: The late-1973 oil embargo caused shortages of gasoline. To moderate demand, rationing was implemented in the form of odd and even number days, based on the number in the license plate, when gasoline could be bought.

America has been down that dangerous road before. In 1970, after 111 years of generally steadily growing production, conventional US oil production peaked, making America oil insecure. Within three years, America’s first oil supply crisis hit when some Middle East nations attempted to squeeze the US president to align with their foreign policy priorities. That crisis dramatically increased oil prices and caused a substantial US recession.

Figure 3: History of US domestic oil production and imports from 1900-2023 with the author’s illustration of the likely decline of conventional oil production through 2100.

Within a decade, as America’s oil insecurity grew to the point that America was importing over half of the oil used, President Jimmy Carter declared protecting American access to foreign oil a national security priority. Within another decade, America was engaged in full-out conventional warfare in the Middle East to protect US access. It took nearly another 30 years for the US to finally be rescued —yes, rescued—from that quagmire by the practicable technological breakthrough of guided drilling and hydraulic fracturing known as “fracking.”

The US Department of Energy (DOE) was formed in 1977 by President Carter. He consolidated several existing federal agencies—many arising out of the Manhattan Project and civil nuclear power—into a department level organization focused on energy conservation and renewable energy sources, with a “side hustle” of managing much of the government’s nuclear weapon and nuclear power activities. (None of which have proven to reduce America’s persistent conventional oil insecurity.) Yet, buried deep in that organization when it was formed was federal research and development financial support for what became the fracking that rescued America three decades later and has now enabled the world to enter a period of energy insecurity dormancy led by the US.

The chart above shows the history of US domestic oil production. Specifically, the chart shows the sustained rise in production of conventional oil wells until the peak in 1970 followed by the decline that is still underway. This bell-shaped production curve is representative of all natural resources in demand. It was seen in the production of both wood fuel and coal in the US. Hence, we know that it will repeat with the production of fracked oil and natural gas.

As everyone should acknowledge, fracking is only a “band-aid” fix to America’s need to be permanently energy secure. Knowing this, it is only common sense that the US Department of Energy should have (by now) established a national energy security strategy to undertake America’s orderly transition to sustainable energy before, once again, America becomes energy insecure. However, this has not happened, even as the necessity for America undertaking this transition has been readily apparent for decades.

Responding to this need, I began to quantitatively model America’s energy use and evaluate its sustainable energy transition needs in 2008. Over the years, I have refined my analysis. In 2022, I summarized my findings in an article here in 2022. (See “Evaluating America’s green energy options including astroelectricity (part 1)”, The Space Review, November 14, 2022.) Recently, I updated and published my analytical assessment on ResearchGate. In this article, I summarize my updated results to reemphasize the point that pursuing the development of space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity should now be America’s (and DOE’s) national energy security imperative.

What will it take for America to “go clean”

The failed Green New Deal efforts make very clear that successfully transitioning to sustainable energy is not a trivial undertaking. Difficulties arise in two areas. First, the type of sustainable energy must be able to be scaled up sufficiently to make a difference. Second, the implementation of the solution must provide an orderly transition path while being practicable to be built. To better understand these two considerations, I will begin by explaining how much total energy America now needs and then show the equivalent amount of entirely sustainable energy needed for America to “go clean.”

America’s current energy use

The starting point is to refresh our understanding of pertinent energy units. For the use of primary combustible fuels in America —coal, oil, and natural gas—the primary energy unit is the British Thermal Unit (BTU). This unit originated two centuries ago to aid in designing steam engines. A BTU is the amount of thermal energy (heat) needed to raise one pound (16 fluid ounces) of water by one degree Fahrenheit. For perspective, when heating 16 fluid ounces of tap water to make tea, around 130 BTU of heat must be used. A BOE is defined as having 5.8 million BTUs of thermal energy.

For the following discussions, I use America’s energy use in 2019 as the baseline. That was the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic when the impact of the pandemic and later national energy policy changes suppressed energy use. Thus, in terms of per-person energy use, the 2019 value indicates what is needed during generally prosperous economic times.

Reflecting the fact that fossil carbon fuels still predominate US energy use, America’s national energy use is often reported using a unit called the “Quad”. This is an abbreviation for 1 quadrillion BTUs or 1 × 1015 BTUs. The chart below shows America’s sources of energy and how energy use “flows” through the US economy. In 2019, according to this chart, America used 100.2 Quads of energy from all sources. Coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas provided about 80 Quads or 80% of the primary energy, with just oil and natural gas providing nearly 70 Quads. Further, electricity use consumed about 37 Quads or 37% of the primary energy.

Figure 4: Diagram of how the sources of energy used in the US, shown on the left, “flow” through America’s economy to yield the goods and services consumed. Essentially, this entire energy flow needs to be made sustainable.

One Quad equals 172.4 million BOE. Thus, from the above chart, the 100.2 Quads used in 2019 equaled 17.3 billion BOE, with the petroleum and natural gas consumption supplying nearly 12 billion BOE—the value shown in the earlier Figure 1 table.

An oil supertanker will carry two to three million barrels. Thus, in 2019, Americans used the equivalent of around 7,000 supertankers of oil—nearly one supertanker worth of energy every hour of every day. Of these, four of every five supertankers would be non-sustainable energy that must be replaced by new sustainable energy sources. Supplying 10–12 million BOE of new sustainable energy every day illustrates the challenge that America must solve to undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy. Clearly, this will require a well-developed “engineering” solution, not an impractical political solution as has been tried for the past several decades.

America’s possible sustainable energy source options

Figure 5: The four possible sustainable energy sources that are sufficiently scalable to substantially replace fossil carbon fuels.

While there are many possible sources of terrestrial sustainable energy for America to use, biomass, hydroelectricity, geothermal electricity, and wave- and tidal-generated electrical power cannot be scaled up to become a primary source of sustainable energy to replace fossil carbon fuels. This leaves only wind power, ground solar power, and nuclear fission power as the remaining terrestrial options for America to possibly use to “go clean.” For this assessment, I added the option of SSP-supplied astroelectricity. Wind power and ground solar power are, obviously, intermittent power sources while nuclear fission power and astroelectricity are baseload power sources, meaning that they are assumed in this assessment to be able to operate continuously.

American current per person use of energy

The starting point to determine how much sustainable electrical energy America will need to go clean is to start with America’s current average energy use per person—specifically per resident. Using updated consumption and population values for 2019, the following chart shows how much energy per person was used on average and how this was consumed in the form of electrical energy and fuels.

In 2019, 12,545.8 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy and 31.1 BOE of fuels were used per person on average. In total, the equivalent of 50.584 BOE of energy was used per person. (By using the BOE unit, this provides an appreciation of how much energy is actually being used per person in America today.)

Figure 6: US average total energy used per person in 2019 showing the breakdown into electrical energy and fuels use.

Introducing two new energy units

In America’s new sustainable energy infrastructure, electrical energy will be the primary type of sustainable energy used. The two electrical energy units used that will replace the BTU and BOE are the kilowatt-hour (kWh) and the gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, with kWh and GWh not having any real world physical meaning—as the BTU and BOE do—two new energy units are needed to help appreciate how much sustainable electrical energy will be needed per person and nationally.

From the above chart, 12,545.8 kWh of electrical energy was used on average per person in 2019. This was the electricity used directly (e.g., air conditioning) as well as that used to produce the goods and services consumed. There are 8,760 hours in a year. Thus, 12,545.8 kWh ÷ 8,760 hours = 1.43 kW of electrical power being used continuously throughout the year, on average. We can conveniently express 12,545.8 kWh as 1.43 kW-continuous or 1.43 kWc.

A typical microwave oven uses 1 kW of power when operating. Thus, in 2019, each American consumed enough electricity to operate 1.43 microwave ovens continuously. We can think of the per person electrical energy use in terms of microwave ovens just as we thought of the total energy use in terms of the barrel of oil equivalent.

In 2019, the US used 4,130,574 GWh of total electrical energy, or 472 GW continuous, GWc. The Hoover Dam can generate 2 GW when operating at full power. If the Hoover Dam could operate continuously, it would be rated at 2 GWc. We can use this to express the 472 GWc generated in 2019 as being equivalent to 236 Hoover Dams operating continuously.

When mentioning that the US was generating the equivalent of 472 GW of continuous power, most people would have little appreciation of how much energy that was. However, if this is stated as the US was producing the equivalent of 236 Hoover Dams operating continuously, this can readily be understood. Just as I will use the number of microwave ovens operating continuously to illustrate how much clean energy will be needed per person, the number of Hoover Dams operating continuously will be used to illustrate how much total sustainable energy for America will need to go clean.

Figure 7: A microwave oven and the Hoover Dam are used to provide a perspective on how much sustainable energy America will need per person and nationally to “go clean”.

(Note: Before continuing, take a guess at how many Hoover Dams operating continuously would be needed for America to fully transition to sustainable energy.)

Modeling America’s needed new sustainable energy infrastructure

Figure 8: Diagram of the model used to estimate the total primary sustainable electrical power (kWc) needed to go clean.

The sustainable energy transition model I used is shown in the diagram above. The complexity of energy use in America—as shown earlier in the energy flow diagram—and the need for carbon-based fuels and industrial feedstocks makes an all-electric or an electric-hydrogen energy infrastructure impracticable to use. Therefore, in this model, both clean hydrogen and CO₂-neutral (clean) carbon fuels are supplied to replace the use of fossil carbon fuels. By producing clean carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks, the transition from the use of fossil carbon fuels to an entirely sustainable energy infrastructure is seamless, making it generally transparent to the end-users. This is what I call an “orderly” transition.

(Note: All carbon used to produce synthetic carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks comes from the CO₂ either extracted from the atmosphere or captured in the exhaust of industrial plants, power plants, and waste disposal incinerators. In this manner, no net CO₂ is added to the atmosphere. This is necessary for undertaking an orderly transition to sustainable energy.)

I used this model to estimate the total primary sustainable electrical power (kWc) needed per person to supply 12,545.8 kWh of sustainable dispatched electrical power and 31.1 BOE of sustainable fuels. This model was run separately using only intermittent primary power and then using only baseload power.

(Note: For this top-level estimate of sustainable energy needs, only synthetic methane is assumed to be produced to supply the needed replacement fuels.)

America’s total kWc and GWc needed to have already “gone clean” in 2019

Figure 9: Estimated total kWh of primary electrical energy and kWc of primary electrical power needed per person on average in the US in 2019 to have already transitioned to sustainable energy.

Recall that in 2019, the average end-user, directly and indirectly, used 1.43 kWc of utility-dispatched electrical power. This was generated using 38.5% of the total energy used. If all energy consumed had been used to generate electricity, then the total would have been 3.71 kWc.

From the above table, to transition fully to sustainable energy using the baseload-methane case, 16.47 kWc would be needed per person. Thus, for the baseload-methane case, America’s new sustainable energy infrastructure needs to supply roughly 4.4 times more energy per person. When using intermittent sources, this increases to 21.14 kWc, 5.7 times more energy. Using the microwave oven metaphor, the energy need increases from about 4 microwave ovens to about 16 for the baseload case and about 21 for the intermittent case. Hopefully, this is making clear the magnitude of the challenge of America successfully transitioning from fossil carbon fuels.

Figure 10: Comparison of the total GWc of primary electrical power needed in 2019 along with the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously to supply that power.

The total GWc needed for America to have already transitioned to sustainable energy can easily be calculated by multiplying the above table’s kWc values by the US 2019 resident population. These results, along with the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously, are shown in the table above. When using baseload primary power, the equivalent of 2,476 two-gigawatt Hoover Dams operating continuously, supplying 5,424 GWc of electrical power, would have been needed. For the intermittent case, this increases to the equivalent of 3,481 Hoover Dams supplying 6,962 GWc.

Was your guess anywhere near this number?

(Note: The 2019 resident population used was about 329 million. Each additional million adds the need for 7.5 additional Hoover Dams operating continuously.)

Assessing America’s four possible scalable sustainable power options

As noted earlier, America has only four possible sufficiently scalable options to enable its transition to sustainable energy. The intermittent options are wind power and ground solar power, while the baseload options are nuclear fission power and space solar power-supplied astroelectricity. In my assessment, I examined each to determine if it was a practicable solution at the scale needed to fully meet the GWc need.

Wind power

Figure 11: Possible wind farm locations in the contiguous US for wind turbines with a hub height of 110 meters.

The above map was created by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as part of their assessment of the wind power potential in the contiguous US. The blue areas are where commercial wind farms could be built with the darker blue areas where the annual wind energy potential is greatest.

The NREL study found that about five million square kilometers (1.9 million square miles) of the contiguous United States could be used to build commercial wind farms. Building out this extent of wind power would require installing about 7.7 million wind turbines on nearly two-thirds of the contiguous US.

Figure 12: This chart summarizes the author’s analysis of the NREL assessment of the wind power potential in the contiguous US. It shows how the total GWc available increases as more of the land area is used for wind farms, beginning with those areas with the greatest wind power potential.

From my assessment’s results—shown in the chart above—such extensive use of commercial wind farms could yield 4,756 GWc of intermittent primary electrical power in an average wind power year. Recall that 6,692 GWc of such intermittent primary power would have been needed in 2019. Thus, in an average year, the available wind power is only 68% of what the US would have needed to transition fully to sustainable energy. In a low wind power year, this drops to 3,805 GWc, or only 55% of what would have been needed. Obviously, wind power alone is not a practicable solution since the American public is unlikely to accept covering America with a forest of wind turbines, especially without yielding a full sustainable energy solution.

Ground solar power

While obviously there is sufficient land in the contiguous United States on which to build ground solar farms, how much land would be needed? By my estimate, to supply 6,692 GWc of intermittent primary power, about 14% of the contiguous United States would need to be converted into ground solar farms. In total, the required land area, within the perimeter fence, would be 1.1 million square kilometers (420,000 square miles). As shown in the map below, this is equivalent to a square of land 1,045 kilometers on each side.

Figure 13: Representative total area of ground solar farms needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need overlaid on a terrain map of the contiguous US.

As the map above shows, a large percentage of the contiguous United States is unsuitable for ground solar farms due to terrain, especially in the sunny Southwest. Also, suitable locations for commercial solar farms require generally flat land and a location that has generally sunny skies—essentially the same requirements needed for large-scale agriculture. Thus, while needing only 14% of the total contiguous land area may not at first appear unreasonable, ground solar farms would need to be built across much of America’s breadbasket states. This is unlikely to be politically acceptable as well as being unacceptable from a food-security perspective.

Hence, as with wind power, ground solar power alone is NOT a practicable means of enabling America to transition to sustainable energy. In fact, a combination of wind power and ground solar power is also not a practicable solution as it still requires a coast-to-coast forest of turbines while only cutting the required land area for solar farms in half.

Nuclear fission power

With wind and ground solar power not enabling America to undertake a practicable transition to sustainable energy, the only remaining terrestrial option is nuclear fission power. As noted previously, the baseload-methane case would require 5,424 GWc of primary electrical power. This equates to 5,641 GW of nameplate power with the assumption that each plant would not be generating power for two weeks each year to undertake maintenance, inspection, and refueling. For perspective, the US currently has around 100 GW of nuclear power generation capacity. To fully meet the baseload sustainable energy need using only nuclear fission power, about 56 times more nuclear generation capacity would be needed.

As has been recognized since the 1950s, with natural uranium only having 0.72% of the U-235 fissile fuel needed by the reactors, breeding is needed to undertake a substantial expansion of nuclear fission power. It is estimated that about 1.2 metric tonnes of fissile fuel are needed per GW-year of generation. Thus, to fully meet the US sustainable energy need, 6,509 metric tonnes of either Pu-239 or U-233 would need to be bred each year. For perspective, from 1945 until it ended breeding in 1987, the government’s Hanford plant only produced a total of 67.4 metric tonnes of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons and to power naval reactors.

While nuclear breeding reactors were pursued in the 1960s and early 1970s, by the end of the 1970s, these were abandoned due to worries about nuclear weapon proliferation as both Pu-239 and U-233 can be used to produce nuclear weapons. Further, no enrichment is needed as with U-235. Thus, nuclear breeder reactors could covertly—or defiantly, by a rogue nation—be used to produce fissile materials to make nuclear weapons. Should the United States establish a precedent for using nuclear breeder reactors to transition to sustainable energy, this will most certainly open the door for uncontrollable nuclear weapon proliferation worldwide.

Figure 14: An already built naval reactor was used to speed up the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Plant.

In the 1950s, the US advocated for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The first civilian nuclear power plant was built at Shippingport, Pennsylvania. An unneeded US Navy 60-megawatt (MW) reactor, developed for an aircraft carrier, was installed in 1956 as shown in the photograph above. The plant began to generate electrical power the next year.

This particular reactor bred fuel while producing power. During its 25 years of operation, it first bred Pu-239 and, later, was modified to breed U-233. However, doing this required a special core of weapons-grade U-235 to breed Pu-239 with a similar approach used to breed U-233. This effort spurred interest in the 1960s and early 1970s in developing more advanced breeding power reactors—efforts that were abandoned by the end of the 1970s.

The Shippingport Atomic Power Plant illustrates why there is current interest in building new nuclear fission power plants using smaller “modular” reactors. The intent is to reduce the construction cost and shorten the plant’s construction time by powering it with one or more smaller reactors that can be built on an assembly line and then installed in the plant as was done with the naval reactor. To achieve the US total GWc need, the chart below shows how many of such small modular reactors in the range of 100–500 megawatts would be needed.

Figure 15: Number of small modular reactors needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need as a function of the reactor nameplate power generation rating.

Naval reactors typically have an operating life of about 30 years. Thus, the small modular reactors will have a finite life perhaps in the range of 30 to 60 years. At the end of their life—when the reactor would likely be highly radioactive—each would need to be decommissioned, removed from the power plant, and transported to where they would be finally (somehow) rendered no longer a radioactive hazard to humanity.

While this sounds straightforward, when the Shippingport reactor was decommissioned and removed in the late 1980s, to render it safe for transport, the reactor pressure vessel and its steel and concrete filled surrounding radiation shield weighed 870 metric tonnes. It required a 320-wheel trailer to transport it the short distance to the Ohio River to be loaded aboard a special oceangoing barge for transport down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and then by sea to Washington state where it was entombed—meaning it is probably still there. This is what may need to be done to remove and replace the modular reactors—perhaps several hundred each year—at the end of their rated life to keep the nuclear power plants operating.

In addition to the nuclear weapon proliferation issues and the likely need for the transport and entombment of highly radioactive decommissioned reactors, many other serious concerns exist. Among these are the threat of natural disaster (such as the tsunamis that destroyed several Japanese nuclear power plants in 2011), a continuously expanding need for nuclear waste disposal (with no current politically acceptable solution), the growing threat of terrorist attacks (perhaps using drone-deployed weapons), and the threat of a space-based electromagnetic pulse attack (potentially rendering the reactors’ safety systems inoperative). As with wind power and ground solar power, nuclear fission power will not enable America to undertake an orderly transition to sustainable energy.

Astroelectricity

As the 1960s came to an end, American oil insecurity was emerging as a major political, economic, and national security issue. One proposed solution—far ahead of its time—was to collect sunlight in Earth orbit, convert this into electrical power, transmit this power via radio waves to special receiving antenna (rectenna) farms on the ground, and supply this power—what I call “astroelectricity”—to the power grid as baseload power. This is called space solar power (SSP). It was invented by Peter Glaser in 1968, perhaps building on the idea of beaming power to planets in a 1941 story by science fiction author Isaac Asimov. Glaser received a US patent for this in 1973.

Figure 16: Illustration of space solar power from Peter Glaser’s space solar power patent.

As America’s energy insecurity grew in the 1970s—and after breeder reactors were abandoned—space solar power was investigated from 1978 to 1980 by NASA and the recently formed DOE. From these efforts, a baseline five-gigawatt space solar power system was defined. This concept is shown in the following illustration. It involves using Manhattan Island-size space solar power platforms located in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) to collect sunlight, convert this into electrical power, and transmit the power using radio waves to the ground receiving antennas (rectenna farm).

Figure 17: Illustration of the ground rectenna site that would receive the power transmitted from the space solar power platform. The transmitted power will be converted into “astroelectricity” and fed into the regional power grid just as is done with baseload powerplants today.

I refer to the ground rectenna farm as an astroelectric plant. For the baseline 5-GWc design, the ground area used by the astroelectric plant is shown in the following illustration. For a typical plant located in the contiguous US, the plant’s rectangular area would be 12.6 km  16.6 km = 209 square kilometers (81 square miles). This equates to 42 square kilometers (16 square miles) needed per 1 GWc of baseload power supplied.

(Note: The GEO SSP platforms will enter the Earth’s shadow at local midnight for about an hour each day for about a week before and after the spring and fall equinoxes. This would be at a time of minimal power demand—seasonally as well as daily. With the annual loss of energy being less than 1%, for this top-level assessment, the SSP platforms are considered to be operating continuously.)

Figure 18: Diagram of the dimensions of a typical astroelectric plant located in the mid-latitudes of the contiguous US.

I assumed that astroelectricity would supply 80% of the primary baseload power America would need. This equates to 4,339 GWc of astroelectricity needed. This would require about 182,000 square kilometers (70,000 square miles) of land in the contiguous United States for the astroelectric plants. This is less than 3% of the contiguous US. For perspective, this is comparable to the total land used for cities in the contiguous US.

For the remaining 20% of the total GWc needed, ground photovoltaic solar farms would be used. Using special rectenna panels collecting both sunlight and the transmitted power, these solar farms would be built as part of the overall astroelectric plants.

Figure 19: Representative total area of astroelectric plants needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need overlaid on a terrain map of the contiguous US.

The approximate total land area needed for this astroelectric option is shown on the map above. The 180,000 square kilometers needed for the astroelectricity option compares very favorably to the more than one million square kilometers needed for an all-ground solar power solution or with the coast-to-coast forest of wind turbines and a half-million square kilometers of ground solar farms needed for a combined solution. The space solar power option will provide America with the best form of sustainable primary power—baseload—while minimizing the land area needed to meet America’s total sustainable energy need. Also, it is the only one of the four options that provides a practicable solution for undertaking an orderly transition to sustainable energy.

Conclusion

The primary conclusions drawn from the assessment are:

At least for America, only SSP-supplied astroelectricity can provide an orderly transition to sustainable energy at the scale needed to replace fossil carbon fuels.

The magnitude of America’s transition to sustainable energy is immense requiring concerted leadership and effort by the Government to ensure that it is effectively undertaken.

To avoid a return to the geopolitical plague of energy insecurity, America must complete the transition to SSP-supplied astroelectricity before the end of this century while being ready to begin its orderly deployment by the time fracked oil and natural gas production peaks and begin their inevitable decline.

Acknowledging today’s moral obligation that we owe to future generations to ensure that their America will still be free, prosperous, energy secure, and at peace, undertaking SSP must now become America’s national energy security imperative.

In fact, year to date through July, the Cybertruck had only 15,211 U.S. registrations, per S&P Global Mobility.
Ram, a major Stellantis (STLA -1.42%) brand, canceled plans for its first full electric pickup and attributed the decision to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).
Why is the EV truck segment so different from the gasoline segment?
But when it comes to EV trucks, the largest cost component is typically the battery, and those weigh down margins significantly.","Perhaps management at Lucid Group (LCID 6.35%) was right the entire time: Electric pickups just aren't going to be a winner in the near term.

""It's very tough to make an electric pickup work today,"" then-Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said during the company's Tech and Manufacturing Day back in September 2024, adding, ""not one that's usable and cost-effective.""

The bad news is that many of Lucid's rivals have tried and are mostly failing.

What have you done for me lately?

Let's briefly go down the list. Tesla's (TSLA 1.88%) Cybertruck, which (it is fair to say) has been a commercial flop, has disappeared from Tesla's U.S. order page as battery-electric pickups industrywide feel the pain. Tesla introduced the base model in April with a sticker price roughly $10,000 lower in the hopes of attracting buyers, but it was essentially a gutted version of the vehicle and dropped key features that made the truck compelling to the small niche of an audience it had.

Back in 2019, CEO Elon Musk announced the cheapest version of the Cybertruck would start under $40,000 before shipping, but in reality, it retailed at nearly $70,000. Musk also predicted the pickup truck would sell between 250,000 and 500,000 units. While Tesla doesn't report sales by country or model, U.S. vehicle registration data can give us an idea of the sales landscape -- and it's not pretty. In fact, year to date through July, the Cybertruck had only 15,211 U.S. registrations, per S&P Global Mobility. That was good enough for a 14% decline compared to the same period in 2024. July registrations are down 54% year over year.

Tesla isn't the only automaker with a big truck problem. Ram, a major Stellantis (STLA -1.42%) brand, canceled plans for its first full electric pickup and attributed the decision to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

Rivian (RIVN 5.98%), in the same fashion as Tesla, doesn't report sales by country or model, but U.S. registrations for Rivian's R1T fell 37% year to date through July. July registrations dropped about as severely as Tesla's, down 40% to only 588 pickups. Ford Motor Company's (F 0.47%) F-150 Lightning faced a less drastic drop, but a drop nonetheless. The F-150 Lightning recorded a 12% drop in registrations through July, with July registrations down 15%. Ford rival General Motors (GM -0.05%) was the lone bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture: The automaker's Silverado EV, Sierra EV, and Hummer EV all posted registration gains through July.

What's the problem?

Despite GM's bright spot, the pickup EV segment failed to break 50,000 sales through July, which is the opposite of the gasoline-powered full-size truck segment that powers sales by the hundreds of thousands annually. So what gives? Why is the EV truck segment so different from the gasoline segment?

Essentially, the economics of an electric pickup flip historic truths. The dirty little secret is that gasoline-powered full-size trucks cost only marginally more to produce than sedans, yet the former can power price tags 2 to 3 times higher. That gives full-size trucks margins that are unprecedented in the automotive industry, and have powered profits in Detroit for decades.

But when it comes to EV trucks, the largest cost component is typically the battery, and those weigh down margins significantly. And there isn't much breathing room because consumers view full-size trucks, even electric trucks, as a work tool and aren't generally willing to give up performance or towing power to lower price tags. It becomes incredibly difficult to turn a profit, even a gross profit, when massive battery packs on the market can cost around $50,000.

What it all means

But all is not lost. Eventually, battery prices will come down to earth, potentially opening the door for successful EV pickups -- Ford is already on this path.

In fact, Ford essentially has doubled down on its EV ambitions. It went back to the drawing board and revolutionized its historic assembly line into an ""assembly tree,"" where three sub-lines produce their parts simultaneously before joining together. Not only is it expected to substantially improve production speed, by up to 40% compared to the current vehicles produced, but Ford also anticipates that the first EV to roll off the line will be an EV pickup that's expected to be profitable very early in its life cycle.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/834322/2026-hummer-ev-carbon-fiber-edition-pickup.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:56.711160

This will enable Meta to secure large-scale power commitments under favorable terms and sell any excess it doesn't use.

The application seeks direct authorization from FERC to “sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It does not disclose where it would seek to trade power. It will be required to file for membership if it aims to trade in one of the US’s competitive power markets, such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, where it is currently developing its flagship Louisiana data center.

Atem was formed by Meta this year and is wholly owned by the Mark Zuckerberg-run company. According to the application, it was ""formed to act as a power marketer to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services at wholesale in the United States.""

The decision by Meta is predicated on skyrocketing energy demand emanating from the artificial intelligence data center market. Its planned Louisiana data center is expected to have a capacity exceeding 2GW and will be powered by three combined-cycle gas turbines with a capacity of 2.26GW, built and operated by utility Entergy.

Late last year, the company also announced a request for proposals to identify potential nuclear energy developers to support 1.4GW of new nuclear generation capacity across the US.

Following the RFP, the company signed a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Constellation Energy for more than 1.1GW of power from a nuclear power plant in Clinton, Illinois.

The company has also signed numerous renewable supply agreements to decarbonize its operations. In June, the firm procured almost 800MW of renewable power from Invenergy to power its US data center portfolio.

However, its renewable strategy has come under fire due to a reliance on Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreement (EAPA) over PPAs. EAPAs do not involve the direct purchase of energy. Instead, they represent the purchase of the project's environmental benefits through renewable energy credits, with the power generated fed directly into the grid.

Mills also signed LD 1868 into law earlier this year to codify the state’s goal of using 100% clean energy by 2040.","Amid federal efforts to scale-back clean energy incentives, utility regulators in Maine approved five new renewable energy projects.

On Sept. 16, the Maine Public Utilities Commission approved a four-megawatt hydroelectric facility and four solar projects totaling more than 250 megawatts through a procurement process that prioritized the reuse of contaminated land for economic development.

In July, the commission asked for proposals to develop energy projects that used eligible renewable resources, which could include solar, wind, hydroelectric and biomass. Priority was given to projects that would be placed on agricultural land contaminated with per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals.

Although that approach is intended to help communities turn environmental challenges into economic opportunities, Commission Chair Philip Bartlett said it was difficult to assess the benefits of these projects because of the current market and federal policy changes.

The Inflation Reduction Act offered developers a 30% tax credit into the 2030s for investments in energy projects that don’t produce carbon emissions. However, President Donald Trump signed a policy measure on July 4 that ended those credits. Projects must now start construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the credits, or be operational by the end of 2027.

States fast-track wind, solar permits and contracts to beat Trump’s deadline

Some states, including Maine, have tried to fast-track clean energy projects in light of that change, but these particular projects were the result of legislation Gov. Janet Mills signed into law in June 2025 that called for expedited procurements for cost-effective renewable energy projects.

“Assessing benefits based on assumptions and forecasts is particularly challenging at this moment,” Bartlett said. “We’ve seen significant changes in federal policy that will make renewable projects more expensive going forward, and there is increasing uncertainty and potential volatility in our [renewable energy credit], energy, and capacity markets.”

Bartlett added that all three commissioners agreed the new projects have “a reasonably strong chance of achieving benefits and will also provide a hedge against market volatility in the years ahead.”

The leader of the Governor’s Energy Office, which is expected to transition to the cabinet-level Maine Department of Energy Resources this fall, expressed support for the projects selected. .

“This procurement, expedited by bipartisan legislation, will result in new clean energy generation for Maine that should be able to take advantage of expiring federal tax credits and deliver affordable energy to ratepayers,” Director Dan Burgess said.

In the future, the new Department of Energy Resources will conduct competition procurements for clean energy projects that are approved by the Public Utilities Commission. Mills also signed LD 1868 into law earlier this year to codify the state’s goal of using 100% clean energy by 2040.

Bonin pressed further in another round of questions, but the officials couldn’t say how those recent policy changes, in combination, have impacted Canada’s work to reach its 2030 target.
“They’re too embarrassed to show the true face of this government and the policies it’s dismantling in the fight against climate change.” While MPs grilled Environment Canada officials, another climate fight was happening a floor above in the House of Commons on Monday.","Another report last year from Environment Commissioner Jerry DeMarco warned Canada would miss the 2030 target and said there was still 20 to 30 years’ worth of emissions reduction work ahead before it could catch up.

A group of assistant deputy ministers appeared before the House of Commons standing committee on environment and sustainable development Monday morning to brief MPs.

Bloc Québécois MP Patrick Bonin asked them repeatedly about the impact on Canada’s 2030 emission targets from the repeal of the consumer carbon price and the decision to pause implementation of the electric vehicle mandate for 2026.

Department officials initially cited other measures in place and repeated Prime Minister Mark Carney’s talking points, but eventually shared some data when pressed further.

Megan Nichols, one of five officials answering questions, said scrapping the consumer carbon price would add three megatonnes of emissions in 2030, while the impact of suspending the EV mandate for 2026 had not yet been calculated.

“Given that, the government has also announced its intent to review that regulation in more detail to make sure that industry will continue to be able to achieve the goals, and also that prices are affordable,” Nichols said.

The electric vehicle mandate would have required automakers to have 20 per cent of all new car, SUV and light-duty truck sales be zero-emission. The mandate, as written, would still be enacted in 2027 at a threshold of 23 per cent, rising steadily to 100 per cent by 2025.

But when the government paused its implementation, it also launched a 60-day review of the mandate, which is being led by Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Bonin pressed further in another round of questions, but the officials couldn’t say how those recent policy changes, in combination, have impacted Canada’s work to reach its 2030 target.

“We’re just in the middle of revising the projections with the most recent information to be able to respond directly to that question,” said Alison McDermott, the assistant deputy minister of strategic policy.

McDermott said they would have the revised projections before the end of year, which — by law — is when the government must present a progress report with an assessment on the 2030 target.

Speaking to The Canadian Press, Bonin said he believes the government already ran those numbers ahead of making its recent policy decisions, but is too embarrassed to share it.

“It’s clear to me that the government has all that information and it’s walking back (climate policies) in many instances, while it wasn’t even on track to meet its 2030 emission reduction targets,” Bonin said in French.

“They’re too embarrassed to show the true face of this government and the policies it’s dismantling in the fight against climate change.”

While MPs grilled Environment Canada officials, another climate fight was happening a floor above in the House of Commons on Monday.

During an opposition day, the Conservative Party presented a motion calling for the government to eliminate its emissions cap on oil and gas producers.

Last year, Ottawa introduced draft regulations — two years behind schedule — requiring producers to cut emissions by about one-third over the next eight years.

The Liberals have said repeatedly they aren’t capping production, just the emissions that come from it — a bid to force companies to invest in technology to produce the fuels more cleanly. But industry leaders and Conservative politicians insist the targets are too stringent and can’t be met without capping production.

“We’re giving Liberals an opportunity to vote here and now,” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said during a speech on the motion.

“If they vote to keep their production cap in place, it’ll be a signal that all of the flirtations that the Prime Minister has done with the possibility of producing more or building pipelines, were nothing but an illusion. A tragic and extremely costly illusion.”

Michael Timberlake, research director at E2, said: “Every year clean energy jobs become more critical to our overall economy.","Clean energy jobs in the US grew more than three times faster than the wider economy in 2024 yet momentum is slowing as President Trump’s energy reset begins to bite.

The Clean Jobs America report from business group E2 says the sector added nearly 100,000 new roles last year, lifting the total to 3.56 million.

Clean energy now makes up 42% of all US energy jobs and 2.3% of the national workforce – more than the number employed as nurses or teachers.

Solar, wind, storage, efficiency and clean vehicles made up 82% of all new US energy roles. Over the past five years the sector has added more than 520,000 jobs, up 17%, far outpacing fossil fuels.

Yet 2024 saw the weakest growth since the pandemic.

About 50,000 fewer jobs were created than in 2023 as uncertainty and policy rollbacks took hold.

Trump’s administration has scrapped tax credits, cancelled permits and added new red tape. Since January, companies have pulled more than $22 billion (£17.6bn) of planned projects that would have created 16,500 jobs.

Analysts warn as many as 830,000 posts could go under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed on 4 July.

Bob Keefe, executive director at E2, said: “This was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors at the end of 2024. Now clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it our overall economy.”

Energy efficiency remains the largest employer with 2.4 million jobs after adding 91,000 last year. Renewables employ 569,000, up 9,000, while storage roles rose by 6,800.

The South led the nation with 41,000 new roles, pushing its clean energy workforce past 1 million.

California remains top with 552,000 jobs, followed by Texas with 281,000. Seventeen states have seen their clean energy workforces jump more than 20% since 2020.

Michael Timberlake, research director at E2, said: “Every year clean energy jobs become more critical to our overall economy. The future of America’s job market is now inseparable from clean energy.”

Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.
“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.
Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.
Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations.","The race to replace coal in Indonesia, the world’s largest coal exporter, has become a contest between the U.S. and China. At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

On 22 August, the US Department of the Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a stop-work order halting all offshore construction activities on the 704 MW project, which is already 80 per cent completed, according to its developers, Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables.

A few days later, the joint venture challenged the stop-work order in the US District Court for the District of Columbia, while Connecticut and Rhode Island filed their own lawsuits against the decision on the same day.

On 22 September, the court granted the preliminary injunction sought by Revolution Wind, allowing the developer to restart impacted activities while the underlying lawsuit challenging the stop-work order progresses.

“Revolution Wind will resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority,” according to Ørsted.

After the temporary injunction was granted, Oceantic Network’s CEO, Liz Burdock, said: “Today’s decision allowing work to resume on Revolution Wind is welcome news for the hundreds of skilled workers who can now return to their jobs while the legal process continues.”

The 704 MW Revolution Wind offshore wind project is set to provide power to Connecticut and Rhode Island in 2026. According to Oceantic Network, the wind farm sparked investments in Louisiana and New England shipyards, purchased export cables from a South Carolina factory, and spurred a steel supply chain that crossed New York and created hundreds of union jobs in Providence, Rhode Island.

“Revolution Wind is critical to securing New England’s electric grid, lowering energy costs for businesses and families, strengthening the local supply chain, and achieving energy independence. This Made in America energy project is putting Americans to work building reliable, affordable power to communities across New England that desperately need it,” Liz Burdock added.

HEALEY: When we talk clean energy, what sort of jobs are we talking about?
HEALEY: Minister, I want to come back the increase of women in the sector in a second.
GILES: These are more the energy jobs than the construction jobs that we're talking about.
HEALEY: Minister, we've got a new report out today, Sydney Uni, talking about the adversity that women still face in the construction sector – inflexible conditions.","NIC HEALEY, HOST: But look, this morning, and I mentioned it earlier, the Federal Minister for Skills and Trade, Andrew Giles, is in Morwell talking up careers, talking up jobs in the clean energy sector. Because one of the things we're constantly told about the renewable transition is that there will be jobs attached to it. Now, the focus today is on women in the energy sector. It's the launch of the Powering Her Pathways project designed to boost the amount of women working in that workforce. And Minister, a very good morning to you.

ANDREW GILES, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Good morning to you, Nic. Great to be speaking with you.

HEALEY: When we talk clean energy, what sort of jobs are we talking about?

GILES: There are so many jobs out there. The opportunities in net zero are enormous. We're around 32 or perhaps 42,000 electrical workers short alone in transmission work and work associated with batteries, and of course in rewiring our nation, our communities more broadly. These jobs are largely also located in regional Australia, which is why it's so important that I'm here in Morwell today.

HEALEY: I want to be clear, are these jobs that already exist? Are these jobs of the future that we need to train for now, a mix of both?

GILES: It is a mix of both. So there are jobs out there right now, and it's about also recognising something else that's going on in our workforce at the moment. We know we've got skill shortages right across the board, but those shortages are really concentrated in those areas of our economy, our labour force where there's a big skew in terms of gender, and clean energy is one of those. Only one in six jobs in this industry, in this growing industry, is currently being done by women, and that goes down to 6 percent when it comes to some of the trade apprenticeships. So it's about recognising we've got this challenge to build a workforce that we need to support our national goals, but also to open up more opportunities for women to be part of this.

HEALEY: Minister, I want to come back the increase of women in the sector in a second. I just also want to ask one thing, talking about these jobs – are they all ongoing jobs? Because we tend to see some of these be temporary during construction or building phase.

GILES: These are more the energy jobs than the construction jobs that we're talking about. There are some connected with transmission construction, but most of these are ongoing jobs.

HEALEY: Why is it so important to you that we get more women in this sector then?

GILES: There are two reasons. One, our view as a Government, and my view as a minister, is we should make sure that every job is equally open to every member of our community, that people aren't held back from pursuing their dreams because of a stereotype or some other barrier. The second reason is the point I made earlier, that we've got skills shortages right across the economy, but they are particularly concentrated in those areas where there's been a historical skew towards one gender or the other.

So there's a really important national interest as well as that principle-based job that says we've got to break down the barriers that have been holding back women from getting into clean energy, and for that matter, men getting into nursing or primary teaching.

HEALEY: What are you specifically targeting with Powering Her Pathways? How are you going to encourage this change?

GILES: Importantly, this is a community-led partnership that we are supporting with around $1 million of the Commonwealth investment through the Building Women's Careers Program. So I want to give a big shout-out to Tradeswomen Australia, a fantastic organisation, and the partnership they've established with TAFE Gippsland down here and ENGIE, the operators, to make sure that we can work out a couple of things. Firstly, to better understand the barriers that have been preventing from women getting into the industry and staying in the industry.

We also want to make sure that the training is appropriate, and that's going to be about piloting some arrangements with women down here, but also thinking about what best practice looks like, because this is about Morwell, but it's also about building a clearer understanding about how we can break down more barriers so that more women can have the opportunity to participate in the opportunities of this industry.

HEALEY: What are the barriers you want to see taken away?

GILES: There are some which are just cultural, I think, that have said that being involved in the electricity industry is roles that historically have been associated with men. So it's about hearing directly from women who have been the pathfinders, the pathbreakers in this industry, letting them tell and share their stories so that young women or perhaps women thinking about a career change can understand that this is an option for them. It's also about thinking about what are the flexibilities that we might need to think about in both the training offer, but also in building careers that work for everyone, not just the model that's been in existence up to this point in time.

HEALEY: Minister, we've got a new report out today, Sydney Uni, talking about the adversity that women still face in the construction sector – inflexible conditions. I think there was phrasing talking about becoming pregnant or looking for parental leave as being career-ending – still very focused on a jobs-for-blokes attitude. How do we make sure that that doesn't become part of the issue in the energy sector as well?

GILES: Yeah, these are really concerning reports. And as it happens, yesterday, I was with my colleague, Minister Rishworth, and also the Housing Minister, Minister O'Neil, meeting with employer and union representatives in construction to discuss exactly these issues, how we need to make sure that we are doing absolutely everything that's possible to build a culture that is safe and welcoming in all industries. Issues obviously apply in construction. We have been working to address them, including, of course, by placing the CFMEU in administration.

When it comes to clean energy, I don't presume that we deal with the same issues, but we've got to recognise the fact if only one in six people are currently women in the industry, we've got to ask why. And in particular, we've got to ask the women who have been involved in the industry about their experiences, the barriers that they have experienced and how we can work around them, and also think about how we can engage young people by understanding what it is that's saying to someone this is a job for me or this isn't a job for me.

HEALEY: I mean, surely one of the biggest issues is not just the attracting of people to this industry but the retaining of them once they're there.

GILES: Yeah, well, that's critical at every level. We want people to start, for example, trade apprenticeships, women in particular, but we also want to make sure they finish them. So some of the points that you made in construction apply equally to every industry, whether there are arrangements that recognise that inflexible start and finish times, for example, inflexible locations of work, outdated attitudes to pregnancy. All of these things need to be addressed. Now, there isn't going to be one answer, but the question really for this project, which of course is led by people in this community, is about understanding how do we bridge these barriers?

How do we make sure that some of the things that we know about, the issues that I've just been talking about, particularly around pregnancy and reproductive rights and health, can be dealt with, but also, what are the issues that perhaps we're not seeing? And that's why the regions are so important here because some of the barriers in Morwell, for example, will be different than in Melbourne when it comes perhaps to access to childcare, as just one example.

HEALEY: I'm speaking with Andrew Giles. He’s the Federal Skills and Training Minister. And Minister, I know you need to move on soon, but a few people have been texting in, and when it comes to jobs in clean energy, they're saying things like, ‘there are three wind farms in my area, there's only three full-time jobs for those farms’. There seems to be a perception that these jobs do not exist at a level that makes a difference to the community.

GILES: Again, I won't speak to any particular individual circumstances, but I'd ask people to have a look at the work that's being done by Jobs and Skills Australia, which has identified an enormous shortage of good jobs in the region. We know we need tens of thousands of more electrical workers in Australia to meet our net zero ambitions and to enable the electrification of large chunks of our economy. It's something that I'm concerned about. It's something the industry is concerned about. And in particular, I want to make sure that every Australian has an equal opportunity to be part of this transformation.

HEALEY: Very quickly, Free TAFE, I understand we're seeing some pretty strong numbers out of regional Victoria people taking up that option.

GILES: Yeah, fantastic. It's been terrific to see the take-up in regional Victoria. And some of the barriers that have held people back, I mean, previously to do an enrolled nursing diploma would have cost someone $17,000. So that's obviously been a huge barrier that's held people back from realising their ambitions. Regional Victoria have really picked up the ball and run with it when it comes to Free TAFE. It's something that I'm really looking forward to chatting to TAFE Gippsland in a minute about to see what they are seeing on the ground, particularly seeing different people who've had the opportunity to participate in TAFE who've been held back.

Around the country, more than one in three Free TAFE enrolments have been in the regions. So we're seeing a fantastic opportunity being opened up that was previously closed for people to get fantastic skills in community development, in nursing, in early childhood education, and, of course, in the traditional trades as well.",https://ministers.dewr.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-03/dese-default-social.png,N,,2025-09-23 07:00:00.235661

The World Network of Biosphere Reserves now includes 759 biosphere reserves across 136 countries, which Azoulay said demonstrates ""concrete multilateralism"".","Amid increasing global challenges, experts from around the world gathered on Monday in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, to discuss environmental and biodiversity conservation, highlighting the key roles of international cooperation and technological innovation.

Addressing the opening ceremony of the 5th World Congress of Biosphere Reserves, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang called for strengthened global cooperation on biosphere conservation.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Ding said, China has achieved ""remarkable progress"" in ecological protection and green development. China has also actively contributed to global environmental and climate governance, playing a key role as a participant, contributor and leader in international ecological efforts.

To address global environmental challenges, Ding urged countries to strengthen coordination and cooperation, increase investment and encourage participation from governments, enterprises and the public. He also called for enhanced scientific and technological support, the sharing of research outcomes, and efforts to bridge knowledge gaps between countries and regions.

Ding highlighted the importance of biosphere reserves in promoting harmony between humans and nature and fostering coordinated progress between economic growth and environmental protection.

The congress, which is convened by UNESCO every 10 years, aims to evaluate progress, share experiences, and set future directions for the Man and the Biosphere Programme.

Latifa Yaakoubi, chair of the International Coordinating Council of the MAB Programme, said countries around the world are now facing a series of interconnected crises, including climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. The impacts of these crises are intensifying, affecting everyone and threatening the foundations of socioeconomic systems.

Yaakoubi said the goal of the MAB Programme, established in 1971, is to enhance understanding of the connections between humanity and nature. This understanding is crucial for changing behaviors and building a more sustainable future.

The program can bridge global ideals with local and regional actions, align national agendas with international ones, and fulfill sustainability commitments at local, national and international levels, she said.

Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, echoed Yaakoubi's comments, adding that ecological multilateralism is central to UNESCO's work.

The World Network of Biosphere Reserves now includes 759 biosphere reserves across 136 countries, which Azoulay said demonstrates ""concrete multilateralism"".

Azoulay also highlighted an island watch program in Mauritius, where local communities are becoming observers and actively involved in monitoring environmental changes.

""Gaining a better understanding of the living world also means raising awareness of indigenous knowledge and integrating it better into our management policies,"" Azoulay said, stressing the importance of open science and international cooperation.

Hou Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said new technologies, including artificial intelligence and biotechnology, have created favorable conditions for collective efforts to tackle global ecological and environmental challenges.

""The establishment and development of biosphere reserves not only provide important application scenarios for the practical implementation of new theories, technologies and products, but also serve as an important platform for countries to jointly strengthen ecological conservation efforts and cooperation, thereby achieving common sustainable development,"" Hou said.

He emphasized the importance of deepening technological communication and cooperation to empower the construction of biosphere reserves by leveraging the World Network of Biosphere Reserves, universities and research institutions. This collaboration should focus on key areas such as ecological restoration, biodiversity protection, and green and low-carbon development, providing more effective solutions.

""We should strengthen the co-construction and sharing of foundational capability building,"" he said, adding that a big data platform should be built to enhance exchanges and cooperation in data sharing and talent cultivation, thereby establishing an intelligent, integrated ecosystem research and monitoring network.

He also called for greater attention to the challenges faced by developing countries in balancing socioeconomic development with ecological and environmental protection, emphasizing the need to provide them with tailored solutions.",https://www.chinadailyhk.com/upload/main/image/2025/09/23/97a52b83bed2cbe5146911fdb04fcb04.png,N,,2025-09-23 05:59:58.777235

He served on the Biden-Harris Campaign Climate Advisory Council, the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, and co-chaired the executive order committee that shaped national environmental justice policies, which was started by President Bill Clinton.
“And how you were able to go about getting this facility was pretty strategic.” When he started ReGenesis, Mitchell said he didn’t know anything about environmental justice.
Quentin Pair, retired from the U.S. Department of Justice, rounded out the evening’s speeches, complimenting the folks in the room on the work they’d done.
“As wonderful as Sherri is, and she is wonderful, you are the ones who make this possible.” “All of these people we’ve been talking about … didn’t know a damn thing about environmental justice, and many of you may not know what environmental justice is,” Pair continued.","In 2020, in the midst of the COVID pandemic, Sherri White-Williamson took a bold step toward realizing a dream. She started the Environmental Justice Community Action Network, known as EJCAN, in Clinton to help empower the Sampson County community and surrounding areas to fight against environmental threats. On Saturday night, about 225 people gathered to help her celebrate the organization’s fifth anniversary and also to welcome EJCAN to its new facility, the former National Guard Armory, at 200 Northeast Blvd.

“It’s phenomenal to see the work, the effort, but most importantly the vision of Sherri to make the offer for this building; to manifest this in about six months’ time,” said master of ceremonies for Saturday’s banquet, Jeffrey Robbins.

EJCAN Board Chair Allie Sheffield called White-Williamson “an extraordinary leader.”

“As a result of her leading all of us, I think we have done amazing things in the time we’ve been working together,” she continued.

Phillip Bell of the Coharie was also on hand for land acknowledgement. “For over 14,000 years, this land and the waterways have been integral to the life-sustaining ceremonies and healing practices,” he shared. “Despite facing displacement and removal, American Indian communities in North Carolina have shown remarkable resilience and sustainability.”

Bell added that American Indians are present in all 100 counties in the state, and Coharie continues to be one of the federally recognized tribes.

White-Williamson said she was overwhelmed at the turnout for the banquet and the recognition for EJCAN’s work. “Five years ago, some of us who were students of Vermont Law decided we wanted to try to make a difference in the world, and we decided we wanted to start here in Sampson County,” she explained. “We started working for several communities here, primarily the Snow Hill community, and we wanted to hear what they needed here in the county. We managed to get a consent agreement to help improve life for folks around the Snow Hill community, but more than that, I think the gathering here demonstrates what we were trying so hard to do, is to bring community together so that we could all work together toward a common goal. The environment is most important to all of us. It doesn’t matter where you live, how much money you make, what your race makeup is, or any of those things. We all breathe the same air, we all drink the same water. What we should be doing most of all is working together to make sure all of us are equally taken care of, in terms of our lives and our lifestyles.”

She asked those present to let EJCAN know of any changes they’d like to see made in the community. “We will work very hard to make that happen.”

After a performance by gospel recording artist Gerald Hinton, EJCAN Deputy Director Denise Robinson took to the stage to thank sponsors of the event and donors to the organization. Robbins called Robinson “the glue that holds everything together.”

Maggie Galka, co-founder and classmate of White-Williamson’s, introduced the guest speaker for the evening’s event, Harold Mitchell, the founder of the ReGenesis Institute in Spartanburg, S.C. In the late 1990s, Mitchell founded ReGenesis to help revitalize his community after his family and neighbors experienced severe health effects from toxic pollution. Under his guidance, ReGenesis grew from a $20,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to nearly $300 million in investments from federal, state and local governments, as well as the private sector.

He served on the Biden-Harris Campaign Climate Advisory Council, the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council, and co-chaired the executive order committee that shaped national environmental justice policies, which was started by President Bill Clinton.

“This is not a sprint, this is a marathon,” Mitchell shared. “I know, with this five-year anniversary that you are celebrating, if you look at the experiences of the past five years, we’ve had the pandemic, we’ve had the experience of this administration, but you’re still here. And I think it says a lot about North Carolina, because you know how to mobilize, organize and galvanize.”

He said that EJCAN is something special, because of its diversity and local support. “What you have is a beginning point, with this incredible facility,” Mitchell stated. “And how you were able to go about getting this facility was pretty strategic.”

When he started ReGenesis, Mitchell said he didn’t know anything about environmental justice. “I was sick. I was throwing up blood. We grew up in front of a fertilizer plant, landfill in the backyard, chemical plants to the side. We were completely surrounded.”

Mitchell’s sister died from sepsis, due to the chemicals surrounding their home, he said. “We got tired of seeing people pointing fingers back and forth,” he shared. “We were able to pull everyone together.”

He said he’s seen small, rural communities that had a population the size of the room in which the banquet was held. “And they’re drinking 150 parts per billion arsenic in their drinking water,” he said.

“This is a good start,” Mitchell said of EJCAN. “Please pull together. Embrace the vision of EJCAN. There is so much that can be done here. You are in the place to be able to help your community.”

He encouraged those present to come together and look at the real needs of the community. “The answers are in the community,” he said. “The federal government doesn’t have the answers; the state government doesn’t have the answers. And until the people realize who’s in charge, you are the ones in charge, and that’s why the civic engagement piece is so important. If your elected officials ain’t doing their job, send them home. It’s time to get spinally challenged people who are sitting in office, doing nothing because they’re afraid of who’s coming after them. You own them. Take them out. Until we do so … elections have consequences. We’re seeing that over the past eight months. Please take your community forward.”

Mitchell concluded that at EJCAN’s sixth anniversary, he hoped to see solid plans in place to improve the community.

Quentin Pair, retired from the U.S. Department of Justice, rounded out the evening’s speeches, complimenting the folks in the room on the work they’d done. “Everything that has been done could not have been done without you,” he stated. “As wonderful as Sherri is, and she is wonderful, you are the ones who make this possible.”

“All of these people we’ve been talking about … didn’t know a damn thing about environmental justice, and many of you may not know what environmental justice is,” Pair continued. “But they knew there was something wrong with their communities, and they stepped forward.”

At the same time, Americans’ protections for clean air and water are being rescinded, and electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.
According to MidAmerican’s and IPL’s latest energy plans, both utilities intend to build new gas power plants while continuing to operate outdated, costly coal power plants.
With a power grid increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, Iowans will face rising energy prices and devastating health impacts.
“While the wind turbines are hard to miss, it’s Iowa’s dirty secret that there are still 6 coal plants across the state polluting our air and water.","DES MOINES, Iowa — Today, Sierra Club released its fifth annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This year, Berkshire Hathaway-owned MidAmerican Energy, as well as Alliant Energy-owned Interstate Power and Light (IPL), both received the lowest grade possible, an F.

It is IPL’s second year in a row to receive a failing grade, while MidAmerican’s score dropped 10 points over the last year from 23 out of 100 (D) to 13 out of 100 (F). MidAmerican’s and IPL’s low scores reveal the utilities are resistant to fully transitioning to affordable clean energy, and continue to rely on expensive, polluting fossil fuels. At the same time, Americans’ protections for clean air and water are being rescinded, and electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

According to MidAmerican’s and IPL’s latest energy plans, both utilities intend to build new gas power plants while continuing to operate outdated, costly coal power plants. IPL plans to add 1,275 MW of gas-burning power over the next 10 years, and MidAmerican is slated to add 1,164 MW. With a power grid increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, Iowans will face rising energy prices and devastating health impacts.

“MidAmerican and IPL have an opportunity to be the renewable energy leaders they claim to be, but instead, they keep clinging to gas and coal,” said Pamela Mackey Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter Director. “While the wind turbines are hard to miss, it’s Iowa’s dirty secret that there are still 6 coal plants across the state polluting our air and water. But together, Iowans can demand better from our utilities. It’s time these companies acted in our best interest, and that means phasing out dangerous fossil fuels to save lives and lower bills.”

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

As was the case under the TCJA, “qualified business income” includes qualified REIT dividends.
In addition, as described above, certain REIT investors will continue to benefit from the qualified business income deduction with respect to qualified REIT dividends.","On July 4, 2025, the President signed into law a reconciliation bill that is referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”). In significant part, the OBBBA extended or made permanent various provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”) that were set to expire at the end of this year. The OBBBA also introduced many changes to the tax law that will be relevant to various sectors of the economy, including real estate. Below is a high-level summary of certain key provisions of the OBBBA that may impact the real estate sector.

Goulston & Storrs continues to closely monitor the OBBBA and its implications for individuals and businesses across sectors. If you have any questions about how these changes may affect you or your business, please contact your G&S attorney or a member of our Tax Group.

Income Tax Rates

The OBBBA preserves and permanently extends the ordinary income tax rates applicable to individuals that were introduced by the TCJA (i.e., a 37% top marginal rate). No changes were made to the capital gains rate. Read additional details related to the impact of the OBBBA on individuals, including charitable giving, as well as estate and gift tax considerations here.

Bonus Depreciation

The OBBBA now makes permanent 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property and new tangible property that has a recovery period of 20 years or less. The TCJA had introduced the 100% bonus regime but had been gradually sunsetting the program. The full expensing rule will apply to qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025. As was the case prior to the OBBBA, this provision does not apply with respect to non-residential real property, residential rental property, and qualified improvement property held by taxpayers with a real property business who elect out of the 30% limitation on interest deductions described below.

Qualified Production Property

Subject to several limitations and qualifications, the OBBBA introduces an election allowing taxpayers to currently expense costs associated with building so-called “qualified production property,” which generally is limited to nonresidential real property that is used by the taxpayer to manufacture tangible personal property. Among other things, the new election will only apply to newly constructed manufacturing facilities located in the United States or a possession of the United States, the construction of which begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 19, 2029, and which are placed in service before January 1, 2031.

Business Interest Limitation

Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code, originally established under the TCJA, limits business interest expense deductions to 30% of adjusted taxable income (“ATI”). Since 2022, the calculation of ATI has been based on earnings before interest and taxes, but after deducting depreciation and amortization (“EBIT”). The OBBBA returns to the more generous pre-2022 standard by adding back depreciation and amortization to the calculation of ATI, effectively allowing taxpayers to deduct interest subject to a limitation of 30% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”).

As was the case under the TCJA, the 30% of ATI limitation does not apply to taxpayers with a real property business who elect out of Section 163(j).

Read additional details related to the impact of the OBBBA on financing transactions here.

SALT Deduction Cap

The limitation on the deduction of state and local taxes (“SALT”) was a major facet of the TCJA and has been one of its most controversial provisions. There is a temporary increase in the SALT deduction cap from $10,000 to $40,000 beginning in 2025. The cap increases by 1% per year beginning in 2026 until 2030 when it reverts to $10,000.

The increased SALT deduction begins to phase out when a taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income reaches a threshold of $500,000 (or $250,000 for married filing separately), which will grow by 1% annually. The amount of the phasedown is equal to 30% of the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross income over the threshold; however, the deduction will not decrease below $10,000.

Qualified Business Income Deduction

OBBBA makes permanent the qualified business income deduction under Section 199A, which allows non-corporate taxpayers the ability to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income. As was the case under the TCJA, “qualified business income” includes qualified REIT dividends.

REITs

The OBBBA relaxes the REIT asset test with respect to taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) to provide that a REIT cannot hold securities in one or more TRSs representing more than 25% (up from 20%) of the REIT’s value. This change is applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. In addition, as described above, certain REIT investors will continue to benefit from the qualified business income deduction with respect to qualified REIT dividends.

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The OBBBA permanently extends and updates the qualified opportunity zone (QOZ) program, which had previously been set to expire for new investments made after December 31, 2026. The OBBBA made several changes to the QOZ program, including a new designation process, deferral mechanics, changes to the designation of qualified census tracts, incentives to promote investments in rural low-income communities, and new information return reporting requirements and associated penalties. See additional details related to the OBBBA and Qualified Opportunity Zones here.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credits

The OBBBA increases by 12% the State housing ceiling applicable to the allocation of 9% low-income housing tax credits for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2025. In addition, the so-called “50% test” applicable to 4% credit projects financed by tax-exempt bonds is relaxed for certain buildings placed in service after December 31, 2025, to provide that it is sufficient for 25% of the aggregate basis of the building and land to be financed by tax-exempt bonds, one or more of which must be issued after December 31, 2025. The new 25% test requires that at least 5% of building and land be financed by tax-exempt bonds issued after December 31, 2025.

Phase Out of Certain Green Building Incentives

The OBBBA makes numerous changes to the clean energy incentives introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In relevant part, the OBBBA phases out the Section 179D deduction for the cost of energy efficient commercial building property and new energy efficient homes credit under Section 45L. The Section 179D deduction will not apply to property the construction of which begins after June 30, 2026. The Section 45L credit will not apply to any qualified new energy efficient home acquired after June 30, 2026.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15468_1147.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 00:57:59.408598

LANSING — In case you missed it, Lucerne International Inc. has scrapped its plans for a “$50 million hot aluminum forging plant with 325 new jobs in Detroit,” according to Crain’s Detroit Business. The company is blaming the chaotic tariffs supported by GOP senate candidate Mike Rogers for “driv[ing] up costs” and undermining the auto supplier’s “three-year effort to bring manufacturing from China to the U.S.”

Earlier this month, Mike Rogers was caught at a campaign event “making fun of those who worry about higher prices,” arguing that they are “worth the financial strife being put on the American people,” even as the U.S. has lost 42,000 manufacturing jobs since Rogers-backed tariffs were implemented in April.

“Mike Rogers’ reckless tariff policies just cost Detroit more than 300 manufacturing jobs and a $50 million investment that was supposed to bring production back from China,” said Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Curtis Hertel. “While Mike Rogers is out on the campaign trail mocking families worried about higher costs, his failed policies are killing opportunities for Michigan workers to rebuild the state’s manufacturing base.”

Crain’s Detroit Business: Auto supplier scraps $50M Detroit factory plan as tariffs drive up costs

Lucerne International Inc.’s plan for a $50 million hot aluminum forging plant with 325 new jobs in Detroit — the culmination of the automotive supplier’s three-year effort to bring manufacturing from China to the U.S. — was nearly a done deal.

Then came President Donald Trump’s frenzied tariffs and regulatory upheaval, prompting decision-making paralysis across the industry.

[…] “It’s everything converging at once,” Buchzeiger told Crain’s. “You’ve got tariffs that are hitting our equipment costs. You’ve got tariffs that are hitting our raw material costs. You’ve got these questions over the Inflation Reduction Act. You’ve got the industry itself, where programs are being delayed or canceled, margins are being squeezed.”

Michigan is feeling the pain as previously announced investments fizzle out. In just the past few weeks, an Australian mining giant scrapped a $210 million electric vehicle battery plant in Detroit due to federal policy, a once high-flying battery startup is vacating most of its factory in Van Buren Township, a $60 billion microchip project near Flint is kaput and the list goes on.

Meanwhile, the Detroit 3 automakers are out billions of dollars in profit due to import fees, while production volume uncertainty rocks auto suppliers.

[…] Tariffs could cost the auto industry a staggering $188 billion over the next three years, according to an analysis by Ann Arbor-based think tank Center for Automotive Research. Auto manufacturers have so far absorbed most of the costs to protect sales, but sticker prices are expected to rise and that could hurt production volume.

[…] “I think in the long run, tariffs are bad for everybody because all they’re doing is raising the price for consumers here in the U.S. and making us uncompetitive with the rest of the world,” [Buchzeiger] said.

In its latest energy plan, the utility proposed to burn coal indefinitely at the majority of its coal plants, including the Hunter and Huntington coal plants in Utah and Dave Johnston Unit 4, Naughton Unit 2, and Wyodak coal plants in Wyoming.
“Rocky Mountain Power is leaving money on the table, period.

This year, PacifiCorp received a C. In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress, if any, the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

Important to note is PacifiCorp’s grade is based on its entire system, including Rocky Mountain Power in the east (covering parts of Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho) and Pacific Power in the west (covering parts of Oregon, Washington, and California). When reviewed separately, Rocky Mountain Power received a D (31 out of 100) and Pacific Power received a B (63 out of 100). Pacific Power boosts PacifiCorp’s overall score because it operates in states that require utilities to phase out fossil fuels and transition to clean energy like solar, wind, and batteries. PacifiCorp’s plans for its Oregon and Washington customers project more progress in its clean energy transition and PacifiCorp has initiated processes to procure clean resources for these states, but only because it is legally mandated to do so.

By contrast, Rocky Mountain Power has backtracked on retirement dates for some of the dirtiest coal plants in the country. In its latest energy plan, the utility proposed to burn coal indefinitely at the majority of its coal plants, including the Hunter and Huntington coal plants in Utah and Dave Johnston Unit 4, Naughton Unit 2, and Wyodak coal plants in Wyoming. With most of PacifiCorp’s coal plants forecasted to operate without a retirement date, Utahns, Wyomingites, and Idahoans are facing the consequences of a grid powered by expensive, polluting fossil fuels, and electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

Earlier this year, Sierra Club released a report based on PacifiCorp’s own proposal that showed investments in renewable energy could create thousands of long-term, good-paying jobs while boosting economic activity and generating critical tax revenue for communities in Utah and Wyoming.

“Rocky Mountain Power is leaving money on the table, period. Investing in clean energy could immediately boost our communities by providing good jobs and funding for schools,” said Luis Miranda, Utah-based Campaign Organizer for the Sierra Club. “This report is more proof that the coal plants in Utah are dragging all of us down. They are giving kids asthma, making our water dirty and unsafe, and running our wallets dry.”

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:15.576190

Many were hoping the promise made before wasn’t empty, but it turns out people who shell out for an electric car won’t be able to make their neighbors help pay for a portion of it.

The Subaru Legacy is no more.

This news comes as the September 30 deadline for the federal EV tax credits approaches. It turns out the reason for this rather unsurprising development is rather fundamental.

It all comes down to one thing: cost. The state of California can’t foot the bill for such a measure, reports Bloomberg. According to Governor Newsom, the removal of the tax incentives by Republicans is “federal vandalism.”

Considering under the federal program people who lived in other states helped finance vehicle purchases for people living in California, we’re not sure how that even makes sense. But most politicians get rather testy when they’re told they can no longer raid private citizen’s earnings for their pet programs.

Some automakers were really banking on California offering the $7,500 EV tax credit, picking up where the federal government is leaving off. There was a proposal for a $5,000 incentive, but California can’t even float that much.

After all, the Golden State is out of cash, running a budget deficit was it keeps spending money like crazy. It’s almost like there are consequences to actions.

During a speech announcing the disappointing development, Governor Newsom made sure to threaten GM CEO Mary Barra, accusing her of “selling out” his state by pushing on US Congress to end the EV mandate in California.

However, Newsom has made a fresh batch of promises, saying next year California will offer a new EV subsidy program, even though it hasn’t had one since 2023. We can’t wait to see who he blames when that also falls apart.

SACE is pleased to report that on August 28, the Forsyth County Council did indeed pass a unanimous, bipartisan resolution questioning the health and safety impacts of the Transco Southeast Supply Enhancement Project and asking FERC and NC DEQ to deny applicable permits unless and until concrete steps are taken that ensure the protection of the community. You can read the resolution here. Thank you, Forsyth County Council, for adding your name to the growing list of communities with concerns about this expensive, disruptive, harmful, and unnecessary fossil gas pipeline project.

I grew up in Thomasville, but with my grandmothers, great-aunts, and uncles all in Winston-Salem, it always felt like my second home. Back in the 1980s, I attended the North Carolina Governor’s School at Salem, took summer courses at Wake Forest, and worked a summer job at Piedmont Airlines in its final days. I have fond memories of early dinners at the K&W on Knollwood with my grandmother — a place we loved until it was tragically destroyed by a methane gas explosion in 1988.

I now work for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, and I have serious concerns about a large proposed interstate gas pipeline project called the Williams Transco Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) that could jeopardize the safety of citizens along its path, including those right here in Winston-Salem. Part of the SSEP expansion is 24 miles of new 42” pipeline to be added next to Transco’s three existing large diameter, high pressure pipelines here in the Triad.

These older lines were installed long before Winston-Salem’s population, now over 125,000, began to grow around them. Neighborhoods, businesses, churches, hospitals, and schools are now in close proximity. Currently, plans call for adding a fourth massive pipeline into this already crowded corridor, a move that could be incredibly disruptive but also potentially dangerous. Much of the route now falls within a “high consequence area,” meaning that if the pipeline were to explode, loss of life and property would be likely. Heightening the risk, Williams intends to thread the new pipeline beneath the three existing lines in several places, including a crossing beside the new VA Clinic in Kernersville and another just 1,000 feet from Wallburg Elementary School on Highway 109.

In North Carolina, where safety comes first, adding another pipeline so close to homes, schools, and hospitals is reckless, especially when we don’t even know the full blast impact of stacking it beneath three existing lines. It is possible to calculate a “blast zone” for a single pipeline when you know its diameter and pressure. For example, for a 42-inch pipeline at a standard 1,440 psi, the blast zone extends 1,115 feet from the center — though the Pipeline Safety Trust has raised concerns that this figure may be too low. Currently, there are no studies to determine how the blast zone might be impacted if an explosion were to occur beneath two, three, or even four pipelines, leaving critical safety questions unanswered.

Furthermore, most of the gas from this project may never be used in North Carolina, but Duke Energy’s ratepayers in the state will likely end up paying for most of the $1.5 billion project since Duke Energy has agreed to contract for two-thirds of it. As cleaner, more affordable energy sources come online, Duke Energy likely won’t need most of that pipeline capacity. Williams has designed the project so that excess supply can continue flowing south toward liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminals in the Gulf Coast.

The project includes adding bi-directional flow capability to compressor stations all the way to Transco’s main pooling station on the Alabama-Mississippi line. This would allow SSEP, if approved, to move fracked gas from the Pennsylvania and West Virginia shale gas region down to the Gulf Coast, conveniently close to LNG export terminals.

Winston-Salem is where I formed some of my most cherished memories, and I want future generations to have the same chance — to grow up in safe neighborhoods, to gather with family in beloved local spots, and to build their own stories without the looming threat of another hazardous methane gas pipeline. Protecting this community means preserving not just our safety, but the places and moments that make it home.

So why are we being asked to assume the risks so Williams and others can profit from new capital projects and LNG exports while undermining the state’s clean energy goals? It’s not too late to stop this. The project has not received state or federal approvals. If this dangerous and unnecessary proposal concerns you, contact your elected officials and urge Forsyth County Commissioners to join Guilford County in passing a resolution against SSEP.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/pipeline-orange.png,N,,2025-09-23 06:00:44.359473

In 2013, when the Appalachian fracking rush was still in its early days, then President Barack Obama extolled its benefits in his State of the Union address. Not only had natural gas already helped to lower America’s carbon emissions, it could protect Americans from the fluctuations of the global oil market, Obama said. And there was one more important benefit: “Nearly everyone’s energy bill is lower because of it.”

Obama’s words echoed fracking’s champions in politics, business and government, who boasted that natural gas would save Americans money—perhaps nowhere more fervently than in Pennsylvania, the epicenter of the boom.

“Having that kind of a resource and that kind of production of energy right in our own backyard does help to keep the price of natural gas down for customers and the price of electricity down too,” the former chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, Terry Fitzpatrick, told television viewers in 2011. “So it’s very important to the people of Pennsylvania.”

But the savings Obama and others touted were short-lived for many Pennsylvanians, followed by punishing increases that are on track to balloon even further as forecasts for demand skyrocket in the age of AI. The result is a growing energy affordability crisis, a nightmare collision of higher utility bills, climate change and shrinking federal aid.

After state Republicans fielded “distressed calls from Pennsylvanians asking for an inquiry into rising energy prices,” the Pennsylvania House Republican Policy Committee held a hearing in 2023 to learn more about the reasons for a “dramatic increase in energy costs for residents and businesses.”

“With our immense resources, and our status as a net-energy exporter, one would think the People of PA would receive lower energy prices,” the committee wrote. “But this is not the case.”

David Callahan, then the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade group for companies fracking in the Marcellus formation, said natural gas was “a solution to poverty” that is “most beneficial to lower income individuals and communities of color.” He testified that the state Department of Environmental Protection was to blame for rising prices because permitting delays held up fracking projects.

That argument didn’t address a fundamental contradiction: If Pennsylvania is producing so much more gas, why are prices going up? Why aren’t its residents benefiting more from the resource beneath their feet?

Impossible Choices

Natural gas production in Pennsylvania more than doubled between 2013 and 2024, and consumption rose faster than in any other state. The rise in natural gas consumption in Pennsylvania has largely been driven by electricity as coal power plants went offline. Now close to 60 percent of the state’s electricity comes from gas, far above the national average. Pennsylvania is awash in excess power, sending more electricity outside its borders than any other state and exporting, domestically and internationally, three-quarters of the gas it produces.

These shifts have not translated to lower costs for Pennsylvanians. Comparing average household electricity prices from 2010 to 2024, residents here haven’t fared better than consumers in many states with little or no natural gas production.

After a period of stability, Pennsylvania electricity rates have soared since 2020. The average household electricity bill in the state has risen 31 percent in that time, according to the Energy Information Administration, faster than the national average by six percentage points.

Some of the highest increases in Pennsylvania are in the southwest, the heart of fracking country, where residents often live in close proximity to wells and bear the heaviest health and environmental burdens caused by drilling.

Gas industry advocates say increases in the past few years are blips due to price shocks from the Ukraine war and other factors that affected the global economy, not a reason to question Pennsylvania’s resource decisions.

But the long-term record is more difficult to defend.

A review of federal electricity data since 2005—a year selected because it preceded the development of the Marcellus, the shale gas deposit under Pennsylvania—shows that the period when abundant gas contributed to stable electricity costs didn’t last long.

The state’s household electricity prices were the 14th highest in the country in 2005. In 2024, they were also 14th. Pennsylvania’s prices were above the national average in 2005 and remain so now.

Gas costs aren’t the only driver. Utilities spent significantly more on wires and other grid infrastructure that were little noticed when fuel costs were flat.

Still, the state’s dependence on a single energy source is a significant part of the story.

Twenty-four percent of Pennsylvanians struggled to pay their energy bills in 2024, according to census data, up from 19 percent in 2021, and disconnection rates are rising.

Data from utilities shows a 25 percent increase in electricity terminations between 2023 and 2024 alone.

Elected officials, activists and utility lawyers who help people with their energy bills have watched the reverberations ripple across the state. A suddenly higher bill for a person on a tight budget means impossible choices, between food and heat or between medicine and air conditioning. Terminations can lead to debt, eviction and family separations. In heat waves and cold snaps, and for people who rely on electricity to power medical equipment, they can be life-threatening.

“More and more people cannot afford to keep energy on,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, a legal advocacy group that assists people with their bills.

When people can’t keep up with their utility bills, they try to make do with less electricity, she said, which often has serious consequences for their health.

“In the wintertime, I’m usually not turning on the heat because I don’t want the electric bill to go up,” said Amber Gale, a resident of Clearfield County in central Pennsylvania. “We unfortunately don’t have any air conditioning. We can’t afford to get it, but we do have some fans.” She tries to avoid turning the fans on in the summer, even as the temperature soars.

In all seasons, she constantly watches how much electricity she uses, trying to avoid spikes in her bills.

The Pennsylvania Gas Discount

For almost 20 years, the gas industry sold fracking to Pennsylvanians as a revolutionary economic engine that would bring jobs, infrastructure investment, energy security, tax revenue for local governments—and lower energy bills.

“Abundant natural gas in the Marcellus not only means lower heating bills for families and small businesses, but lower electricity rates as well, as they are tied to prices for natural gas,” a 2011 fact sheet from the Marcellus Shale Coalition said. In the early 2010s, the industry paid for economic studies carried out by researchers at Penn State University that estimated that Pennsylvanians had already saved millions of dollars in energy bills because of fracking, $27.7 million on electricity alone.

“Electricity prices for all Pennsylvanians are down nearly 40 percent since the onset of the shale gas revolution, thanks to the increased use of natural gas for electric generation,” David Spigelmyer, then the coalition’s president, wrote in 2016.

In 2017, the University of Pennsylvania released a study reflecting on more than 10 years of shale gas development. As things stood then, the fracking revolution had delivered a “clear win for consumers” in Pennsylvania, said Christina Simeone, the researcher who authored the study and now works for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Simeone’s study showed a “Pennsylvania Gas Discount” from fracking that lowered gas and electricity commodity prices, though residential consumers were still paying more than national averages. From 2007 t0 2016, consumers in the state experienced fewer service terminations and less energy debt.

But Simeone warned that the discount could disappear, especially as companies exported more gas out of state. “It is also important to understand that erosion of the PA Gas Discount has the potential to also increase electric power prices,” she wrote.

Her prediction was prescient. Earlier in the fracking boom, lack of pipeline infrastructure meant that the gas was essentially stranded in the state, sold at lower prices than would be available elsewhere.

Today, with additional infrastructure in place, the local cost benefit has been undercut by the state’s role as a major supplier to much of the country and abroad.

This is a boon for companies that produce gas, but it does little for the state’s consumers.

“Pennsylvanians are competing for their own gas with other countries that are willing to pay a lot of money for it,” said Marx, with the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. “There’s no requirement, like, ‘You shall provide this amount of gas to the people whose backyards it’s pumped out of,’ right? If you have people willing to pay more to ship it out of state, as long as the infrastructure exists to ship it out of state, you’re going to ship it out of state.”

Because Pennsylvania’s electricity grid is now so reliant on natural gas, when gas prices spike, utility bills go up, too. More service disconnections follow. Marx said there is a “direct line” between rising gas prices and more people losing access to heating and cooling in their homes.

These factors are magnified as the country enters a period in which electricity demand is rising to serve the growth of data centers and AI. Rising demand for electricity contributes to rising prices for gas, which is Pennsylvania’s and the country’s leading fuel for power plants.

“People Are Struggling”

Before Elizabeth Marx specialized in utility law, she was an attorney at the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence. In that role, she handled a case where custody was transferred to an abusive parent because the other parent had lost electricity service.

“The judge thought it was safer for that child to be with the batterer than it was to be in a home without electricity,” she said. That case gave her insight into the unexpected ways that energy precarity can unravel lives, compromising safety, housing, health, education and stability.

Marx’s work is deeply personal for her. When she was a child, she and her mother and siblings escaped from domestic violence, leading to a period of upheaval. After leaving a shelter, the family lived in a 19th century farmhouse with nearly original windows and extremely high costs for heating.

“It’s not an academic exercise for me,” she said. “I lived poverty.” She and her family experienced energy insecurity, though it didn’t have a name then.

Today, she’s increasingly alarmed by the situation in her home state. She has a bird’s-eye view via the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project’s emergency hotline for people seeking help with their utility bills. These days, the calls are coming from across the state, Marx said.

“You’d find energy insecurity everywhere you go. There’s certainly high concentrations in Philadelphia, and increasingly high concentrations in Pittsburgh. But we’ve got clients in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania, and Erie, Pennsylvania, and everywhere in between,” Marx said. That’s why promising Pennsylvanians lower energy prices was a winning political strategy in the 2024 election: “It resonates with people, because there’s not a single person that’s going to tell you their energy prices haven’t gone up.”

Between 2006 and 2025, western Pennsylvania’s Duquesne Light Co. and West Penn Power, and Penelec in northern and central Pennsylvania all increased rates more than 110 percent, according to an annual rate survey from the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission that started in 2006. Met-Ed, in the southeast, increased rates 95 percent. These increases far outpaced the rate of inflation in this period. (The percentages are based on comparisons of the total electricity bill for households using 500 kilowatt-hours per month.)

“In my office, we see so many people, young people living in their first apartments, seniors who are on fixed incomes, parents with really hungry kids who are holding their breath when they get their electric bill every month, because it could be a big shock,” state Rep. Mandy Steele, a Democrat representing an area just north of Pittsburgh, said during a virtual discussion in April about rising electricity costs.

Jessica Shirley, secretary of Pennsylvania’s Department of Environmental Protection, shared her own experience in that meeting of opening a bill in the dead of the prior winter. “I was like, ‘We’re just gonna be cold, guys.’”

For Amber Gale, who moved from Pittsburgh to Clearfield County in 2020, increases have meant shortchanging her budget for food and clothing and going without heat whenever possible. “When we first moved, our average electric bill was anywhere from $50 to $60. Now, this past winter, it was about $120 to $170,” she said. She still can’t figure out why the bill for her small apartment, which uses electric heat, is so high.

Gale has experienced what it’s like to survive without electricity at home: walking to the library to charge her phone, going to the laundromat to wash clothes, relying on friends or family for other essential needs. She fears that increasing utility bills will land her in the same situation again.

“Not being able to afford anything, having our electricity turned off right now, getting sick and dying from the heat: That’s what I’m really worried about,” said Gale, who has diabetes, one of many chronic conditions exacerbated by high temperatures. “I’ve never been able to handle the heat well, so it makes me really sick.” There are no cooling centers close to where she lives and few options for public transportation.

In Braddock, a steel town south of Pittsburgh, seniors on fixed incomes are struggling the most with utility bills, said Chardaé Jones, the former mayor of Braddock and a regional organizer for the Pennsylvania Policy Center. “There’s only so far that they can stretch their budget,” she said. “It’s not like they’re using more electricity. They’re just getting charged more.” Braddock is served by Duquesne Light.

When intense storms tore through the Pittsburgh region in April, an example of extreme weather increasing as the climate changes, people in Braddock were left without power for days. Duquesne and other Pennsylvania utilities have increased investment in infrastructure updates, in part to contend with the climate-fueled storms that the state’s natural-gas use contributes to, but data shows little or even no improvement in several indicators of grid reliability.

As climate change fuels more frequent heat waves and extreme weather events, and prices are likely to keep rising, summers in Pennsylvania will be increasingly dangerous.

“I’m worried about seniors. I’m worried about newborns. I’m worried about medically vulnerable households not being able to keep their homes at adequate temperatures in the summer,” said Joline Price at Community Legal Services, a nonprofit that provides legal help to low-income Philadelphia residents. “The only thing we’re going to see with increasing prices is increasing shut-off notices.”

She’s watched the number of Philadelphia households needing help with their utility bills rise for the past five years.

“The assistance that’s available has been going down,” added Price, a divisional supervising attorney specializing in energy. “People are struggling.”

Philadelphia’s aging housing stock, higher levels of poverty, urban heat islands and warmer climate compared to the rest of the state mean that the city is particularly vulnerable. “I’m concerned about not being able to pay for my electric,” said Carol Foy, a Philadelphian who tries to keep her usage down, a difficult task. Her husband needs electricity to power a medical machine for his heart, she said.

Like Gale, she worries about what the future will bring. She’s seen what can happen when someone is unable to get help with their utility bills. “I had a friend that passed away like 10 to 15 years ago, because she didn’t want to turn on her heat. She froze to death because she was scared that she couldn’t afford to pay her electric bill,” Foy said.

Cuts to federal funding that used to be a lifeline for people like Gale and Foy are making a bad situation worse. Earlier this year, the Trump administration laid off the entire staff overseeing the national Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps Americans with heating and cooling costs. The program provided aid to hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians every year, keeping families out of debt and their power and heat turned on.

In Pennsylvania, the funding had also been used to pay for air conditioners for residents, one possible avenue of help for Gale now potentially closed off, though even before staff was cut, need far exceeded supply. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating funding for the energy assistance program entirely, though so far Congress has rejected this proposal.

“There’s no help,” Gale said. “Anytime you try to get help or ask someone or call a government agency, they just tell you to call another one, and then they tell you to call another one.”

The Resource ‘Right in Our Backyard’

Inside Climate News asked the Marcellus Shale Coalition and the companies that own the state’s largest electricity utilities the same question: How do they explain the recent price surge?

Patrick Henderson, vice president of government affairs and communication for the coalition, took issue with using the rates people pay—retail electricity prices—to assess what’s happening because customers’ bills have many costs beyond fuel.

“I’d find the nearest window, open it and throw out comparisons of retail prices,” he said.

He prefers to use figures that separate the regulated portion of the retail price, which mainly includes delivery charges, and the unregulated portion, which includes the electricity supply and is closely tied to the price of gas.

The Public Utility Commission’s rate survey makes it easy to analyze changes to different parts of the bill over time. Looking at the survey from 2006 to 2016, the regulated and unrelated parts of the bill for most Pennsylvania utilities was close to a 50-50 split.

From 2017 to 2022, the ratio shifted to roughly a 55-45 split, regulated charges exceeding the unregulated ones. Delivery charges grew while gas prices were close to flat.

From 2023 to 2025, a substantial growth in the unregulated charges as gas prices rose helped return bills to about a 50-50 split.

But this attempt to summarize the pricing belies some big differences between utilities. For example, Duquesne Light has been an outlier for much of the last decade in having a large share of its overall bill taken up by regulated delivery charges and a small share—as low as 31 percent in 2021—taken up by unregulated charges.

Henderson listed several factors that he thinks should be part of the conversation about rising electricity rates.

First, he points to the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, a state requirement that utilities get a certain percentage of their electricity from solar, wind, hydropower and natural gas captured from coal mines and landfills, along with other qualifying sources. Utilities spent $702 million complying with the law in 2024, which gets passed on to customers. This was equivalent to 3.9 percent of Pennsylvania consumers’ total spending on electricity that year.

Second, he said the 2019 proposal for Pennsylvania to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, has led power plant owners and others in the electricity market to shift their spending in ways that lead to higher costs. So far, the state has not joined the carbon-trading initiative due to legal challenges, and it’s difficult to distinguish between investments companies might have made in anticipation of RGGI membership and decisions that would have happened anyway.

Henderson’s third point is that increases in gas prices in the last few years were tied to global events such as the Ukraine war, and some of the more recent increases reflect rising electricity demand to serve data centers and other large users.

While acknowledging that the price increases have happened, Henderson thinks shale gas producers deserve credit for the years of stable prices.

Prices would “be a hell of a lot higher if they weren’t being mitigated by a cheap, abundant resource right in our backyard,” he added.

Consumer and environmental advocates strongly disagree with Henderson’s points about the alternative energy standard and RGGI. They note that some of these arguments may have currency when talking to elected officials or people affiliated with the oil and gas industry, but they are off base as part of any serious attempt to explain the major factors behind the state’s pricing trends.

How could RGGI be driving price increases when it has not become policy in Pennsylvania? “Utilities are creatures of stability,” said Marx. “They don’t respond to potentials.”

The problem, she said, is that the oil and gas industry is exaggerating the effects of small factors, such as the alternative energy standard, while downplaying huge factors, such as the harm of relying so heavily on one fuel.

“The most recent jump that we have seen post-pandemic is nearly entirely driven by the gas export market,” she said. “I would point to the substantial increase in LNG exports that have Pennsylvanians competing in the world market for gas the way they do for oil.”

Pennsylvania’s utility companies explained rate increases as largely driven by the need to make investments in equipment to improve reliability, along with increases in the market price of gas.

“PECO’s rate trend remained relatively stable for many years, with more noticeable changes beginning in 2021,” said Candice Womer, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia-area utility. “These adjustments reflect the company’s ongoing commitment to strengthening the energy grid, enhancing service reliability, and supporting the region’s transition to cleaner energy.”

Other utilities had similar comments. For example, Matt Neistein, director of communications for Duquesne Light, said recent rate increases are because the company is “investing in the replacement and modernization of our grid infrastructure.”

Todd Meyers, a spokesman for the four FirstEnergy utilities in Pennsylvania, said the company’s customers pay rates comparable to those of other investor-owned utilities in the state. He said any differences can largely be explained by contrasts in population density and topography. “Some have large rural territories while others have a more urban footprint, with each requiring different electrical equipment, infrastructure and staffing levels,” he said.

Some of the people who predicted the current affordability crisis are incredulous about what they see as weak excuses from the companies that have benefited.

“What has happened over the last 20 to 25 years is that these utilities have essentially boiled the frog,” said Patrick Cicero, who was head of the Pennsylvania Office of Consumer Advocate until January. “They’ve had increases over increases over increases.”

He had a reputation for being an aggressive defender of utility consumers’ interests. Now he is working on the legal staff at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, alongside Marx.

The low price of natural gas in the late 2010s, he said, meant that utilities could increase their delivery charges without having much of an effect on overall bills.

Then delivery charges kept going up as gas prices spiked in the last few years.

Cicero doesn’t blame gas companies for trying to increase demand for their product and he doesn’t blame utilities for proposing rate increases. He places most of the blame on the Public Utility Commission for not being skeptical enough of utilities’ spending.

“Utilities are acting in their rational self interest all the time, and it is a shame that our system has not held them more accountable,” he said.

When asked for an explanation for rising rates, the commission said that it only has oversight for part of the electricity bill, and that the process for setting the regulated portion of rates is transparent.

“We do not set or control generation prices,” said Nils Hagen-Frederiksen, the Public Utility Commission’s press secretary, in an email. “Those are based on wholesale market forces and supplier pricing decisions. However, we understand consumer frustration when energy costs rise, regardless of the cause.”

Asked if the Marcellus is a net benefit to electricity ratepayers, he said this:

“The advent of Marcellus Shale production in Pennsylvania, beginning in the late 2000s, contributed to a lengthy period of relatively low and stable energy prices. But market dynamics have changed dramatically over the past several years, leading to increasing and more volatile energy prices.”

Energy Dependence

When Obama gave an important speech on American energy policy in March 2011, the “enormous” potential of natural gas played a starring role. The U.S. needed to reduce its reliance on foreign oil, Obama said, to protect consumers from “being a victim to shifts in the oil market.” Natural gas could help ensure America’s security and prosperity, he said.

Obama’s vision for American energy independence has not come to pass. The rise in natural gas exports is creating the same challenges for consumers that he had hoped to avoid by weaning the country off oil imports.

President Donald Trump wants to accelerate that trend: He has made expanding liquified natural gas exports a priority of his second administration. One of Trump’s first acts in his second term as president was to end a pause on additional export terminal permits that was put in place under President Joe Biden. The Marcellus Shale Coalition has supported Trump’s LNG policy; its then-president said in December that LNG exports “promote jobs” and “deliver energy savings for consumers.”

“The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in May.

Although the Trump administration has said that providing affordable energy for Americans is a priority, the president’s emphasis on increasing LNG exports is likely to have the opposite effect, experts warn.

Pennsylvania could pay as much as $16 billion in additional costs between 2035 and 2050 because of higher natural gas prices if proposed LNG export projects move forward, according to a November report from Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.

“Trump doesn’t seem to realize that the more LNG you export, the higher people’s home energy bills are going to be. The more we export, the more we expose ourselves to these wild swings in the market,” said Alan Zibel, research director at Public Citizen. “The Trump administration has pretty clearly sold out the future of rural communities in Pennsylvania.”

Over the past 20 years, Pennsylvania has locked itself into a future where its fate is tied to the volatilities of the global price of natural gas, and the people paying the highest price are the same ones that fracking companies promised to help.

After months spent trying to find government resources to assist with paying her climbing energy bills, Gale sees community support as the only real option for help, and she encourages people to look out for each other when they can.

But she acknowledged there were limits. She had realized recently that she was not alone in navigating this new, more expensive reality.

From the roaring steam in the steel - rolling workshop to the whispering algorithms in the cleanroom, the factory has always played a pivotal role in connecting technological progress and organizational evolution. It is the origin of management science and the cradle of management ideas.

Before introducing the special topic of the 42nd issue of Management Vision, we will use three articles to review the history of management ideas starting from the factory - Taylor's ""scientific management,"" Ford's ""assembly line,"" and Toyota's ""lean production."" Returning to the factory, we see not only ""how to improve efficiency"" but also understand how people, technology, and systems in an organization shape each other; we question not only ""how to make rules"" but also how to make rules the fertile ground for human nature to play its role.

Ford is transforming its factories.

As the global automotive industry shifts its focus from fuel - powered vehicles to electric vehicles, Ford, a veteran automaker from Detroit, realizes that this is not just a matter of replacing the engine. Electric vehicles require a whole new set of components, especially batteries, which means a new set of specialized production equipment and new production methods.

Managing the supply chains of both fuel - powered and electric vehicles simultaneously is no easy task. From being one of the ""Big Three in Detroit"" to implementing an ""all - electric strategy,"" Ford's transformation has been extremely difficult.

In May 2025, Ford's electric vehicle sales in the US market were only 6,723 units, a 25% decrease compared to the same period last year. Among them, the sales of the F - 150 Lightning plummeted by 42%, and the sales of the E - Transit were even more dismal. As a result, Ford cancelled an expected $12 billion investment in electric vehicles, cut more than 40% of the production plan at its Michigan battery factory, postponed the launch of its large electric pickup truck to 2027, and cancelled the launch plan of an SUV. Competitors like Tesla's strong grasp of battery technology, production processes, and supply chains also put great pressure on Ford.

However, this is not the only challenge Ford faces. Since the 1970s, the global manufacturing landscape has changed. Today's world stage does not shine the spotlight on just a few players. Emerging markets such as India, China, and Southeast Asia have risen rapidly in the past decade and become important driving forces in global manufacturing. Meanwhile, geopolitical factors such as trade frictions, economic decoupling, resource nationalism, technological sovereignty, and regulatory fragmentation are driving the restructuring of the global supply chain. In the vision of Industry 4.0, the way humans and machines collaborate is changing, and the application of AI in manufacturing is changing the roles and skill requirements of workers. Environmental challenges also require enterprises to adopt green technologies, optimize resource use, and improve waste management efficiency.

Ford has no choice but to keep up with the ""frontier"" and start renovating its old factories around the world. For example, the Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Michigan is being renovated to produce electric motors and electric transaxles, paving the way for its electric vehicle strategy. At its famous River Rouge Plant, which was built in the 20th century, Ford also built a new assembly plant dedicated to producing the all - electric version of the F - 150 pickup truck.

The factory transformation brought about by the electric vehicle business inevitably makes us think of the glorious Ford factories a century ago:

In 1904, the Piquette Avenue Plant was completed in Detroit. This was Ford's first self - built factory. It witnessed the birth of the legendary ""Model T"" and also witnessed Ford's early history of continuously conducting efficiency experiments and process optimizations in the factory. In 1909, the Highland Park Plant was completed. Here, Ford made its most famous contribution to industrial production - the Ford system, which gave birth to the world's first application of the automatic assembly line in large - scale industrial production. In 1920, the then - most modern ""super - factory,"" the River Rouge Plant, was built. It carried Ford's attempt at vertical integration in the automotive industry and witnessed the crucial moment of the rise and fall of the Ford system and the US manufacturing industry.

These factories were not only the most cutting - edge experimental bases in the 20th - century automotive industry but also gave rise to the ""mass consumption,"" ""middle class,"" and ""Modern Times"" that emerged around mass production, having a profound impact on production methods, corporate management, and social life forms.

Can Industry 4.0 lead the world to a new ""Ford moment""? What transformation challenges do the advancing factories face? Looking back at the Ford factories a century ago in the context of today's manufacturing industry, revisiting an important slice of 20th - century US manufacturing may provide inspiration for us to understand the evolution of factory management logic and the changes in manufacturing paradigms.

1904: The Piquette Avenue Plant, the Model T, and Edison - style Experiments

Figure 1 The Piquette Avenue Plant of Ford Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan, 1936

In the summer of 1904, when Ford Motor Company was one year old, Henry Ford celebrated his 41st birthday. This year, Ford finally had its first real car factory of its own.

The Piquette Avenue Plant is located in Detroit, Michigan. It has a brick - built structure in the late Victorian style, modeled after the New England textile mills, and is three stories high. There are three fire - proof doors inside the factory, and a 25,000 - gallon water tank on the roof supplies water for the automatic sprinkler system. It is one of the earliest buildings in the US equipped with a fire - fighting system. Ford spent $76,500 on building this new factory. As it turned out, this investment was completely worthwhile. At the Piquette Avenue Plant, Ford assembled seven early - model vehicles and later contributed to the birth of the most famous ""Model T."" Now, it is recognized as one of the most important automotive industrial heritages in the world.

The location of the Piquette Avenue Plant was carefully chosen. Two railway lines intersect nearby, and its neighbors include well - known automobile manufacturers such as Anderson Electric, Brush, and Cadillac. These unique and convenient conditions provided a solid foundation for the Detroit automotive industry, and Ford naturally benefited from them. After the factory was completed, Henry Ford, his wife Clara, and his son Edsel rented a duplex apartment a few blocks away from the factory. Ford usually walked or rode a bicycle to the factory, and his office was on the second floor.

However, visitors rarely saw Ford in his office. The Piquette Avenue Plant was producing several models simultaneously, including the Model B, Model C, Model F, Model N, Model R, Model S, and Model K. Ford was constantly arguing with the company's directors about one question: which model should Ford focus on producing?

In the early 20th century, cars were still regarded as toys for the rich, and most people wondered what use an ordinary family could have for a car. Therefore, some members of the board of directors were inclined to manufacture luxury cars for the rich to achieve higher profit margins. Ford, on the contrary, advocated producing simpler and cheaper cars - not just for the rich but for everyone. Although the profit per car would be lower, it might effectively expand the market.

In the first few years, the directors who believed that only the rich would buy cars won. In April 1906, Ford Motor Company launched a large and expensive car - the Model K. For some time, Ford had to focus on the design of the Model K, but he did not give up his vision. Soon, Ford bought out Alexander Malcomson's shares in the ""large - car camp"" and officially became the president of Ford Motor Company. Later, he designed and launched a new four - cylinder car - the Model N, which was almost exactly what Ford wanted.

By the end of 1906, Ford had sold 2,194 Model N cars to dealers across the United States. It undoubtedly became Ford's best - selling ""hit"" that year. But the experiments continued. There was still a long way to go before Ford's ideas were truly realized.

As different models were launched and production methods were improved, the existing space in the Piquette Avenue Plant was no longer sufficient. Charles Emil Sorensen, the head of the assembly department, oversaw the construction of an annex on the west side of the factory to meet the increasing work demand.

In January 1907, Ford ordered the establishment of a ""secret laboratory"" in the back corner of the third floor of the factory. There was a drawing room on one side of the laboratory, and on the other side, there were several machine tools, a blackboard, and Ford's mother's old rocking chair. Ford carefully assembled a research and development team and focused on developing new ideas in this ""secret laboratory."" Except for Ford, who was 44 years old in 1907, almost all the key members of the laboratory's R & D team were in their twenties. They conducted the initial tests of the new car prototype on the Model N chassis and redesigned the blueprints over and over again.

It wasn't until the spring of 1908 that Ford led the workers to build several complete new cars for testing. They were light, inexpensive, easy to drive and maintain, performed well on rough roads, and could accommodate five people. This was the Model T that fully met Ford's expectations.

Figure 2 A touring version of Ford's ""Model T,"" 1908

Ford personally took the Model T for a test drive. He drove the test car on a trip to northern Wisconsin and Michigan, climbed the stairs of the Tennessee State Capitol, and reached the peak of Pikes Peak. People were amazed by this inexpensive car that could perform all kinds of stunts. After passing the final test, the first Model T was completed on September 27, 1908, and was delivered to the first customer on October 1st.

At first, the production volume of the Model T was very small. Only 11 cars were produced in October. But by December, the monthly production volume had risen to 200. Soon, every available inch of space in the factory was dedicated to the production of this popular product. The engines and axles were assembled on the first floor, and light - processing work was done on the second floor. According to Ford's statistics, the first batch of Model T cars produced at the Piquette Avenue Plant totaled 12,000 units.

The Model T did bring an innovation of ""ease of driving"" to drivers. It placed the steering wheel on the left side, making it convenient for passengers to get in and out of the car. Its flexible gearbox allowed drivers to shift gears easily. It was the first model to cast the engine block and crankcase as one piece, the first to use removable cylinder heads for easy maintenance, and the first to widely use the light and strong vanadium - steel alloy. Early Model T cars also came with a tool kit for the driver, and car owners could optionally choose to install a windshield.

Figure 3 A 1911 - model Model T driving up the steps of the YMCA

In his memoir My Life and Work, published in 1922, Ford elaborated on his vision for the Model T: ""I will build a car for the great multitude. It will be large enough for the family, yet small enough for the individual to run and care for. It will be constructed of the best materials, by the best men to be hired, after the simplest designs that modern engineering can devise. It will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one..."" Ford firmly believed in his concept. So, one morning in 1909, Ford announced to the entire factory that from then on, they would only produce one model, the Model T.

Regarding the Model T, Ford had a famous quote: ""Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black."" This is a direct proof of the innovation of the Model T. Cars gradually changed from being specific toys for the rich to standard products with a unified image, performance, and general operation modules. However, this design to improve production efficiency did not mean that all Model T cars had to be black. Before 1914 and after 1925, people could buy Model T cars in various colors, such as blue, red, gray, and green. By the early 1920s, more than half of the registered cars in the world were Fords, and the sales volume of the Model T exceeded 15,000,000 units. The success of the Model T truly brought the ""Ford concept"" into the US automotive industry.

Ford recalled that when the company was first established, the rented factory area was only 0.28 acres, and it employed only 311 people in the first year, manufacturing 1,708 cars. But four years after moving to the Piquette Avenue Plant, in 1908 when the Model T was officially born, the area of the Ford factory increased to 2.65 acres, the number of employees reached 1,908, and 6,181 cars were manufactured. The Piquette Avenue Plant became an important base for Ford's early production and innovation. It witnessed the birth of several legendary car models and the rise of the company, and at the same time, practiced the initial ""Ford concept.""

The purpose of the ""Ford concept"" is to reduce prices, increase production volume, and improve product quality. Among them, ""reducing prices"" is always given top priority. However, it is obvious that price reduction cannot be achieved easily. Ford invested a large number of experiments in every possible production process that could be ""better and cheaper.""

Actually, when Ford first started trying to build cars, he had been focusing on experiments to reduce the weight of the car. He believed that ""excessive weight would damage any self - propelled vehicle."" Reducing weight and eliminating unnecessary parts was Ford's consistent logic in his work. In 1905, at a racing event in Palm Beach, Ford accidentally picked up a valve stem from a scrapped French car and found that it was both light and tough. Ford knew that this was the key material he had been looking for to make the car lighter - vanadium steel.

Ford began to find someone to try to produce vanadium steel. The first batch failed, but the second batch was successful. Ford was overjoyed and immediately disassembled the existing car models to check the condition of each part and decide which type of steel was the most suitable. Ford believed that for the first time in the history of machine production, they scientifically determined the exact quality of steel. In this material optimization initiative, the strength and lightness of vanadium steel helped Ford cars shed a lot of weight. This is just one example of the numerous experiments Ford conducted on the way to his vision of a universal car.

""There must be a better way."" Ford promoted this ""foolish - charge"" experimental spirit throughout the entire factory. When someone told them that there was only one way to cast a certain part, Ford decided to try other methods. The first attempt always failed, but Ford and the workers ignored the failures. When an ""expert"" told them that there was no need to make changes, Ford asked this ""expert"" to leave the factory and decided to continue the experiments and overcome the failures. To some extent, this factory experimental spirit is an important foundation of the Ford concept and the premise for Ford to gradually reduce production costs and product prices and ultimately lead the transformation of the automotive industry.

Community energy: a missing lever Community energy refers to models where communities take a direct role in generation, storage, or energy sharing.
For community energy to become more than niche, Australia needs to take a more active and supportive stance.
The question now is how to make community energy a core enabler of the transition, not an afterthought.
But without the right frameworks, finance, and capacity, community energy in Australia could remain small scale and fragmented.","A moment of ambition and risk

The Australian Government has announced a new target to cut emissions by 62–70% below 2005 levels by 2035. Achieving this goal will depend heavily on the energy sector, which is expected to carry the lion’s share of the effort. Renewables already supply more than a third of Australia’s electricity, but the pace of rollout is falling short of what’s needed to stay on track for future targets.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has warned that transmission build-out is lagging; industry reporting confirms a sharp fall in large-scale renewable approvals since 2018. Connection queues are growing, and communities across the country have pushed back against new wind, solar and high-voltage transmission lines.

The social licence problem

Arguably, Australia’s renewables build out is being slowed not by technology, but by trust. Some research shows that most Australians support renewables in principle, but when projects land in people’s backyard, opposition can be significant. The Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner (AEIC) in their “Community Engagement” report observes that poor or absent engagement correlates with stronger local opposition, delays, and even legal challenges.

In Planning to engage the community on renewables: insights from community engagement plans of the Australian wind industry (Lansbury et al., 2020), an analysis of 32 wind farm engagement plans found increasing use of benefit-sharing practices, but also wide variation in how meaningful engagement is, and a gap between intention and actual practice.

NSW has established community funds for Renewable Energy Zones (REZs), and Victoria is proposing compensation for landholders near new lines. These are important steps, but some detail is still lacking, and more could be done to drive faster or more widespread uptake. Social licence shouldn’t be considered a secondary issue, it has become one of the most important determinants of whether Australia can build the infrastructure to meet its climate goals on time.

Community energy: a missing lever

Community energy refers to models where communities take a direct role in generation, storage, or energy sharing. This can take different forms, some include:

Shared ownership: local residents or councils hold equity stakes in projects.

Benefit-sharing: dedicated community funds, local bill reductions, or infrastructure upgrades.

Participatory governance: communities co-design siting, design, and revenue distribution.

Energy sharing: neighbours pooling solar, or accessing shared “solar gardens” or batteries.

In principle, these approaches can help align national ambition with local acceptance. They turn communities from passive consultees into active partners. Yet in Australia, such models appear relatively rare or small-scale (some exceptions include Hepburn Wind, Indigo Power, and the Haystacks Solar Garden).

What might be blocking community energy in Australia

Our research suggests that some of the barriers to greater uptake include:

No consistent enabling framework: Unlike the EU (which defines Renewable Energy Communities in law), Australia has no clear national policy framework giving communities rights to participate, share energy, or access markets on fair terms.

Uncertain financial pathways: Community projects cannot access dedicated development grants, low-cost loans, or tax reliefs. Scotland’s CARES program offers structured support, while Australian groups may not benefit from the same type of structured and long-term support.

Complex governance and legal structuring: Community groups often lack the legal templates, governance guidance, and risk-allocation models needed to negotiate shared ownership with developers - every deal is bespoke, adding cost and delay.

Voluntary, not mandatory, benefit-sharing: Current practice is guided in part by the Clean Energy Council’s Best Practice Charter, but there is no baseline requirement for developers to offer equity or revenue-sharing. By contrast, Denmark mandates a 20% local ownership offer for new wind farms.

Capacity and skills gaps in communities: Many local groups lack the technical, financial, and legal capacity to engage on equal terms with developers. Compressed consultation windows exacerbate the imbalance.

Retail and market design barriers: Community solar gardens, batteries, and peer-to-peer energy sharing face complex retail and tariff rules. Each project must negotiate bespoke retail contracts, undermining scalability.

Limited recognition in planning and approvals: Approvals frameworks don’t distinguish between developer-led and community-inclusive projects. There are no streamlined pathways or scoring uplifts for proposals embedding community ownership or benefit funds - so the system offers no incentive to go beyond the minimum.

Lessons from abroad

International practice shows these barriers can be overcome:

Finance frameworks: Scotland’s Community and Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES), tax-relief schemes, and dedicated community benefit/share-ownership policies (e.g. UK Govt working paper Community benefits and shared ownership for low carbon infrastructure) offer examples.

Legal rights: EU law (via RED II and IEMD) requires legal status for energy communities and rights including energy sharing, equal market access and governance structures.

Mandatory/local ownership: Denmark has required developers to offer at least 20% ownership to local residents in new wind projects under its Renewable Energy Act 2008. Germany also saw wide co-operative ownership thanks to feed-in tariffs and favourable rules.

Capacity support: At EU level the Citizen Energy Advisory Hub (CEAH) will provide one-stop support with technical, financial, and governance advice. The Citizen-led Renovation (CLR) initiative (concluding in 2025) has strengthened citizen participation in building renovation and energy efficiency, while the new LIFE EnerCOM project (launched in September 2024) is expanding support for innovative community energy models. Without support for communities to engage (technical, financial, governance capacity), sharing offers or mandates are less likely to succeed. As an example, Ricardo led the Rural Energy Community Advisory Hub (RECAH) to help rural communities develop renewable energy projects, complementing wider EU initiatives like CEAH, CLR and LIFE EnerCOM.

Connection & planning reforms: EU/UK jurisdictions have simplified permitting/licensing for community energy groups; reduced regulatory burdens; and implemented priority grid access in some cases for small/community-led generation.

A call to action

The Australian Government’s new Net Zero Plan and sector strategies set out five national priorities: decarbonising the electricity system, electrifying wherever possible, switching to low-carbon fuels, driving innovation, and expanding carbon removals. Community energy is not explicitly named in these documents, yet it directly supports several of these pillars. By embedding shared ownership, participatory governance and local benefit-sharing into renewable projects, community energy can accelerate renewables deployment, build social licence for transmission, and make household and community-level electrification more affordable and inclusive.

For community energy to become more than niche, Australia needs to take a more active and supportive stance. Possible policy support and reform could include:

A national enabling framework defining Renewable Energy Communities in law

A finance stack: grants, loans, and tax relief to de-risk community equity

Mandatory benefit-sharing baselines for renewables and transmission

Priority connection and streamlined planning for projects with verified community participation

Dedicated capacity-building for communities and First Nations partners

Scaling REZ community funds into a standard national model

Australia’s climate targets and REZ rollout create the right conditions. The question now is how to make community energy a core enabler of the transition, not an afterthought.

International evidence shows it can accelerate deployment, reduce resistance, and strengthen social licence. But without the right frameworks, finance, and capacity, community energy in Australia could remain small scale and fragmented. With them, it can become a cornerstone of delivering on Australia’s 2035 and 2050 goals.

Ricardo’s work leading major initiatives on community energy and citizen-led energy renovation has shown how to embed participation into national systems through policy advice, advisory hubs, financial innovation, and citizen engagement. This experience demonstrates how structured frameworks and inclusive models can accelerate renewable uptake while building fairness and trust - lessons directly relevant to Australia’s transition.",https://www.ricardo.com/media/siln1sru/aerial-drone-view-of-the-hybrid-gullen-solar-farm-and-gullen-range-wind-farm-for-renewable-clean-energy-supply-located-at-bannister-in-the-upper-lachlan-shire-nsw-australia.jpg?width=1200&height=630&v=1dc2c23922d6bc0,N,,2025-09-23 08:00:14.968970

What’s more, some new or fully redesigned vehicles may not have yet been put through their paces.
Cut-rate financing deals are typically reserved only for those having stellar credit ratings.","Electric vehicle sales surged to a record 146,332 units in August as buyers flocked to dealerships to take advantage of the one-time $7,500 federal tax credit (which can also be taken at the point of sale like a rebate) before it expires on September 30.

While only a relative handful of EVs that meet certain requirements for domestic production and price limits qualify for the incentive, many automakers have managed to exploit a loophole in the tax credit legislation that passes all or part of the $7,500 to those leasing an EV that otherwise doesn’t qualify for the credit. And automakers are also pumping up sales by offering some unbeatable cash rebates and cut-rate financing deals that could likewise go away on October 1.

But as with any vehicular acquisition, making the switch from gas to battery power should not be made on a whim. In addition to considering an EV’s sticker price, energy consumption, operating range on a charge and the aforementioned incentives, shoppers should also consider a given EV’s safety ratings.

To that end, 11 current models passed all of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s (IIHS) rigorous evaluations and were designated Top Safety Picks (TSP), with all but one earning the tougher Top Safety Pick+ (TSP+) award.

To earn top marks in the IIHS’ rigorous ratings system, a given model must excel in in all of its crashworthiness tests, including front and side-impact crash tests, and both driver- and passenger-side offset frontal crash tests that replicate an offset collision between two vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

Award recipients must also include highly-rated forward emergency automatic braking systems that can help avoid collisions with both other vehicles and pedestrians in both daytime and nighttime driving. What’s more, top-ranked vehicles must offer headlight systems that are deemed as being “Acceptable” or “Good” as standard equipment.

The IIHS gives models that receive Good marks in most of the above criteria its “Top Safety Pick” designation, but with a second-best Acceptable mark for the recently upgraded side-impact test. Those that also ace the latter test get the organization’s “Top Safety Pick+” honors.

On the down side, the IIHS tends to concentrates its testing efforts on the industry’s best-selling vehicles, which often leaves out big-ticket luxury models. What’s more, some new or fully redesigned vehicles may not have yet been put through their paces.

To help safety-minded EV shoppers we’ve compiled the below list of the IIHS’ top-rated battery-powered models along with the special offers on each that can save last-minute buyers a bundle through the end of September.

The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.","After much anticipation and several months of evaluation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has decided to keep the landmark Biden-era rule extending Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) liability to certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—otherwise known as “forever chemicals.” This announcement comes amid an industry lawsuit challenging the rule, which has been stayed for months while the Trump Administration’s EPA reconsidered whether it wanted to continue defending the designation.

What are the relevant PFAS?

PFAS are synthetic chemicals used in many products and materials by a broad range of industries—from cosmetics to textiles—because they resist heat, water, and oil. Given their widespread use, these chemicals are relatively ubiquitous at low levels and have been detected in soil, sediments, groundwater, and surface water at many sites. The EPA rule at issue focuses on two PFAS specifically, PFOA and PFOS, given their widespread use and prevalence in the environment.

What does the rule do?

The EPA’s April 2024 rule designates PFOA and PFOS as “hazardous substances” under CERCLA. The rule establishes substantial reporting requirements for PFOA and PFOS releases, allows the EPA to initiate response actions without showing imminent and substantial endangerment, and perhaps most importantly, allows parties to pursue reimbursement or contribution claims for cleanups of these two substances. CERCLA’s strict, joint and several, and retroactive liability regime is particularly concerning in the context of chemicals like PFOA and PFOS that are ubiquitous in the environment and resistant to degradation.

More details on the rule’s specific requirements can be found in analysis from the Alston & Bird team here and here.

What’s the rule’s current status?

After the rule went into effect in July 2024, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and industry groups petitioned for review by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing in part that the agency had wrongly applied CERCLA and did not adequately assess the costs and benefits extending Superfund liability to PFAS contamination. With the Trump Administration’s arrival, the EPA moved for a stay in February 2025, and the case has been paused since then while the agency decided whether to continue defending the rule.

In its September 17 motion this week, the EPA asked the court to lift the stay. Attached to the motion was a declaration from a senior adviser to the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management stating that the agency will continue to “engage with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.” This goal of protecting so-called “passive receivers” raises significant questions, including the criteria for determining which entities qualify, the scope of protections provided, and the potential of unintended consequences on enforcement actions and cost allocations at sites where these entities are involved. The EPA has indicated that Congress will have to adopt new statutory language to address concerns with passive receiver liability.

The decision to retain the PFAS Superfund rule contrasts with other Trump Administration actions to relax PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act and push back compliance deadlines under similar legislation.

Next Steps

As litigation against the rule proceeds, companies and stakeholders should follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels, where prominent leaders in both branches have supported measures to keep the rule but excuse so-called “passive receivers” from liability. For now, companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams, be mindful of potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions, and stay informed on potential liability that may arise from real property investments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15546_5043.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 23:59:12.548638

Revolution Wind is being developed as part of a joint-partnership between the Danish energy company Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, a division of Global Infrastructure Partners.
Both developers sued the Trump administration earlier this month in an effort to lift the stop-work order, which officials said was costing the project up to $2.3 million per day.
“The Trump Administration should see the writing on the wall with this decision and drop its defense of their indefensible actions,” Tong said.
Kathy Hochul agreed to relent on her state’s opposition to several gas pipeline projects in exchange for the Trump administration allowing the wind project to continue.","This story has been updated.

Work on the nearly-completed Revolution Wind project was allowed to resume on Monday, after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration had failed to justify its sudden decision last month to halt all offshore construction on the $6 billion project.

In particular, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said that the government has yet to provide any new information to back up its claims that the project — which is more than 80% completed — poses a severe risk to national security.

Any potential impacts on national security were already reviewed as part of the project’s years-long permitting process, Lamberth said. Without any apparent basis with which to reverse its prior approvals, he said the government’s stop-work order represented “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”

“If Revolution Wind cannot meet its deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse,” said Lamberth, who was appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by President Ronald Reagan.

“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm,” he added.

The Trump administration did not immediately say whether it plans to appeal the ruling. In a statement Monday, Department of the Interior spokeswoman Elizabeth Peace said the agency will continue to investigate any potential national security and other concerns as work resumes on the project.

“The Department of the Interior remains committed to ensuring that prior decisions are legally and factually sound,” Peace said.

Revolution Wind is being developed as part of a joint-partnership between the Danish energy company Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, a division of Global Infrastructure Partners. Both developers sued the Trump administration earlier this month in an effort to lift the stop-work order, which officials said was costing the project up to $2.3 million per day.

Much of the work on Revolution Wind is taking place at the State Pier in New London, where workers are tasked with preparing pieces of the massive turbine shafts and propeller blades to be loaded onto specialized ships and carried out to the assembly area off the coast of Block Island.

Once completed, the project is expected to supply 704 megawatts of carbon-free power to the New England electric grid supported by power-purchase agreements with utilities in Connecticut and Rhode Island.

In a statement after the judge agreed to the developers’ request for a preliminary injunction, Revolution Wind spokeswoman Meaghan Wims said that work on the project will resume “as soon as possible.”

“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” of the underlying lawsuit, she said.

In addition to the lawsuit brought by the developers, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island jointly sued the Trump administration over its decision to issue halt work on Revolution Wind. While that case remains pending in federal court in Providence, Tong issued a statement on Monday calling Lamberth’s ruling a “major win” for the the state.

“The Trump Administration should see the writing on the wall with this decision and drop its defense of their indefensible actions,” Tong said. “Every day that this project is stymied is a day of lost employment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when American-made clean energy is within reach.”

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement Monday, “The court’s decision restores momentum toward bringing clean, local power to New England, strengthening our energy security, and supporting thousands of jobs across the region. We applaud the court for upholding the rule of law and rejecting a reckless attempt to sabotage clean energy progress that will slash bills and toxic pollution.”

Lamberth’s ruling came at the start of a critical week for the project that has been stalled since Aug. 23.

In an affidavit filed with the federal court in Washington D.C. earlier this month, Ørsted’s senior engineering, procurement, and construction director Paul Murphy said the developers have a tight window this year to make use of several specialized transportation and installation ships contracted to work on the project. Once those ships depart to work on other scheduled projects, he said, it could be years before they are available to return.

In addition, offshore weather conditions during the winter pose a “significant risk” to workers, making further delays more likely.

If work on the project does not resume by the end of September, Murphy said that Revolution Wind risked missing its deadline to begin supplying power by the end of 2026. That could result in the developers having to forgo “billions of dollars” of revenue through power-purchase agreements, and may force them to cancel the project altogether.

“Revolution Wind currently has no mechanism for extending those deadlines, and the [power-purchase agreements] would be subject to termination, significantly threatening the financial viability of the entire Project and posing an existential risk to the Project, and thus to Revolution Wind,” he said

Officials in Connecticut were quick to praise Monday’s ruling, with many noting the number of jobs tied to the project along with projections of lower electric costs once Revolution Wind begins producing power.

“The Trump Administration offered no credible facts — not a shred of evidence — to support a continued stop work order that deprives thousands of workers of jobs and Connecticut consumers of more affordable energy,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement. “None of the government’s trumped-up arguments have factual or legal weight. While I am pleased with today’s ruling, construction should be permanently permitted to go forward, and workers should be allowed back to the site. The Trump Administration’s irresponsible pandering to the fossil fuel industry cannot be permitted to persist in wasting taxpayer and consumer dollars.”

After the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued its stop-work order in August, Gov. Ned Lamont said he reached out to officials within the Trump administration in an attempt to negotiate a deal that would allow work on the project to resume.

When the federal government halted work on similar wind farm under development in Brooklyn this spring, Lamont noted, it was widely reported that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to relent on her state’s opposition to several gas pipeline projects in exchange for the Trump administration allowing the wind project to continue. (Hochul has denied to making such an explicit agreement.)

In his efforts to get a deal, however, Lamont said he was repeatedly met with silence from federal officials.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, Lamont expressed satisfaction with the judge’s decision to issue an injunction.

“I haven’t had a chance to follow up with Ørsted yet to see what the timing is, but it’s good news on behalf of the consumers and bringing down the price of electricity and honoring a contract with Ørsted that goes back to the first Trump administration,” Lamont said.

Renewable energy can unlock opportunities and change lives

Aid budgets are under pressure and every concessional dollar must stretch further. Meanwhile, climate change is advancing and global instability looms.

As leaders gather in New York for the UN General Assembly and Climate Week, these crises demand an answer to the hard question of how and where limited capital can work to deliver the greatest growth and global resilience.

The answer is renewable energy.

Access to electricity is the foundation of modern prosperity. No country has achieved broad economic development without it.

Electricity drives education, industry and public health. It powers irrigation pumps for farmers, refrigeration for vaccines, and digital tools for entrepreneurs.

Yet, nearly 700mn people still live without electricity. Billions live with access that is unaffordable or unreliable. At the same time, climate change is worsening risks such as flooding and drought that often hit energy-poor communities hardest.

Without decisive action and co-ordinated efforts, climate change will accelerate, entire countries will be locked out of the energy-enabled economy, and global instability will intensify.

But there is a path forward. Clean electricity can unlock opportunity and change lives.

I have met farmers in Kenya irrigating crops using solar pumps; entrepreneurs in Nigeria expanding their businesses; innovators in India pioneering new technologies; utilities in Indonesia emboldened to integrate renewables; and world leaders committing to ambitious national energy transition plans.

I have also seen far too many places where a lack of electricity and the means to use it is holding back communities and economies.

A recent report from the International Renewable Energy Agency found that 91 per cent of renewable energy projects are now cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. It predicted pronounced cost declines in Africa, Asia and South America.

Yet, according to the International Energy Agency, only a fifth of global clean energy investment goes to emerging markets and developing economies.

Catalysing private funding

The Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet, which includes organisations from the public, private and philanthropic sectors, released a report on Monday that lays out how governments, businesses, philanthropies and non-profits can work in consort to accelerate clean energy uptake. This growth can create jobs, improve prosperity, manage climate change, and drive lasting, systemic change — even in this constrained funding environment.

The alliance has supported 137 clean energy projects across more than 30 developing economies. But one of the report’s most striking findings is that philanthropic investments of $503mn in catalytic funding have unlocked $7.8bn from private investors and development banks for projects that are either already deployed or ready for deployment.

In a world of shrinking aid budgets, that multiplier is not a luxury, it is essential.

In Nigeria — home to the world’s largest population without electricity access — philanthropic capital is catalysing large-scale public and private investment and building a pipeline of interconnected solar-powered, mini-grid projects that will serve hundreds of thousands of people.

Here, the GEAPP has deployed flexible grant funding and technical support to launch a pilot project with the non-profit RMI. At the same time, local utilities have worked to prove their commercial viability. And the World Bank, persuaded by the early evidence and improved developer capacity, committed $127mn in concessional finance, with expectations of mobilising substantial additional funding, including $190mn in private capital.

This model of alliances in action shows how even in a constrained environment, we can drive progress at the speed and scale the world demands.

Even with the best intentions, if we work in silos, fail to integrate community level inputs or recognise the technical capacity needs of governments, and assume that infrastructure automatically leads to economic advancement, change will not happen.

Renewable energy access offers a clear path to shared, equitable, sustainable prosperity. It delivers jobs, competitiveness and carbon reductions in a single package. But no single organisation has all the answers.

We are making great strides together and we must all — governments, investors and philanthropies — stay focused on deepening our collaboration.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/ae0cd714-4490-4ea1-aabd-4f1ecaf1e1ed.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 22:58:44.954656

For those who miss the roar of a muscle car, speakers can be used for effect. The sound from the speakers allegedly got Mike, an electric vehicle motorist, in trouble.

Mike and his car club friends were in downtown Stillwater earlier this year, on their way back home to the cities.

""We were thinking about stopping to get a bite to eat at one of the various pizza places in town,"" Mike said.

A group of six cars stopped at the traffic light right across from a gas station. The light turned green.

""Here I am, at the back of the line. I make my way to the front. The light turns red. I stop,"" Mike said.

A Minnesota State Patrol trooper, driving in the opposite direction, was also stopped at the light.

""The State Trooper looks at me. I look at him. As he drives by, we make eye contact. He continues, flips, pulls me over,"" Mike said.

The car he was driving was a 2025 Dodge Daytona, an electric vehicle. It has a fratzonic chambered sound mechanism.

""You can rev it, but you have to be in park to rev it,"" Mike said.

The car is equipped with three modes. The sport mode gives motorists the visceral feeling of an eight-cylinder Muscle car.

""Speakers on the outside and speakers on the rear,"" Mike said.

Mike tried to explain the speakers to the trooper, but he wouldn't listen and issued the citations.

""I didn't want to argue with him, so I said, 'I'll see you in court,'"" he said.

Mike has been waiting for a court date since June. The ticket still isn't in the Washington County court system. In the meantime, a video of the interaction that was posted online has gone viral.

""We didn't really expect it to blow up overnight. I was heading out to Chicago the very next day ... and, like, my phone is blowing up,"" he said. ""I would hope the trooper realized his mistake and didn't submit or write up the ticket.""

Without the tax incentive to encourage EV purchases, the electric vehicle industry obviously will take hit.

So will auto buyers who insist on sticking with more environmentally friendly private transportation.

And if past purchases and EV tax credit claims are an indicator, drivers in two staunchly red states will feel the loss of the tax break.

EVs popular in populous states: California, not surprisingly, has the most registered electric vehicles by a large margin. The latest U.S. Department of Energy data shows 1,256,646 EVs on the official rolls.

The Golden State has long been the leader on environmental matters. It’s hefty gasoline tax also no doubt convinces a lot of drivers to switch to alternative fuel autos.

But two other states with Trump administration supporting leadership and overall voting populations that lean conservative come in second and third.

Florida had 254,878 EVs, with Texas accounting for 230,125.

And recent research by the online lending marketplace LendingTree found that drivers in these three states will lose the most from the end of the EV tax credit.

Almost $4 billion claimed in EV credits: EV inclined drivers in those three states obviously will face difficult decisions about whether to buy without a tax break.

Overall, after analyzing Internal Revenue Service data on individual income tax returns filed and Clean Vehicle Credits claimed, LendingTree found that in tax year 2023, Americans filed 487,990 returns claiming the EV tax credit. Those claims totaled $3.3 billion.

Another 28,180 returns included claims for the pre-owned EV credit. Those used car credits totaled $95.6 million.

The maximum possible EV tax credit for a new vehicle is $7,500. The average credit claimed on the returns LendingTree examined was $6,709. For used EVs, which could get a possible $4,000 maximum tax break, the average credit claimed was $3,392.

Potential costs for CA, TX, and FL drivers: California would be hardest hit by the expiration of the new EV tax credit, as it leads in total claims and national share.

Californians submitted 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit in tax year 2023, or 32.2 percent of the tax break claims, according to the LendingTree findings. California also led in used EV tax credit claims, accounting for 23.2 percent of the overall filings for the pre-owned auto tax benefit.

Over a year, Californians could miss out on an estimated $1.1 billion in EV tax credits when the federal incentive ends, according to the study. That includes credits for new and used electric vehicles.

Texans filed 38,870 EV tax credit claims. That produced $272.7 million in savings for those drivers.

Florida claims came to 30,090. Those filings accounted for $201.4 million in tax savings on EV purchases.

Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst, says those credits are big, especially when you consider how expensive vehicles are today.

“That these credits could often be taken at the point of sale makes them even more significant,” says Schulz. “It’s one thing to have to wait until the following spring to get a rebate with your tax refund. It’s something else to be able to knock thousands of dollars off the price of a vehicle from the start. I have no doubt that those credits inspired people who may not otherwise have considered an electric vehicle to at least think about them.”

From Fears to Discoveries The journey of the electric vehicle through the consumer’s eyes is a story of transformation.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer confined to prototypes or niche markets. They are entering mainstream conversations across industries, governments, and households. Yet, the real story of adoption cannot be understood solely through statistics on sales or production. At the heart of the transition lies the consumer: the individual who weighs risks and rewards, who is both skeptical and curious, and whose decisions ultimately determine the pace at which electromobility reshapes global transportation.

This article explores the electric vehicle through the consumer’s eyes, delving into their fears, expectations, and discoveries. By understanding these dimensions, we can better assess the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for policymakers, manufacturers, and infrastructure providers.

1. Fears: The Psychological and Practical Barriers to EV Adoption

Although EV adoption is accelerating worldwide, surveys consistently reveal that consumers harbor significant concerns that slow down decision-making. These fears are not irrational; rather, they reflect real gaps between the promises of technology and the realities of infrastructure, affordability, and information.

1.1 Range anxiety

The most cited concern is “range anxiety” — the fear of running out of battery power before reaching a charging station. For decades, drivers have been conditioned by the ubiquity of gasoline stations, where refueling takes minutes and locations are predictable. In contrast, charging infrastructure is still unevenly distributed, especially outside urban centers.

Even though modern EVs often offer ranges exceeding 400km per charge, perception lags behind reality. For consumers, it is not only about the maximum advertised range but also about how that range varies with driving style, weather conditions, and the use of auxiliary systems such as heating or air conditioning.

1.2 Charging time and convenience

Another obstacle lies in charging time. Fast-charging technology has improved significantly, reducing charging sessions to 20–30 minutes for an 80% charge in many models. Yet, consumers still compare this to the five minutes needed at a gas pump. The idea of waiting — even with amenities at charging hubs — remains a barrier, especially for drivers who rely on their vehicles for long commutes or professional use.

1.3 Battery degradation and replacement costs

Consumers often express uncertainty about the durability of EV batteries. Will the performance of the battery decline significantly after a few years? How much will replacement cost, and will warranties cover it? Despite evidence that most EV batteries retain the majority of their capacity after eight years or more, the perception of rapid degradation remains strong, fueled by early-generation EVs and anecdotes.

1.4 Purchase price and affordability

Price is perhaps the most tangible concern. Even though total cost of ownership (TCO) often favors EVs due to lower fuel and maintenance costs, the upfront purchase price is typically higher than comparable internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. For middle-income consumers, this remains a decisive factor, especially in markets with limited government incentives.

1.5 Resale value and technological obsolescence

Rapid technological advances create an additional layer of uncertainty. Potential buyers worry that their EV may lose value quickly as newer models enter the market with longer ranges, better software, and faster charging. This fear of obsolescence mirrors consumer behavior in the smartphone industry, where yearly upgrades shift perceptions of value.

2. Expectations: The Consumer’s Vision of EVs

While fears are powerful, they coexist with a set of expectations that motivate interest and exploration. Consumers view EVs not only as vehicles but as symbols of a broader shift in technology, lifestyle, and environmental responsibility.

2.1 Environmental responsibility and sustainability

For many, EVs represent a tangible way to reduce personal carbon footprints. Consumers increasingly expect that their purchasing choices should reflect their values, and sustainability is central to that equation. Surveys show that younger generations, in particular, associate EV ownership with climate action and social responsibility.

2.2 Affordability through incentives and innovation

Consumers expect that governments and manufacturers will work together to make EVs more affordable. Subsidies, tax breaks, reduced registration fees, and free access to urban toll zones are all incentives that shape expectations. At the same time, many consumers anticipate that technological progress will naturally reduce costs, much like the declining price trajectory of smartphones and solar panels.

2.3 Convenience and infrastructure parity

The ideal consumer expectation is parity with ICE vehicles in terms of convenience. That means charging stations should be as abundant and reliable as gas stations, and charging times should continue to decrease. Home charging is often viewed as a potential game-changer, offering unmatched convenience for those with access to private parking.

2.4 Innovation and digital integration

Consumers expect EVs to be more than just cars with batteries. They envision vehicles integrated into digital ecosystems: smart navigation that optimizes charging stops, over-the-air software updates, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and seamless connectivity with smartphones and smart homes. In many ways, EVs are perceived as “computers on wheels,” and consumers expect a level of innovation that justifies the transition.

2.5 Status and lifestyle

In certain markets, EVs are associated with status and modernity. Just as early adopters of smartphones were seen as forward-thinking, EV owners often view their choice as a statement about being aligned with innovation, sustainability, and the future of mobility.

3. Discoveries: When Perception Meets Reality

The most transformative part of the consumer journey occurs when individuals move from abstract concerns to firsthand experiences. Test drives, ownership, and peer influence all play critical roles in reshaping attitudes.

3.1 The driving experience

One of the most surprising discoveries for new EV drivers is the quality of the driving experience. Instant torque provides rapid acceleration, while the absence of engine noise creates a smoother, quieter ride. For many, these features turn EV driving into a revelation.

3.2 Range anxiety diminishes with experience

Surveys reveal that actual EV owners report significantly lower levels of range anxiety than those who have never driven one. Daily commutes are often well within the range of most EVs, and home charging eliminates the need for frequent public charging. This discovery helps normalize EV use and gradually reduces fears.

3.3 Financial benefits over time

Consumers who track their expenses often discover substantial savings in fuel and maintenance. EVs have fewer moving parts, no oil changes, and reduced wear on brakes thanks to regenerative braking. Over the vehicle’s lifetime, these savings can offset the higher initial cost, reinforcing the economic case for adoption.

3.4 Lifestyle integration

Discoveries extend beyond economics and performance. Many owners integrate EVs into broader lifestyle choices, such as pairing home solar panels with EV charging or participating in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) programs. These experiences deepen the sense of being part of a sustainable, technology-driven movement.

3.5 Community and identity

EV ownership often fosters a sense of belonging to a community of early adopters and innovators. Online forums, local clubs, and shared charging experiences create social value that goes beyond the utility of transportation.

4. Regional Perspectives on Consumer Adoption

4.1 Europe: Incentives and urban restrictions

European consumers often face strong policy-driven incentives. In cities like Oslo, EVs benefit from free tolls, parking privileges, and access to bus lanes. These measures not only reduce fears but also align with expectations of convenience and cost savings. Discoveries in Europe often revolve around the seamless integration of EVs into daily urban life.

4.2 North America: Lifestyle and infrastructure gaps

In the United States and Canada, consumer adoption varies by region. While California leads with incentives and infrastructure, other states lag behind. Consumers often fear limited charging availability during road trips but discover the benefits of home charging for daily use. Lifestyle and status also play a role, with Tesla serving as a cultural symbol of innovation.

4.3 Asia: Affordability and mass adoption

China demonstrates how large-scale infrastructure investment and aggressive government policies can reshape consumer perceptions. Fears are mitigated by widespread charging networks, while expectations are fulfilled by affordable domestic models. Discoveries in China often highlight the practicality of EVs in densely populated cities.

4.4 Latin America: Early adoption challenges

In Latin America, consumers often face high upfront costs and limited infrastructure. Fears about affordability dominate, while expectations center on government support and future infrastructure growth. Discoveries, for now, are concentrated among early adopters who value environmental responsibility and status.

5. The Role of Communication and Education

Bridging the gap between fears and discoveries requires effective communication. Misinformation about battery degradation, exaggerated concerns about charging times, and lack of awareness of incentives can all slow adoption. Transparent data, consumer education campaigns, and hands-on experiences such as test drive events are critical tools for reshaping perceptions.

6. From Fears to Discoveries

The journey of the electric vehicle through the consumer’s eyes is a story of transformation. It begins with fears rooted in uncertainty, evolves through expectations shaped by values and aspirations, and culminates in discoveries that redefine mobility.

Manufacturers, governments, and infrastructure providers must recognize that this journey is not only technological but also emotional. Addressing practical concerns, fulfilling expectations, and facilitating positive discoveries will determine the speed of EV adoption worldwide.

In the end, consumers are not just buying vehicles, they are investing in a vision of the future. The challenge and opportunity lie in ensuring that this vision aligns with their everyday realities.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2024-08/NextGen-Intelligence-img-2024-Raul-Moreno-1-MBN-mfr.jpg?h=33b8bd54&itok=iDrngRax,N,,2025-09-22 22:01:19.311588

That’s in peril unless tech companies and utilities demand more transparency and opt for more renewables like solar and wind energy.
There could also be some double or triple counting (or more) going on when it comes to forecasting AI energy demand because of developers approaching more than one utility to get several quotes.
Despite the uncertainty, they’re still building out new gas power plants and pipelines to meet that demand.
Tech companies clearly have a big role to play, too, by improving the energy efficiency of their technologies and investing in renewables.","Even if AI turns out not to be as much of an energy hog as people are making it out to be, it could still spell out trouble for power grids across the US.

Tech companies are already burning through increasing amounts of electricity to train and run new AI models. And they’re asking for a lot more electricity as they try to outcompete each other. That rising demand is already starting to reshape the energy system, with utilities scrambling to build out new gas plants and pipelines.

But all these plans to reshape the US energy system could be based on an AI bubble. With overexcited investors pumping money into tech companies afraid of missing the bandwagon but still at risk of developing AI tools that ultimately flop, utilities are also faced with a wave of speculation over data centers’ energy needs.

“The uncertainty is unnerving”

The uncertainty is unnerving considering the costs that Americans could wind up paying when it comes to higher utility bills and more pollution, a recent report warns. A transition to cleaner and more affordable energy sources has been making progress slowly in the US. That’s in peril unless tech companies and utilities demand more transparency and opt for more renewables like solar and wind energy.

“While the AI boom provides exciting opportunities, there are many risks to not approaching energy needs with a deliberate and informed response that takes long term impacts into account,” Kelly Poole, lead author of the report published this month by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow and environmental organization Sierra Club, said in a briefing with reporters.

The nation’s fleet of gas-fired power plants would grow by nearly a third if all of the new gas projects proposed between January 2023 and January 2025, as the generative AI industry heated up, come to fruition. The amount of new gas capacity that utilities and independent developers proposed jumped by 70 percent during that time frame, driven in large part by rising data center electricity demand.

Prior to the generative AI boom, electricity demand had pretty much flatlined for more than a decade with energy efficiency gains. But new data centers, souped-up for AI, are a lot more energy-hungry than they have been in the past. A rack of computers in a traditional data center might use 6-8 kilowatts of power — roughly equivalent to the power used by three homes in the US, Dan Thompson, a principal research analyst at S&P Global, explained in the briefing. AI, however, requires more powerful computer chips to run more complicated tasks. The power required to run one of those high-density racks equals about 80 to 100 homes’ worth of power, or upward of 100 kilowatts, according to Thompson.

“Essentially what you’re looking at is a small town’s worth of power being deployed,” he said.

Why does that matter? Power grids basically function as a precarious balancing act. If power supply can’t meet demand growth, it could lead to higher utility bills and potential outages. On the other hand, overbuilding new capacity risks creating stranded assets that utilities and their customers wind up paying for regardless of whether or not they actually need them in the long term. That’s why it’s so important to try to get an accurate forecast of future demand.

“Essentially what you’re looking at is a small town’s worth of power being deployed.”

And while AI does use a lot of energy, projections for the future get murky. “Speculators are flooding the market,” the report says, seeking to build and flip data centers. Trying to get ahead of long wait times to connect to the power grid, some of those speculators are requesting power even before they’ve got the capital or customers lined up to ensure they can bring a project to the finish line. There could also be some double or triple counting (or more) going on when it comes to forecasting AI energy demand because of developers approaching more than one utility to get several quotes.

In the Southeast, a major hub for data centers, utilities are projecting as much as four times more demand growth compared to independent analyses of industry trends, according to a report earlier this year from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). Nationally, utilities are preparing for 50 percent more demand growth than the tech industry is expecting, a separate report from December 2024 states.

Utilities themselves have recognized this risk on recent earnings calls. Proposed projects trying to connect to the grid “may be overstated anywhere from three to five times what might actually materialize,” Jim Burke, CEO of Texas-based Vistra Energy, said in a Q1 earnings call this year.

Despite the uncertainty, they’re still building out new gas power plants and pipelines to meet that demand. After all, building new infrastructure is one of the most lucrative ways for a utility to increase profits. And right now, the Trump administration — whose campaign was buoyed by oil and gas contributions — is incentivizing reliance on fossil fuels. In Louisiana, for example, local utility Entergy proposed building three new gas plants to power a giant new Meta data center. The data center is estimated consume as much electricity as 1.5 million homes and lead to 100 million tons of carbon emissions over 15 years.

It’s a stark contrast from the Biden administration’s goal of getting the power grid to run on 100 percent carbon pollution-free energy by 2035. The only way to stop climate change in its tracks is to get rid of planet-heating pollution from fossil fuels. Building a rush of new gas infrastructure obviously moves the nation in the opposite direction.

There are solutions to minimize all these risks, As You Sow and Sierra Club point out in their report. Utilities can require developers to disclose the number of other utilities they’ve brought their data center proposal to and how far along they are in finalizing a project. When inking contracts, they can also require long-term service agreements, hike-up nonrefundable deposits, and raise fees for canceling a project.

Tech companies clearly have a big role to play, too, by improving the energy efficiency of their technologies and investing in renewables. For years, tech giants including Amazon, Meta, and Google have been top corporate purchasers of renewable energy. Inking those kinds of long-term agreements to build out new solar and wind farms can have even more impact now, counteracting the Trump administration’s rollback of financial incentives for renewables, if companies are willing to prioritize their own sustainability goals as much as their AI ambitions.",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/gettyimages-2190030422.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-09-22 20:02:13.249061

American Antimony Corporation (OTCID:XTPT), operating as Xtra Energy Corporation, is pleased to announce that Chairman & CEO, Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., has completed an on-site visit with the Company's field team at the IHX Zone, part of the flagship American Antimony Project in Nevada's historic Bernice Canyon District.

The visit focused on evaluating surface stockpiles and near-surface mineralized material across the IHX Zone and the adjacent King Solomon and Antimony King targets. During the review, the team identified and initiated further testing of approximately 6,700 tons of mineralized material at the IHX Zone, with the objective of commencing initial commercial sales of antimony ore.

Additional site visits are scheduled, during which the team will conduct inspections and volumetric assessments of the other stockpiles previously identified by the field team. These visits will also provide critical data for the permitting process required to support the timely, staged removal of the additional piles.

On-Site Assessment Highlights

Up to 6,700 Tons Targeted - Includes stockpiles identified during the 2025 drilling program and 2024 sampling campaigns.

Bulk Sampling in Progress - Representative material is being collected at the end of September to ship for mill scale recovery tests under Metallurgical Testing Agreements (MTAs) with a prospective mill partner and buyer.

3rd Party Lab Accredited Assay Results from Stockpiles: -

Antimony King: ~42.9% Sb (429,366 ppm Sb); Au 0.09 g/t; Ag 6.6 g/t; As 148 ppm

King Solomon: ~24.7% Sb (247,431 ppm Sb); Au 0.22 g/t; Ag 23.1 g/t; As 125 ppm

IHX: ~2.5% Sb (24,915 ppm Sb); Au 0.06 g/t; Ag 2.7 g/t; As 226 ppm

Low-Arsenic Advantage - Confirmed consistently across drill core and surface samples, arsenic levels remain in the tens to low hundreds of ppm, supporting favorable metallurgy compared to many global peers.

Commercial Pathway - Positive metallurgy and offtake results would position the Company to finalize direct sales agreements, establishing an early revenue stream from U.S.-sourced antimony ore while broader exploration and resource definition continue.

CEO Commentary

""Our on-site review at the IHX Zone underscores that the American Antimony Project is not only a world-class exploration opportunity, but also a near-term commercial pathway,"" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO. ""The antimony at IHX sits near the canyon entrance, making it readily accessible for shipment and processing. This oxidized surface stockpile is rich in stibnite, and further testing, validation, and permitting to lift up to 6,700 tons of material represent the next step in proving we can deliver clean, U.S.-sourced antimony to the market. This initiative is designed to enhance shareholder value by advancing early revenue generation while simultaneously expanding the Project's long-term resource base.""

Strategic Importance

Antimony is a federally designated critical mineral, essential for:

Defense applications (munitions, armor, flame-retardant systems)

Semiconductors and battery technologies

Energy storage and industrial alloys

With the United States currently 100% import-reliant on foreign antimony-primarily from China and Russia - the American Antimony Project is one of the few emerging domestic supply sources capable of strengthening U.S. critical mineral independence.

This update demonstrates that American Antimony Corporation is executing a dual-track strategy: near-term commercialization of high-grade stockpiles alongside long-term expansion of a district-scale antimony resource in Nevada.

Environmental groups are facing an unprecedented battering from a Trump administration hell-bent on tearing down regulations, rolling back Biden-era climate policies and expanding drilling and mining for fossil fuels.

On top of that, the White House is pledging to crack down on left-leaning nonprofits, possibly by revoking their tax-exempt status or launching racketeering investigations.

It’s all added up to a crushing year for many environmental groups, which are also coping with disappointing fund raising, internal divisions, adverse court rulings, last year’s electoral wipeout for their Democratic allies and the failure of GOP moderates to hold the line on clean energy spending. And now, two camps have emerged on how climate activists should revive their deflated movement, writes my colleague Zack Colman.

On the one side are groups that want to weave their climate message into a broader anti-billionaire campaign led by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). That movement depicts the Trump administration as dismantling democratic norms and regulations to give more power to a ruling class of wealthy elites.

A second faction wants to continue the path of former President Joe Biden, who championed climate action as an engine to revive U.S. manufacturing, generate jobs and blunt high costs for consumers by pouring billions into clean energy technologies.

Both approaches are on display at New York City’s annual Climate Week, which kicked off Sunday and corresponds with the United Nations General Assembly, which convened earlier this month. This past weekend saw both a “Make Billionaires Pay” march in Manhattan, as well as a gathering led by environmental activist Bill McKibben touting solar power.

But many in the environmental movement are scrambling for new ideas.

“The same playbook isn’t going to work and is not working,” Mel Smith, a spokesperson with the climate activist group 350.org and one of the lead organizers for last weekend’s march, told Zack. “We are not winning — which doesn’t mean that we still can’t win.”

That could mean organizing smaller gatherings across the country instead of trying for massive marches, for example, or paying social media influencers to promote clean energy, Zack wrote.

Seeing a losing battle against President Donald Trump, some groups are boosting their state organizing. One example is a “Make Polluters Pay” initiative that has seen New York state and Vermont pass laws meant to force oil, gas and coal companies to pay for damages from disasters like storms linked to climate change.

The Trump administration has asked a judge to strike the Vermont law, but organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council are pushing similar bills in Maryland, Illinois, California and New Jersey.

“People don’t have a lot of optimism that we’re going to make huge changes at the federal level,” Margie Alt, director of Climate Action Campaign, a coalition of environmental groups, told Zack. “The stuff this administration has done has really chilled people.”

Clean energy opportunity?

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking for leverage in government shutdown negotiations to fund clean energy, writes Amelia Davidson.

Congress left for a weeklong recess without passing a continuing resolution to keep the government open past Sept. 30. Now, Trump appears poised to meet with Democratic leaders — presenting an opportunity to negotiate, Schumer said Monday.

Democrats’ message, he said, is that “Trump is shutting down the government by not negotiating with Democrats on health care — we’re saying health care because everyone agrees with that — and clean energy.”

Revolution Wind can resume construction

A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind, throwing a lifeline to the embattled project, writes Benjamin Storrow.

The Interior Department halted the $6.2 billion project in August, citing national security concerns. But Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia called the order “the height of arbitrary and capricious.”

Revolution Wind, which is 80 percent complete, is the latest target of Trump’s anti-wind agenda. Lamberth said the issues Interior cited for stopping the project had been reviewed for years as part of the permitting process. The federal government, he said, failed to provide any factual findings for why it believed the project was no longer in compliance with its permit.

Big year for battery storage

Batteries that can store and release large amounts of electricity are seeing record growth as developers look for quicker options to meet increasing demand, Brian Dabbs and Christa Marshall write.

Battery storage is expected to account for a quarter of installations to the grid this year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. They’re providing backup to wind and solar, allowing users to tap them when they need power. That means they can take the place of fossil fuel plants that would normally be tapped for electricity at night.

“Batteries and solar are like peanut butter and jelly,” said Mark Dyson, managing director for carbon-free electricity with clean energy think tank RMI. “There’s a natural diurnal cycle to the sun, obviously, and also therefore to how batteries are going to be operating most economically.”

What's new: The Supreme Court ruled that fuel producers have standing to challenge California’s EPA-approved regulations requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles because “commonsense economic principles” show the regulations caused harm to the fuel producers that could be redressed by invalidating the regulations. But the decision leaves open the question whether vacatur is a valid remedy under the APA.

Why it matters: This decision makes it easier for businesses indirectly affected by regulations to challenge them, reducing the need for expert or other evidence to prove standing.

What to do next: The decision leaves unresolved the limits of standing for entities further removed from direct regulation. It does suggest, however, that an entity further removed from a regulation can bolster its claim for standing with evidence in the record of a regulation’s impact on the entity.

__________

In Diamond Alternative Energy, LLC v. Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court held that fuel producers have standing to sue the Environmental Protection Agency for approving California regulations that would require automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered vehicles than they would under ordinary market conditions. In particular, the Court held that the fuel producers showed redressability, because if the regulations are invalidated, automakers will likely manufacture and sell more gasoline-powered cars, thus increasing demand for liquid fuel.

In reaching that conclusion, the Court emphasized that when the possibility of redressability turns on the actions of third parties, courts may rely on commonsense economic principles to predict what those third parties are likely to do if the court grants the requested relief. That inquiry includes consideration of how actors will behave at various points along the chain of production.

The June 20, 2025, ruling is an important victory for businesses that, while not themselves directly regulated, nevertheless suffer economic injuries from, and may wish to challenge regulation up or downstream of their position in the marketplace. At the same time, the ruling contains reminders about the importance of nonetheless developing record evidence. It also leaves unanswered questions about the scope of vacatur under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

Background

The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set emissions standards for certain air pollutants from new motor vehicles. 42 U.S.C. §§ 7521(a)(1). To promote uniformity in those standards, the Clean Air Act generally preempts state standards “relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles.” Id. § 7543(a). But there is one important exception: Subject to EPA approval, California may adopt more stringent emissions standards under certain limited circumstances, id. § 7543(b)(1)(B), and other states may choose to adopt California’s stricter emissions standards instead of hewing to the EPA’s standards, id. § 7507.

Since 2005, California has attempted to use its unique position to address global climate change by limiting greenhouse-gas emissions and encouraging the production of more electric vehicles, with mixed success. As presidential administrations have changed, so too have the EPA’s views. Under Republican administrations, the EPA has found that California’s authority to set its own emissions standards is limited to addressing local or regional pollution — and that it does not extend to combatting global climate change. But under Democratic administrations, the EPA has allowed California’s regulations to take effect.

History and Facts of Diamond Alternative Energy

This case involves California’s 2012 request for EPA approval of regulations that would require automakers to (1) limit the average greenhouse-gas emissions of new vehicles sold in California, and (2) manufacture a certain percentage of electric vehicles. Under President Obama, the EPA allowed California’s regulations to take effect in 2013. But during President Trump’s first term, the EPA rescinded approval in 2019. During President Biden’s administration, the EPA reinstated approval of California’s regulations in 2022. To date, 17 States and the District of Columbia have adopted California’s emissions standards, accounting for about 40% of the American market for new cars.

After the EPA reinstated approval of California’s regulations in 2022, several fuel producers sued the EPA in the D.C. Circuit, arguing that the EPA lacked authority under the Clean Air Act to approve the regulations because California’s emissions standards target not local pollution, as authorized, but rather global warming. These fuel producers manufacture and sell liquid automobile fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and ethanol.

To support standing, the fuel producers argued that California’s regulations depress demand for their fuel because they require the manufacture and sale of vehicles that use less (or no) liquid fuel. Thus, the manufacturers argued, invalidation of the EPA’s approval of California’s regulations would redress their injury, at least in part, because car manufacturers would once again produce and sell more gas-powered vehicles.

California intervened in the litigation to defend its regulations, emphasizing their importance to “meeting California’s emissions-control goals.” For example, California argued that, without the regulations, it expected fewer electric vehicles to be produced and sold, meaning there would instead be more gasoline-powered vehicles that would in turn produce higher greenhouse gas emissions. After the D.C. Circuit granted California’s motion to intervene, however, California argued that the fuel producers lacked Article III standing because, it claimed, consumer demand for electric vehicles was “surging,” and vehicle manufacturers would not “make more gasoline powered vehicles” even if a court were to invalidate the regulations.

The D.C. Circuit agreed with California and held that the fuel producers lacked standing. That court reasoned that “redressability depended on how third-party automakers would act in the absence of California’s fleet-wide emissions standards and electric-vehicle mandate.” Since the fuel producers failed to demonstrate that the automakers would produce more gasoline-powered vehicles if the regulations were invalidated, the court concluded that the fuel producers lacked evidence of redressability to support Article III standing.

Majority Opinion

In an opinion authored by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit’s decision, concluding that the fuel producers have standing to challenge the EPA’s approval of California’s regulations.

The Court began by explaining that the “‘irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements’: injury in fact, causation, and redressability” (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)). Here, there was no real dispute that the fuel producers showed injury in fact or causation. The regulations likely caused monetary loss to the fuel producers by decreasing demand for gasoline and other liquid fuels. The only question was whether the fuel producers had shown redressability. As to that element, the Court concluded that, if the EPA’s approval of California’s regulations were invalidated, it would likely redress “at least some of the fuel producers’ monetary injuries,” because it would likely “result in more revenue for the fuel producers from additional sales of gasoline and other liquid fuels.”

The Court described this case as presenting the “familiar circumstances where government regulation of a business may be likely to cause injuries to other linked businesses.” In other words, “when the government regulates (or under-regulates) a business, the regulation (or lack thereof) may cause downstream or upstream economic injuries to others in the chain.” See FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 379 (2024). In those circumstances, the Court held, it is appropriate to consider “commonsense economic principles” when analyzing the predictability of third-party behavior for the purpose of redressability. And here, those commonsense economic principles supported finding that invalidating California’s regulations would likely redress the fuel producers’ injury. Following that relief, manufacturers would likely produce more gasoline-powered automobiles, leading, in turn, to greater sales of liquid fuels.

The Court observed that record evidence supported that commonsense conclusion. California estimated that its regulations would produce “substantial reductions in demand for gasoline,” and recognized that “fuel providers would likely be most adversely affected by the regulations due to the resulting substantial reductions in demand for gasoline.” And automakers who have invested heavily in electric vehicles and who intervened on the side of the EPA and California predicted that, “absent California’s regulations, other automakers would seek a competitive advantage over them by selling fewer electric vehicles and more gasoline-powered vehicles.” Thus, the “totality of record evidence” “make[s] it sufficiently predictable that invalidating California’s regulations would likely redress the fuel producers’ injury.”

Importantly, the Court clarified that the fuel producers did not need to introduce expert evidence to show redressability — all they needed to show was “a predictable chain of events.” The upshot, in the Court’s words, is that “[t]he government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders.”

Dissenting Opinions

Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the Court should not have granted certiorari to begin with. She suggested that the D.C. Circuit’s standing analysis relied on a misunderstanding about the duration of California’s regulations. Thus, in her view, the Court should “simply have vacated the case and remanded it to the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its redressability analysis” with the corrected timing in mind.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, too, arguing that the Court has not applied its standing precedents “evenhandedly,” and that its failure to do so “erodes public trust in the impartiality of judicial decisionmaking.” In particular, Justice Jackson reasoned that the Court is more lenient with “moneyed interests” as opposed to “ordinary citizens.” The majority responded to this critique by citing standing cases over the last few years that, it said, disprove her argument, such as a case where the Court found that an inmate on death row had standing to challenge the prosecutor’s refusal to provide DNA testing, see Reed v. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023), and a case where the Court found that several medical associations lacked standing to challenge the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone, see FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. 367, 374 (2024).

Justice Jackson further asserted that this case did not warrant the Court’s attention because it “will soon be moot” because the EPA under the Trump administration is likely to change its position and revoke approval of California’s regulations anyway. Justice Jackson criticized the majority for stretching to find redressability in this case, and questioned what the majority of justices called “commonsense.”

Implications and Open Questions

The Court’s decision is important because it clarifies what unregulated entities must show to establish standing to challenge agency regulations that cause them economic harm. Specifically, the decision makes clear that courts may rely on commonsense economic principles about how rational actors will behave in the marketplace in order to predict the consequences of requested relief. Thus, unregulated entities who suffer economic injuries from the regulation of linked businesses can use commonsense inferences to establish redressability, and they do not need to present expert evidence to that effect.

“Predictable” versus “speculative” inferences. One open question, however, is how courts will draw the line between “predictable” and “speculative” inferences for potential plaintiffs that may be further attenuated from the regulated entity in question. For example, the Court suggested that a hot dog manufacturer would be able to sue if the government banned hot dog sales in stadiums, because the stadium regulation would adversely affect hot dog sales. But what about the hot-dog bun manufacturers? The condiment manufacturers? The company that makes the hot-dog sized disposable trays?

It is unclear to what extent courts will accept “common sense” in the place of record development, particularly where the questions become more speculative. Although the Court said expert evidence may not be necessary given common sense, the Court’s reliance on record evidence, and disagreement with the D.C. Circuit, are good reminders, to borrow Voltaire’s old saw, that common sense may not be so common.

Common sense was arguably clear in Diamond Alternative Energy: California’s about-face on the effect of its regulations underscored the obviousness of predictable economic results. In seeking to intervene before arguing that the producers lacked standing, California had itself emphasized those results — so much so that the Court’s response was reminiscent of the distaste it has expressed in other cases when a litigant “speaks out of both sides of its mouth.” Bittner v. United States, 598 U.S. 85, 97 n.5 (2023). Most cases, in contrast, are unlikely to involve clear support for standing by the party opposing standing — and the Court’s ruling is a good reminder about the strategic and credibility concerns with making such contradictory (but not alternative) arguments.

Validity of vacatur. Another open question concerns the continued validity of the fuel producers’ requested relief: vacatur of the regulations under the APA. The APA permits courts to “set aside” agency action, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), but there is an ongoing academic debate about whether that language permits courts to vacate agency action. The Court in Diamond Alternative Energy avoided wading into that debate, instead adopting the lower courts’ interpretation without endorsing it. In a footnote, the Court explained that “[u]nder D.C. Circuit precedent, setting aside EPA’s approval would mean that California may not enforce its greenhouse-gas emissions limits and electric-vehicle mandate for new vehicle fleets” — i.e., the court would vacate the EPA’s approval of the regulations.

That remedy, however, looks similar to so-called “universal injunctions,” which the Court in Trump v. Casa held “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.” Vacatur, like the universal injunction, enables a court to grant relief that is not tailored to the parties before it. The question thus remains whether vacatur is likewise unlawful.

As it turns out, the answer to that question is probably outcome-determinative here, because the fuel producers can obtain relief in this case only if the APA authorizes vacatur of the regulations. That’s because the fuel producers are not themselves a regulated entity — the automakers are. So an injunction barring enforcement of California’s regulations against the fuel producers would not afford the fuel producers relief because they aren’t regulated by California’s rules in the first place.

Instead, the fuel producers “can obtain meaningful relief only if the APA authorizes vacatur of the agency rule, thereby remedying the adverse downstream effects of the rule on the unregulated plaintiff” — here, the fuel producers. See Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 603 U.S. 799, 826 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). (See our September 2024 article “Supreme Court Decisions Curtail Regulatory Agencies’ Powers, Making It Easier To Challenge Rules.”) Indeed, the fuel producers recognized as much—counsel for the fuel producers admitted at oral argument that vacatur was the only way to redress their injury. Nevertheless, the Court assumed that vacatur is a lawful remedy and avoided wading into that thorny question here.

The “object” of a regulation. Somewhat relatedly, the Court left open the question of whether the fuel producers could be considered the “object” of the California regulations, because the regulations “explicitly seek to restrict the use of gasoline and other liquid fuels in automobiles,” even though they don’t regulate the fuel producers directly.

Whether a party is the “object” of a regulation matters because the Court has long held that, “[w]hen a plaintiff is the ‘object’ of a government regulation, there should ‘ordinarily’ be ‘little question’ that the regulation causes injury to the plaintiff and that invalidating the regulation would redress the plaintiff’s injuries” (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 461). Because the fuel producers demonstrated standing through common sense inferences and record evidence, however, there was no need for the Court to resolve that question in this case.

We will continue to monitor developments in the D.C. Circuit on remand and in other courts of appeals in response to the Court’s decision.

By Jamie Martin

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that small farms remain essential to both the national food system and the stability of rural communities. Faith Parum, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation, explains that the USDA classifies a small farm as one earning under $350,000 in gross cash farm income annually. This figure reflects total revenue before costs. With typical expenses of about $200,000, many small farms ultimately earn only around $45,000.

Parum emphasizes that the term “small farm” is different from “family farm.” The former measures financial size, while the latter describes who owns and operates the farm. Nearly 86 percent of American farms qualify as small by income, and about 97 percent are family owned, whether by individuals or partnerships.

Beyond producing food, small farms serve as economic lifelines for rural regions. They create jobs, generate steady revenue, and help keep vital institutions such as schools, hospitals, and small businesses open. Parum notes, “They sustain these communities in terms of revenue into the community, but also jobs, workforce.”

By supporting services and providing employment, small farms ensure rural communities remain vibrant places to live and work. Their combined contributions prove that even with limited size and income, small farms are key to the health of the U.S. farm economy and the well-being of families across the nation.

The results are “striking,” Environmental Defense Fund Energy Transition Associate Vice President Jon Goldstein said during the news conference.

“It’s the clearest evidence yet that regulations are working,” he noted. “The state’s efforts to put sensible requirements in place to limit methane emissions from oil and gas development are having a marked impact on pollution on the state.”

Methane is a colorless, odorless gas and a significant driver of climate change as it is 28 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. New Mexico passed rules in 2021 and 2022 to require producers to track and capture 98% of the gases. The EPA issued additional rules under the Biden Administration, which President Donald Trump has vowed to roll back, prompting pushback from states, including New Mexico.

Lujan Grisham said she hopes the state can be a leader on the issue, as the federal government moves to implement more regulations cuts for industry.

“I don’t have a good ready statement except that I believe New Mexico won’t be one of those places that can be strong-armed to do the wrong thing for the people that we serve,” she said.

But the findings — which include data collected by nine satellites and validated by the Environmental Defense Fund — still show that New Mexico is projected to have higher greenhouse gas emissions than its 2030 goals set forth in an executive order issued by Lujan Grisham in 2019.

Efforts to enshrine those goals into law in recent sessions have failed, and the Lujan Grisham administration is running out of time to pass them, given the 2026 30-day session will be the last of her second term.

The Environmental Defense Fund noted that New Mexico’s methane emission rate is still “appreciably high,” and that additional efforts would need to be in place to reduce emissions. Oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled since 2020.

Lujan Grisham acknowledged that “we are seeing a drastic reduction in our greenhouse gases methane, but it’s not where we have to be by 2030.”

\New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney said the state would work with EDF to close the 9% gap and meet the 2030 emissions reduction goal.

“This partnership, this ability to work together, to develop the science, to work with regulators, to then implement what we’re learning will show that there is not a lack of leadership around climate in the United States – it’s actually happening within the states,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MLG-Presser-Sept.-22-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 19:00:23.712490

To drive growth in industries such as low-carbon steel, cement, chemicals, and aluminum, several countries in recent years have begun using contracts for difference policies.

Without greater federal support to advance domestic competitiveness, American manufacturing is at risk of falling behind in global markets that value energy-efficient, low-carbon industrial production. Contracts for difference could be an efficient tool for providing this support. However, to date, there is little experience in the United States with contracts for difference policy.

A group of experts across fields and organizations came together to write a report, published by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy today, that explores the potential of a US contracts for difference policy. It evaluates contracts for difference as a policy tool to boost innovation and low-carbon American manufacturing and outlines design considerations for policymakers. Our coauthors on the report are Seton Stiebert, Yuqi Zhu, William Shobe, Benjamin Longstreth, Aaron Bergman, and Chris Bataille.

Contracts for difference lower the risk of capital-intensive projects by providing price certainty.

In the context of industrial decarbonization, a contract for difference is a contract in which a manufacturer and a government agree on a guaranteed price—the strike price—over a given period for low-carbon products or materials for which the government seeks to increase production. The government agrees to pay the manufacturer the difference between the strike price and the market price. Unlike a long-term contract or power purchase agreement, however, the government does not procure the product or material; it simply provides the financial boost for innovation in the market.

For example, suppose a low-carbon steel mill has a contract for difference guaranteeing $600 per ton and the market price drops to $550 per ton for a given period. In this case, the producer receives an additional $50 per ton from the government for that period. In some cases, contracts for difference also require the producer to pay the government the difference if the market price rises above the strike price (as Figure 1 illustrates, this depends on whether the contract is designed to be one- or two-sided). The strike price is usually determined through a competitive auction in which the government awards the contracts to eligible projects with the lowest-cost bids.

As a first step, policymakers can examine whether there is authority to create a contracts for difference program under existing federal law. The most straightforward path, however, may be for Congress to enact federal legislation authorizing such a program.

Our report details the program elements that policymakers must consider, such as eligibility requirements, auction design, and the adjustability of the strike price, among others. It also compares contracts for difference to other policy options. While the program’s overall impact would depend heavily on its scope and the level of government investment, an ambitious, well-designed program could help jumpstart American innovation and put domestic manufacturers on a better path to compete and lead globally in industries central to the transition to a low-carbon economy.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2420518787_16x9.width-600.png,N,,2025-09-22 20:00:13.206597

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said.
Electricity prices also increased during the Biden administration, due both to inflation and increasing energy demand, but they had fallen from their high point by the time Biden left office.
Biden and the Democrats hoped that their signature clean energy policy, included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would help increase supply and make energy more affordable.
When asked if he believed that restoring support for clean energy could be included in a budget deal, Schatz said he felt it would take longer.","With U.S. households paying 10 percent more per kilowatt hour for electricity than they did at the start of this year, Senate Democrats sought Monday to tie the increasing pain for consumers to the Trump administration’s relentless rollback of clean energy policy.

“Trump and Republicans are doing what the American people hate most, and that is raise costs,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York in a conference call from Climate Week activities in his home state. “From skyrocketing electricity prices to ever-increasing homeowner insurance premiums because of climate change to healthcare.

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said. “They’re making it much worse, and the American people are realizing it.”

Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, a leading Democrat on climate policy, said the increase in power prices—now occurring at twice the rate of inflation—can be traced to the administration’s decisions to stop clean energy projects and Congress’ repeal of federal support for renewable energy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which it passed in July. Natural gas projects are backlogged because of supply chain issues and nuclear and geothermal power, which still get support under the new law, will take a long time to catch up with the increasing demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence.

“Even if there were no planetary emergency, the most logical energy to put on the grid, because it is the cheapest and the fastest to get done, is wind and solar, with battery storage,” Schatz said. “We are going to keep talking about this, because the unfortunate thing is that this doubling of energy prices against the rate of inflation, we’re kind of at the bottom of this mountain. It has been spiking, but this is before the real spike in load comes.”

The senators’ remarks come as the Trump administration has been escalating its assaults on clean energy—issuing a series of stop-work orders for offshore wind projects and putting a stop to coal plant retirements. That’s on top of the instability that is rippling throughout the clean energy industry due to the impact of the repeal of federal subsidies in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which many experts predicted would increase costs. Trump’s tariffs on raw materials also have raised costs throughout the energy industry.

Electricity prices also increased during the Biden administration, due both to inflation and increasing energy demand, but they had fallen from their high point by the time Biden left office. Biden and the Democrats hoped that their signature clean energy policy, included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, would help increase supply and make energy more affordable.

The Trump White House and the Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks by Schumer and Schatz. But earlier this month, Jarred Agen, the executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, defended the moves to eliminate federal support for renewables.

“I think it was given unfair preferential treatment in the past, particularly in the last administration,” Agen said in a conversation at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C. think tank. “What the president and I think the team at the White House is the most against is, obviously, just the American taxpayer covering the cost of the intermittent energy that is not producing what it has promised to produce and there is not the return of investment.

“It’s the tax subsidies that have really kept these afloat for a long time and basically the president is saying enough is enough,” Agen said.

But the cost of renewable energy has plummeted in recent years, which has allowed it to better compete against fossil fuel power—especially coal. Most analysts expect clean energy to continue to grow when the subsidies are phased out, just not quickly enough to meet the U.S. climate goals that were set under Biden.

And it’s not only consumers but workers who are feeling the pain of Trump policies, the Democrats said. They pointed to a new report by the advocacy group Climate Power that calculated that more than 80,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the sector this year; $42 billion in private investment has been lost or delayed.

“We were blindsided by the news that the project was being halted,” said Tom Kilday, an apprentice electrician on the Revolution Wind project off of Rhode Island that was hit with a Trump stop-order work. A member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, he joined the Democratic senators to describe how union workers were being affected.

“Thousands of workers like myself don’t know if we will still have a job in a week, or a month,” Kilday said. “And we’re a hard-working group of people … We’ve all taken hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of classes in our careers to develop our craft and expand our knowledge.”

Within a couple hours of the news conference, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered a stay of the Trump order that allowed work to restart—at least for now—on Revolution Wind, which is 80 percent complete and was expected to be providing enough electricity for 350,000 homes in New England by next year.

Schumer said that because the Inflation Reduction Act spurred even more clean energy projects in Republican and purple states than in Democrat-led states, he believed the issue of what is happening in the industry can and should be addressed in negotiations he has called for with Trump and Republicans in order to head off a federal government shutdown. Congress must pass either a budget deal or a “continuing resolution,” or CR, by Sept. 30 to keep the current budget in place.

So far it is not clear such negotiations will take place. When asked if he believed that restoring support for clean energy could be included in a budget deal, Schatz said he felt it would take longer. “We’re like 10 days before the end of the federal fiscal year, so an energy provision in a CR is, I think, vanishingly unlikely,” he said. “But I do think there’s deal space over the next six months to alleviate the pain.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2208599443-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 19:00:15.487269

Key Takeaways

The number of EV charging points in the U.S. grew from 15,000 in 2013 to an estimated 193,000 in 2024, more than a 12-fold increase in just over a decade.

By 2030, the U.S. is expected to reach about 550,000 charging points, with an average of 58,000 new chargers added each year.

As electric vehicles (EVs) gain traction in the U.S., the charging infrastructure to support them is racing to keep pace.

EV chargers are the critical piece in the EV ecosystem to enable more widespread adoption and everyday usability.

This visualization is part of Visual Capitalist’s VOLTage Week, sponsored by Tema ETFs. It visualizes the number of EV charging points in the U.S. by year from 2013 to 2024, with a forecast for 2030 using data from the IEA and J.P. Morgan.

EV Chargers in the U.S. Have Surged Since 2013

In 2013, the U.S. had just 15,000 EV charging points. That number has skyrocketed to 193,000 by 2024, and by 2030 the U.S. is forecasted to have 550,000 EV chargers installed across the country.

The data table below shows the total number of installed EV chargers in the U.S. every year from 2013 to 2024, along with a forecast for 2030:

YearEV Charging Points in the U.S. 201315,000 201420,000 201532,000 201639,000 201746,000 201861,000 201977,000 202098,000 2021113,000 2022129,000 2023160,000 2024193,000 2030F550,000

The surge of the past decade has been fueled by growing EV adoption as more companies enter the market, government incentives, and infrastructure programs aimed at reducing range anxiety and supporting green transportation.

EV Chargers’ Rapid Growth from 2020 to 2024

The growth in EV chargers has steadily accelerated since 2013, however since 2020 the number of added chargers each year has consistently been in the tens of thousands.

2020 was the first year where more than 20,000 chargers were added, with 21,000 added, and then between 2022 and 2024 alone, the U.S. added 80,000 new chargers.

The Road to 2030

Projections show the number of EV chargers in the U.S. reaching 550,000 by 2030. To meet this target, the U.S. will need to install roughly 58,000 new chargers annually.

While the annual installed average is around 16,100 since 2013, since 2020 the average is around 23,200.

While this is far off from the 58,000 figure, growth is expected to continue accelerating, and is essential to meet EV driver demand across the country.

Chart: What’s Powering New U.S. Electricity Generation?

This was originally posted on our Voronoi app. Download the app for free on iOS or Android and discover incredible data-driven charts from a variety of trusted sources.

Key Takeaways

Between 2025 and 2026, renewables account for the lion’s share of new U.S. electricity additions.

Solar accounts for 50% of new U.S. electricity generation, driven by declining prices supporting its cost competitiveness.

By contrast, natural gas makes up just 8% of new additions, while remaining fossil fuel sources of energy make up less than 0.2% of the total share.

U.S. electricity generation is decarbonizing as demand for green power surges.

In the next two years, renewable sources will power 92% of new electricity capacity. Driving this shift are massive investments from big tech companies to scale their AI infrastructure, requiring a huge amount of power to run and cool data centers.

This visualization is part of Visual Capitalist’s VOLTage Week, sponsored by Tema ETFs. It shows where new U.S. electricity capacity is coming from, based on data from the EIA via J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Breaking Down New U.S. Electricity Generation

Source% of Additions 2025-2026GW Added Solar50%63.3 Batteries30%38.0 Wind12%15.2 Natural gas8%10.1 Other0.2%0.3

Total Additions100%126.5

As we can see, solar power accounts for 50% of new capacity additions in the next two years.

While natural gas continues to be the leading source of electricity in the U.S., solar is rapidly growing. In 2024, solar power additions hit a record 37 gigawatts (GW) in new capacity compared to 1 GW of new capacity for natural gas-fired power.

With 30% of new capacity, battery storage follows next. In the next two years, new storage capacity is set to reach 38 GW of power, with projects concentrated in Texas and California.

Meanwhile, the majority of U.S. electricity retirements are coal (55%), natural gas (37%), and oil (8%) through to 2026.

When the average unemployment rate is under 5%, as it is now, a person can only receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 weeks.
The Louisiana Workforce Commission will also be able to disqualify people from receiving unemployment benefits if they don’t show up for a scheduled job interview.","Louisiana businesses will pay less in unemployment taxes following an across-the-board reduction to jobless benefits that took effect at the beginning of this year.

The employer tax will drop from approximately $98 to $89 per employee making at least $7,700 per year starting Jan. 1. For most businesses, the change should work out to approximately 9% in tax savings.

At the same time, maximum benefits for the unemployed will increase 2.5% from $275 to $282.

The changes are the result of the expectation that Louisiana’s unemployment insurance trust fund will reach $1.2 billion in August 2026. A projected balance of $1.15 billion automatically triggers the reduction in employer taxes and a boost in benefits under state law.

The modest bump in weekly unemployment payments won’t make up for a much larger cut in those benefits that went into effect at the beginning of this year, however.

Unemployed people eligible for maximum benefits will receive $84 to $140 more per year as a result of the discussed change, but those same workers are expected to lose over $3,600 in benefits this year.

Through a new law passed last year, Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana lawmakers reduced the cap on receiving unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 12 or 20 weeks, depending on the state unemployment rate.

As a result, people who were previously entitled to $7,150 in unemployment support annually will only be able to receive $3,384 to $5,640 per year moving forward. The length of time a person can receive unemployment benefits is now tied to the state unemployment rate.

When the average unemployment rate is under 5%, as it is now, a person can only receive unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 weeks. As the unemployment rate rises, the length of time a person can receive benefits lengthens until it reaches a maximum of 20 weeks when the rate is 8.5% or higher.

Another set of new requirements will also come into play Dec. 31 under another new law.

People seeking unemployment benefits will have to prove they have done five searches for work for every week they expect to access a payment. Currently, they are required to show three work searches under state rules.

BATWorks Bolsters Mayor Adams’ Efforts to Create a ‘Harbor of the Future’ in New York City, Fulfills Key Commitments in “Green Economy Action Plan”

BROOKLYN, NY—New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) today announced the next steps in advancing BATWorks, a cutting-edge climate innovation hub at Brooklyn Army Terminal (BAT) in Sunset Park, with Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) hosting a series of inaugural climate programming events during Climate Week NYC that more deeply tie LACI’s national programs to New York City and BATWorks. Throughout the week, LACI—a cleantech incubator created as an independent nonprofit organization by the City of Los Angeles—will host programming to bring industry leaders, climate entrepreneurs, investors, and the Sunset Park community together to spark new connections and raise opportunities for partnerships and financing, while exploring strategies to attract green businesses to operate at BATWorks or at the BAT campus. Additionally, event programming at BATWorks will share progress on the pilots soon-to-deploy across New York City in support of city-identified climate goals as part of the City Climate Innovation Challenge—helping cities solve challenges while helping startups commercialize technology, accelerate equitable climate action, and create economic opportunity. See a full list of the week’s events and programming.

As a complement to the introductory events hosted by LACI, NYCEDC unveiled new branding for the world-class innovation hub and new plans for a temporary BATWorks welcome and leasing center, ocated at the BAT campus entrance on 1st Avenue.

First announced in Mayor Adams’ 2023 State of the City address, the world-class BATWorks hub will provide start-ups with space for product research and development, as well as offer workforce training and job placement programming to New Yorkers. Last May, NYCEDC announced that a consortium led by LACI and the Cambridge Innovation Center (CIC) will design and operate BATWorks. NYCEDC’s $100 million investment in BATWorks will help create over 600 jobs, serve 150 startups over 10 years, and generate $2.6 billion in economic impact for the city. The hub continues Mayor Adams’ efforts to turn the city’s waterfront into a “Harbor of the Future” and support entrepreneurs and leaders developing, piloting, and deploying new solutions to combat climate change, and advances a key commitment in the Green Economy Action Plan.

“I cannot think of a more fitting way to kick off NYC Climate Week 2025 than with LACI officially launching programming at New York City's new cutting-edge climate innovation hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal,” said NYCEDC President & CEO Andrew Kimball. “Building on the city's Green Economy Action Plan, BATWorks will unlock new opportunities for startups, advance innovative climate solutions, fuel job growth, and strengthen Brooklyn’s green working waterfront, and NYCEDC is incredibly proud to see this vision coming to life.”

“We are thrilled to host inaugural events during Climate Week NYC to help NYCEDC introduce the future climate innovation hub at BATWorks,” said LACI President and CEO Matt Petersen. “These events will also showcase how the nation’s two largest cities are working together on climate innovation by bringing together key speakers from Los Angeles and New York City, as well as introduce LACI’s national programs including NCCEI, the LACI Debt Fund and the Challenge and how these programs are moving climate innovation forward across the country to better create opportunities for regional innovation organizations, help underrepresented founders access working capital, and work with cities and startups to scale key solutions.”

LACI is advising NYCEDC on climate programming, including future cleantech startup incubation and workforce development initiatives. Over the next 12 to 18 months, LACI will engage key climate and innovation organizations in the region as well as community leaders in Sunset Park. Starting in 2026, LACI will lead “Pilots at BAT,” a program where emerging climate technology companies can test their products in a live-built environment. While CIC—a global leader in building and operating innovation campuses—will design work and laboratory spaces as well as programming to support innovation and attract start-ups. The awarded consortium also includes The City University of New York (CUNY), New York University (NYU), and Perkins&Will.

NYCEDC announced plans for a temporary BATWorks welcome and leasing center located at BAT campus entrance on First Avenue, while construction is underway on the permanent hub. In the temporary hub, LACI will focus on activating the BAT campus through piloting, building programmatic partnerships at BAT across the city’s climate tech ecosystem, hosting events for an array of related stakeholder groups, and developing plans for startup incubation and workforce training to take place at BAT. The permanent BATWorks climate innovation hub will be located in BAT Building A and is currently scheduled to open in 2028.

Sunset Park’s waterfront district in South Brooklyn, with its rich industrial history, robust infrastructure, diverse tenants, and strategic access to major transportation networks, is uniquely positioned to serve as a hub for clean energy and sustainable manufacturing. BAT, as a whole, is home to over 100 tenants that collectively employ 4,000 New Yorkers. NYCEDC has invested nearly $450 million in the site to date—with more than $300 million of that investment currently in the pipeline—to bring new leasable space online and modernize this historic campus, as well as improve open space, common areas, and additional campus infrastructure.

BATWorks is a crucial part of the larger Harbor Climate Collaborative—a joint initiative between NYCEDC, the Trust for Governors Island, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corporation—to link together tech piloting, tenanting, and programming opportunities across all three organizations and promote climate innovation. By unlocking 6 million square feet of space, the Collaborative will support the creation of 5,000 permanent jobs, educate and train 2,100 students, and generate $55 billion in economic impact. In addition to the $100 million available for BATWorks, the Adams administration and NYCEDC are also transforming the nearby city-owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal into one of the largest offshore wind port facilities in the nation, which broke ground in 2024.

“BATWorks is an exciting step toward an economy where climate solutions and economic opportunity grow together, giving more New Yorkers access to promising careers,” said Brooklyn Workforce Innovations (BWI) Executive Director Aaron Shiffman. “BWI is proud to be collaborating with EDC and the BATWorks partners in this important work.”

“BATWorks at Brooklyn Army Terminal is an incredible opportunity to imagine the reuse of an historic building into a vehicle for the future of innovation and workforce development in New York City,” said Perkins & Will Managing Partner Robert Clemens. “With it's unique position along the waterfront, BAT is also poised to play a key role in the iterative evolution of the Blue Highway, an alternative concept to bring back the importance of water-borne transportation to link Brooklyn to greater New York and beyond. One of the key interventions that our whole team is envisioning is an iconic gathering space, unique to this project, where people can come hear about the innovation happening at BATWorks and also to gather as a community, reinforcing the identity of Sunset Park and it's vision of the future.”

NYCEDC’s work across Sunset Park builds on the Adams administration’s broader strategy to develop the Harbor of the Future—a reimagined network of innovation and growth across New York City’s waterways. The Harbor of the Future includes emerging innovation centers at the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx, the country’s largest offshore wind port at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, a new cutting-edge climate innovation hub at the Brooklyn Army Terminal in Sunset Park, modern maritime port and vibrant mixed-use community hub at the Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Red Hook, the Science Park and Research Campus in Kips Bay in Manhattan, new sustainable housing and public space on the North Shore of Staten Island, and an anchor research and educational partner with the New York Climate Exchange on Governors Island.",https://edc.nyc/sites/default/files/styles/1x1_md/public/2025-09/NYCEDC-Press-Release-BATWorks-New-Rendering.jpg?h=feffbd0b&itok=f-YD7r1f,N,,2025-09-22 22:59:07.697146

Same Driver, New Record

The company achieved the feat at the ATP Automotive Testing Papenburg track in Germany. Professional driver Marc Basseng, who set the previous EV speed record in 2024, was behind the wheel.

The track edition electric vehicle uses the same e4 Platform and DiSus-X core technical architecture as the commercially available U9 currently sold in China. The car also adds a 1,200-volt platform paired with advanced thermal management.

Quad-Motor System

Yangwang stated that the EV’s quad-motor system includes 30,000-rpm motors that can deliver peak power of 555 kilowatts each and a combined system output that exceeds 3,000 PS. According to the company, these specs grant the vehicle a power-to-weight ratio of 1,217 PS per metric ton.

Adjusting Wheel Torque, Suspension Height

The car also features an independent torque-vectoring system that minimizes traction loss and wheel slip by monitoring road feedback and adjusting the wheels’ torque more than 100 times per second. Additionally, the DiSus-X Intelligent Body Control System alters suspension height at each corner during hard cornering and rapid acceleration.

Other features include “body posture control,” an optional carbon-fiber splitter, and track-focused semi-slick tires.

Company to be Fully Funded with Clean Balance Sheet and Streamlined Capitalization Table, Super Charging New Era of Organic Growth and Opportunity to Expand into Crypto Economy

SANTA MONICA, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Super League (Nasdaq: SLE), a leader in playable media trusted by global brands to reach and activate gaming audiences through playable ads and gamified content, today announced the execution of definitive documentation for a private placement financing to be undertaken solely with accredited investors, anchored by a $10 million strategic equity investment from Evo Fund, an internationally recognized sponsor of digital asset treasury companies such as Metaplanet Inc, the 5th largest holder of bitcoin in the world. The Company expects to receive between $12.0 million and $20 million in gross proceeds from the private placement, consisting of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock. While no assurances can be given that the private placement will be consummated, the private placement is expected to close following the Company’s Annual General Meeting of Stockholders in October. Upon consummation of the private placement, Super League will have a strong financial foundation and will have removed all outstanding indebtedness. In addition to strengthening its balance sheet, the financing is expected to facilitate regaining compliance with Nasdaq’s shareholder’s equity listing requirements, completing the final step of the Company’s rapid corporate restructuring.

This marks a significant inflection point for Super League and a major step forward to increase shareholder value. As the company advances toward its stated goal of being EBITDA positive on a cash basis in the fourth quarter of 2025, closing this transaction will provide the strategic and financial flexibility to pursue new scalable initiatives. With Evo Fund’s worldwide network and integrated suite of financial holdings, Super League will be positioned to evaluate and pursue strategically differentiated, crypto-forward opportunities while also strengthening current operations.

“Today’s announcement marks a transformative milestone for Super League and its shareholders,” said Matt Edelman, CEO and President of Super League. “Upon closing the financing and having Evo Fund as a committed partner, we will emerge much stronger, ready to pursue growth opportunities with renewed momentum. Super League will be debt-free, fully capitalized, and ideally positioned to advance our core business while exploring ways to accelerate growth through a symbiotic digital asset strategy. With a fortified balance sheet, we will be able to focus squarely on achieving sustainable profitability - a welcome shift from having to balance our attention so heavily towards corporate health versus operational efficacy. Together with the recent reductions in our cost structure, this transaction will set us firmly on a path to creating durable, long-term value for our shareholders as a gaming media company poised to enter the crypto economy.”

Evo Fund’s investment reflects its confidence in Super League’s long-term trajectory and in the broader strategic opportunities being unlocked by a supportive regulatory environment and the rapid evolution of digital asset models.

“Evo Fund is proud to stand alongside Super League at such a defining moment in the company’s journey,” said Michael Lerch, Founder, President, and Chief Global Investment Officer of Evo Fund. “We believe deeply in the power of enduring partnerships between committed capital and executive leadership. We have known Matt for several years and seen firsthand his and his team’s resilience and accomplishments over the past six months. That has only reinforced our conviction in the opportunity to build a platform together. We have learned a lot as the leading investor in digital asset treasuries in Japan and are excited to break new ground in the U.S. market with Super League.”

The financing coincides with Super League’s successful efforts to simplify its capital structure, eliminating the complex layers of previously outstanding preferred stock and creating a clean foundation for business acceleration. For the first time in several years, the company has a capitalization table and equity structure designed to enable both strategic agility and staying power.

Aegis Capital will be acting as the exclusive placement agent for the transaction.

There is no guarantee that the private placement will be consummated. The private placement is subject to the completion of certain closing conditions customary for transactions of this type, and receipt of the approval of the Super League’s stockholders to issue the securities being offered and sold in the private placement. Super League intends to hold its annual meeting of stockholders in October, 2025, which will include a proposal to approve the issuance of the securities under the private placement.

The securities being issued and sold in the private placement are solely being sold to accredited investors, and have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities Act ”). Accordingly, these securities may not be offered or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Concurrent with the execution of the securities purchase agreement, Super League and Evo Fund entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which Super League has agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the resale of the shares of common stock, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, sold in the private placement.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or other jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.

LONG BEACH, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Rocket Lab Corporation (Nasdaq: RKLB) (“Rocket Lab” or “the Company”), a leading launch and space systems company, delivered two Explorer-class spacecraft to Kennedy Space Flight Center for NASA’s Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers (ESCAPADE) mission, in partnership with the University of California, Berkeley’s Space Sciences Laboratory.

Last year Rocket Lab completed the design, build, integration, and testing of the twin spacecraft, named Blue and Gold , in just three and a half years, an accelerated timeline for a Mars mission. This achievement was made possible by Rocket Lab’s mature spacecraft manufacturing experience and its vertically integrated supply chain, which brings production of critical components like solar arrays, star trackers, propellant tanks, reaction wheels, radios, flight software, and more, in-house. ESCAPADE is based on Rocket Lab’s Explorer spacecraft platform , a configurable, high delta-V interplanetary variant of the Company’s advanced family of spacecraft.

ESCAPADE is part of NASA’s Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program, designed to deliver high-value planetary science at lower cost and on faster timelines. ESCAPADE will deliver critical Mars science at a fraction of the cost and time of traditional billion-dollar missions.

During a 22-month cruise to Mars, Blue and Gold will travel together before entering complementary elliptical orbits around the planet to conduct their science campaigns. The spacecraft will simultaneously capture data from two regions of Mars’ magnetosphere. This unique two-point measurement will allow scientists to understand how the solar wind strips atoms from Mars’ atmosphere, offering insight into the planet’s atmospheric escape history and space weather environment, and informing future human exploration strategies.

Rocket Lab founder and CEO, Sir Peter Beck, says: “ESCAPADE is a perfect example of why Rocket Lab exists – to make ambitious space science faster and more affordable. Delivering two interplanetary spacecraft on schedule and within budget for a Mars mission is no small feat, and it speaks to the determination and agility of our team. They’ve proven that we can take a concept from design to Mars readiness in just a few short years. This won’t be Rocket Lab’s last time at Mars, with concepts like the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter on the horizon, we’re laying the groundwork for more complex, capable, and essential missions that will support future human exploration.”

Rob Lillis, ESCAPADE Principal Investigator and Associate Director for Planetary Science at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, says: “It's been a long road, but we are so excited to be launching Blue & Gold on their mission to understand the Martian space weather environment. Through the usual ups and downs, Rocket Lab has been right alongside NASA and UC Berkeley, supporting us every step of the way on this interplanetary journey.""

Upon arrival at Kennedy Space Center, Rocket Lab engineers will conduct post-transport inspections and functional tests in the cleanroom before propellant loading and vehicle integration. Launch is scheduled to occur no earlier than this fall on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket.

San Antonio, TX, Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Global Investors, Inc. ( NASDAQ : GROW ) (“the Company”), a registered investment advisory firm [1] with expertise in gold mining stocks and the airline industry, is pleased to announce that it will continue its payment of monthly dividends.

The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved payment of the $0.0075 per share per month dividend beginning in October 2025 and continuing through December 2025. The record dates are October 14, November 10 and December 15, and the payment dates will be October 27, November 24 and December 29.

Based on the September 15, 2025, closing price of $2.48, this monthly dividend represents an annualized yield of 3.63%.

Gold and Miners Are Shining in 2025

Gold has been on a historic run in 2025, setting repeated new all-time highs and exceeding its previous inflation-adjusted record, set in 1980. Central bank buying, sticky inflation and global political uncertainty have fueled demand for the precious metal as a store of value.

Frank Holmes, the Company’s CEO and Chief Investment Officer, comments on the opportunity for gold miners:

“In my 40+ years in capital markets, I’ve rarely seen an environment this strong for gold mining companies. With average all-in sustaining costs (AISC) hovering around $1,500 per ounce and spot prices more than double that, miners are enjoying extraordinary margins. The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index recently hit all-time highs, with many producers and mid-tier names posting triple-digit year-to-date gains. We believe this has made gold miners one of the most compelling stories in today’s markets, particularly against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and heightened political risk.”

GOAU at an All-Time High

For investors seeking targeted exposure to this trend, the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF ( NYSE: GOAU ) offers a rules-based approach. GOAU blends traditional gold producers with royalty and streaming companies—businesses the Company considers the “smart money” of the mining sector because they capture commodity upside without the full risks of mining operations.

“I’m pleased to share that GOAU hit a new record intraday high of $37.75 per share on Friday, September 19, approximately double the price since the start of 2025,” says Mr. Holmes. “Investors appear to be betting that the Federal Reserve is ready to start lowering interest rates, which historically has favored gold prices.”

As of June 30, 2025, GOAU held 29 companies with a weighted average market cap of $10.9 billion, including top royalty names like Wheaton Precious Metals and Franco-Nevada. By combining Smart Beta 2.0 screening with disciplined construction, the ETF seeks to capture the upside of rising gold prices while focusing on well-managed firms with sustainable profitability.

Performance data quoted above is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. For a portion of periods, the fund had expense limitations, without which returns would have been lower. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. The principal value and investment return of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance does not include the effect of any direct fees described in the fund’s prospectus which, if applicable, would lower your total returns. Performance quoted for periods of one year or less is cumulative and not annualized. Obtain performance data current to the most recent month-end at www.usfunds.com .

Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV), may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.

Because the fund concentrates its investments in specific industries, it may be subject to greater risks and fluctuations than a portfolio representing a broader range of industries. The fund is non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate a larger portion of its assets in a smaller number of issuers than a diversified fund.

The fund invests in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The fund may invest in the securities of smaller-capitalization companies, which may be more volatile than those of larger, more established companies.

Interim Clinical Study Results for Cohort 1 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study Anticipated in Q4 2025

Enrollment of the First Subject into Cohort 2 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study Expected in Q4 2025

HAYWARD, Calif., Sept. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Benitec Biopharma Inc. (NASDAQ: BNTC) (“Benitec” or “Company”), a clinical-stage, gene therapy-focused, biotechnology company developing novel genetic medicines based on its proprietary “Silence and Replace” DNA-directed RNA interference (“ddRNAi”) platform, today announced financial results for its full year ended June 30, 2025. The Company has filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

“We remain incredibly thankful for our continued close collaboration with families, clinical researchers, and healthcare providers as we advance the BB-301 clinical development program. With increasing durations of clinical follow-up for Subjects enrolled into Cohort 1 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, our enthusiasm continues to be strong for the potential to develop BB-301 as a safe and efficacious therapy for the improvement of swallowing in patients diagnosed with OPMD with dysphagia,” said Jerel A. Banks, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Benitec. “We are also grateful to have received a favorable recommendation to continue enrollment into Cohort 2 from our Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board following the safe treatment of the sixth and final Subject of Cohort 1. We look forward to beginning enrollment of Subjects into Cohort 2 of the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, as well as providing additional interim clinical study results for Cohort 1 Subjects, in the fourth calendar quarter of this year.”

Corporate Highlights

In accordance with the protocol for the BB-301 Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, a meeting of the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was convened following the completion of the 28-day post BB-301 dosing visit for the sixth Subject enrolled into Cohort 1. At the conclusion of the meeting, the DSMB formally recommended the continuation of subject enrollment into the Phase 1b/2a Treatment Study, which is expected to begin in calendar Q4 2025.

We look forward to providing additional interim clinical study results for Cohort 1 Subjects in the fourth calendar quarter of this year.

Financial Highlights

Full Year 2025 Financial Results

For the year ended June 30, 2025, the Company reported total expenses of $41.8 million compared to $22.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2024. Research and development expenses were $18.3 million in 2025, up from $15.6 million in 2024, and were primarily related to the ongoing clinical development of BB-301 for the treatment of OPMD. The increase in research and development expenses reflected the timing of contract manufacturing activities and payments associated with the OPMD Natural History and Dosing study.

General and administrative expenses totaled $23.4 million in 2025 compared to $7.0 million in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by higher share-based compensation of $14.5 million, as well as increases in legal fees of $492,000, consulting fees of $605,000, travel expenses of $219,000, and salaries and wages of $685,000.

The loss from operations for the year ended June 30, 2025, was $37.9 million compared to $21.8 million for the prior year. Net loss attributable to shareholders was $37.9 million, or $1.05 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $22.4 million, or $1.22 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $97.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.

About BB-301

BB-301 is a novel, modified AAV9 capsid expressing a unique, single bifunctional construct promoting co-expression of both codon-optimized Poly-A Binding Protein Nuclear-1 (PABPN1) and two small inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) against mutant PABPN1 (the causative gene for OPMD). The two siRNAs are modeled into microRNA backbones to silence expression of faulty mutant PABPN1, while allowing expression of the codon-optimized PABPN1 to replace the mutant with a functional version of the protein. We believe the silence and replace mechanism of BB-301 is uniquely positioned for the treatment of OPMD by halting mutant expression while providing a functional replacement protein.

,EPA,2025-09-22 21:01:45+00:00,ww2.arb.ca.gov,CARB submits scathing critique of U.S. EPA's illegal effort to overturn the endangerment finding,Not Available,,,,,https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/news/carb-submits-scathing-critique-u-s-epas-illegal-effort-overturn-endangerment-finding,"SACRAMENTO — The California Air Resources Board (CARB) today submitted comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) illegal push to end federal responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions by overturning its 2009 endangerment finding.
The comments also note that EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.
“Let’s just say the quiet part out loud: EPA’s proposal is a stunningly sloppy and amateurish effort to sow doubt where there is no doubt,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph.
In addition, EPA acknowledges that it is relying on the DOE report because it does not trust its own analysis.

The comments also note that EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.

“Let’s just say the quiet part out loud: EPA’s proposal is a stunningly sloppy and amateurish effort to sow doubt where there is no doubt,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “And EPA cannot simply repeal its own standards based on a political whim. The agency owes the American people straight, honest answers why it is proposing to carelessly risk their health, lives and property.”

CARB’s comments note that the U.S. Department of Energy report on which EPA is relying was assembled by a small group of self-described climate skeptics and is almost totally devoid of scientific evidence to support or explain how they reached their conclusions. Instead, the slim document relies on flawed, disproven assertions and data taken out of context. In addition, EPA acknowledges that it is relying on the DOE report because it does not trust its own analysis. EPA is shamelessly ceding its responsibility to another agency whose current mandate is to prop up fossil fuels at any cost, including public health.

""The Trump Administration wants you to believe that this is a battle about gas-powered cars versus electric ones. That’s a lie,"" said California's Secretary for Environmental Protection Yana Garcia. ""California is fighting for lives. Decades upon decades of science show that climate-warming gases produced by cars, trucks, power plants and gas facilities are killing people. The proof is clear—more smog, more asthma, and more emergency room visits. Instead of standing up for everyday people and businesses, Trump’s EPA is cannibalizing itself to dodge its responsibility to protect health, safety and the economy. There’s nothing patriotic about abandoning Americans.""

EPA’s proposal is also directly at odds with its own mission statement. That includes:

The promise that Americans are entitled to clean air.

National efforts to reduce environmental risk are based on the best available science.

Federal laws protecting human health and the environment are administered and enforced fairly and effectively.

By any of these measures, EPA is obligated to address greenhouse gas emissions and adopt strong standards to reduce them.

CARB also points out that beyond the scientific and documentary evidence, EPA ignores the tragic and painful experiences of thousands of Americans who’ve been severely harmed by more intense wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters made worse by climate change. The proposal also discounts the billions of dollars in economic loss sustained each year by the country and the people who live here.

CARB further points out that EPA leaves no obvious paper trail leading to the environmental impacts of its proposal and therefore provides no opportunity for informed public comment on those impacts. That is fundamental to the sound development of environmental regulations and is illegal since it turns a blind eye to EPA’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.

Standing up for science

CARB Executive Officer, Dr. Steven Cliff, testified before EPA in August noting that the DOE arguments against the endangerment finding are attempting to refute science that even 5th grade students know is true. He also pointed out that DOE’s arguments are routinely rolled out by the oil industry.

In September, CARB filed comments with DOE specifically calling out the lack of actual science in the study and refuting its misinformation and falsehoods line-by-line.

CARB is calling for EPA to stand up for science, and facts, and to drop this thinly veiled attempt to rewrite established history.",https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-22 18:00:52.297537

The Supreme Court affirmed this responsibility in 2007, ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to regulation.
Indeed, in your own confirmation hearing, you acknowledged that the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants.
It fails to meet your statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act.
Sincerely, Gavin Newsom Governor of California California’s climate leadership Pollution is down and the economy is up.","Dear Administrator Zeldin:

I write to you not only as Governor of California — the fourth largest economy in the world — but as the leader of a state whose people must live with the daily consequences of your agency’s failures.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reverse the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare is not just putting politics over evidence, it is bad policy, a dereliction of duty, a moral abdication, and a betrayal of the very mission entrusted to you.

The Clean Air Act could not be clearer: EPA has an affirmative duty to protect public health and welfare from air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. The Supreme Court affirmed this responsibility in 2007, ruling that greenhouse gases are pollutants subject to regulation. Indeed, in your own confirmation hearing, you acknowledged that the Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding recognizes that these emissions threaten the health and welfare of current and future generations. The evidence supporting this is well-documented and settled. And yet, you are now proposing to ignore binding law, overwhelming science, and lived reality.

That is not discretion — it is negligence. It is unlawful. It will cause great harm to the American people.

The cost of EPA’s surrender will be measured in human lives and economic devastation. In California alone:

Wildfires fueled by rising temperatures have killed hundreds, destroyed entire communities and tens of thousands of homes, and caused tens of billions of dollars in damages.

Extreme heat is now the deadliest climate impact, responsible for more annual deaths than wildfires and floods.

Drought has cost California’s agricultural economy billions, threatening food production nationwide and harming family farmers.

In recent years, climate-driven floods caused an estimated $5 billion in damages, devastating families and businesses alike.

Nationwide, the picture is no less dire: In 2023 alone, the United States endured 28 separate climate-driven weather disasters exceeding $1 billion in damage each — the highest number ever recorded — claiming more than 400 American lives and causing $92 billion in damages.

In the face of all that, you are suggesting that climate change doesn’t endanger us all. Seriously?

EPA’s decision to advance this proposal is not only inconsistent with science, it is inconsistent with the law. It fails to meet your statutory obligations under the Clean Air Act. It violates the principles laid out by the Supreme Court. It disregards the wealth of scientific evidence and research underlying the 2009 Endangerment Finding. And in doing so, it abdicates EPA’s responsibility to the American people.

By siding with polluters over science, EPA is telling wildfire victims to ignore the flames, flood victims to ignore the rising water, and parents of asthmatic children to ignore the dirty air that chokes their respiratory systems and takes their breath away. That is not leadership — it is an insult.

California will not stand by. We will continue to lead, because we have no choice; the lives and livelihoods of our people depend on it. But history will ask: where was the EPA — the agency created to protect Americans — when the nation faced the greatest environmental and public health crisis of our time?

You still have a choice: honor the law, follow the credible and established science, and fulfill your duty to the American people. Or go down in history as the administration that abandoned its mission, betrayed its mandate, and failed its country.

Sincerely,

Gavin Newsom

Governor of California

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 20% since 2000 – even as the state’s GDP increased 78% in that same time period as California grew to become the world’s fourth largest economy.

The state also continues to set clean energy records.

American Antimony Corporation (OTCID:XTPT), operating as Xtra Energy Corporation, is pleased to announce that Chairman & CEO, Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., has completed an on-site visit with the Company's field team at the IHX Zone, part of the flagship American Antimony Project in Nevada's historic Bernice Canyon District.

The visit focused on evaluating surface stockpiles and near-surface mineralized material across the IHX Zone and the adjacent King Solomon and Antimony King targets. During the review, the team identified and initiated further testing of approximately 6,700 tons of mineralized material at the IHX Zone, with the objective of commencing initial commercial sales of antimony ore.

Additional site visits are scheduled, during which the team will conduct inspections and volumetric assessments of the other stockpiles previously identified by the field team. These visits will also provide critical data for the permitting process required to support the timely, staged removal of the additional piles.

On-Site Assessment Highlights

Up to 6,700 Tons Targeted - Includes stockpiles identified during the 2025 drilling program and 2024 sampling campaigns.

Bulk Sampling in Progress - Representative material is being collected at the end of September to ship for mill scale recovery tests under Metallurgical Testing Agreements (MTAs) with a prospective mill partner and buyer.

3rd Party Lab Accredited Assay Results from Stockpiles: -

Antimony King: ~42.9% Sb (429,366 ppm Sb); Au 0.09 g/t; Ag 6.6 g/t; As 148 ppm

King Solomon: ~24.7% Sb (247,431 ppm Sb); Au 0.22 g/t; Ag 23.1 g/t; As 125 ppm

IHX: ~2.5% Sb (24,915 ppm Sb); Au 0.06 g/t; Ag 2.7 g/t; As 226 ppm

Low-Arsenic Advantage - Confirmed consistently across drill core and surface samples, arsenic levels remain in the tens to low hundreds of ppm, supporting favorable metallurgy compared to many global peers.

Commercial Pathway - Positive metallurgy and offtake results would position the Company to finalize direct sales agreements, establishing an early revenue stream from U.S.-sourced antimony ore while broader exploration and resource definition continue.

CEO Commentary

""Our on-site review at the IHX Zone underscores that the American Antimony Project is not only a world-class exploration opportunity, but also a near-term commercial pathway,"" said Mac J. Shahsavar, P.Eng., Chairman & CEO. ""The antimony at IHX sits near the canyon entrance, making it readily accessible for shipment and processing. This oxidized surface stockpile is rich in stibnite, and further testing, validation, and permitting to lift up to 6,700 tons of material represent the next step in proving we can deliver clean, U.S.-sourced antimony to the market. This initiative is designed to enhance shareholder value by advancing early revenue generation while simultaneously expanding the Project's long-term resource base.""

Strategic Importance

Antimony is a federally designated critical mineral, essential for:

Defense applications (munitions, armor, flame-retardant systems)

Semiconductors and battery technologies

Energy storage and industrial alloys

With the United States currently 100% import-reliant on foreign antimony-primarily from China and Russia - the American Antimony Project is one of the few emerging domestic supply sources capable of strengthening U.S. critical mineral independence.

This update demonstrates that American Antimony Corporation is executing a dual-track strategy: near-term commercialization of high-grade stockpiles alongside long-term expansion of a district-scale antimony resource in Nevada.

Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract.
Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction?
The effects of climate change are in every continent.
What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change?","Climate debates often focus on the world’s largest economies and biggest emitters. But the work of adapting to a hotter planet is happening in countries that have contributed little to the problem but are nevertheless exposed to its consequences.

I spoke with six world leaders from these places and heard some common themes — the ravages of extreme weather, the difficulties posed by the Trump administration’s retreat. (The president withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement and denies the existence of climate change.)

But the conversations, which you can see in full, also show how varied environmental predicaments can be. Some of the interviews, condensed and edited, are here:

Talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by? Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel that the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? It is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? We have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

The Marshall Islands

This country, made from islands and reefs in the Pacific Ocean, is a few feet above sea level. Each year, the challenges grow. Mosquito-borne diseases have spread because of more frequent rainfall. Tuna — an economic backbone — are leaving for cooler parts of the Pacific. The water is rising. “We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part,” says President Hilda Heine, who has spent her career sounding the alarm.

What do developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that.

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation.

How much do you think international efforts on climate action have succeeded? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”

At The Times’s Climate Forward conference this week, we’ll hear from world leaders, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and activists like the actor Rainn Wilson. Sign up for the livestream here.

The Pentagon said on Friday that it would forbid journalists who cover the military from reporting any information that had not been authorized in advance for release. Eric Schmitt, who has spent 35 years covering national security for The Times, recounts some of the stories that might never have come to light under a policy like this.

Rigorous reporting on national security often relies on facts that are not publicly known. One of the most important parts of our job is to shine light on classified programs and operations that the American people need to know about. Some examples:

Caribbean boat strikes. My colleagues and I revealed in August that Trump had secretly authorized military force against certain drug cartels. Since then, U.S. strikes against suspected drug boats have killed at least 17 people.

Pentagon Papers. The Times published top-secret documents in 1971 showing how four presidential administrations deceived the public about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Nixon White House tried to stop their publication, leading to the court showdown you probably learned about in high-school history class.

Botched mission in North Korea. In 2019, Trump authorized a secret operation to spy on Kim Jong-un. Earlier this month, my colleagues were the first to report on it — and how it failed, leaving unarmed North Koreans dead. These military failures are often kept under wraps, leading the public to underestimate the extreme risks that American forces undertake.

We’ve published thousands more stories based on confidential information. It’s how The Times has done some of its most important reporting: on WikiLeaks, the Iraq War, N.S.A. wiretapping and more.

OPINIONS

Trump prefers his personal relationships to guide diplomacy. But in doing so, he risks misjudging his counterparts’ intentions, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Keren Yarhi-Milo write.

“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the U.S. administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” said Revolution Wind spokesperson Meaghan Wims in a statement.

Revolution Wind, along with the nearby Sunrise Wind and SouthCoast Wind projects, were perceived as relatively safe from federal interference under the second Trump administration.
This is a huge win not just for Revolution Wind, but for offshore wind projects up and down the East Coast that are being targeted by Trump.”","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Revolution Wind will be allowed to continue to build offshore wind turbines, thanks to a preliminary injunction granted to the company by a federal judge on Monday.

Judge Royce C. Lamberth, first appointed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by Ronald Reagan in 1987, issued a stay on the stop-work order on the project imposed by the federal Department of the Interior on Aug. 22.

“Revolution Wind has demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of its underlying claims, it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction, the balance of the equities is in its favor and maintaining the status quo by granting the injunction is in the public interest,” wrote Lamberth in his order.

Pending the outcome of its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Revolution Wind parent company Ørsted will be allowed to continue construction of its wind farm, which the company estimated prior to the stop-work order was 80% complete.

“Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the U.S. administration and other stakeholders toward a prompt resolution,” said Revolution Wind spokesperson Meaghan Wims in a statement. “Revolution Wind will resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as a top priority.”

The stop-work order took Ørsted – and Rhode Island officials – by surprise last month after it was issued by the acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the agency within the federal Department of the Interior that oversees offshore wind lease areas and production.

The $5 billion, 65-turbine wind project 20 miles off the Rhode Island coast had been on track to supply renewable electricity to Rhode Island and Connecticut by 2027, but the stop-word order presented major disruptions, including the loss of specialized equipment and some union labor.

The Trump administration has not hidden its hostility to offshore wind projects, despite Revolution Wind originally obtaining federal approval from BOEM in early 2020 during the president’s first term.

Revolution Wind, along with the nearby Sunrise Wind and SouthCoast Wind projects, were perceived as relatively safe from federal interference under the second Trump administration. All three projects had their major federal permits already in hand, with the Biden administration issuing its final major permit approval for SouthCoast Wind just days before Trump’s inauguration.

Rhode Island needs the Revolution Wind project if it’s going to meet its renewable energy goals and reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with electricity consumption. Around 18.6% of all emissions produced in R.I. stem from resident and business consumption of electricity, most of which comes from natural gas-fired power plants located outside of the state.

Rhode Island’s Act on Climate requires the state to reduce its GHG emissions by 45% under 1990 levels by the end of this decade, a benchmark which becomes far more impossible to achieve without a major renewable energy generator supplying electricity to the state.

In a joint press conference with the entire state Congressional delegation and labor leaders held days after the stop-work order was issued, Gov. Dan McKee said the order would endanger union jobs in Rhode Island and threaten a committed source of renewable electricity the state was relying on to meet its energy needs and goals.

“J-O-B-S, jobs,” said McKee at the Aug. 25 press conference. “That’s what at stake in Rhode Island without this project.”

Just last week, on Sept 17, attorneys general from Rhode Island and Connecticut filed a 47-page motion in District Court arguing the project was almost complete, and without a stay the company faced “unsustainabe losses” from the stop-work order.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong had filed their own lawsuit in District Court against the Trump administration over its stop-work order to the Revolution Wind project.

In a release issued Monday, Neronha celebrated the preliminary injunction, saying it was a win for Rhode Island’s workers and families.

“This president cannot cancel clean energy projects just because he believes doing so is politically expedient for him,” said Neronha. “Indeed, the outcome here bodes well for our case in Rhode Island. Judge Lamberth’s decision to grant Ørsted’s motion aligns with our argument that this administration’s attempt to undermine the clean energy industry while eliminating thousands of union jobs is both arbitrary and capricious – in simpler terms, it came without warning, reason, or legal basis.”

Christian Roselund, who leads the Yes to Wind campaign for Climate Action Rhode Island, said Monday, “Trump is not a God, or a king. His administration often issues illegal orders, and they can be stopped. This is a huge win not just for Revolution Wind, but for offshore wind projects up and down the East Coast that are being targeted by Trump.”",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Yes-to-Wind.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 18:00:18.196015

More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.
His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.
Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first, large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.
Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.","A federal judge ruled Monday that a nearly complete offshore wind project halted by the administration can resume, dealing President Donald Trump a setback in his ongoing effort to restrict the industry.

Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut has been paused since Aug. 22 when the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop work order for what it said were national security concerns. It did not specify those concerns at the time. Both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts.

Danish energy company Orsted and its joint venture partner Skyborn Renewables sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that would allow them to move forward with the project.

Judge Royce Lamberth held a hearing on that request Monday. Lamberth said he considered how Revolution Wind has relied on its federal approval, the delays are costing $2.3 million a day and if the project can’t meet deadlines, the entire enterprise could collapse. After December, the specialized ship needed to complete the project won’t be available until at least 2028, he said. More than 1,000 people have been working on the wind farm, which is 80% complete.

“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,” Lamberth said, as he granted the motion for the preliminary injunction.

The Interior Department has said that the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Orsted said Monday that construction will resume as soon as possible.

WATCH: Economic fallout mounts as Trump halts near-finished wind power project

On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the offshore wind industry as soon as he returned to the White House. He wants to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change, in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says.

His administration has stopped construction on major offshore wind farms, revoked wind energy permits and paused permitting, canceled plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopped $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

Revolution Wind is supposed to be Rhode Island’s and Connecticut’s first, large offshore wind farm, capable of providing about 2.5% of the region’s electricity needs.

Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said the judge’s ruling is a major win for workers and families, who need this project on track now so it can start to drive down unaffordable energy bills.

Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney, a Democrat, said a multibillion-dollar project that is 80% complete and was fully permitted with input by the Pentagon is not a national security problem. The Interior Department “should take the hint and let the thousands of construction workers finish the job,” he said.

Orsted began construction in 2024 about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the Rhode Island coast. It says in its complaint that about $5 billion has been spent or committed, and it expects more than $1 billion in costs if the project is canceled. Rhode Island is already home to one offshore wind farm, the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm.

The competition also is, you know, either a Chinese domiciled company that is now facing restrictions next year in terms of what what they can sell here. And so that company stands out as as a potential winner, you know, very, very near term. There's dynamics going on with what I would say is, you know, uh call it call it uh a garage sale of of solar panels to get ahead of some of the restrictions that are coming in place next year, but um, you know, starting next year, I think first solar looks starts to look really really attractive.

Are they capacity constrained at all? Can they make enough to keep up with the demand that we're seeing, you know, out next year?

Yeah, so they're on the domestic supply piece, they're actually sold out through 2028. Now, they have opportunities to bring more manufacturing capacity into the US. You know, they they manufacture in in Southeast Asia and they're, you know, I think at least they're going to shift uh a line over to the United States so they'd, you know, within a year or so they'd potentially have more more supply on that can can they can sell.

Now, um in nuclear and we should mention you don't cover the sort of big legacy power generators that have the older nuclear plants. There aren't many choices on the new nuclear side. You cover NuScale. I think that if I'm not mistaken, that's the only one.

GE Vernova. Because they supply. Yeah. Well, they they have a nuclear plant as well, an SMR be it's called the BWRX 300. So it's it's sort of a a shrunk down size of the call it old school traditional traditional nuke. And you know, I guess from my perspective it's it's a huge opportunity. I mean what's available today, you know, NuScale has done arguably the best job getting into a position where they can sell a nuclear plant today. They went to there's, you know, the regulatory commission that that governs these things and they have approvals that say, hey, these, you know, the NRCs has reviewed all our docs. It takes many, many years, but they reviewed all the docs. They've agreed that this is safe and it's it's ready to go today. And I think from a company that's, you know, new to the market, that's a huge vote of confidence and you can take that to a potential customer and sell it.

And yet you're sector perform on NuScale.

Yeah. So and I think this really just comes down to more, you know, expectations around timelines and nuclear development takes a long time and, you know, even though NuScale has a, you know, design approval from the NRC, it still takes call it five, six years to build one of these. And, you know, our our opinion is that they'll get the the initial one green lit and they'll start construction, but then what happens over that time are are, you know, new investors and and new customers comfortable coming in and buying plant number two, plant number three, while the first one's still undergoing construction and, you know, one of the biggest risks in in this industry is, uh, you know, these developments cost two times as much as they're supposed to and they take three years longer. And so there is this sort of proof process that I think has to go on for for them and everyone else in the industry where they need to show that they're on time and on budget.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WAClrtCKzEkUdmPBQo3BTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/1487f8c0-93e3-11f0-aafc-b7b60164001c,N,,2025-09-22 20:00:27.916397

Newsom can't spin up the electric vehicle rebate program on his own; it would have required legislative action amid a large budget deficit.
The governor's pullback means that Sept. 30 will, indeed, mark the end of an era for Californians who want to purchase electric vehicles.","Gov. Gavin Newsom signed six energy and climate bills in San Francisco on Friday morning, after delivering an impassioned speech about the need for California to counter the ""environmental injury"" of President Donald Trump's federal government while also making life cheaper for state residents.

One pocketbook issue, though, was conspicuously absent from Newsom's speech and legislation. In November, the governor pledged that he would replace the federal government's electric vehicle purchasing credit with a state version, should Trump cancel the $7,500-per-new-car benefit. Trump did so, meaning electric vehicles will become much more expensive for Americans after Sept. 30. Now, it turns out that relief isn't actually on its way for Californians - Newsom said Friday that his administration won't be replacing the popular rebates.

""We can't make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits,"" Newsom told reporters at a brief press conference. He said state funds were instead being spent on physical infrastructure, and pointed to the tens of thousands of public electric vehicle chargers built in the state.

""There are billions and billions of dollars through 2045 in the cap-and-trade program that continue to make those infrastructure investments, but not the direct subsidies - that we cannot make up for - that were eliminated under the federal program,"" the governor said.

Newsom can't spin up the electric vehicle rebate program on his own; it would have required legislative action amid a large budget deficit. But the remarks are a complete turnaround from November, when his office published a news release saying, ""Governor Newsom commits to restarting state's [zero emission vehicle] rebate program if federal tax credit is eliminated,"" and pointing to the cap-and-trade program - extended in Friday's bill-signing - as a likely source of funds.

The governor's pullback means that Sept. 30 will, indeed, mark the end of an era for Californians who want to purchase electric vehicles. Trump and congressional Republicans, with the summer's so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" eliminated the credits that Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act had offered through 2032. The federal tax credits are worth up to $7,500 for a new car and $4,000 for a used car, bringing electric vehicles closer to price parity with gas cars and boosting their sale across the United States. But they won't be available come October.

California used to have its own version of the credit, the ""Clean Vehicle Rebate Project,"" which Newsom's team pointed to as a success story in the November news release. The program launched in 2010 and closed in 2023, after spending $1.49 billion across nearly 600,000 vehicles.

In July, a coalition of electric vehicle companies wrote to Newsom and a few of his agency heads asking that they enact state credits, to ""provide a stabilizing counterforce to recent federal shocks to the ZEV industry."" But it'll be gas companies pleased with the governor's Friday signings; he OK'd more oil drilling in Kern County as part of the package.

Trump's electric vehicle credit cuts aren't the only damage the federal government has done to California's ambitions in the industry this year; the U.S. Senate voted in May to block the state's push to ban new gas-powered car sales by 2035.

Newsom sounded optimistic Friday even as he doused hopes for a rebate program. He said that California now has more public chargers than gas nozzles, and he pointed to subsidies that helped Tesla and other companies grow, praising the state's electric vehicle progress: ""We've created an ecosystem and we've created a market. Ask Elon Musk.""

What the Bill Does

The GRID Power Act passed narrowly in the House, 216–206. The legislation directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to allow grid operators—including transmission providers, Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), and Independent System Operators (ISOs)—to fast-track dispatchable energy projects through the grid’s interconnection queue.

Supporters argue this change will help get critical baseload projects online faster, address shortages caused by retiring power plants, and better support the nation’s rising demand for electricity.

Balderson’s Push for Reliability

Rep. Troy Balderson (R-Ohio), who introduced the bill, said the measure is designed to prevent a looming reliability crisis.

“With American power demand far outpacing our ability to generate more electricity, our grid is heading toward a reliability crisis,” Balderson stated after the vote.

He emphasized that the bill would clear the backlog of projects and provide grid operators with tools to bring new power online quickly. According to Balderson, the legislation ensures operators can still conduct feasibility and system-impact studies before approving interconnection agreements.

Oklahoma Delegation’s Support

Reps. Stephanie Bice, Josh Brecheen, Tom Cole, Kevin Hern, and Frank Lucas all voted in favor of the bill. Their support signals Oklahoma’s alignment with efforts to prioritize reliability and dispatchable energy—sources such as natural gas, coal, and nuclear that can run continuously—over intermittent renewable projects waiting in line.

What Happens Next with GRID Power Act

The bill faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats and clean energy advocates have expressed opposition. They argue the legislation undercuts renewable expansion at a time when the U.S. needs more low-carbon energy sources to meet climate goals.

For now, the GRID Power Act’s passage in the House reflects a growing debate in Washington over how to balance grid reliability with the push for renewable energy growth.",,N,,2025-09-22 17:02:39.307209

Ferguson declared that every Maryland household will receive two bill credits equivalent to about $40 per utility bill. The Senate president said the first credit is expected to come as the summer closes and another in the cold months, around January or February, as heating bills are expected to be high.

This announcement comes after Moore signed legislation in 2023 to allow more eligibility for energy assistance. Automatic eligibility is allowed for those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or who receive income-based veterans benefits.

ELECTRICITY PRICES ROSE FURTHER IN AUGUST AS TRUMP BLAMES RENEWABLES

The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power.

Department officials initially cited other measures in place and repeated Prime Minister Mark Carney’s talking points, but eventually shared some data when pressed further.

Megan Nichols, one of five officials answering questions, said scrapping the consumer carbon price would add three megatonnes of emissions in 2030, while the impact of suspending the EV mandate for 2026 had not yet been calculated.

The questions came after federal ministers refused in recent weeks to commit to Canada’s 2030 emission reduction targets, and after the release of a Canadian Climate Institute report that suggested Canada’s 2030 target is now out of reach.

What you need to know: CalEPA Secretary Yana Garcia is at Climate Week NYC, underscoring the state’s global leadership on climate action and its resolve to maintain a sense of urgency despite federal attacks and rollbacks.

Sacramento – California’s leader for environmental protection, Secretary Yana Garcia, today joins fellow state officials, international delegates and global climate experts at Climate Week NYC. Her participation reaffirms California’s ongoing and decisive leadership in accelerating bold action amid the Trump Administration’s denial of science and incessant attacks on climate and economic progress.

“Climate threats are real. Hotter days, drier droughts and more devastating wildfires are making that clearer than ever,” said CalEPA Secretary Garcia. “California has long been out front on setting ambitious climate goals and staying the course to reach them. Armed with science and like-minded partners, we are keeping our focus squarely on fighting the long-term effects of climate change to protect health and wellbeing. Climbing to the fourth largest economy in the world proves that protecting people from environmental harm and economic innovation go hand in hand.”

While in New York, Secretary Garcia will participate in several convenings to share California’s leadership and expertise on climate policy. The state continues to invest in programs and policies that reduce pollution while driving clean economies:

Last week, Governor Newsom signed a historic package of climate and energy affordability legislation, including the extension the state’s Cap-and-Invest program (formerly Cap-and-Trade) to 2045, a timeline that aligns with the state’s world-leading carbon neutrality targets.

Nearly $33 billion has been raised from polluters to fund climate solutions in communities across the state with money from the state’s Cap-and-Invest program over the past 10+ years. These investments have delivered more than a half a million projects across the state, supporting over 122,000 jobs and cutting millions of tons of carbon emissions.Of the $12.8 billion already implemented, $9.2 billion has benefitted priority populations.

California leads the nation in transportation decarbonization. In June 2025, Governor Newsom signed an executive order reaffirming the state’s commitment to ZEV deployment and initiating the development of the Advanced Clean Cars III regulation to advance new strategies for emissions reduction and spur innovation. In August, state agencies released a report that charts a path to expand clean and ZEV adoption across all vehicle types, protect public health and maintain the state’s momentum in the face of federal rollbacks.

In 2025, California announced a major milestone — 67% of the state’s retail electricity sales came from renewable and zero-carbon electricity generation — compared to just 61% the previous year and around 41% a decade ago.

With more than 545,000 clean energy jobs, California is first in the U.S. for total renewable energy generation jobs and first for overall clean energy jobs.

Pollution is down and the economy is up. California’s greenhouse gas emissions are down 20% since 2000, while the state’s GDP increased 78% in the same timeframe.

This week, California is continuing its collaboration with global leaders to reduce pollution around the world. The state has built a decades-long legacy of forming partnerships that drive emission reductions and strengthen climate commitments among national and regional governments. Recent examples include:

In August 2025, in their continued partnership, California and Denmark signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Governor Gavin Newsom and Ambassador of Denmark to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen supporting green economy resilience, technology and innovation.

In May 2025, CARB and the Republic of Panama entered into a partnership on carbon pricing programs and climate investments.

In March 2025, California signed a new partnership with Sonora Governor Alfonso Durazo Montaño advancing cross-border action for cleaner air and clean energy.

While many RVs on the road feature lavish interiors and well-appointed exteriors, the fuel efficiency piece of the puzzle is often missing. That may be set to change with Entegra’s release of the Embark, the world’s first range-extended electric Class A motorhome.

Watt a concept

Enetgra, a subsidiary of the THOR Industries RV empire, has spent the past five years developing electrification tech fit for the demands of an RV. The result is the Embark, a first-of-its-kind prototype Class A motorhome that delivers up to 450 miles of range.

It’s important to note that the concept RV is not fully electric: its enhanced range is thanks to the low emission gasoline range extender, which recharges the ample electric battery system.

However, an impressive note is that the Embark is capable of 105 miles of range on electric battery alone, which is ideal for day trips.

The cutting-edge, range-extended electric chassis, manufactured by Harbinger Motors (which counts THOR Industries as an investor) delivers an 800V electrical infrastructure (powered by a center-mounted 140-kWh battery pack) for unparalleled performance.

Power on

The battery packs are mounted low, which improves the overall handling of the motorhome.

Entegra says the EV drivetrain “delivers instant torque, reduced sway and a quieter ride” — which, if you’ve ever driven an RV, is a definite upgrade from traditional models.

The system also allows for rapid charging at DC Fast Charger locations, which means less time stationary, and more time hitting the open road.

The batteries can also be charged at traditional camping sites or at home, offering greater flexibility to adventurers.

Speaking of home — the Embark is so powerful, it can be used as a mobile energy backup system to power your house in case of emergency. Pretty nifty.

Availability and pricing

The Embark electric motorhome concept is on display at the Elkhart Dealer Open House, the largest dealer event in North America, starting today in Elkhart, Indiana.

While pricing has not yet been announced, the Embark is expected to go into full production beginning next year. You can contact Entegra Coach for more info.

Carbon Management Innovations: From Capture to Value Creation

The ethanol industry's decarbonization efforts are no longer limited to reducing emissions; they now include capturing and repurposing carbon. Gevo, for instance, has pioneered Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) technologies to produce SAF from non-food industrial corn. Its SAF, compliant with ASTM D7566 standards, has demonstrated the ability to operate at 100% SAF in test flightsGevo HAUSH Ltd. SAF development[ 1 ]. Gevo's integration of blockchain-based carbon tracking and regenerative agriculture further solidifies its position as a “carbon-aware fuels company.”

Meanwhile, Summit Agricultural Group's partnership with Honeywell to develop an ethanol-to-jet facility through its Summit Next Gen platform is addressing the aviation sector's urgent need for scalable SAF solutionsSummit Agricultural Group and Honeywell partnership[ 4 ]. This initiative aligns with global SAF demand projections, which are expected to surge as airlines face stricter emissions regulations.

Financial Performance and Investment Potential

While strategic partnerships and innovations are reshaping the industry, financial performance remains a key metric for investors. Gevo's Q2 2025 results, which showed a net profit of $0.01 per share and $43.41 million in revenue, reflect the company's momentum in SAF developmentADM and Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline[ 5 ]. Analysts have upgraded their price targets, with UBS Group raising its estimate to $2.25 per shareADM and Wolf Carbon Solutions pipeline[ 5 ].

Conclusion: A Carbon-Neutral Future Within Reach

The ethanol industry's transition to a low-carbon economy is being accelerated by strategic collaborations and technological breakthroughs. Companies like Gevo,

, ADM, and Petrobras are not only reducing emissions but also creating new revenue streams through SAF, carbon credits, and carbon-negative products. As the market grows at a CAGR of 3.37% through 2030 , investors should prioritize firms that combine innovation with scalable partnerships. The ethanol sector's ability to align with global decarbonization goals while delivering financial returns makes it a compelling investment opportunity in the energy transition.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758547731755.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-22 16:04:26.944011

PHOENIX – Attorney General Kris Mayes today joined a coalition of 23 attorneys general and seven counties and cities in filing a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed recission of its landmark 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions, including from motor vehicles, drive climate change and endanger public health and welfare. That finding is known as the Endangerment Finding.

""EPA’s proposed repeal of the Endangerment Finding is wrong on the science and is unlawful,"" said Attorney General Mayes. ""The EPA is obligated to consider the costs of climate change by using rigorous, peer-reviewed methods. Instead, EPA is proposing to bury its head in the sand and ignore the mounting costs of climate change for all Americans, including devastating impacts to health and safety.""

Last month, the Trump Administration announced its proposal to rescind that 2009 Endangerment Finding, claiming that EPA lacks authority to regulate air pollution that contributes to climate change and eliminating all existing EPA vehicle greenhouse gas emission standards in one fell swoop. In August, Attorney General Mayes testified before EPA in opposition to the agency’s proposed rescission of its landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that drives climate change and endangers public health and welfare.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the direct result of the landmark 2007 Supreme Court opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA, which confirmed EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that threaten public health and welfare. In direct response to that opinion, and after more than two years of scientific review, EPA determined in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that harms public health and welfare in numerous ways.

As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NAS) confirmed just last week, “EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” EPA’s new proposal, which relies on a flawed, unlawful, and unfinished report issued by the Department of Energy’s Climate Working Group, seeks to reverse that finding with no grounding in law or science.

Today’s comment letter is just one way that Attorney General Mayes and the coalition have recently fought back against EPA’s dangerous proposal.

2009 Endangerment Finding Comment Letter

In their 225-page letter submitted to the EPA today, the coalition argues that rescinding the 2009 Endangerment Finding would violate settled law, Supreme Court precedent, and scientific consensus, endangering the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans, particularly those in communities disproportionately impacted by environmental harms.

Scientific research has proven that every region of our country is experiencing the ongoing and significant harms of climate change and motor vehicle pollution, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise. Extreme summer heat, driven by climate change, is leading to increased rates of heat-related illness and death, particularly among vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, low-income individuals, and workers. Increasing rates of natural disasters – like wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts – not only have a devastating effect on public health and safety, but on state and local economies as well.

Not only does EPA’s proposed recission ignore those facts, which are backed by robust climate science, but it also violates EPA’s legal obligations under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change. The coalition argues that EPA’s new legal interpretations are fundamentally inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and binding Supreme Court precedent, and that the proposal would mark a drastic reversal of its own longstanding findings without any explanation grounded in science. To make matters worse, the Climate Working Group report on which EPA relies is procedurally and substantively flawed, yet EPA blindly accepts its findings and disregards the scientific consensus, which was just reaffirmed by NAS last week.

In filing this comment letter, the coalition urges EPA to abandon its unlawful and unsupported proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

Joining AG Mayes in filing this comment letter, which was co-led by the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York, were the attorneys general of Colorado, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin; the Cities of Chicago, New York, and Oakland; the City and County of Denver; and the Counties of Martin Luther King Jr., California and Santa Clara, California.

Motor Vehicles Comment Letter

In withdrawing the 2009 Endangerment Finding, EPA also proposes to repeal all existing federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for all motor vehicle classes and all years. In a second letter submitted to the EPA today, which was joined by AG Mayes, the coalition explains that this proposed, unprecedented disruption to the regulatory landscape of the last fifteen years will be catastrophic for the States and Local Governments’ residents, industries, natural resources, and public investments. For instance, EPA projected last year that current motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards would prevent more than 8 billion metric tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions over the next 30 years, avoiding $1.82 trillion in climate harms. If those reductions from the federal motor vehicle greenhouse gas program alone were the emissions of a country, that country would rank 33rd on a list of the world’s top emitters.

A robust regulatory program for greenhouse gas emissions is also crucial to vehicle affordability, consumer choice, and the success of the American automotive industry. The greenhouse gas program for vehicles spurs automakers to innovate and create better cars, saving drivers hundreds of billions of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs, and helps support domestic manufacturing and jobs. Repealing that program, as EPA now proposes, will shutter factories, kill jobs, and wipe out billions of dollars in investments by Congress, States, and local governments to keep the American auto industry thriving and globally competitive. The best way to support drivers and auto workers, while also helping the planet, is to continue promoting innovation in the most cutting-edge vehicle technologies.

Climate Working Group Comment Letter

On September 2nd, AG Mayes joined a coalition of 22 attorneys general, three cities, and two counties in filing a comment letter opposing the CWG report that EPA relied on in its proposed recission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

In that comment letter, the coalition identified numerous procedural and substantive legal flaws in the Climate Working Group report. In creating the Climate Working Group, the Department of Energy selected five widely known climate change skeptics, ignored well-established scientific integrity standards, and failed to comply with Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) procedures, which require the disclosure of all committee-related records and that committee meetings be open to the public.

The report – written in less than two months and riddled with inaccuracies, factual omissions, and mischaracterizations of irrefutable climate science research – attempts to critique decades of peer-reviewed scientific research establishing that the emission of greenhouse gases causes climate change and endangers public health and welfare.

In filing the comment letter, the coalition urged the Department of Energy to withdraw the unlawful and misguided Climate Working Group report.

Infinity Two is a first-generation 350 MWe baseload power plant utilizing Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology. The parties argue that stellarator is currently the only fusion technology to have demonstrated “stable, steady-state operation” with high efficiency. Type One Energy is developing Infinity Two using today’s existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support near-term deployment of the technology. The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce.

TVA retired the coal-fired Bull Run Fossil Plant in December 2023, as part of its effort to fully retire its coal fleet by 2030.

“TVA is a leader in pursuing advanced nuclear technologies we need to power America’s economic prosperity and fuel artificial intelligence, quantum computing and advanced manufacturing,” said Don Moul, TVA President and CEO. “We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies, and I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley. Our region is building a nuclear ecosystem that provides good jobs and opportunities for the people of the Valley.”

“We are really honored to be working with TVA on the world’s first private sector fusion power plant project,” said Christofer Mowry, Type One Energy’s CEO. “TVA is a best-in-class energy utility that knows how to build, operate, and maintain complex power generation technologies. This LOI with TVA, and the role it establishes for Type One Energy as the fusion technology provider for their Infinity Two project, is therefore fully aligned with our goal of pursuing the lowest-risk approach to commercializing fusion energy.”

Final decisions and definitive agreements regarding the funding and construction of Infinity Two, as well as any agreements to purchase the energy output, are subject to TVA Board approval, regulatory review, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes and American energy dominance strategy.

In February 2024, Type One Energy entered into a cooperative agreement with TVA to jointly develop plans for a potential TVA fusion power plant project in the Tennessee Valley region using Type One Energy stellarator fusion power technology. Infinity Two could offer a complementary source of base load electrical generation for the region as early as the mid-2030s, the parties claim.

The cooperative agreement expands on Project Infinity, first launched by Type One Energy, TVA, and the U.S. DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in early 2024, with support from the state of Tennessee. Originally centered on deploying the Type One Energy Infinity One stellarator prototype in TVA’s Bull Run power plant, the parties say Project Infinity now encompasses a “deeper, broader engagement” toward commercialization of fusion energy. TVA and Type One Energy will collaborate on Infinity Two fusion power plant siting studies, environmental reviews, and licensing, as well as development of project plans and financing from various sources. Type One Energy will support TVA in its evaluation and review of the project.

Nuclear fusion occurs when two atoms combine to form a single atom. The combined atom has less mass than the original two atoms, with large amounts of energy released in the process. Getting energy from fusion – the process that powers the sun and stars – has been a great challenge on Earth. Scientists have been trying to replicate it as far back as the 1930s.

While there have been breakthroughs at the lab level, many experts’ believe it will take multiple decades for nuclear fusion to generate large-scale energy.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/cat-bulldozer.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 16:03:33.228751

These four actions build on the numerous actions the Adams administration has taken to protect New Yorkers from the effects of climate change.","NEW YORK – The City of New York today announced that — as part of a coalition of dozens of cities, counties, and states from across the nation — it has filed three comment letters opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed reversal of its 2009 “Endangerment Finding.” The landmark 2009 finding holds that greenhouse gas emissions — including those from motor vehicles — drive climate change and endanger public health and welfare. The new proposal — issued on August 1, 2025 — would deny the EPA’s authority to regulate harmful air pollution that contributes to climate change, harms public health, and would eliminate all existing EPA vehicle emission standards.

Additionally, earlier this month, the City of New York and a coalition of 19 attorneys general filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Environmental Defense Fund v. Wright, supporting the plaintiffs in a case challenging the authority of the Climate Working Group, convened by the U.S. Department of Energy in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act requirements, to prepare a report that purports to undermine the scientific consensus on climate change.

This announcement builds on the work the Adams administration has done to address climate change and comes at the start of “Climate Week NYC,” the world’s biggest climate event of its kind. In 2024, Mayor Adams introduced the city’s first-ever climate budgeting publication through the city’s Fiscal Year 2025 Executive Budget. Climate budgeting is a process that incorporates science-based climate considerations into the city’s budget decision-making process by evaluating how actions and spending today contribute to meeting longer-term climate targets and needs. New York City is the first big city in the United States to adopt climate budgeting, joining other global cities, such as London, Oslo, and Mumbai, to utilize the process.

“New York City is no stranger to the devastating effects of natural disasters. With more extreme weather events hitting the five boroughs more often, for our safety and to protect our economy, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change, including by putting in place stronger federal regulations of greenhouse gases,” said Mayor Adams. “Attempts to undermine this scientific consensus should not be the basis for undoing important regulations that mitigate future environmental damage that threatens lives, brings harm to our communities, and hampers our economies. We are proud to stand with our partners from across the nation in taking multiple actions supporting long-held scientific findings that protect against environmental disasters in our communities.”

“More than a decade ago, the EPA formally determined that greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of the American people, and that emissions from motor vehicles and engines contribute to the greenhouse gas pollution that threatens public health and welfare,” said New York City Corporation Counsel Muriel Goode-Trufant. “Now, over the span of a few months, the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA have sought to manufacture a basis to reject this overwhelming scientific consensus, endangering all Americans and all New Yorkers.”

The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the direct result of the landmark 2007 U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Massachusetts v. EPA, which confirmed the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions that threaten public health and welfare. In direct response to that opinion, and after more than two years of scientific review, the EPA determined, in 2009, that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that harm public health and welfare.

Increasing rates of natural disasters — like wildfires, hurricanes, flooding, and droughts — not only have a devastating effect on public health and safety, but on state and local economies as well.

Climate change poses existential risks to New Yorkers’ health and safety. Sea level rise in New York City is putting communities and infrastructure at risk of regular flooding. Extreme weather events — such as Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and Hurricane Ida in 2021 — can result in injury and loss of life due to exposure, interrupted utility service, or lack of access to emergency services. Additionally, warming temperatures exacerbate or introduce health problems. On average, more than 500 New Yorkers die prematurely because of extreme heat in New York City each year.

Not only does the EPA’s proposed reversal ignore those facts, but it also violates the EPA’s legal obligations under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to address climate change.

The coalition argues, in today’s letter, that the EPA’s new legal interpretations are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and binding Supreme Court precedent, and that the proposal would mark a drastic reversal of its own longstanding findings without any explanation grounded in science.

Regulatory enforcement for greenhouse gas emissions is also crucial to vehicle affordability, consumer choice, and to the success of the American automotive industry. The greenhouse gas program for vehicles incentivizes automakers to innovate and create better cars, saving drivers hundreds of billions of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs, and helps support domestic manufacturing and jobs. Repealing that program, as the EPA now proposes, will shutter factories, kill jobs, and wipe out billions of dollars in investments by Congress, states, and local governments to keep the American auto industry thriving and globally competitive.

Climate Working Group Comment Letter

Earlier this month, on September 2, the City of New York joined another coalition of 27 localities from around the nation in filing a comment letter opposing the Climate Working Group report that EPA relied on in its proposed recission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

In that comment letter, the coalition identified several legal flaws in the Climate Working Group report. In creating the Climate Working Group, the U.S. Department of Energy selected five widely known climate change skeptics, ignored well-established scientific integrity standards, and failed to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s procedures, which require the disclosure of all committee-related records and that committee meetings be open to the public.

Climate Working Group Amicus Brief

On August 29, the City of New York and 19 attorneys general from around the nation filed an amicus brief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts in Environmental Defense Fund v. Wright, supporting the plaintiffs in their effort to declare the Climate Working Group’s report unlawful.

In their brief, the coalition argued that the Department of Energy violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act by establishing and utilizing the Climate Working Group, and that this violation will harm state and local governments’ strong interest in ensuring that the federal government rely on the best available science to guide its climate policy decisions. In New York City, the New York City Panel on Climate Change uses federal climate data to develop its own reports and mapping tools, which inform many city policies, including the Climate Resilience Design Guidelines and zoning rules related to current and future flood conditions.

On September 17, the district court held that the federal government is not exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

Joining the City of New York in filing this amicus brief were the attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

In addition to the actions described above, Elijah Hutchinson, Executive Director of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Climate and Environmental Justice, testified before EPA on August 21 to oppose its proposed recission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding and motor vehicle greenhouse gas standards.

These four actions build on the numerous actions the Adams administration has taken to protect New Yorkers from the effects of climate change. Just last week, Mayor Adams broke ground on a $218 million public safety project to protect Red Hook from coastal flooding and save hundreds of millions of dollars for residents in lost property costs. And, as announced in the Mayor’s Management Report last week, in Fiscal Year 2025, the city saw major environmental gains and savings, largely due to composting and recycling. Overall recycling tonnage increased 4 percent, and the diversion rate of recyclables rose for a third consecutive year to 21.8 percent, the highest since Fiscal Year 2011. Tons of refuse disposed to landfills decreased to the lowest level in at least 15 years, largely due to the tons of organic waste that were diverted, which increased nearly 29 percent. In 2023, Mayor Adams celebrated the passage of the “City of Yes for Carbon Neutrality” proposal, a historic set of citywide zoning changes that will facilitate climate action, clean energy, and resiliency.

UV Curing for Composite Manufacturing

Ultraviolet energy (UV) curing, also known as energy curing, has been used by the composites industry for some time, but it is still not quite as well-known as some other curing chemistries. The extremely rapid cure speed leads to high throughput and productivity, while the breath of physical properties of the cured resins allow them to be used in a variety of applications. The possibility of making lower VOC/styrene free formulations with very long pot life and reduced waste are also benefits of UV technology. In this presentation, allnex will briefly review what UV curing entails and compare the advantages and challenges of energy curing with thermally curing technologies (for example, peroxide curing of UP resins).

How They Can Help Microgrids Meet ...,Lisa Cohn,,,,,https://www.microgridknowledge.com/generation-fuels/article/55318140/these-carbon-free-technologies-still-get-the-itc-how-they-can-help-microgrids-meet-soaring-demand,"A developing thermal storage option Most recently, Fourth Power announced that it’s developing thermal energy storage systems that are eligible for the ITC with components sourced in the U.S.
The result is one-ton blocks of pure carbon that can store heat, said Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power.
Fourth Power uses special solar cells–thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells –to transform light from the glowing white-hot infrastructure into electricity.
Thermal energy storage at $25/kWh “The high temperatures allow you to get an unprecedented amount of power density,” Ganesan said.
Fourth Power is now building a demonstration project in Massachusetts Its first commercial deployment is expected in 2028.","Fuel cells, geothermal, energy storage and nuclear energy are all still eligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s investment tax credit (ITC), while the Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out the ITC for solar, wind and electric vehicles.

The ITC provides 30% tax credits for projects that meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. Developers can claim bonus credits for projects in low-income communities, energy communities or those that use domestic content.

Energy companies developing the ITC-eligible technologies are finding ways to take advantage of the ITC and source their materials in the U.S., avoiding Foreign Entity of Concern provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill Act that make it difficult to obtain materials in China and other countries.

This means these companies can help microgrid developers crank out clean kWh more quick ly and cost-effectively to help meet soaring demand from data centers, electrification and AI, they say. And they can be deployed 24-7 as baseload power.

A developing thermal storage option

Most recently, Fourth Power announced that it’s developing thermal energy storage systems that are eligible for the ITC with components sourced in the U.S.

Thermal energy storage is energy stored in a material as a heat source or a cold sink and saved for use at a different time, according to the federal Department of Energy. The systems can store thermal energy from hours to weeks. The energy can be discharged directly to change building temperatures and don’t require conversions from thermal to electrical energy.

Fourth Power’s system is unique because the technology, developed at Georgia Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology–has high energy density. The company uses any form of generation to heat petroleum coke, a form of raw carbon that’s released as part of petroleum refinement, and puts it in a kiln at 2,400 degrees Celsius. The result is one-ton blocks of pure carbon that can store heat, said Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power.

He noted that the process doesn’t sequester carbon, but doesn’t combust it, either.

Fourth Power uses special solar cells–thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells –to transform light from the glowing white-hot infrastructure into electricity.

“TPV cells are always converting light into power because heat and light are fundamentally the same phenomenon,” explained Asegun Henry, Fourth Power's founder and chief technologist. “Every object in the universe constantly radiates light, including our own bodies.” As objects heat up, they emit more light and shift toward higher frequencies.”

The high temperatures created by the company’s process spark higher power density.

Thermal energy storage at $25/kWh

“The high temperatures allow you to get an unprecedented amount of power density,” Ganesan said. “The hotter, the more efficient and the smaller the system is.” The company can build a 1-GWh battery on an acre of land, which is a relatively small footprint, he said.

The company expects to deploy grid-scale systems at less than $25/kWh to store power and $1/watt to output the power. By comparison, with lithium-ion batteries, it costs about $250/kWh to store power, he said.

Solar and wind energy are the least expensive and quickest ways to charge the storage systems, he said.

Fourth Power is selling the systems in 25-MW blocks, Ganesan said.

Storage for microgrids and critical infrastructure

“You can stack up the blocks, and this can support microgrids and critical infrastructure,” he said. It can also power data centers. One option is to

use behind-the-meter generation paired with the system, which could avoid interconnection delays.

The company plans to focus first on front-of-meter applications, working with independent power producers, utilities and hyperscalers. The systems would be off-grid microgrids to avoid interconnection delays, he said. Fourth Power is now building a demonstration project in Massachusetts Its first commercial deployment is expected in 2028.

IBIS stands for ‘The Intelligent Battery Integrated System’ and is designed to improve vehicle space usage, faster charging times and improved efficiency.

The European giant is working in partnership with battery company ‘Saft’ and has fitted this new technology to a Peugeot e-3008 electric SUV.

The IBIS technology allows for the inverter and charging systems to be embedded into the battery itself, making the unit more compact. However, it can still be topped up from an AC and DC rapid charge – ensuring shorter charge times – and will be able to supply power to the car’s motors and full electrical systems. In addition, the system will be able to feed power back to the grid where possible.

Peugeot also claims that the new system lifts the electric motor’s power output from 201bhp to 230bhp, while it’s claimed to boost efficiency by up to 10%; however, an official electric range figure from the car has not been revealed. The battery is 40kg lighter than a standard unit, which should help improve overall efficiency.

Also, charging speeds improve too, taking six hours rather than seven hours to top up using a standard AC charger similar to those equipped at homes.

Ned Curic, chief engineering and technology officer at Stellantis, said: “By rethinking and simplifying the electric powertrain architecture, we are making it lighter, more efficient and more cost-effective. These are the kinds of innovations that help us deliver better, more affordable EVs to our customers.”

EREVs use an EV platform with a large lithium-ion battery, but add a gas engine to recharge that battery and offer additional range.

But Hyundai's CEO said the priority with EREVs will be larger vehicles, following the pattern seen by other automakers.

Hyundai is the latest automaker to bet on an old-school technology to boost electric-vehicle adoption: the gas engine. And when it launches its first extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) in 2027 with added power from fossil fuels, the Korean automaker will follow a familiar pattern.

Hyundai's EREVs will primarily be used on ""larger vehicles,"" Hyundai Motor Company CEO José Muñoz said at a media briefing last week after its annual investor conference. At that event, Hyundai offered a few key new facts about its EREV program, including a target of 600 miles of range, ""EV-like"" driving experiences and a smaller battery than many of its conventional EVs.

But the platform won't be used for smaller vehicles, Muñoz said.

""We see them more useful for larger vehicles, because basically, you remove your range anxiety, and then you can, you can get [the] longer distances which are driven by the American consumer,"" Muñoz said.

He added that the utilization Hyundai sees with many of its EV customers, especially in California, is day-to-day commuting. ""They save money on gas, and then [we see] the model of using it in the day and charging overnight, very simple, like your phone. So no problem.""

But Muñoz added, ""If you want to go for a long weekend and you have to make a lot of miles, you have certain anxiety, because you don't know if the charger is going to work, etc, etc. So then you need a different technology.""

Hyundai is actually taking two approaches there, he said. One is expanding owners' fast-charging access by being a partner in the Ionna network along with several other automakers, and adopting the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard (NACS) plug type from the factory. The other approach, Muñoz said, is to branch into EREVs for people who crave more long-distance driving.

What form that will take at Hyundai remains to be seen. The automaker has not announced any specific models that will use its forthcoming EREV platform. Past rumors have indicated possible EREV pickup trucks and variants of the Hyundai Santa Fe and Genesis GV70, but that's far from official.

In doing so, Hyundai would join several other automakers in adopting the EREV approach for larger vehicles. Scout Motors announced the ""Harvester"" EREV to go with its electric trucks and SUVs, and has said that customer orders overwhelmingly favor that version over the all-EV one. Ram recently canceled an all-electric pickup truck to focus on an EREV version instead. And Ford CEO Jim Farley has said his company needs to get into the EREV game because, in his words, ""Americans love their big cars. They love their big trucks.""

While plug-in hybrids are essentially gas vehicles with EV-style components, EREVs work in reverse—they're EVs where the gas engine only exists to recharge the battery. While earlier small vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt and BMW i3 would be considered EREVs today, the technology is now mostly being applied to bigger vehicles, especially in China. EREV platforms are catching on quickly there for larger SUVs.

Large electric SUVs and trucks require big batteries to achieve their desired range. But then they run into issues with towing and hauling, which can be key activities for those owners. Thus, EREVs are seen as a potential way to mitigate the need for a massive battery pack and assuage customers' range fears. Over time, the gas engine could even be deleted from these platforms as the charging infrastructure grows.

Additionally, Muñoz said that Hyundai is counting on hybrids and hybrid-type vehicles like EREVs if the United States—its most important market—sees a downturn in all-electric sales as tax credits and fuel economy penalties go away. That's why its new Georgia Metaplant is designed to be flexible in what it produces, he said.

""I think by by 2030, you will see a good balance, I would say roughly 50/50, between hybrids and EVs,"" Muñoz said. Whether that will include EREVs too someday remains to be seen, but if Muñoz is banking on them being a hit with Americans, it could be a no-brainer.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/9mp4R0/s1/hyundai-erev-post.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 16:02:54.175843

In their letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers urged the agency to uphold its climate protections, stressing the need to protect New Yorkers from the escalating costs, damage, and dangers associated with climate change.

“We are deeply concerned by the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding and what that will mean for New York State and our constituents’ health and safety. By undermining the scientific and legal basis for EPA to protect people from the pollution that causes climate change, this proposal will condemn New Yorkers to a less safe, less prosperous, and less livable environment for generations to come,” the lawmakers wrote.

In the letter, the lawmakers emphasized that New Yorkers are already living with the consequences of climate change, from Montauk to Niagara Falls and Prospect Park to Plattsburgh. They warned that these impacts are projected to intensify in the decades ahead unless significant and rapid action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with global scientific consensus.

“Since the Endangerment Finding was issued in 2009, New York has experienced numerous destructive, climate-fueled extreme weather events, including Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Hurricane Ida in 2021, and historic snowstorms in Western New York in November and December 2022,” continued the lawmakers. “These natural disasters have caused devastation throughout the state, resulting in billions of dollars in damage to infrastructure, private property, and ecosystems.”

The lawmakers warned that rising temperatures will bring more dangerously hot days across New York, threatening public health and key industries like farming. They also pointed to warmer, more humid conditions fueling the spread of ticks and increasing cases of Lyme disease, raising health risks and costs for families.

Clean, renewable energy is the most affordable energy available today and uses little water resources.","AUSTIN, Texas – As the country faces a rapid and significant shift in its energy landscape due to the data center boom, the Sierra Club’s Dirty Truth report is exposing just how much cost and pollution utilities are passing on to customers. This year’s Dirty Truth, released today, shows that most Texas utilities aren’t doing enough to deliver affordable, clean energy, despite electricity bills increasing faster than inflation – particularly in the Lone Star State.

According to this Sierra Club analysis, developed using utility-reported data, the 75 utilities nationwide scored a collective F – the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021. Three major Texas utilities scored as follows:

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) got another F – after years of Fs – the lowest score of all utilities in Texas and a sign it is making no progress to lower prices and pollution. By keeping the Fayette coal plant open east of Austin, near La Grange, and planning for zero investment in affordable renewables, LCRA is failing customers. LCRA sells its power wholesale to 29 cities and 4 rural electric cooperatives across Texas, so its operations have far-reaching impact.

Xcel Texas has maintained its B grade, largely due to forward-looking plans to retire the expensive, dirty, and water-guzzling Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle as the Ogallala Aquifer continues to dwindle.

CPS Energy in San Antonio scored a C as it has made some investments in additional solar and battery storage and is closing one coal unit, but it is doubling down on gas as part of its current and future portfolio.

Statements from the Sierra Club

“LCRA professes a mission to enhance Texans’ quality of life while keeping open a dirty, expensive coal plant and investing almost nothing in the most affordable forms of energy,” said Cyrus Reed, legislative and conservation director of the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter. “In fact, LCRA got one of the lowest clean energy scores in the entire United States even though reversing course would help lower bills for its city and co-op customers. If LCRA wants to truly improve our lives and be a good steward of our water resources, it needs to retire coal and build more clean, water-conserving solar, battery storage, and geothermal resources and fewer water-hungry, polluting gas plants.”

“It’s clear when looking at the abysmal nationwide score that our utilities are failing customers during such a crucial time. It’s refreshing to see Xcel Texas get a B after its solid commitment to retire the Tolk coal plant earlier than planned,” said Josh Smith, senior attorney for the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program. “This was such an important step – largely driven by the region’s water scarcity and the plant’s immense water needs – and Xcel Texas is also planning significant renewables to provide affordable energy to its service area. This is a reminder that utilities do have choices when planning for a future with increasing demand – and they should be taking the road less costly.”

To produce each utility’s grade, Dirty Truth focuses on three metrics that gauge impacts on affordability and public health due to fossil fuel pollution:

Utility efforts to retire coal plants by 2030. Burning coal for energy is outdated, extremely expensive, and it releases toxins into the air that are detrimental to health.

Utility efforts to not build new gas plants through 2035. Gas prices are volatile, and gas power plants are much more expensive than solar, wind, and battery storage – and are a significant contributor to climate change.

Washington (September 22, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and 10 of his Senate colleagues today wrote to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, urging the agency to reverse course on the elimination of federal standards for greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars and medium and heavy-duty trucks. The EPA’s move is enabled by the Trump EPA’s proposal to get rid of the 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions threaten our health and welfare by contributing to climate change, which is the underlying basis for EPA’s regulatory ability to address tailpipe climate pollution. The Trump administration’s proposed clean vehicles rollback would decimate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution from cars; the current standards on the books are projected to prevent 2,500 premature deaths, as well as save drivers $6,000 over the next five years by cutting fuel costs.

In the letter, the lawmakers write, “If the Trump administration persists with eliminating federal vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards, it will be responsible for damaging the environment, hurting public health, costing drivers money, cutting American jobs

and competitiveness, and increasing our dependence on foreign oil.”

The lawmakers conclude, “Americans should be able to drive and share the road with cleaner, more efficient vehicles that help clean up our air, save families money at the pump, and strengthen American competitiveness and energy independence. We urge you not to destroy these life- and cost-saving vehicle emission standards on the basis of faulty science and unlawful attacks on the clean air statutes passed by Congress.”

The letter is cosigned by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Senator Markey has been a champion for clean vehicles since stronger standards were enabled by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which included fuel economy language co-authored by then Representative Markey. On July 13, 2023, Senators Markey, Tom Carper (D-Del.), and Padilla led nearly 100 colleagues in writing a letter to then-Administrator Michael Regan, urging the EPA to finalize the strongest feasible multi-pollutant vehicle emission standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles by the end of 2023.

Most generally, these comments explain various ways in which EPA’s Proposed Rule, and the draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) on which the Proposed Rule relies, are arbitrary and capricious.
Moreover, U.S. standards for motor vehicles can spur further emissions reductions in foreign countries, delivering even more climate benefits.
Therefore, critical mistakes in its RIA add to the arbitrariness of its Proposed Rule.
EPA also ignores most externalities in most of its cost-benefit scenarios, including climate effects and public health effects.","In August, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to repeal its 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from motor vehicles cause or contribute to dangerous air pollution (Proposed Rule). Most generally, these comments explain various ways in which EPA’s Proposed Rule, and the draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) on which the Proposed Rule relies, are arbitrary and capricious.

EPA distorts the plain meaning of “requisite technology” under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act. In fact, the “requisite technologies” for compliance are widespread and efficiently address climate change. As EPA’s past analyses have shown, manufacturers can deploy a range of technologies, including hybrid vehicles and cleaner gasoline engines, that will deliver trillions of dollars in climate benefits that justify the standards’ costs. Moreover, U.S. standards for motor vehicles can spur further emissions reductions in foreign countries, delivering even more climate benefits.

EPA’s theory that existing GHG standards negatively affect overall safety and “economic freedom” is flawed. The claim is based on an outdated model of scrappage effects and an overestimate of price elasticity. That old analysis did not apply to medium- or heavy-duty vehicles, and overlooked countervailing effects that could improve safety. The standards could help promote the overall financial standing of lower-income consumers, especially as more efficient vehicles begin to enter the used-vehicle market.

Contrary to EPA’s assertion, its draft regulatory impact analysis (RIA) informed its proposed regulatory decisions: EPA admits that part of its reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding included assessing the standards’ costs and their effectiveness. Therefore, critical mistakes in its RIA add to the arbitrariness of its Proposed Rule. For example, EPA ignores billions of dollars in effects by focusing only on the repeal of the 2024 standards but not the simultaneous proposed repeal of all prior standards as well. EPA also ignores most externalities in most of its cost-benefit scenarios, including climate effects and public health effects.

EPA arbitrarily devalues future consumer fuel savings by relying on specious theories and methods. Neither empirical evidence nor the weight of academic literature supports EPA’s theories that consumers selectively apply unusually high discount rates to future fuel savings, that consumers have strictly binding budget constraints that specifically prevent the purchase of more energy-efficient technologies, or that manufacturers would choose to tradeoff performance attributes for fuel economy without substantial savings on compliance costs. Instead, well-established market failures explain the energy efficiency gap and justify keeping the GHG standards in place. Erasing all fuel savings after the first 2.5 years, as in Scenarios 4 and 5, is an especially unjustifiable approach to cost-benefit analysis.

EPA’s new “revealed preference methodologies” in Scenarios 6 and 7 are riddled with errors, leading to overinflated estimates of compliance costs, consumer welfare effects, and effects to the electric grid.

EPA’s artificially lowered fuel prices in Scenarios 3 and 5 are internally inconsistent and inconsistent with historical evidence on supply-side effects on global oil prices.

EPA fails to support its claim that leakage significantly affects the contribution of new U.S. motor vehicles to climate change and the effectiveness of U.S. standards. EPA offers no evidence for its various vague theories of leakage, ignores how standards actually affect rates of driving versus other transportation options, ignores the positive international spillover effects of U.S. regulations, and ignores how consumers will likely efficiently sort their purchase and utilization of electric, hybrid, and gasoline-powered vehicles.",https://policyintegrity.org/assets/img/thumbnail.png,N,,2025-09-22 17:02:46.346535

We will continue to evaluate and pursue additional utility-scale opportunities across North America, leveraging our proven development expertise to build a diversified and resilient portfolio of clean energy assets.""

Project Overview

Project Capacity - 30 MWp solar project located in southern Alberta. A land lease agreement has been signed with one landowner for the entire Project area.

Development Status - the Project has been under development for the last two years and is considered to be at the mid-stage of development with site control completed along with various other permitting and interconnection works. The project is currently in the AUC permitting process with a decision on the permit approval expected by the end of 2025.

Development Program - the Company is targeting having the Project ready to build in early 2027, with commissioning targeted for mid-2028.

Financial Forecast - once fully commissioned, the Project is expected to generate annualized revenue in the range of C$5.6m to C$6.0m and EBITDA of between C$3.8m to C$4.2m. The current cost estimate to build the Project ranges between C$38m and C$40m, which will include a combination of debt, equity and the Investment Tax Credit of up to 30% available for renewable energy projects in Canada. The Company intends to update these forecasts closer to construction commencing and as the commercial arrangements for the sale of electricity from the Project are finalized. Revolve intends to build, own and operate the Project, which, once operational, will substantially enhance the revenue and cashflow profile of the Company. Construction on the Project is currently targeted for 2027, subject to interconnection studies and final permitting. This schedule aligns strategically with the targeted construction of the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows solar project in 2026.

Under the terms of the LOI, which was entered into on September 19, 2025, the Company will pay an upfront consideration of C$75,000 upon signing of the definitive ATA, which includes the reimbursement of certain development costs incurred in the development of the Project to date. The Company has also agreed to pay further consideration and reimbursement of historical development costs of up to C$1,479,750, subject to the final installed capacity of the Project and linked to the successful completion of various milestones including the commencement of construction and the commercial operation date of the Project. It is expected that these milestones will be met during the period 2026 to 2028. The transaction will be financed through existing cash resources held by the Company.

The Project acquisition, once completed, will add to the Company's growing portfolio of operating and development projects in Alberta. Revolve is advancing the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows Solar Project which was recently granted approval from the AUC. The Company also operates the 6 MW Box Springs Wind Project in Alberta.

Non-IFRS Measures

This press release refers to certain non-IFRS measures including Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""EBITDA""). Non-IFRS measures and industry metrics do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. The term EBITDA consists of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA calculated in accordance with IFRS is net gain or net loss. The term EBITDA margin consists of the percentage of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. These measures, have limitations, and are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our filings on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca and posted on our website.

Financial Projections

The Company's financial projections are inherently speculative and may prove to be inaccurate. Any financial projections provided in this press release have been prepared in good faith based upon the estimates and assumptions considered reasonable by management. However, projections are no more than estimates of possible events and should not be relied upon to predict the results that the Company may attain. Future oriented financial information in this press release includes statements with respect to forecasted revenues and EBITDA that are expected to be generated by the Project. There is a risk that the assumptions related to these revenue and EBITDA forecasts may not be met and that the Project will not meet the conditions to start construction. The projections are based upon several estimates and assumptions and have not been examined, reviewed or compiled by independent accountants or other third-party experts, including assumptions with respect to the anticipated expenses and future revenues from the Project. These assumptions may vary from the actual results. Accordingly, there is no assurance that future events will correspond to management's assumptions for the Project. Any variations of actual results from projections related to the Project may be material and adverse. Future-oriented financial information and financial outlooks, as with forward-looking information generally, are, without limitation, based on the reasonable assumptions of the Company and management as at the date hereof. Our actual financial position and results of operations and the Project may differ materially from management's current expectations and, as a result, our revenue, profitability, EBITDA may differ materially from any revenue, and profitability profiles provided in this press release. Such information is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our actual financial position or results of operations.

Revolve does not provide reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as Revolve is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or number of various events that have not yet occurred, are out of Revolve's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For these same reasons, Revolve is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

The transaction is consistent with our M&A strategy of targeting projects under 30 MW in the US and Canada, where we continue to see excellent opportunities to acquire, develop, build and operate quality assets with attractive returns. We will continue to evaluate and pursue additional utility-scale opportunities across North America, leveraging our proven development expertise to build a diversified and resilient portfolio of clean energy assets.""

Project Overview

Project Capacity - 30 MWp solar project located in southern Alberta. A land lease agreement has been signed with one landowner for the entire Project area.

Development Status - the Project has been under development for the last two years and is considered to be at the mid-stage of development with site control completed along with various other permitting and interconnection works. The project is currently in the AUC permitting process with a decision on the permit approval expected by the end of 2025.

Development Program - the Company is targeting having the Project ready to build in early 2027, with commissioning targeted for mid-2028.

Financial Forecast - once fully commissioned, the Project is expected to generate annualized revenue in the range of C$5.6m to C$6.0m and EBITDA of between C$3.8m to C$4.2m. The current cost estimate to build the Project ranges between C$38m and C$40m, which will include a combination of debt, equity and the Investment Tax Credit of up to 30% available for renewable energy projects in Canada. The Company intends to update these forecasts closer to construction commencing and as the commercial arrangements for the sale of electricity from the Project are finalized. Revolve intends to build, own and operate the Project, which, once operational, will substantially enhance the revenue and cashflow profile of the Company. Construction on the Project is currently targeted for 2027, subject to interconnection studies and final permitting. This schedule aligns strategically with the targeted construction of the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows solar project in 2026.

Under the terms of the LOI, which was entered into on September 19, 2025, the Company will pay an upfront consideration of C$75,000 upon signing of the definitive ATA, which includes the reimbursement of certain development costs incurred in the development of the Project to date. The Company has also agreed to pay further consideration and reimbursement of historical development costs of up to C$1,479,750, subject to the final installed capacity of the Project and linked to the successful completion of various milestones including the commencement of construction and the commercial operation date of the Project. It is expected that these milestones will be met during the period 2026 to 2028. The transaction will be financed through existing cash resources held by the Company.

The Project acquisition, once completed, will add to the Company's growing portfolio of operating and development projects in Alberta. Revolve is advancing the 15.7 MW Bright Meadows Solar Project which was recently granted approval from the AUC. The Company also operates the 6 MW Box Springs Wind Project in Alberta.

Non-IFRS Measures

This press release refers to certain non-IFRS measures including Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (""EBITDA""). Non-IFRS measures and industry metrics do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. These measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under IFRS. The term EBITDA consists of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA calculated in accordance with IFRS is net gain or net loss. The term EBITDA margin consists of the percentage of net loss or gain and excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. These measures, have limitations, and are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative for, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP (including the notes), included in our filings on SEDAR+ at sedarplus.ca and posted on our website.

Financial Projections

The Company's financial projections are inherently speculative and may prove to be inaccurate. Any financial projections provided in this press release have been prepared in good faith based upon the estimates and assumptions considered reasonable by management. However, projections are no more than estimates of possible events and should not be relied upon to predict the results that the Company may attain. Future oriented financial information in this press release includes statements with respect to forecasted revenues and EBITDA that are expected to be generated by the Project. There is a risk that the assumptions related to these revenue and EBITDA forecasts may not be met and that the Project will not meet the conditions to start construction. The projections are based upon several estimates and assumptions and have not been examined, reviewed or compiled by independent accountants or other third-party experts, including assumptions with respect to the anticipated expenses and future revenues from the Project. These assumptions may vary from the actual results. Accordingly, there is no assurance that future events will correspond to management's assumptions for the Project. Any variations of actual results from projections related to the Project may be material and adverse. Future-oriented financial information and financial outlooks, as with forward-looking information generally, are, without limitation, based on the reasonable assumptions of the Company and management as at the date hereof. Our actual financial position and results of operations and the Project may differ materially from management's current expectations and, as a result, our revenue, profitability, EBITDA may differ materially from any revenue, and profitability profiles provided in this press release. Such information is presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of our actual financial position or results of operations.

Revolve does not provide reconciliations for forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures as Revolve is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or number of various events that have not yet occurred, are out of Revolve's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For these same reasons, Revolve is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

New geothermal systems are beginning to threaten the status of fossil energy for firm 24/7 power delivery, but there’s a catch. Most of these systems are still in the early stages of testing and demonstration. It could be years before the technology hits the market, and the US needs more electricity right here and now. Oh, wait…

More Geothermal Energy, STAT!

The US geothermal energy profile barely registers on the meter today. Traditional geothermal systems rely on a scarce few locations in western states, where naturally occurring rock, heat, and water factors are optimal for electricity generation.

Within these limitations, further restrictions involve the availability of transmission lines and other electrical infrastructure, as well as proximity to willing off-takers.

Those obstacles are beginning to crack as geothermal stakeholders begin to deploy advanced drilling and exploration methods borrowed from the oil and gas industry to create human-made geothermal conditions underground. The result is a new industry that can spread into more areas of the US, far beyond its current limitations (see more geothermal background here).

Geothermal Energy & The AI Solution

The question is how quickly these advanced systems can deliver the fossil-free kilowatts, and the Utah-based startup Zanskar has an answer. The company surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar last year when it earned a spot in the energy-forward plans of the US Air Force, and they have not let the grass grow under their feet.

Unlike other firms in the advanced geothermal field, Zanskar is still betting that naturally occurring conditions offer a good opportunity to produce power-quality energy, but they have been hidden deep underground where they are undetectable by conventional methods. To identify deep-earth conditions, Zanskar deploys an economical suite of modern assessment tools including artificial intelligence, geoscience modeling, and data collection.

“Our vertically-integrated, AI-native approach to geothermal development is delivering the speed to discovery and speed to development necessary to meet the new paradigm of rapid energy demand growth,” explains Zanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland.

“These latest deep drilling results only further confirm what we’ve known all along: conventional geothermal resources are far more abundant and bigger than previously believed,” Hoiland said, “and are the lowest-cost route to delivering gigawatts of reliable, carbon-free, baseload power at scale.”

The Pumpernickel Discovery

Zanskar already has one deep well under its belt, the Lightning Dock facility in New Mexico. The project involved upgrading an existing, conventional geothermal site that was considered to be unproductive, putting Zanskar’s business model to the test.

That worked out well for Zanksar, which bills Lightning Dock as “the most productive pumped geothermal well in the U.S.” if not the entire world. Last week the company announced another successful venture at a second site, located at the Pumpernickel geothermal field in Nevada, near the eastern Sonoma Range in the northern part of the state.

The Pumpernickel area was initially explored for geothermal resources in the 1970s, with little success. In 2006 researchers with the Geothermal Resources Council issued a new assessment and found indications that it hosts “extensive, structurally controlled, relatively high temperature geothermal reservoir suitable for electric power production,” but the report failed to stimulate much activity. A company called Sierra Geothermal Power Corp. picked up an option to explore the site in 2006, only to drop it just two years later.

With its advanced detection systems in hand, Zanskar gave the site another go and they hit the jackpot. “Zanskar’s drilling results at ‘Pumpernickel’ in Northern Nevada have proven one of the top-ranked geothermal discoveries in the U.S. of the last decade,” the company enthused in a press statement on September 18, adding that the discovery puts the site “on a path to becoming one of the largest geothermal power plants in Nevada.”

If all goes according to plan, Zanskar anticipates a phased-in construction timeline aimed at delivering first power in just three years.

Follow The Money

As described b the company, that three-year timeline is “faster than anyone thought possible,” putting Zanskar on a good footing to compete against fossil power plants and nuclear energy, too. As for competing on cost, Zanskar is among those making the case for further improvements, much as the cost of wind and solar has dropped over the years. The company credits its suite of assessment tools with significantly reducing the cost of discovery per megawatt “by an order of magnitude” compared to conventional methods.

Zanskar is not alone. The prospect of introducing a significant, economical new non-fossil energy resource to the US power grid also has investors banging on the door. One example is another Utah-based firm, Rodatherm, which just closed out its Series A funding round after oversubscribing at $38 million, which it describes as “the largest first venture raise for a geothermal startup of all time.”

Leading the investor charge was the Canadian firm Evok Innovations, with participation from TDK Ventures, Toyota Ventures, TechEnergy Ventures, MCJ, Active Impact Investments, Renewal Funds, Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment, and Giga Investments, among others.

Rodatherm claims that it can compete with fossil systems on cost, deploying a modular, closed-loop system analogous to a heat pump, achieving a 50% efficiency improvement compared to conventional systems based on water cycling. The company plans to focus its Series A haul on a pilot system in Utah, which is scalable to a full 100-megawatt facility.

Geothermal Energy Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

“Rodatherm’s advanced geothermal system is expected to achieve competitive levelized costs of energy with firm power, including fossil fuels, at early project scale and is designed to have a decades long operating life,” the company states.

Ouch! That sure sounds like Rodatherm expects to pull the rug out from under fossil fuels, though for some reason (maybe this one), US President Donald Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” plan has embraced geothermal energy with no discernible objection from fossil energy stakeholders.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Before you do, consider that some fossil energy stakeholders have already demonstrated their willingness to adopt geothermal energy into their portfolios as illustrated by the interest of two leading oilfield services firms in the the US geothermal startup Fervo.

The potential for one hand to wash the other is also in play elsewhere around the world, the German geothermal startup Factor2 Energy being one example. Factor2 has come up with a geothermal system that piggybacks onto CO₂ storage sites, a value-added proposition aimed at attracting dollars to the carbon capture and storage field. On September 19 the company announced a seed funding haul of $9.1 million, led by At One Ventures with High-Tech Gründerfonds, Gründerfonds Ruhr, Verve Ventures, and Siemens Energy Ventures participating.

Factor2 Energy has developed a geothermal system using stored CO₂ as a working fluid. The system was developed by three principles at the company, who initially worked on the project at Siemens Energy. The seed funding will go to a pilot project with the potential for scale-up.

Factor2 expects that its CO₂ solution will cut costs by leveraging existing underground conditions and eliminating the use of water and brine as a primary working fluid. The idea is to leverage captured CO₂ at deep underground storage sites, where it absorbs heat from the surrounding rock. “As it absorbs geothermal heat from the surrounding rock, its density decreases, initiating a buoyancy-driven circulation known as the thermosiphon effect,” Factor2 explains.

“As a result, the CO₂ rises naturally to the surface via production wells, eliminating the need for subsurface pumps and significantly reducing parasitic energy consumption and mechanical complexity,” the company adds.

The closed-loop system runs the CO₂ through a turbine at the surface to generate electricity. The CO₂ is then cooled and shunted back down to the storage site.

Attorney General James emphasizes that failing to act on climate change will have – and is already having – deadly consequences.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James is co-leading a coalition of attorneys general, counties, and cities in a series of actions opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) unlawful proposal to rescind its landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding, which established that greenhouse gas emissions drive climate change and pose a threat to public health and welfare. Attorney General James and the coalition assert that the administration’s proposal would irreversibly damage the nation’s efforts to combat the climate crisis by abandoning the fight to regulate harmful air pollution.

“Climate change is real, it is dangerous, and it is already hurting communities in New York and across the nation,” said Attorney General James. “With this reckless proposal, the EPA is ignoring science in favor of abandoning its responsibility to protect the American people. Rolling back these critical protections would worsen asthma, heart disease, and premature deaths, and put vulnerable communities at even greater risk. My office will always fight to defend science, protect public health, and hold the federal government accountable.”

In a comment letter submitted to EPA today, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that rescinding the Endangerment Finding would violate settled law, binding Supreme Court precedent, and overwhelming scientific consensus. The coalition warns that reversing course would endanger the health and safety of millions of Americans, particularly vulnerable populations such as children, seniors, low-income communities, and workers already disproportionately harmed by climate change and air pollution. The coalition points to harms like extreme heat, worsening storms, wildfires, and flooding as examples of the growing threats that would be impacted by abandoning these protections – protections that the EPA is legally obligated to uphold under the Clean Air Act, which requires EPA to regulate air pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, that endanger public health and welfare.

In a second letter to EPA today, Attorney General James and the coalition emphasize the importance of preserving strong federal motor vehicle emissions standards. For decades, EPA has recognized that pollution from cars and trucks contributes to asthma, heart disease, impaired lung development, low birthweight, and premature death. Current standards are projected to prevent more than eight billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions over the next 30 years and avoid $1.82 trillion in climate harms. In today’s letter, Attorney General James and the coalition argue that rolling back these protections would violate the Clean Air Act and harm public health, hinder American innovation, and place U.S. automakers at a competitive disadvantage in global markets that increasingly prioritize zero- and low-emission vehicles.

Earlier this month, Attorney General James led a coalition in a separate comment letter opposing a flawed and unlawful report from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Climate Working Group, which forms the supposed scientific basis for EPA’s proposed rescission. The report was drafted in less than two months by well-known climate skeptics with no peer review, and the coalition argues that the final report ignores federal standards of scientific integrity and fails to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. They also allege the report is riddled with inaccuracies and mischaracterizations of decades of peer-reviewed climate science. In the letter, Attorney General James and the coalition urged DOE to withdraw the report entirely. Last month, Attorney General James and the coalition also filed an amicus brief challenging the report, arguing that the federal government cannot rely on such unlawful and unreliable findings to justify climate policy.

Attorney General James emphasizes that failing to act on climate change will have – and is already having – deadly consequences. In the past 20 years, the number of billion-dollar climate disasters in New York State has more than doubled compared to the previous 20 years. There have also been over 90 percent more fatalities due to extreme heat, severe floods and storms, and hurricanes. New York City alone now averages over 500 heat-related deaths each year, largely the result of greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on our climate.

These coordinated actions, which Attorney General James co-led with the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, reflect a broad coalition of states, counties, and cities united in defense of the Endangerment Finding, federal vehicle standards, and the scientific foundation of national climate policy. Together, the coalition is urging EPA to abandon its unlawful and unsupported proposal and to recommit to its duty under the Clean Air Act to protect public health and welfare from the harms of greenhouse gas emissions.

Joining Attorney General James in several of these actions are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. Also joining several actions are the Chief Legal Officers of the City and County of Denver, City and County of San Francisco, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and the Cities of Chicago and New York.",https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/oag-social-preview.png,N,,2025-09-22 15:02:55.657318

Jackson County leaders have been engaged in talks with NextEra Energy Resources to establish a new solar energy farm for years. The project, named Jeffrey Solar, is expected to cover hundreds of acres of space in the county with solar panels and generate millions in tax revenue for the county while also adding numerous work opportunities.

Not all local residents see the project as beneficial, or wanted, and are voicing their opposition to it. 27 News got in touch with both the energy company and locals to find out where people stand on the sweeping solar project.

NextEra Energy Resources

27 News touched base with NextEra Energy Resources on Sept. 9 to learn more about the company’s plans for the new solar project in Jackson County. NextEra spokeswoman Laura Gies said the company is focused on building strong relationships with the communities its projects border and supporting nearby residents.

“Renewable energy projects, like the proposed Jeffrey Solar are attractive to local communities, as they provide numerous economic benefits, including good jobs and the potential for millions of dollars in additional tax revenue, which can be used to enhance schools, roads and essential services,” Gies said.

Jeffrey Solar is expected to add an additional $136 million in tax revenue for local communities over the course of 30 years, create new employment opportunities during the construction of the solar plant and produce 500 megawatts of renewable energy, according to an economic impact study. Gies said NextEra is currently working with the Jackson County Planning and Zoning Committee prior to construction of the solar farm.

“We appreciate the Planning and Zoning Committee’s collaborative efforts in drafting the solar ordinance and look forward to adhering to Jackson County’s regulations as we advance the Jeffrey Solar project through the permitting process,” Gies said. “We will develop and submit an application for a project that the county can be proud of – one that creates homegrown, renewable energy, good jobs and economic growth for the local communities and the state of Kansas.”

Jeffrey Solar is currently scheduled to begin operations by February 2030, according to NextEra’s website. The entire project is set to take up 5,000 acres of space in the county, which equates to about eight square miles of land or nearly 3,800 football fields. NextEra states on the project’s website that solar projects create sources of renewable energy while also preserving clean water and air.

“For more than two decades, NextEra Energy Resources has been investing in Kansas,” Gies said. “We remain committed to continued energy development, leveraging all forms of energy across renewables, battery energy storage, natural gas, nuclear and other critical energy infrastructure.”

Local criticism and lawsuit

27 News got in touch with some locals in Jackson County to find out what opinions they hold about the solar project. Some have objected to the construction of the plant, claiming it would have several negative impacts on the nearby area and environment.

Local residents and the City of Rossville filed a lawsuit in early 2025 against the U.S. Department of Treasury (USDT) and Jeffrey Solar in an attempt to halt the project. The plaintiffs claimed the use of taxpayer funding for the project, in the form of tax credits, should require a review under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regarding the impact the solar farm will have on the environment. However, a U.S. district judge later dismissed the suit in July, ruling the plaintiffs lacked standing.

“Plaintiffs’ claims, arguments, and requested relief have been difficult to analyze. They are trying to use the procedural requirements of NEPA as a roadblock because they do not like what Congress has chosen to incentivize and what regulations Jackson County is considering. But those challenges must be made to the legislative branch, not to the judiciary.”

Case 5:25-cv-04003-HLT-BGS excerpt

Tom Hoffman is one of the landowners who filed the lawsuit. In a statement to 27 News sent on Sept. 14, he claimed the project will “destroy 5,000 or more acres of land, at taxpayer expense” and cause damage to the environment.

“This project will lower non participating land owners quality of life, reduce their property use, possibly harm the health of those people nearby as well as lowering their property values,” Hoffman said.

Austin Nimocks with PNT Law Firm, speaking on behalf of Hoffman on Sept. 18, said the dismissal of the lawsuit left them “disappointed” but that it is currently being appealed in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. He claimed that a big issue with the project is that it lacks an environmental review.

“The proposed industrial project in Kansas is not undergoing any significant environmental review, though it is planned for a sensitive environmental area containing endangered species and which is prone to flooding, among other things,” Nimocks said.

Documents for the “Working Solar Draft” listed on the county’s website for the solar project do mention the Jackson County Planning Commission, and other county officials, will take into consideration the impact the project will have on wildlife, the appearance of the local area, nearby agricultural operations and more. The draft places additional requirements on the project such as where it can be located and reducing the impact it may potentially have on “environmentally and historically sensitive lands.”

Terrence Kaufman, a local property owner, said he has been following the Jeffrey Solar project since 2022. He said his long-standing plan to build a home on his land is on hold due to the project, and he fears the arrival of numerous solar panels would be detrimental to life in the rural countryside.

“It would be totally unreasonable to build a home in the vicinity [of the project],” Kaufman said.

Matt DeVader, another local resident, said he lives on a farm not too far south of Holton and owns a small solar farm of his own. While a user of renewable energy himself, he believes the creation of a solar farm on the scale of Jeffrey Solar would be too great of an impact to the environment.

“The overall environmental costs to build large or numerous solar or wind components does not yet provide a net gain to the environment,” DeVader said. “It does in fact make an overall huge net damage to our environment.”

Public meetings

Jackson County locals are invited to attend two upcoming meetings on the solar project later this month and in early October at 400 New York, Room 104 in Holton. People are encouraged to share with county commissioners their thoughts and opinions on the project during these meetings.

6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 25.

6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Oct. 2.

The Jackson County Planning Commission will take comments into consideration but will not give out any comments of its own during these sessions. People are encouraged to follow several guidelines during the meetings to help ensure the discussions remain both orderly and efficient.

The conversation focused on liquified natural gas (LNG), or natural gas that has been cooled to a liquid state, which can reduce its volume to about 1/600th of its size as a gaseous methane molecule, making it transportable over long distances, particularly via shipping. Dan Byers, vice president of policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute, noted that on February 24, 2016, a tanker left Cheniere‘s Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana, marking the very first LNG export from the Lower 48 states. Since then, in less than a decade, the U.S. has become a leading exporter.

Filip Schittecatte, president of LNG market development at ExxonMobil Upstream Company, noted that the U.S. has a competitive advantage in transporting affordable natural gas produced in one area to demand centers worldwide. Plus, adding an LNG offtake market to the U.S.’s well-functioning domestic market was a smaller step to take than elsewhere in the world, where “there is not a lot of market locally, and so you really have to justify the entire investment in the upstream, as well as building the liquefaction unit, and then you’re in need of finding the customers to underpin the entire project.”

This will be particularly important for the U.S. on the road to mid-century: ExxonMobil estimates that by 2050, one-quarter of the entire world’s energy will come from natural gas, with 20% of that supplied through LNG, compared to just 12% through LNG today. Schittecatte said that this energy form has “a very strong growth prospect on a global level,” and the country’s ability to export it would “would actually, in our view, keep the U.S. proportional to the entire global market’s growth.” Over the past decade alone, according to Rob Jennings, vice president of natural gas markets at the American Petroleum Institute, global demand for LNG has increased by 60%, with the U.S. accounting for approximately one-quarter of both natural gas production and global LNG exports.

Over the past several years, this increasing demand has been driven by a growing focus on energy security. Referencing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Jennings explained, “A lot of countries took a look at their energy policies and realized that they may not have been thinking about energy security as much as they should have been.” Despite the U.S. taking the slot as the world’s number one natural gas producer, and there being an EU proposal on the table to phase out Russian imports completely, Byers claims they will not be able to do so unless U.S. LNG providers continue to come online: “These countries also want to have that optionality to have a trusted partner. And so really, in a way, the timing is just extremely fortuitous that our next wave of projects is coming along just as the geopolitics is heating up.”

At the end of the day, according to Jennings, the demand for LNG itself “sends an important signal to upstream producers like ExxonMobil that they still should be investing in upstream, and that midstream companies should still be investing in pipeline capacity, and that does help build that robust system… Our big, comprehensive, and well-built-out natural gas system that really underpins our energy security.”

LNG demand is also being driven by the trend toward decarbonization, as natural gas burns about twice as clean as coal, providing a cleaner alternative. Since 2005, the U.S. power sector alone has reduced emissions by about 40%. Jennings stated that “the biggest driver of that was the switch from coal to natural gas. In the power sector, we used to burn a billion tons a year of coal. Today we burn half that… What the U.S. LNG fleet allows us to do is export that template for reducing emissions that has worked so dramatically well here in the U.S.” Schittecatte added that 70% of LNG demand comes from the Asia Pacific, where buyers have come together to start the Coalition for LNG Emission Abatement toward Net-zero (CLEAN) Initiative. The partnership, supported by the governments of Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Australia, sees the world’s largest demand center asking producers to provide information on their emission management and reduction efforts, allowing the U.S. to demonstrate its advantages.

Not only does natural gas offer a decarbonized resource for American trade, but the industry has increasingly recognized its value. Exxon has achieved more than a 60% reduction in the methane intensity of its operated assets since 2016. “I think it feels natural for us to do because it addresses both sides of the end equation,” explained Schittecatte. “It provides the energy we’d like to supply to market, and doing so by also addressing the emissions.” Jennings said this can be seen in the rest of this ecosystem, as well: “The broader industry has reduced the methane intensity of U.S. onshore oil and gas production 59% since 2015. And one of the most remarkable things about that is that’s not been regulatory driven. Those changes have been industry-driven. That’s what shareholders want.”

Moving forward, one of the challenges highlighted was the importance of the U.S. continuing to show its leadership in the sector. Jennings mentioned that when President Biden introduced an LNG permitting pause, “it injected a ton of uncertainty,” after LNG had been “almost a bipartisan exercise for the first eight years.” Meanwhile, Byers commented, “I think there’s a fairly good consensus that LNG exports do not raise emissions, and, in fact, they decrease emissions, but that’s something that’s still not going away, so we have to sort of be diligent, and you’ll see continued progress in addressing methane through the value chain.” Additionally, the country should only pursue goals that do not impede our reliability as a trading partner. Schittecatte said the idea of having LNG exports shipped by U.S.-built and -flagged vessels is an endeavor that would hinder the industry because it would have to start from scratch.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/116243529_3276249455772478_2325338291113300235_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 00:58:09.596595

Kaufman, Stephen Lacey, Open Circuit",,,,,https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/will-utilities-deploy-next-generation-meters-to-support-a-smarter-more-flexible-grid/,"In the early 2000s, U.S. utilities began replacing analog electricity meters with so-called smart meters, which communicate with utilities wirelessly.
By 2022, 77% of U.S. homes and businesses had a smart meter installed, according to the Institute for Electric Innovation.
She called next-generation smart meters mini computers.
“In Michigan, I think roughly 95% of residential customers now have [1.0] smart meters,” she said.
Sherman said she would like to see regulatory oversight in Michigan that would push utilities toward proactive planning for upgrading to next-generation smart meters.","In the early 2000s, U.S. utilities began replacing analog electricity meters with so-called smart meters, which communicate with utilities wirelessly. This advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) enables a range of utility benefits, from automated meter reading to outage detection and more efficient power restoration.

AMI grew nationwide after 2009, thanks to federal funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. By 2022, 77% of U.S. homes and businesses had a smart meter installed, according to the Institute for Electric Innovation. Research shows that for utilities, the investment paid off.

In recent years, however, smart meter technology has advanced. Laura Sherman, president of the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, a trade association that advocates for clean energy policy in the state, wants the state’s energy providers to keep up with the newest technology, and to ensure it helps consumers save energy and money.

She called next-generation smart meters mini computers. “What we have now in Michigan is like a flip phone,” she said during a recent interview on the With Great Power podcast. Those “flip phones” are like smart meters 1.0, whereas newer 2.0 models are more like iPhones, and are capable of running applications too advanced for deployed smart meter 1.0 networks.

Now, as more advanced smart meters are becoming available, the EIBC wants Michigan’s utility providers Consumer Energy and DTE to develop a roadmap for upgrading those networks. “In Michigan, I think roughly 95% of residential customers now have [1.0] smart meters,” she said.

While smart meter 1.0 technology has helped utilities improve the accuracy and frequency of meter readings, ”it hasn’t done a good job of providing customer benefits,” Sherman said. She blamed some of that on poor planning and coordination with other service providers. But she also pointed to meters’ limited capabilities, saying they don’t always support applications that would help consumers lower their energy usage and spending.

Smart meter transition

Sherman isn’t alone. As utilities around the country start to upgrade to next-generation smart meters, industry watchers — including the hosts of the Open Circuit podcast — want to ensure that they’re capable of supporting distributed energy resources like virtual power plants and demand response programs.

That’s becoming more important as more consumers install battery storage in their homes, or switch to electric appliances like heat pumps and other devices that have Wi-Fi capabilities to connect to energy applications. Electric vehicle charging also highlights the use of smart meters and applications that control the flow of electrons based on rates and demand.

If it means you’ll pay a lower rate and reduce grid stress, “you don’t really care if the utility shifts the charging from right when you get home to midnight,” Sherman said. “As long as you have enough [charge] in the morning.” The same is true, she said, of heating water in a home. “If you take a shower, you just want the water to be hot, but you don’t care if the water heater turns on the minute you stop.”

Sherman pointed to National Grid as a utility that is deploying next-generation AMI and leaning into customer-facing benefits. In 2023, National Grid’s Transformation Programs lead Carlos Nouel noted that although data collection from earlier smart grid deployments was seamless for the utilities, it wasn’t frequent enough to unlock the visibility needed to support responsive applications.

“In the past, we just had 15-minute interval data, but as an industry claimed we had real-time information. The reality is, when you’re 15 minutes behind — and you might even push it every hour at best, or even every eight hours — that’s not real real-time,” he said.

Sherman said she would like to see regulatory oversight in Michigan that would push utilities toward proactive planning for upgrading to next-generation smart meters.

“ I don’t want [utilities] to make investments in things that are not going to work or that are going to become obsolete,” she said. “But I really think that if the utility is able to look at the full benefits, and the regulators are able to push them to look at the full benefits, I’m hopeful that we can move the conversation along.”

She warned that just investing in new meters without building clear business and use cases could lead to a second round of underutilized meters that fail to deliver new benefits to users.

“We need to better understand how the investments… are going to then benefit customers. It was a promise that was made with the first generation [smart meters] and it didn’t bear out.”

Related: Would You Buy An EV After The Tax Credit Expires?

President Trump’s decision to axe the previous Biden administration’s $7,500 of tax credits against an EV purchase means the nationwide subsidies will cease at the end of this month. Some Californians, clean air campaigners, and several automakers had hoped Newsom would step in to offer state aid to replace the federal incentives, something he himself had previously pledged. But last week, he told reporters it was unaffordable.

No Safety Net from Sacramento

“We can’t make up for the federal vandalism of those tax credits [by the Trump administration],” Newsom said at a press conference when asked what he was planning to do about replacing the expiring credits.

“But we can continue to make the unprecedented investments in infrastructure,” he continued, highlighting that the state now has over 200,000 public chargers compared with only 120,000 gas pump nozzles.

Newsom claimed in 2024 that he would step in to replace the federal EV aid if it was ever eliminated, but following through on that promise has proved impossible due to California’s growing budget deficit. An earlier state subsidy program ended there in 2023, though after Newsom’s latest speech, his office reportedly said it could be reintroduced next year, potentially by using cash generated by California’s carbon-trading scheme.

A Broader Fight Over Clean Air

In addition to railing against Trump’s work to sabotage California’s nearly 60-year fight to clean up automobile pollution, Newsom slammed GM and other automakers. He accused them of being complicit in the push to block California’s ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles set to take effect in 2035.

The Trump administration has let RFK Jr loose on the energy sector in the US","The United States added 14.5 GW of power to the grid in the first half of 2025, thanks to the increased reliance on solar power in America. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced that 91% of new US electrical generating capacity added in the H1 2025 can be attributed to solar and wind energy, which proves that the renewable energy sector is becoming a crucial staple of the American energy sector, despite the best efforts of the Trump administration. The current President has bolstered the coal and gas sector while making significant moves to dampen the renewable energy sector.

Solar power holds the lead for new energy capacity for 22 consecutive months

There is no doubt in our minds that solar is the fastest and most crucial form of energy production in the United States energy sector. Despite the executive orders that the Trump administration has signed into order that aim to keep the ageing coal and gas sector thriving, the evidence from the FERC points to solar as the most dominant force in the energy sector in the United States.

In June alone, solar power provided 82% of new capacity, making it the 22nd consecutive month solar held the lead among all energy sources. For the first half of this year, solar played an integral part in the growth of the energy sector in the United States, adding 14,567 MW of utility-scale during the first six months of 2025, which was 74.9% of the total new capacity placed into service by all sources.

Wind and natural gas are failing to match the potential of solar power in the United States

The other renewable energy sources pale in comparison to solar. Wind, for example, expanded by 10.53 GW while natural gas increased by just 2.73 GW. Further strengthening the standing of solar power in the energy sector in the United States. FERC also reports that solar will continue to grow and has forecasted that net “high probability” additions of solar between July 2025 and June 2028 total 92,660 MW.

The renewable energy sector continues to grow as the US requires more power from the energy sector

While wind and nuclear power remain an essential part of the American energy sector, they can not keep up with the growing embrace and acceptance of the potential that solar power presents to the average American.

The total installed capacity of solar power (11.34%) is now nearly equal to wind (11.83%), which means that if the current rate of energy production is taken into consideration, solar will easily surpass the wind sector to become the dominant renewable energy sector in the United States.

“Clearly, we need more incentives to quickly increase the use of wind and solar power; they will cut costs, increase our energy independence and our national security…” – Ralph Nader

At the current rate of expansion, by July 1, 2028, renewables would account for 38.1% of total available installed utility-scale generating capacity. One finds it challenging to understand the Trump administration’s hatred towards the solar and wind sector, especially considering the innovation taking place in the solar sector as of late.

Blue Ridge’s website states it has more than 700 employees. Blue Ridge Power is not part of Blue Ridge Energy or Blue Ridge Electric.

Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has used his second term to end projects related to wind and solar energy.

Developers and analysts predicted that the legislation would slash the installation of renewable energy over the next decade.

Blue Ridge cited changes in the industry as the cause of the layoffs.

“Blue Ridge Power has experienced market headwinds similar to those impacting the entire renewable energy industry, requiring Pine Gate Renewables to dedicate significant resources to support the organization.

Using a range of public data sources, it visualizes power transmission hubs in megawatts (MW), highlighting where the electric grid is already working hard, and where future pressure may build.

The table below highlights counties that use the most power for data center facilities:

Loudoun County, Virginia (home to “Data Center Alley”) tops the list with nearly 6,000 MW of active capacity and another 6,300 MW planned.

Why Are Data Centers Located Where They Are?

It’s tempting to assume that large populations drive data center development, but that’s often not the case. Instead, it comes down to a mix of factors:

Electricity availability and cost: Data centers consume vast amounts of power. States like Virginia, Texas, and Oregon offer competitive electricity pricing and stable infrastructure.

Access to water: Many facilities use water for evaporative cooling, so proximity to aquifers or rivers can be crucial.

Fiber networks: Low latency is king. Proximity to fiber optic infrastructure and subsea cable landing stations is critical.

Zoning and incentives: Tax incentives and permissive local zoning laws can make or break a deal.

With this in mind, here are a few areas on the map worth highlighting:

Ashburn, VA and Surrounding DC Suburbs

The data center cluster around the DC suburbs, especially Ashburn, is known as the “Data Center Capital of the World” and “Data Center Alley.” It hosts the largest concentration of internet infrastructure globally, where about 70% of the world’s internet traffic flows daily. This area offers abundant and reliable power from Dominion Energy, dense fiber connectivity, aggressive state tax incentives, and proximity to major government and enterprise customers, making it the preferred hub for hyperscale cloud and data companies.

The I-85 Corridor

This region, which roughly runs from Atlanta up into Virginia, is emerging as a strategic data center hub. The corridor benefits from improved transmission infrastructure, and growing local tax incentives. Atlanta’s proximity to major East Coast markets and Virginia Beach’s new subsea cable landing stations make this region a digital on-ramp to global networks.

West Texas

Known for its vast open spaces and powerful winds, West Texas offers some of the lowest electricity prices in the country. It’s also home to major renewable energy projects, including wind and solar farms that help data center operators meet clean energy goals. This has drawn attention from major players like Microsoft and Meta.

Eastern Washington and Oregon

The Columbia River powers a dense cluster of hydroelectric dams, which in turn support energy-hungry data centers in towns like The Dalles and Quincy. The cool, dry climate further reduces the need for mechanical cooling, making this region one of the most cost-efficient for data center operations.

Can the Grid Keep Up?

U.S. data centers already consume 2-3% of the country’s electricity. According to WRI, this could double by 2030, especially with AI workloads driving GPU server farms that are far more energy-intensive than traditional ones.

Meanwhile, the pressure is on utilities and policymakers to expand grid capacity faster than ever before. Interconnection queues are long, and power disputes are already delaying projects in places like Northern Virginia and Silicon Valley.

Yet, the demand shows no signs of slowing, making the power grid one of the most important tech battlegrounds of the next decade.

According to InvestingPro analysis, the company operates with significant volatility, reflected in its beta of 2.21, making it more than twice as reactive to market movements as the average stock. As the company leverages its strong market position and focuses on innovative solutions, it must also contend with policy uncertainties and potential shifts in the competitive landscape.

Market Leadership and Financial Performance

Sunrun has established itself as a dominant force in the residential solar sector, boasting a significant market share in both solar panel installations and storage solutions. While the company maintains its leadership position with annual revenue of $2.13 billion and 3.27% year-over-year growth, InvestingPro data reveals some financial challenges, including a substantial debt-to-equity ratio of 4.84 and rapid cash burn. These metrics are among the 13+ key insights available to InvestingPro subscribers, helping investors make more informed decisions about this volatile solar player.

In the second quarter of 2025, Sunrun reported revenue of $569.3 million, representing an 8.7% year-over-year increase and surpassing consensus expectations of $559 million. This growth was primarily driven by consumer agreements, which saw an 18% year-over-year increase to $458 million. The company added 28,823 customers in Q2, marking a 22% increase from the previous quarter and a 15.3% rise year-over-year.

Notably, Sunrun’s Net Subscriber Value, a key metric indicating the value created per customer, increased significantly to $17,390 from $10,390 in the previous quarter. This improvement reflects the company’s ability to enhance its value proposition and operational efficiency.

Strategic Initiatives and Future Outlook

Sunrun’s strategic focus on storage solutions and grid services positions the company well for future growth opportunities. The company has been proactive in its approach to potential regulatory changes, implementing a safe harbor strategy for equipment that could provide a significant competitive advantage post-2025.

The introduction of new product offerings, such as the ""Flex"" product, aims to capture additional customer consumption post-solar installations, potentially enhancing margins over time. This strategic move aligns with the company’s goal of diversifying its revenue streams and increasing customer lifetime value.

Sunrun’s emphasis on storage-first solutions is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses the growing demand for energy resilience and grid stability. The company’s strong market share in U.S. residential storage installations (42%) provides a solid foundation for capitalizing on this trend.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Impacts

The regulatory landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for Sunrun. The company is navigating the uncertainties surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and potential changes to the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential solar systems. Despite these challenges, analysts tracked by InvestingPro project positive earnings of $1.30 per share for fiscal year 2025, though the company’s overall financial health score remains weak at 1.49 out of 5, indicating potential vulnerabilities to policy shifts.

The proposed elimination of the ITC in the U.S. House budget bill passed on May 22, 2025, has raised concerns about the potential impact on annual installations. However, Sunrun is exploring strategies to mitigate these risks, including structuring Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to capture ITC benefits and seeking state-level policy support.

The company’s safe harboring strategy for equipment could prove advantageous, potentially extending the benefits of solar tax credits through 2030. This proactive approach may provide Sunrun with a competitive edge in navigating policy changes and market transitions.

Competitive Landscape and Market Dynamics

As the residential solar market evolves, Sunrun faces both opportunities and challenges. The potential market contraction in 2026 due to policy changes could lead to a shift towards leases and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), areas where Sunrun has a strong foothold.

The company’s scale and market leadership position it well to navigate market transitions and potential regulatory changes. Sunrun’s ability to leverage its strong balance sheet and negotiating power with suppliers could lead to market share gains, particularly as smaller competitors may struggle with capital constraints.

Bear Case

How might the elimination of residential solar tax credits impact Sunrun’s growth?

The potential elimination of residential solar tax credits, particularly the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), poses a significant risk to Sunrun’s growth trajectory. The ITC has been a crucial driver in reducing costs for homeowners adopting rooftop solar systems, and its removal could lead to a substantial decrease in annual installations.

Analysts project that the residential solar market could decline by 25% to 50% in 2026 if these credits are phased out. Such a contraction would directly impact Sunrun’s customer acquisition and revenue growth. The company may face challenges in maintaining its current installation volumes and could experience pressure on margins as it attempts to keep solar systems affordable for consumers without the benefit of tax incentives.

Furthermore, the elimination of tax credits could disrupt Sunrun’s financing model, which heavily relies on tax equity tied to these credits. This could lead to increased costs of capital and potentially impact the company’s ability to offer competitive pricing to customers.

What risks does Sunrun face from potential regulatory changes?

Sunrun operates in a highly regulated environment, and potential changes in policies at both federal and state levels present significant risks. The uncertainty surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and its implementation could affect Sunrun’s long-term planning and investment strategies.

One key risk is the potential for more stringent safe harboring rules, which could impact Sunrun’s ability to extend the benefits of current tax credits to future projects. This could lead to increased costs and reduced flexibility in project planning and execution.

Additionally, changes in net metering policies at the state level could affect the value proposition of solar installations for homeowners. If states reduce the compensation for excess energy fed back into the grid, it could make solar less attractive to potential customers and impact Sunrun’s growth in those markets.

Lastly, the potential for new tariffs on imported solar components could increase Sunrun’s costs and put pressure on margins. The company is already facing $100-$200 million in tariff-related costs, and any further trade restrictions could exacerbate this issue.

Bull Case

How could Sunrun’s strategic safe harboring benefit the company long-term?

Sunrun’s proactive approach to safe harboring equipment could provide significant long-term benefits, particularly in navigating policy uncertainties and market transitions. By securing equipment early, Sunrun has positioned itself to potentially extend the benefits of current tax credits through 2030, even if policy changes occur.

This strategic move could give Sunrun a competitive advantage over cash-strapped peers who may not have the resources to engage in extensive safe harboring. As the market potentially contracts in 2026 due to policy changes, Sunrun’s ability to offer more competitively priced systems could lead to market share gains.

Furthermore, the safe harboring strategy provides Sunrun with greater visibility into its future costs and supply chain, allowing for more effective long-term planning and potentially smoother project execution. This could result in improved operational efficiency and potentially higher margins over time.

What opportunities does the shift to storage-first solutions present for Sunrun?

Sunrun’s focus on storage-first solutions aligns well with growing consumer demand for energy resilience and grid stability. The company’s strong market share in U.S. residential storage installations (42%) positions it favorably to capitalize on this trend.

The shift to storage-first solutions presents several opportunities for Sunrun:

1. Increased revenue per customer: By bundling solar with storage solutions, Sunrun can increase the average contract value and potentially improve customer lifetime value.

2. Enhanced grid services revenue: With a growing fleet of distributed energy resources, Sunrun can expand its participation in grid services programs, creating new revenue streams and deepening relationships with utilities.

3. Improved customer satisfaction: Storage solutions provide customers with greater energy independence and resilience, potentially leading to higher customer retention and positive word-of-mouth referrals.

4. Differentiation in a competitive market: As storage becomes increasingly important, Sunrun’s expertise and scale in this area could set it apart from competitors who may be more focused on traditional solar installations.

5. Potential for margin expansion: As storage technology improves and costs decrease, Sunrun may be able to capture higher margins on these value-added services.

By leveraging its leadership in storage solutions, Sunrun could not only mitigate some of the risks associated with policy changes but also create new growth opportunities in an evolving energy landscape.

On his first day as president, Donald Trump issued an executive order halting new approvals for wind farms. A few months later, his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (OBBB), signed last July, phased out some of the key tax credits for solar and wind projects much sooner than what had been decided under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Eligibility for these projects now requires either starting construction before 4 July 2026 or completion by the end of 2027. Meanwhile, other offshore wind projects that had already secured permits and begun development have also suffered a severe blow from the use of the executive power to revoke them.

In addition to those measures hurting solar and wind projects directly, the OBBB proposes the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits and hydrogen production credits after 2025.

The renewable supply chain’s reliance on Chinese inputs also implies vulnerabilities, given that the recent ""foreign entity of concern"" provisions included in the OBBB now limit access to components from adversary countries.

In addition, the executive order to boost the ""clean coal industry"" indicates a notable shift in US energy policy towards fossil fuels and critical minerals, likely redirecting funding and regulatory support from solar and wind towards coal, oil, gas and uranium production.

This comes in addition to other headwinds rattling the economic environment of the sector, such as high interest rates increasing financing costs, and surging prices for key materials like steel and copper, as well as components – notably as a consequence of the introduction of new import tariffs.

As a result, even though the upcoming phasing-out of tax credits under the OBBB should hasten the start-up of projects ‘under discussion’ or the completion of those already ongoing in the short term, and provide a temporary boom within the sector, US solar and wind energy developers must contend with a perfect storm of policy and business environment challenges.

Other clean energies face a brighter future

Fortunately, the entire clean energy sector is not set to face the same adverse climate. Non-solar and wind technologies such as storage, hydropower, nuclear and geothermal have been spared under the OBBB. Expanded tax credits remain in place, until at least 2033, when a progressive phase-down is foreseen for some industries. These technologies are now drawing significant investor interest.

Another driver of innovation is the surging power demand from tech giants. After years of stagnant electricity consumption, data centres and artificial intelligence (AI) development are fuelling rapid growth in electricity demand. In the USA, demand is projected to increase by 2.2% and 2.4% in 2025 and 2026 respectively, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), more than twice the average growth rate observed over the past decade. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that the US economy, driven by AI use, is set to consume more electricity in 2030 for processing data than for manufacturing all energy-intensive goods combined, including aluminium, steel, cement and chemicals. Yet the specific energy needs of AI and data centres – demanding constant, high-capacity power – cannot be covered adequately by the variable output of solar and wind. Consequently, companies like Google are investing in advanced geothermal startups, and tech firms are also betting on next-gen small-modular nuclear reactors, signing deals with startups in the field.

In spite of this interest in alternative clean tech, natural gas – which is currently the largest source of electricity for data centres in the United States (see graph below) – is expected to continue to play a significant role in the additional power supply driven by data centre needs, followed by renewables, according to the IEA (April 2025). As a result, fossil fuels like natural gas and coal are still expected to power more than half of data centre capacity until 2030 in the USA.

Traditional power plants unlikely to replace stalled renewable projects

Given the current increase in power demand and the challenges facing solar and wind energy deployment, adequately bridging the gap created by delayed renewable projects with gas and nuclear power facilities may prove challenging. Indeed, with almost one fifth of gas power capacity in development already earmarked for data centres, new gas-fired projects face long waits (up to five to seven years) for specialised turbines. Nuclear plants are also slow to build, and advanced designs are only just reaching the prototype stage.

Renewables as a buffer against rising electricity prices

With electricity prices already rising (see graph below) due to surging demand from data centres and a recent increase in gas prices, growing energy demand and supply constraints should continue to push US electricity prices higher in the medium term. In this context, accelerating renewable energy deployment could curb prices, as it offers the lowest-cost option for new power generation and can be built faster than gas plants.",https://credendo.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_large/public/media/images/2025-09/itp-energyusa-september2025.jpg?itok=x3_obkDw,N,,2025-09-22 16:03:38.122651

About AETC AETC is a woman-owned, privately held business which conducts operations out of the greater Chicago area.","Zentek Ltd. (""Zentek"" or the ""Company"") (NASDAQ:ZTEK)(TSXV:ZEN), an intellectual property technology development and commercialization company, is pleased to share an update from its wholly owned subsidiary, Albany Graphite Corp. (""AGC"") on its Critical Minerals Innovation Fund (""CMIF"") grant-funded activities. AGC in collaboration with American Energy Technologies Company (""AETC""), has successfully purified a second batch of Albany graphite deposit flotation concentrate to an ultra-high 5N purity level of 99.9992 wt.% C. Subsequent elemental analysis of this material yielded a calculated Equivalent Boron Concentration (""EBC"") of 2.60 ppm which is below the 3 ppm specification required by the nuclear industry. The findings indicate that the electrothermal Fluidized Bed Reactor (""FBR"") purification process developed by AETC has the potential to produce reproducible results, and that ultra-high purity Albany Graphite could be suitable for use in the nuclear energy industry; a field traditionally dominated by synthetic graphite.

Highlights

AETC successfully purified a second batch of Albany graphite to an ultra-high 5N purity level (99.9992 wt.% C), indicating potential reproducibility and suitability for nuclear applications. These results are helping to establish Albany graphite as a rare natural material able to reach the stringent purity required for nuclear applications, traditionally a domain reserved for synthetic graphite.

Elemental analysis yielded a calculated EBC of 2.60 ppm, which is below the 3 ppm specification required by the nuclear industry. Achieving this low EBC is crucial, as it ensures the graphite's suitability for safe, reliable use in nuclear reactors, where boron contamination and other elemental contamination can impact reactor performance.

The FBR purification process developed by AETC achieved consistent results without the use of halogen gases. This is significant because halogen-free processing reduces costs, environmental risks and operational hazards, offering a cleaner and safer route to high-purity graphite.

Ongoing nuclear graphite testing includes measurements of particle size distribution, compressibility, resistivity, and coefficient of friction, along with the production and assessment of near-net-shaped graphite bricks for reactor lining applications. These efforts are important as they ensure that Albany graphite not only meets chemical specifications but also performs reliably in real-world reactor environments.

Additional testing will also evaluate Albany graphite's suitability for lithium-ion battery anodes and as a cathode conductivity additive, supporting further advancement in nuclear and battery-grade graphite materials. This versatility is unique, positioning Albany graphite as a promising candidate for multiple high-growth, high-purity markets.

The thermal purification was conducted at AETC's Wheeling, IL facility utilizing a batch-scale electrothermal FBR at 2,800°C and under an inert gas atmosphere without the use of halogen gases. The EBC value was calculated according to ASTM C1233-15: Standard Practice for Determining Equivalent Boron Contents of Nuclear Materials and was further customized to the present-day industrial application based on AETC's knowledge of the current specification that is required by an operational nuclear plant. The calculated EBC value is the most critical test of purity for nuclear industry use.

These results align with increased investment in nuclear energy. In Canada, Ontario is constructing a grid-scale Small Modular Reactor (""SMR"") at the Darlington site, which marks a step toward clean energy production. Additionally, Prime Minister Carney recently unveiled a list of five ‘nation-building' projects, which included a significant investment in Darlington's New Nuclear SMR Project in Clarington, Ontario.

Similarly, the United States and other countries have prioritized expanding domestic nuclear energy capacity and further highlights the importance of nuclear-grade graphite.123

Next Steps

Additional downstream processing and material characterization is in progress and will involve the following measurements to confirm that additional nuclear specifications are met:

Air Jet Sieve Yield: Meeting a specified particle size distribution and D50 is an important requirement.

Compressibility: Achieving a high compact density along with a low elastic expansion is desirable for matrix graphite powder used in the nuclear industry.

Four-Point Resistivity: Provides an indication of the degree of graphitization of the graphite powder and is a critical test for graphite used in pebble-bed reactors. A low resistivity and therefore a high degree of graphitization is desirable.

Coefficient of Friction (""CoF""): A low CoF is desirable for lubricants.

Test work will also involve the production of near-net-shaped graphite bricks using a mixture of synthetic graphite, ultra-high purity Albany graphite and coal-tar pitch. These solid shapes are typically used to line nuclear reactors. Upon the successful production of the test bricks, AETC will characterize the properties of the composite to confirm that nuclear industry specifications have been achieved.

AETC will also be performing a lithium-ion battery suitability testing program which will involve spheroidization, coating and subsequent coin cell tests to characterize the electrochemical performance of Albany anode material. Spheroidization fines will also be processed and tested as a cathode conductivity additive. Results will be shared as the testwork evolves and they become available.

Emily Schmidt, project manager and business development representative at AETC was quoted as saying, ""AETC is very excited about the successful confirmation that Albany graphite material can be upgraded to nuclear purity graphite without the use of halogen gas in processing. Meeting 5N purity is a necessary but insufficient condition for qualifying graphite for nuclear applications. One needs to also achieve a stringent specification on EBC which in the case of Albany natural graphite material was demonstrated to be at the level of 2.60 ppm compared to the industry spec of 3 ppm. Albany graphite has the potential of being used in market segments of fuel encapsulation, reactor linings, and specialty uses within nuclear plants that include lubrication, repair and maintenance, and other critical needs that support the operation of the plant. Work is currently ongoing on qualifying material from the Albany graphite natural resource in some of these market segments.""

Eric Wallman, Board Chair of Zentek, commented: ""This is an exciting development as we continue to gather information on the potential of the Albany project. The ability to consistently reach ultra-high purity and meet strict nuclear specifications is a promising sign for both the graphite industry, the potential value of the Albany Graphite Deposit and Zentek's ongoing commitment to innovation. This milestone not only demonstrates the quality and versatility of Albany graphite but also showcases the strength of our partnerships and the dedication of our team. As we move forward, I am eager to see how these results open new doors for technological advancement, sustainability, and global competitiveness. We remain committed to supporting rigorous testing and further development to ensure our products meet the highest standards of excellence.""

(NASDAQ:FSLR), a leading manufacturer of photovoltaic (PV) solar modules, finds itself at a critical juncture as it navigates a complex landscape of regulatory changes, tariff uncertainties, and evolving market dynamics. As the largest solar manufacturer in the Western Hemisphere and the only significant U.S. producer of solar modules, First Solar’s position in the industry is both enviable and precarious. According to InvestingPro data, the company maintains strong financial health with a GOOD overall score and operates with a moderate debt level, evidenced by a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 0.12.

Recent Financial Performance and Guidance

First Solar’s first-quarter results for 2025 fell short of expectations, with revenue of $845 million and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.95, below analyst estimates. While the company’s gross margin of 40.8% disappointed investors, InvestingPro data shows the company maintains a healthy trailing twelve-month gross margin of 42.76%. Despite recent challenges, eight analysts have revised their earnings expectations downward for the upcoming period, one of several key insights available through InvestingPro’s comprehensive analysis platform.

The revised guidance for fiscal year 2025 now stands at:

Revenue: $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion (down from $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion)

EPS: $12.50 to $17.50 (reduced from $17.00 to $20.00)

This adjustment reflects the impact of global tariffs implemented earlier in the year and uncertainties surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provisions. The company’s bookings have also been pressured, with only 0.6 GW of net bookings reported in the quarter.

Regulatory Environment and Tariff Impact

The solar industry, and First Solar in particular, is grappling with a complex regulatory environment. The imposition of a 10% global tariff on imported solar modules has significantly impacted First Solar’s operations, especially affecting imports from its facilities in Vietnam, Malaysia, and India.

The U.S. Department of Commerce’s final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) investigations have resulted in higher rates than initially anticipated. The all-in weighted average rate of approximately 330% for solar cell and module imports from certain countries could potentially benefit First Solar in future price negotiations.

However, the uncertainty surrounding these tariffs and potential ""reciprocal"" tariffs has led to a cautious approach from both First Solar and its customers. The company is considering renegotiating prices on contracts pending clarity on tariff levels and IRA provisions, and may even idle capacity in Southeast Asia if reciprocal tariffs are implemented without cost-sharing from customers.

Manufacturing Capacity and Expansion

First Solar’s strong domestic manufacturing capacity positions it well to serve the U.S. market. The company has a significant backlog of approximately 66 GW through 2030, providing long-term visibility. However, the potential idling of overseas facilities due to tariff issues could impact the company’s global production strategy.

The company is also benefiting from Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions, which limit competition from Chinese manufacturers. This regulatory environment allows First Solar to potentially increase its average selling prices (ASPs) and strengthen its competitive moat.

Market Positioning and Future Outlook

Despite the challenges, many analysts remain optimistic about First Solar’s prospects. The company’s position as the only large-scale domestic solar module manufacturer in the U.S. provides it with a unique advantage as the country seeks to boost its clean energy manufacturing capabilities. This optimism is reflected in the company’s market performance, with InvestingPro reporting a remarkable 61.81% price return over the past six months. Based on InvestingPro’s Fair Value analysis, the stock currently appears slightly undervalued. For deeper insights into First Solar’s valuation and growth potential, including access to over 10 additional ProTips and comprehensive financial metrics, explore the full InvestingPro platform.

Analysts project significant growth in earnings and revenue over the next few years:

FY 2025E: Revenue of $5,056 million, EPS of $15.63

FY 2026E: Revenue of $6,618 million, EPS of $25.54

FY 2027E: Revenue of $6,529 million, EPS of $26.14

However, these projections are subject to considerable uncertainty due to the fluid policy environment and potential changes in global trade dynamics.

Bear Case

How might potential changes to IRA provisions affect FSLR’s competitive advantage?

First Solar’s current competitive advantage is heavily tied to the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly the domestic content requirements and tax credits. If these provisions were to be significantly altered or removed, it could erode First Solar’s pricing power and market position.

The company’s earnings are substantially boosted by Advanced Manufacturing Credits (AMC) under section 45X of the IRA. Any reduction or phase-out of these credits could materially impact First Solar’s profitability. Moreover, if the domestic content rules for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) were to be relaxed, it could allow for increased competition from foreign manufacturers, potentially reducing First Solar’s market share and pricing power.

What risks does FSLR face from increasing domestic solar manufacturing capacity?

As U.S. cell capacity grows to meet demand, First Solar’s price premium over imported panels may diminish. The company currently benefits from a scarcity of domestic manufacturing, but this advantage could erode as more competitors enter the market or expand their U.S. operations.

Analysts have noted a 37% increase in year-end 2026 cell capacity expectations for the U.S. market. As this new capacity comes online, it could lead to increased competition and potentially lower ASPs for First Solar’s products. The company may need to invest heavily in research and development to maintain its technological edge and cost competitiveness in an increasingly crowded market.

Bull Case

How could FSLR benefit from stricter FEOC restrictions?

Stricter Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions could significantly benefit First Solar by further limiting competition from Chinese manufacturers and other foreign entities. These restrictions, which are part of the broader effort to secure the U.S. solar supply chain, could create a more favorable competitive landscape for domestic producers like First Solar.

If FEOC restrictions are tightened, it could lead to higher ASPs for First Solar’s products, as customers would have fewer alternatives that comply with U.S. regulations. This could allow First Solar to capture a larger market share and potentially increase its profit margins. Additionally, stricter FEOC rules might incentivize more U.S. solar project developers to secure long-term contracts with domestic manufacturers, further strengthening First Solar’s position.

What potential upside exists for FSLR if tariff issues are resolved favorably?

A favorable resolution to the current tariff issues could provide significant upside for First Solar. If reciprocal tariffs are not implemented or are set at a lower rate than feared, it would allow First Solar to continue utilizing its overseas manufacturing capacity efficiently, potentially leading to higher overall production and sales volumes.

Moreover, if the final tariff structure creates a more level playing field for U.S. manufacturers without overly burdening the broader solar industry, it could lead to increased demand for solar installations. This could benefit First Solar both in terms of volume and pricing power. A clear and stable tariff environment would also allow the company to make more confident long-term planning decisions, potentially leading to more aggressive expansion and innovation strategies.

What We Tried Before and Why It Did Not Work Back in 2005, Congress tried to smooth the path for new transmission.","Recently, I joined the Right of Way podcast to talk about something that usually hides in the background of our energy debates but quietly determines whether the lights stay on: transmission.

When most people think about electricity, they imagine either the power plant that generates it or the wires that carry it into their home. But the system actually has 3 distinct parts:

Generation: the power plants where electricity is produced

Transmission: the high-voltage lines that move power across long distances

Distribution: the smaller lines that branch out through neighborhoods and deliver electricity to your home or business

Transmission is the ​“middle child.” It is not as visible as power plants or as familiar as the poles outside your window, but without it, the whole system grinds to a halt.

Why Transmission Matters Now

We are currently living with the grid of the 20th century, even as the technologies of the 21st — advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, electrification of all sorts of appliances — are taking off. Many power lines that crisscross the country today are 50, 70, or even 100 years old. They have held up remarkably well. But as demand for electricity surges and as the mix of energy sources changes, the old grid is showing its age.

If we cannot move power from where it is made to where it is needed, we are in trouble. Even if we build the most affordable, reliable generator in the world, it is useless if the electricity cannot reach customers. Unless we relearn how to build large transmission lines, we are, to put it in technical terms, hosed.

The 3 P’s: Permitting, Planning, and Paying

On the podcast, I talked about the so-called ​“3 P’s,” the 3 main barriers to building new transmission.

1. Permitting: Before a shovel goes in the ground, developers must navigate an obstacle course of approvals: federal environmental reviews, state approvals, local siting authorities, and land-use agreements. It is common for projects to spend years or even decades in limbo. In the western half of the United States, lines like SunZia and TransWest have been delayed for around 20 years. Nationwide, about a third of Environmental Impact Statements completed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) between 2010 and 2018 for energy projects were for transmission lines, and many of those projects ended up in court.

2. Planning: There is no clear way to propose a new transmission line, even one that provides serious benefits to the system, and have it evaluated systematically and approved on a reasonable timescale. The process is patchy and inconsistent. Some regions have done better than others. For example, the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) created a portfolio of ​“Multi-Value Projects” that actually got built (mostly) on time and on budget. That is the exception, however, not the rule.

3. Paying: Every line must be paid for, ultimately, by the customers who use the power grid. The challenge is figuring out who benefits and making sure the costs are shared fairly. Black-letter case law says that costs should be allocated ​“roughly commensurate” with the benefits. That sounds straightforward, but in practice, disputes and a lack of legal clarity over cost allocation can tie up projects indefinitely.

What We Tried Before and Why It Did Not Work

Back in 2005, Congress tried to smooth the path for new transmission. It created ​“National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors,” gave the Power Marketing Administrations new authority to participate in projects, and it even set up a way to consolidate environmental reviews.

On paper, these updates looked promising. In practice, not a single line has been completed under those authorities. Courts limited the government’s ability to step in when states blocked projects and also created the infamous ​“double NEPA” problem for federally sited transmission — 2 full environmental reviews for the same project.

The result: 20 years later, we are still stuck.

What Real Reform Could Look Like

So how do we move forward? There have been a number of proposals in Congress, including the bipartisan Energy Permitting Reform Act sponsored by Senator Barrasso (R‑WY) and former Senator Manchin (I‑WV), which passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee last year on a bipartisan vote of 15 – 4.

Just this week, the 49 members of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus voted to approve a broad permitting framework geared at unleashing all kinds of American energy infrastructure, including transmission.

A Chance for Common Ground

A closing observation I shared on the podcast is that once a particular energy technology scales up, it often becomes politically divisive. When a technology is still emerging, it tends to enjoy broad support. Transmission is unusual. It is both urgent and still widely recognized as something that helps bring new generation and power new demand.",https://assets.arnoldventures.org/uploads/Feature-Images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Arnold-Ventures_Infrastructure_Energy-Transmission.jpg?mtime=1758566401,N,,2025-09-22 19:00:19.999964

Since our last update in January, several key developments across multiple jurisdictions have occurred, including the beginning of several state programs.

Legislative Developments

When we last reported at the start of 2025, five states had passed EPR legislation: Maine, Oregon, Colorado, California, and Minnesota. The tally has now reached seven. Following the publication of its needs assessment in February, Maryland passed SB 901 in May, establishing a full EPR program for packaging. Washington, one of the states already imposing post-consumer recycled content and other requirements for plastic product packaging, enacted SB 5284 on May 17, establishing the seventh EPR program.

Momentum continues to grow in additional states. Since the beginning of 2025, two states, Hawaii and Rhode Island, have passed legislation tasking state environmental agencies with conducting needs assessments to evaluate the potential for an EPR program. Hawaii Governor Josh Green signed HB 750 on May 27. Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee signed H6207 on June 30. In addition, in Massachusetts, an EPR Commission was established to recommend and propose EPR policies to the General Court, Massachusetts’s legislative body. The commission will host six public meetings and make initial recommendations and related findings no later than January 15, 2026.

Meanwhile, some states with existing EPR programs are exploring updates to their statutory programs. On June 20, Maine, the first state in the nation to pass an EPR for packaging law in 2021, passed SP 579, updating the program with the intent of reducing regulatory costs associated with the program, aligning the program with other states’ programs, and clarifying select definitions. On March 17, Minnesota introduced SF 2619 in an attempt to exempt all paper products from the list of materials covered under Minnesota’s EPR program. Despite initial buzz, the bill has not moved out of committee.

New York, which has been working on passing EPR legislation for several years, again failed to pass an EPR program this legislative session; however, the bill will remain active for the 2026 session.

Regulatory Developments

States with existing EPR legislation have been working on developing their regulatory programs. After California Governor Gavin Newsom declined to accept draft regulations in March, citing high costs for small businesses, CalRecycle went back to the drawing board. On August 22, CalRecycle submitted to the Office of Administrative Law a new proposed rule aimed at simplifying fee structures, clarifying definitions, and expanding product exemptions. The public comment period is open until October 7.

Multiple states continue to refine their plans regarding what materials must be collected by municipalities and the fees that will be required from producers for different packaging categories. These decisions depend, in large part, on whether circular solutions are currently available or whether more resources (generated from producer fees) are still needed to develop them. In August, Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection held a stakeholder meeting on the updated draft Packaging Material Types List that was issued in July. This list designates which types of packaging will be considered “readily recyclable,” “reusable,” and “compostable.” Similarly, on August 15, CAA issued a proposal that seeks to amend the “responsible end market” provisions in Oregon. This proposal is undergoing public comment until October 15.

Ecomodulation provisions are another area of ongoing activity. On May 16, Circular Action Alliance (CAA) issued a proposal seeking to amend the ecomodulation provisions of the Oregon Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO) plan. This proposal, which underwent public comment and is now awaiting a decision by the Department of Environmental Quality, would create “bonus” opportunities for producers that transition from single-use packaging to refillable packaging. On August 14, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) opened a public comment period on draft amendments to the regulations focusing on ecomodulation. The proposed amendments specify the circumstances under which producer fees may be reduced (e.g., use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) content produced in Colorado, among other criteria). Notably, although the Advisory Board recommended approval of the proposal, its recommendation letter noted “significant concern” with CAA’s proposal to use mass balance accounting to support claims that covered materials contain PCR content and recommended that CDPHE request the Solid and Hazardous Waste Commission to conduct a rulemaking process on the allowance or disallowance of free allocation accounting in verifying PCR content. The outcome of this process could have a substantial impact on producers’ ability to claim incorporation of PCR into plastic packaging sold in Colorado.

Programmatic Developments

So far, Circular Action Alliance has largely cornered the market as the PRO in states with EPR programs, having now been selected in Colorado, Oregon, California, and Minnesota. There may be growing potential for sector-specific PROs to advance more tailored compliance plans, however. In August, Colorado approved the Lubricants Packaging Management Association as a PRO for certain petroleum and automotive products.

Oregon leads the nation on implementation of its program plan and its first disbursement of funds to communities. Producers reported data to CAA earlier this year, and CAA anticipates the program will cover 415,000 tons of material over the course of the two-and-a-half years covered by the current PRO Plan (ending in December 2027). In Colorado, producers were required to report by the end of July. Minnesota producers had to register with CAA by July 1, and CAA “encouraged” California producers to register by December 5.

Key Tasks for Producers

Producers should continue to focus on the following tasks in 2025:

Develop or refine data collection plans.

Assess opportunities for fee reduction by leveraging ecomodulation provisions and lifecycle assessments.

Identify “pain points” or areas of programmatic ambiguity that may warrant engagement with CAA or state agencies.

Monitor state enforcement activity.

Continue to monitor new legislation, regulatory processes, and updates from CAA.

(lailluminator.com) — In a defiant tone, Gov. Jeff Landry said nothing has changed about Hyundai Motor Group’s plans to open a massive $5.8 billion steel plant in Donaldsonville, even after an immigration raid on the South Korean company’s facility in Georgia sparked outrage back home.

“I would think that whatever they did that they weren’t supposed to do, I’m sure they are not going to do it here in Louisiana,” Landry said Tuesday (Sept. 16) an economic development news conference.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents threw the United States’ relationship with trade partner South Korea into turmoil when they conducted a raid Sept. 4 at the Hyundai-LG Energy Solution battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. Federal authorities detained more than 300 South Koreans working at the factory.

After the immigration sweep, U.S. officials released a video showing detained South Koreans shackled in chains. Some complained they were kept in unsanitary conditions while in custody.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned this week that South Korean companies might be reluctant to invest further in the U.S. following the raid, The Associated Press reported. The South Korean government also plans to investigate whether American officials committed human rights violations against the detainees.

But a spokesman for Hyundai Motor Group said last Tuesday the company will stay the course with its plans in Louisiana.

“There are no changes to our previously announced plans. We have a strategic long-term commitment to the U.S. market,” Michael Stewart, director of public relations and communications at Hyundai Motor North America, wrote in an email.

Some of the South Koreans were working at the Georgia plant illegally, U.S. officials have said.

South Korean officials have criticized the U.S. visa process, particularly the cap on specialized worker visas, which they said makes it difficult for their companies to operate in America, according to The Washington Post.

In Baton Rouge, Landry refused to answer a reporter’s question about whether foreign nationals would work on the steel plant project in South Louisiana.

“I mean, it’s a pretty trick question, I mean, it’s a pretty big project,” the governor responded.

“I don’t expect anybody illegally to be working on the project,” Landry added.

President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone Sunday in a Truth Social post that addressed fallout from the Georgia raid. He welcomed foreign companies to bring foreign workers into the U.S., at least on a temporary basis.

“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,” Trump wrote. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometimes into the not too distant future!”

In an interview Tuesday, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said she expects South Korean nationals will work at the Donaldsonville site. But their positions will not count toward the more 1,300 jobs Hyundai Steel has committed to creating in Louisiana as part of its project, she said.

“Could there be foreign nationals here? I assume there could be,” Bourgeois said. “But absolutely, Hyundai Steel is committed to using Louisiana labor on that project.”

Bourgeois said her team met with Hyundai Steel officials shortly after the Georgia raid to talk about logistics and progress on the Donaldsonville project. At that time, no concerns were raised about the immigration sweep having an impact on the company’s Louisiana plans, she said.

“They have not taken their foot off the gas pedal,” she said.

The project is Hyundai’s first steel plant in the United States and was announced with a lot of fanfare at a March event held at the White House with Trump and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Benton. It’s expected to supply automobile factories in Alabama and Georgia with steel for the production of several hundred thousand cars per year after it is completed in 2030.

Louisiana officials have devoted $600 million in state and local taxpayer funds to support the facility, according to The Times-Picayune, in part because it is expected to be transformational for the Donaldsonville area. Officials have said the 1,300 jobs affiliated with the plant will have an average salary of $95,000, far above Louisiana’s $58,000 median household income.

State Rep. Ken Brass, a Democrat who represents Donaldsonville, said he is confident Louisiana citizens will be hired for jobs at the plant and at other smaller businesses that open up to support the facility.

A new community and technical college branch in Donaldsonville that will train plant workers was included in the incentive package used to lure Hyundai to Louisiana. The state already has design plans for the $30 million training facility, Brass said.

“There is definitely a commitment for training for local jobs,” he said in an interview.

By Delaney Nolan, The Lens, and

Emily Sanders, ExxonKnews

(Special) — London Toussaint, 8, points to the sugarcane field just behind her home.

“That’s where we play at,” she says, “Me and Lyric, my best friend.”

For children in rural St. James Parish, Louisiana – which straddles the Mississippi, about an hour upriver from New Orleans – the sugarcane fields that dot the area are perfect for games of hide-and-go-seek, running down the rows between the tall plants.

They like to play there during the cooler months, said London’s mother, Nylah Toussaint, as she hoisted her one-year-old daughter Dream up to her hip. Nearby, there’s a berry tree they like to sit under.

But unknown to the Toussaints, Exxon has quietly pushed through a plan to bury a controversial pipeline in their playing field – one that experts say will be seriously under-regulated, and far too close to homes like the Toussaints’.

“We wasn’t informed,” Nylah Toussaint said, frowning. “I never knew anything about a pipeline.”

With little public input, Exxon received local government approval to install the pipeline here, in the area widely known as “Cancer Alley,” the 85-mile span of the Mississippi River lined by nearly 200 petrochemical plants, stretching from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The new eight-mile, 24-inch-wide pipeline would transport highly-compressed carbon dioxide through this part of St. James Parish, passing just 155 feet from a business and 355 feet from the nearest residence.

The proximity might be worrisome for any pipeline, but CO2 pipelines are particularly concerning, critics say, because carbon dioxide is a transparent, odorless asphyxiant that doesn’t dissipate like natural gas.

Pipeline will feed CO2 into the nation’s fast-growing carbon-capture transport network

The CO2 running through the eight-mile St. James pipeline will be captured within the parish, from the Nucor steel manufacturing plant in Convent. It will be piped northwest from Convent, will turn west to cross underneath the Mississippi River, and then pass near a commercial area of St. James until it reaches CF Industries, in Donaldsonville, in neighboring Ascension Parish. There, it will be fed into an existing carbon capture and transport network.

The Toussaint family lives along that pipeline’s path in St. James, where rental homes, apartments, and an RV park surround the quiet Sugar Hill residential neighborhood.

St. James Parish councilmembers waved through the proposal, which is now in the hands of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and its streamlined permitting process for CO2 pipelines.

It’s all part of a national CO2 pipeline buildout that is accelerating under Trump.

Industry representatives say carbon capture – when CO2 is captured from smokestacks and other industrial processes and piped elsewhere – reduces emissions. But across the country, residents, advocates and safety experts are raising the alarm about planned carbon pipelines’ proximity to people, the potential for disaster if an incident were to occur – and the lack of public input, as local boards rubberstamp the projects, like the St. James Parish Council did in July.

In 2023, Exxon purchased carbon dioxide pipeline operator Denbury, and now owns most of the carbon pipeline infrastructure in Louisiana. The state has become the epicenter for deploying carbon capture technology, as petrochemical companies claim to use it to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Thanks to the new pipeline, Nucor will be able to sell “low-carbon steel” for higher prices. Exxon originally suggested the CO2 captured from Nucor would be transported 100 miles away and stored underground in Vermilion Parish.

But the Trump administration recently increased tax credits that incentivize using captured carbon to drill for more oil in a process known as enhanced oil recovery, where companies inject high-pressure CO2 underground to force out more crude oil. Since that change, Exxon reportedly indicated to the St James Planning Commission that the CO2will instead be transported to Hastings, Texas, for enhanced oil recovery.

Internally, Exxon officials have assumed that carbon capture and storage won’t be effectively deployed at a large scale anytime in the near future to reduce emissions. Instead, advocates warn that CCS increases net emissions. Still, the corporation continues to market it as a climate solution to the public, spending at least $50 million to date lobbying for the technology’s expansion.

For residents, part of a lifelong fight against industry

Barbara Washington, 74, can trace her family roots back to emancipation here, in the small river town of Romeville that neighbors Convent.

Once primarily a farming town, Romeville is now blanketed by pollution from chemical facilities and oil and gas infrastructure. It sits in the center of Cancer Alley.

After cancer and respiratory illnesses hit dozens of her family members, friends, and neighbors, Washington saw ties between the medical problems and high rates of pollution. A few years ago, she co-founded the St. James-based environmental justice group Inclusive Louisiana, to organize local residents fighting industrial development.

Washington can see the Nucor Steel facility and its smokestacks from the window of her home. Soon, it will mark the start of Exxon’s new CO2 pipeline.

Carbon capture projects will exacerbate the health problems here, Washington fears, by expanding industry’s license to pollute by claiming to be low-carbon. She worries about Exxon placing CO2 pipelines so near to her community, and fears it will put people at further risk.

Ashley Gaignard, an environmental advocate with Rural Roots Louisiana in Ascension Parish, where the St. James pipeline would terminate, expressed similar concerns. Gaignard has fought several carbon capture projects in her region and doubts the confident claims of industry, especially given their track record of toxic pollution and recent buyout proposals in the parish.

“They’re going to build our community out of the area,” she said. “They’re going to be the reason that we won’t have a community. I just wish that our political leaders could walk away with some integrity and do the right thing.”

Exxon is trying to skirt public feedback on the plan, advocates believe.

The parish council gave residents less than one day’s notice for Exxon’s appeal hearing, when the company managed to move the pipeline proposal forward after failing to get approval from the local planning commission. “We get in the room and it is full of industry people, people from out of the area, like they had weeks of notice to get their scripts and everything together,” said Jack Green, campaign manager at local advocacy group Rise St. James.

Gail LeBoeuf, who co-founded Inclusive Louisiana with Washington, had the same impression.. “It sounds like a public hearing here tonight and only Exxon people knew about it,” she told the council.

Earlier in the year, the legal advocacy nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) had notified the parish council that they may be violating local and state conflict of interest laws. Because Parish Council President Pete Dufresne owns several properties in the path of the proposed pipeline, he stands to benefit financially from servitude agreements with Exxon. CCR never received a response.

The parish council did not respond to requests for comment.

Lifelong residents like Washington and LeBoeuf harbor doubts that the community is prepared. For instance, like many other rural communities facing new carbon dioxide pipelines, the St. James Fire Department is volunteer-run. Even now, Washington said, residents sometimes wait hours before firefighters arrive on scene.

Washington worries that the volunteer firefighters are not equipped for a carbon dioxide rupture. “God forbid that any explosion would happen – we know if there was a rupture, that it would be devastating for us,” she said. “We would be a little wiped-out town.”

CO2 pipeline rupture and emergency unpreparedness

When another carbon dioxide pipeline ruptured in 2020 near Satartia, Mississippi, a cloud of gas flowed into the small town, displacing oxygen, choking the engines of emergency vehicles, and initially bewildering first responders.

At least 45 people sought medical attention at hospitals. Some residents still reported symptoms of hypoxic brain injury years later.

After that incident, advocates and pipeline safety experts pushed for updated regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Regulations proposed in the final days of the Biden administration would have mandated new leak detection requirements and established emergency planning zones for two miles surrounding the pipelines, among other rules. But they were all scuttled by Trump earlier this year.

The disaster in Satartia highlighted grave concerns over emergency responders’ ability to respond to CO2 pipeline incidents.

The pipeline operator, Denbury, didn’t notify Sataria emergency responders about a leak. Instead, emergency crews had to call Denbury themselves to learn that the gas cloud contained CO2. Most did not yet fully understand the impact that carbon dioxide can have on people and even emergency vehicles. First responders who dealt with the incident have said that electric emergency response vehicles are necessary near carbon dioxide pipelines, since CO2 choked the engines of their vehicles, rendering them inoperable.

Federal regulators investigating the rupture found that Denbury had committed several violations. The company had failed to notify first responders that the pipeline was experiencing a pressure loss. And in its dispersion model, which would inform emergency responses, the company had underestimated the areas that could be impacted by such a rupture.

Denbury paid a $2.8 million penalty. Then, earlier this year, PHMSA proposed another $2.4 million fine against Denbury after its workers allegedly harassed federal inspectors who came to monitor the replacement of the damaged section of pipeline.

Louisiana CO2 pipeline threats

Near the town of Sulphur, in southwest Louisiana, where Exxon has another CO2 pipeline, Fire Chief Todd Parker is in regular contact with the company, and his firefighters are attending trainings funded by Exxon to prepare them for how to respond to CO2 leaks. The training curriculum is based in part on guidance from the American Petroleum Institute.

Exxon’s pipeline near Sulphur sprung a small leak last year. Exxon was failing to monitor the pipeline – the facility’s surveillance camera wasn’t working – and operators didn’t arrive to fix the leak for more than two hours, The Guardian reported. Afterwards, multiple local residents reported they had only learned of the leak through social media.

The bigger picture behind these incidents are not lost on residents of St. James.

If Exxon’s pipeline in St. James ruptured, the CO2 could reach people’s homes in a fraction of the distance it traveled in Mississippi.

And as a state, Louisiana has a poor track record.

In a 2022 analysis, the nonprofit Healthy Gulf found that Louisiana has more high-pressure gas pipeline incidents per mile than any other part of the country – more than twice the national average of oil and gas pipeline incidents per mile.

“It’s a lot more than I believe the St. James Parish emergency response can handle even though they have publicly said they can – we would like to see it in writing,” said Scott Eustis, a science director with Healthy Gulf.

Earlier this year, at three hearings with the St. James Parish Planning Commission, the municipal body that would have to rezone land for industrial use along the pipeline route, Eustis and other local environmental advocates raised concerns about emergency preparedness and about the risk of an incident with this particular pipeline route.

The pipeline would cross tectonic fault lines, where plates shift, Eustis said. It would also run under levees that shift when the river is at flood stage. “These pipelines are subject to a lot of forces and fatigue that you don’t see in other parts of even Louisiana,” Eustis said.

In response to the technical concerns, Exxon added a few safety precautions to its proposal. Company officials promised to build the pipeline seven feet underground, rather than four. They also added an extra automated shut-off valve to isolate the gas in the event of a rupture.

But ensuring safety “depends on a rapid response to a leak,” said Ted Schettler, science director at Science and Environmental Health Network, “which did not occur in Satartia or Sulphur.”

Exxon representatives downplayed concerns. If CO2 did rupture from the pipeline, “you’re going to be able to see it, and you’re going to be able to walk away from it,” Exxon representative Michael Smith told the parish council.

Threatening Louisiana communities

The St. James pipeline threatens places where people live, work, worship, and play, residents say. It runs less than 350 yards from Nylah Toussaint’s neighborhood, Sugar Hill Crossing; along with the nearby Sugar Hill RV Park; a juvenile detention center; at least one playground; and a church. It would pass a half mile or less from the Ascension Parish Jail and a second church.

Many of Toussaint’s neighbors have health problems and are unable to move quickly on their own, she said. “They’ve got a lot of old people who use oxygen and all kinds of medical problems, people that go to dialysis,” she said, noting that many are disabled or don’t have cars.

Those without means to evacuate would be transported by bus, said Eric Deroche, director of Emergency Preparedness in St. James Parish. But St. James Emergency Management doesn’t own any electric emergency response vehicles, as recommended by Mississippi officials.

Though St. James stopped using its community air sirens because of high operational costs, the parish’s phone emergency alert system would warn people in the area, even if they aren’t signed up for emergency alerts, he said. Exxon is paying for the parish to purchase gas meters that would detect CO2, Deroche said, and has facilitated third-party training on CO2 leaks for local emergency responders. But the department doesn’t yet have a copy of Exxon’s emergency response plan, which isn’t required on file until next year, when the pipeline goes into operation.

Deroche also has not received Exxon’s dispersion models, which show the potential dispersion of high concentrations of carbon dioxide in the event of a rupture. Though those models, if accurate, could help emergency personnel and communities prepare for possible incidents, Exxon officials argued that such models would “provide misleading information to the public” and pose a security risk.

In a statement, an ExxonMobil spokesperson said, “These projects take years of planning and testing, with strong oversight and round-the-clock monitoring. CO2 pipelines have a good safety record, and in the rare case of an emergency, we’ve taken steps to make sure local first responders are trained and ready to act.”

Unlike states and municipalities, federal regulators at PHMSA cannot enact distance requirements for pipelines. Louisiana representatives introduced legislation for carbon dioxide pipelines in the state, which included the creation of distance requirements from residences, but the bills failed to move out of committee. Some Louisiana parishes also tried to pass local carbon capture laws and moratoriums, only to find them blocked in the courts. In July, Exxon sued Allen Parish over a local ordinance that would have required local permits for carbon capture projects. The parish then rescinded the ordinance.

Though industry officials report confidence in CO2 pipelines, the risks are too great, said Gaignard, of Rural Roots Louisiana.

“They claim they’ve been doing these projects for years and years, but they have never ran carbon capture pipelines under residential communities before,” she said.

We’re pleased to share Bill McKibben’s firsthand account—written the night of the celebrations—from his The Crucial Years Substack.

Your correspondent is…bushed, so excuse typos, lapses of thought, and imprecise prose. But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith.

Those were powerful memories that will last my life.

Sun Day, a day of action celebrating the power of clean energy, took place September 21 across the United States. We’re pleased to share Bill McKibben’s firsthand account—written the night of the celebrations—from his The Crucial Years Substack.

Your correspondent is…bushed, so excuse typos, lapses of thought, and imprecise prose. But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith.

Those were powerful memories that will last my life. But I was also taken by the pictures that showed quieter moments—for instance, people huddled in basements so that they could see their neighbor’s heat pumps or solar inverters, demystifying the whole process of converting to clean power. This is from South Carolina—and it’s how we’re going to turn people into solar consumers across the country.

That proclivity for hydrogen has enabled the sector to forecast significant growth for the years leading up to 2030.
Rising costs in the energy sector have led to a recent wave of project delays and cancellations.
Despite the new approach to the energy sector being led by the Trump administration, hydrogen remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States.
The IEA reported that low-emissions hydrogen production now has the potential to reach up to 37 million tonnes per year by 2030.","The International Energy Agency has released its 2025 edition of its annual Global Hydrogen Review. The IEA has announced lower-than-expected production levels for the first half of this year, but expects significant growth in the years to come. Hydrogen has become a key energy source in both the renewable and non-renewable energy sectors, thanks to the low costs associated with using hydrogen to power the existing fossil fuel sector. That proclivity for hydrogen has enabled the sector to forecast significant growth for the years leading up to 2030.

The International Energy Agency states that worldwide demand for hydrogen is on the rise

Hydrogen has so much potential that is yet to be fully explored. Rising costs in the energy sector have led to a recent wave of project delays and cancellations. Despite the new approach to the energy sector being led by the Trump administration, hydrogen remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States. Whether the current administration likes it or not.

The global usage of hydrogen in the energy sector is on the rise. The worldwide demand for hydrogen has increased to almost 100 million tons in 2024, which is up 2 percent from 2023.

The vast majority of that hydrogen usage in 2024 comes from the fossil fuel sector, where most projects state that they do not have any carbon-capturing systems in place. The biggest consumers of hydrogen have been in the oil refining industry.

Despite the current administration’s disapproval of hydrogen, the forecast looks promising

In the past few months, since Donald Trump started his second term as the President of the United States, the federal government has cancelled or halted projects that aim to increase the standing and usage of renewable energy in the industry. Several projects have had federal funding pulled or been ordered to halt construction while the Trump government assesses the permits and regulations of the Biden era.

Despite that, the forecast for the future of hydrogen looks very good indeed. The IEA reported that low-emissions hydrogen production now has the potential to reach up to 37 million tonnes per year by 2030. We suspect that the analysis comes as the Trump Presidency will end in 2028.

The end of the Trump presidency could boost the standing of the hydrogen sector worldwide

Once that happens, the IEA has reported that the hydrogen sector will continue to grow and become the world’s most dominant energy source. The Biden-led government instituted a tax credit for companies in the hydrogen sector, but the Trump administration has plans to roll back that tax credit.

The IEA reported that if the current trend continues, hydrogen could boost capacity to 4 million tonnes per year, with a further 6 million tonnes possible if effective policies are introduced once Trump vacates the Presidency.

“Investor interest in hydrogen jumped at the start of this decade thanks to its potential to help countries deliver on their energy goals. The latest data indicates that the growth of new hydrogen technologies is under pressure due to economic headwinds and policy uncertainty, but we still see strong signs that their development is moving ahead globally.” – Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director

Many were hoping the promise made before wasn’t empty, but it turns out people who shell out for an electric car won’t be able to make their neighbors help pay for a portion of it.

The Subaru Legacy is no more.

This news comes as the September 30 deadline for the federal EV tax credits approaches. It turns out the reason for this rather unsurprising development is rather fundamental.

It all comes down to one thing: cost. The state of California can’t foot the bill for such a measure, reports Bloomberg. According to Governor Newsom, the removal of the tax incentives by Republicans is “federal vandalism.”

Considering under the federal program people who lived in other states helped finance vehicle purchases for people living in California, we’re not sure how that even makes sense. But most politicians get rather testy when they’re told they can no longer raid private citizen’s earnings for their pet programs.

Some automakers were really banking on California offering the $7,500 EV tax credit, picking up where the federal government is leaving off. There was a proposal for a $5,000 incentive, but California can’t even float that much.

After all, the Golden State is out of cash, running a budget deficit was it keeps spending money like crazy. It’s almost like there are consequences to actions.

During a speech announcing the disappointing development, Governor Newsom made sure to threaten GM CEO Mary Barra, accusing her of “selling out” his state by pushing on US Congress to end the EV mandate in California.

However, Newsom has made a fresh batch of promises, saying next year California will offer a new EV subsidy program, even though it hasn’t had one since 2023. We can’t wait to see who he blames when that also falls apart.

The U.S. is the largest importer of coffee in the world. Brazil, the top source for U.S. coffee, has faced a 50% tariff under the Trump administration’s tariff policy, contributing to a surge in prices. U.S. retail coffee prices increased by nearly 21% last month compared to the same month last year. The No Coffee Tax Act will bring coffee tariffs back to the level they were the day before Trump took office. That level was 0% on everything other than coffee substitutes containing coffee.

“Americans started a revolution over a tax on tea. U.S. coffee prices have increased significantly in the last year, in part due to Trump’s tariffs. If you drink coffee every morning, how can you not be mad about that? Our bipartisan bill is simple: it removes Trump's tariffs on coffee to bring down costs,” said Representative Ro Khanna.

“Families across America are feeling the cost of higher coffee prices, which are already up 21 percent, and tariffing a product we can't grow at a large, commercial scale, only makes it worse. Tariffs are simply a tax on American consumers, raising the price of everyday goods without creating jobs or bringing production on-shore. Article One of the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the authority to set tariffs, and this legislation begins to reclaim that authority. I look forward to working with Rep. Khanna to introduce this bipartisan bill and believe it can help spark the broader debate about Congress reclaiming its constitutional role in tariff policy.” said Representative Don Bacon.

“Millions of Americans are paying a new tax on coffee every morning thanks to President Trump's tariffs. Our bill would stop it,” said Representative Don Beyer.

Instead of the thrill that comes with careening through twists and turns, industry professionals on this ride are likely going to be contemplating significant shifts in their business plan and navigating the world of layoffs, downsizing and potential business closures.

Those seeking to climb to the crest of the next hill are looking at several years of business innovation and uncertainty while anticipating another shift in federal policy that will help the US regain its standing in renewable energy deployment. If the impacts of this bill on jobs, investment and energy costs align with the forecasts from SEIA and others, a future change in leadership is likely to open the door to correcting course.

In the interim, the US will need to focus its efforts on advancing a clean energy future, state by state. While federal tax policy has had a significant role in advancing renewable energy investment, state-level energy policy and regulation are also substantial drivers. There are ample local opportunities to advance clean energy priorities that address short-term needs while creating a regulatory environment that is better prepared for expansive growth than the one we have today.

In this article, we explore the opportunity and imperative for reforming interconnection policy for distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar, energy storage and electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and how such efforts can address near-term challenges while readying the US for a streamlined transition to clean energy.

The need for DER interconnection reform

In January 2025, the Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2X)—a programme of the Department of Energy—released its ‘Distributed Energy Resource Interconnection Roadmap’ [2], which highlights key actions that can be taken in the next five to ten years to address DER interconnection challenges. Priorities include increasing grid transparency, streamlining utility approval, including interconnection in grid planning processes, and supporting grid reliability, resiliency and security. The authors argue that effectively addressing these priorities will provide significant benefits, including reducing interconnection approval timelines, increasing approval rates, improving interconnection queue data, ensuring DERs do not impact transmission-level reliability and reducing customer grid interruptions.

As highlighted in the roadmap, “[if] the potential for DER deployment is to be realised … interconnection processes must evolve to handle large and growing volumes of DER interconnection requests”. While the pace of interconnection requests is expected to slow down in 2026, this reduction in volume will not alleviate the challenges that individual projects face.

Distribution grids have a finite amount of capacity for hosting DERs. With each subsequent project, the risk of interconnection challenges increases. Effective interconnection rules adopted by state utility regulatory commissions are essential to ensure that future projects are able to fully utilise existing hosting capacity and that processes are in place to pay for investments to modernise the grid equitably.

In 2023, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) highlighted the scale of regulatory reform needed in the US through its ‘Freeing the Grid’ evaluation [3], which grades the strength of each state’s interconnection rules (see Figure 1). Thirteen states scored an “F” because they do not regulate DER interconnection, and another 16 states scored a “D”, indicating a need to significantly update their interconnection procedures to streamline review processes, reduce costs and improve transparency.

In summary, nearly 60% of states in the US need drastic improvements to their interconnection procedures to address existing barriers to DER deployment, let alone to achieve the goals highlighted in the i2X roadmap.

Change takes time

One of the challenges of regulatory reform is that its timelines are typically measured in years. Take New Hampshire, for example. Interconnection customers knew well before the most recent update to ‘Freeing the Grid’ that improvements were needed. In January 2022, the state legislature passed Senate Bill 262 to address interconnection delays by directing its Department of Energy to investigate the state’s interconnection procedures. That bill resulted in a year-long proceeding and a December 2023 report to the legislature that concluded working groups would be needed to identify regulatory changes.

Recognising that a formal rule-making would be required to address ongoing concerns, the legislature ordered the Department of Energy in January 2024 to instead initiate a formal rule-making proceeding to align the state’s interconnection rules with national best practices and cited IREC’s ‘Model Interconnection Procedures’ [4] as a resource. A final revised rule is expected to be approved by April 2026.

New Hampshire’s four-year process is not unique. Massachusetts began considering changes to include energy storage in its utilities’ interconnection tariffs in May 2019. Over six years later, these improvements are currently being considered by the state’s Department of Public Utilities. New Mexico, the only state to score an “A” in the 2023 edition of ‘Freeing the Grid’, overhauled its interconnection rules in November 2022 following passage of a grid modernisation bill that was signed into law in March 2020.

Similarly, it took Maine over two and a half years to significantly amend its rules following the passage of interconnection legislation in March 2021.

How change happens

Reforming interconnection regulation requires prioritisation of the issue— typically either by the legislature or the utility regulatory commission—and formal public regulatory processes that evaluate whether any proposed changes will impact the utility’s ability to maintain grid safety and reliability. The time requirements of these processes are better aligned with solving forward-looking challenges, but the reality is that a large majority of regulatory proceedings are reactive. As a result, a discrete interconnection issue can impact a market for years. And while that particular issue is being solved, numerous others can arise.

Whether a deficiency in a state’s interconnection procedures is addressed depends heavily upon legislative or regulatory advocacy. Efforts may be initiated by a legislator who is contacted by a constituent or contractor who is experiencing considerable delays or is required to pay for significant upgrades to the grid to accommodate their projects. Or a regulatory commission may notice a pattern of complaints or receive a filing from a utility seeking guidance on how to comply with the state’s interconnection rules for a particular set of circumstances.

In very few instances do regulatory changes proactively seek to address issues experienced in other jurisdictions that are expected to arise locally in the future.

Often, interconnection issues experienced by utility customers never reach the key decision makers who can initiate needed change. Some solar contractors, when faced with an interconnection challenge and strong demand for projects from other customers, may avoid investing the considerable time needed to try to resolve the issue and instead abandon the project. Or they may try to resolve the issue with the utility and fail to find a reasonable pathway to resolution.

If the contractor is successful in identifying an opportunity to resolve the issue, their customer may decide to cancel the project due to delays or uncertainty. Other customers may shoulder excessive costs or an excessive delay on a single project without raising the broader issue that, if addressed, would prevent similar issues for other customers. In extremely rare cases, negotiation between local industry and utilities can lead to resolution outside of formal regulatory proceedings.

Given the market disruption likely to occur in 2026, DER interconnection challenges need to be more visible and addressed promptly. Project cancellations due to interconnection challenges are likely to be more impactful to solar contracting firms and project developers. The importance of high interconnection approval rates increases with market contraction, and the ability to shoulder the costs to resolve interconnection disputes decreases with a smaller revenue base.

Additionally, once the pendulum of federal policy swings again and the solarcoaster takes another exhilarating ride, it is critical that states don’t spend years resolving interconnection bottlenecks that are very foreseeable today.

Prioritising regulatory reform during challenging times

With the burden of responding to very real and impactful market pressures, it may be difficult for individual solar companies to ramp up their activity in legislative and regulatory arenas where they may not see direct and immediate economic benefit. Even in good times, most of the companies engaging in interconnection reform do so with a specific project in mind. Durable interconnection reform requires a broader approach, one that may seem a significant luxury during lean times.

Yet, interconnection strategy and regulatory engagement are fundamental to the success of companies that weather the impacts of the Budget Reconciliation Bill. For those committed to the long-term success of their business or their state, here are some tips for advancing interconnection reform:

Identify the core interconnection issues facing your state. If you work in the solar industry and are experiencing specific interconnection challenges, evaluate your state’s interconnection procedures and determine whether the challenge is due to utility non-compliance with the rules or a deficiency in the rules themselves. If you are not experiencing interconnection issues and instead seek to be proactive, review your state’s scorecard from ‘Freeing the Grid’ to identify where there are opportunities for improvement.

Learn from other states. Unless you are in California or Hawai’i, there’s a strong likelihood the challenges you’re seeing have been experienced elsewhere. IREC’s ‘Model Interconnection Procedures’ represent a baseline model of effective DER interconnection provisions that have been adopted in states around the country. If your state scored a “D” or “F” in ‘Freeing the Grid’, a strong goal could be to adopt or revise your state’s rules in alignment with the IREC Model. If customers are experiencing issues that aren’t addressed in the IREC model, reach out to colleagues in other states to see whether they’ve experienced similar challenges or contact IREC directly.

Identify areas of strength. Regulatory reform requires broad expertise and benefits from collaboration. Once you’ve identified the challenges to address, identify what you can bring to the table. Are you a technical expert who can evaluate interconnection solutions from other states and how they apply in yours? Do you have expertise in the interconnection process, and what specifically needs to be improved? These insights are highly complementary to parties who want to advance local clean energy solutions and may be more familiar with the regulatory or legislative processes.

Build alliances. Interconnection reform requires people with influential networks, people who can motivate decision makers to act, lawyers or other regulatory policy specialists who can write compelling comments in formal proceedings and practitioners who can make and dispel technical arguments. Common advocates include individual DER companies, trade associations, nonprofit groups focused on climate or clean energy issues, energy agencies in states with climate goals and IREC. You may find collaborators in places you might not expect, such as with utilities. There are often renewable energy champions working on the front lines at utilities who also want to see processes improve. Building strong relationships with utility staff can help strengthen regulatory outcomes by more specifically identifying the barriers to change and the shared benefits of streamlined interconnection procedures.

Take the long view. In the states where interconnection reform has taken years to advance, the pathway was rarely a straight line. And even once those changes have been implemented, interconnection rules need to be updated regularly to address emerging challenges and opportunities. Engaging in these issues, either directly or through collaboration with other parties, is increasingly becoming part of doing business for those in the solar industry.

The second-best day to advance interconnection policy is today

There is an adage that the best day to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second-best time is today. The same holds true for developing strong DER interconnection regulation. While a majority of the states across the US would be better positioned to weather the interconnection challenges of today and tomorrow by initiating reform of their interconnection procedures two, four or even ten years ago, starting today is the next best time to remove barriers to solar and storage projects.

Such efforts will reduce the burden on customers and companies seeking to connect DERs to the grid during what is expected to be a particularly challenging time for the advancement of solar technologies. Interconnection reform is also necessary to streamline processes ahead of the wave of projects that will come when a federal commitment to clean energy returns. The consequences of waiting are predictable and will further hamper US deployment of solar power.

The Sept. 25-28 auto show at the Anaheim Convention Center will feature plenty of electric, hybrid and traditional models from more than 27 automakers and offer dozens of street test drives featuring models from Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Ram and Toyota.

Attendees will get a taste of what driving an EV is like at the SoCal Electrified Ride Experience. It will showcase rides with professional drivers behind the wheel of new EVs — from Cadillac, Ford, Kia or Nissan — that will hum along on a large indoor track at the convention center.

Sackrison concedes that these are challenging times for auto buyers.

“I think October is going to be an interesting month,” said Sackrison. “If 27% of our county’s sales are battery electric vehicles, and those sales are going to be significantly reduced after the tax credits go away, it’s going to create a big challenge, because it’s a big part of the Orange County and California markets.”

The new vehicle sales outlook in California is expected to fall in the second half of 2025 due to inflation, stagnant household disposable income and higher tariffs putting pressure on vehicle prices, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Sackrison cited statistics from CNCDA showing that total new vehicle registrations in 2025 are predicted to fall just short of the 1.75 million vehicle sales seen in 2024.

EV sales have slowed, with some of that stall coming from a backlash over billionaire Elon Musk’s unabashed involvement in cutting jobs in the Trump administration. The share of zero emission vehicles in the state fell to 19.5% in the first six months, down from 22% in the same year-ago period — largely due to the drop in Musk’s Tesla sales.

While OC Auto Show attendees may see an opportunity to get under the wire with buying or leasing an EV, Irvine-based electric carmaker Rivian’s latest R2 SUV model won’t be at the show to see.

Neither is Tesla coming.

Both of these EV automakers have different levers to pull for marketing that rely on showrooms in upscale settings where they can reach wealthier buyers.

A Rivian spokesperson says the company — which recently laid off 200 workers — is all “heads down on bringing the R2 to market in the first half of 2026.” On Tuesday, Sept. 16, Rivian broke ground on a $5 billion plant east of Atlanta, Georgia, where it will begin assembling the R2 in 2028.

“It’s a loss,” said Sackrison of Rivian’s absence from the show, even though the automaker has never attended since landing in Orange County five years ago. “I think they are missing a great opportunity to connect with the largest audience of car buyers in a market that buys more EVs than 45 states. Rivian’s market share is only about 1% in Orange County, so they would really benefit from the more than 350,000 in-vehicle experiences that take place at the show.”

There’s still a silver lining for what is billed as one of the nation’s first auto shows — including Southern California venues in Los Angeles, scheduled for Nov. 21-30 and San Diego on Jan. 1-4.

“The turmoil is going to lead some people to want to trade in or trade up,” said Brian Moody, executive editor of Kelley Blue Book, an Irvine-based vehicle valuation and automotive research company. “As an example, if you had an electric car mainly for the purpose of getting into the carpool lane, and now you don’t get to do that, do you really love the electric car that much, or would you maybe rather have something else?”

People who visit the auto show at the Anaheim Convention Center will kick the tires on a variety of so-called green energy vehicles. They’ll see plug-in hybrids that can run on gas and an electric-powered battery to get an extra bump of 30 to 50 miles of driving, or EVs that use only rechargeable batteries to power electric motors for propulsion.

The hybrid vehicle category may be the lone bright spot in California’s auto market after the tax incentives go away.

In California, registrations of hybrid vehicles that run on electric and gas engines increased 54% in the first half of 2025 and accounted for 19.2% of the market, totaling 181,192 registrations, according to CNCDA.

Turning a new leaf

“It’s probably the first auto show that the consumer is going to get a look at the all-new Nissan Leaf, an inexpensive electric car,” Moody said.

The third-generation 2026 electrified Nissan Leaf features a range of 303 miles, starting at $29,990 for the S+ model, considered one of the least expensive EVs on the market.

Also getting a first-time look at the show will be the 2026 Ram 1500 with a 5.7 liter HEMI V8, reintroduced in the Ram lineup after being dropped in the 2025 model year. Ram acknowledged it made a mistake by discontinuing the legendary V8 and reversed course due to strong customer demand for the engine’s 395 horsepower.

Attendees also will get a sneak peek of the Dodge Duragon SRT Hellcat, a 710-horsepower 6.2 liter HEMI V8 engine that has three rows of seating to accommodate a larger number of passengers, typically up to seven people.

Other new models to be seen at the show include:

Toyota Prius Nightshade and Toyota Crown Nightshade, both of which come as hybrids (Prius also has a plug-in version) featuring blacked-out exterior accents on wheels, window trim, door handles and other trim pieces.

Dodge Charger’s twin-turbo SIXPACK with an engine that produces 550 horsepower.

Honda Ridgeline TrailSport, an off-road-truck with a slightly raised ride height;.

Honda CR-V TrailSport, a hybrid for light off-road use.

Ford F-150 Lobo, with lowered rear suspension, 22-inch gloss black wheels and powered by a V8 engine producing 400 horsepower.

Chevrolet Suburban Premiere, a carry over from the 2025 line that offers updates to the entertainment and in-car camera systems, the latter of which allows the driver to monitor activity in the back seats.

Jeep Cherokee hybrid, an SUV that provides 210 horsepower and an estimated 37 MPG.

Exotic cars roll in

The exotic vehicle display at the auto show offers an up-close look at ultra-high-end vehicles from automakers such as Bentley, Lamborghini and McLaren. A local dealership in Irvine, Lamborghini Newport Beach, plans to roll up with a sporty Lamborghini and McLaren, both priced at more than $400,000.

The Pacific Coast Corvette Club will also feature a showcase of Corvettes, spanning every generation from the classic C1 that debuted in 1953 to the cutting edge C8 unveiled at the Tustin blimp hangar in 2019.

‘Glamping’ market

According to Sackrison, the outdoor vehicle recreation market — sometimes referred to as “overland” — is a growing niche for the show. These so-called OVR vehicles are pitched for outdoor enthusiasts who drive overland in remote areas — oftentimes along rugged and boulder-strewn trails and fire roads in mountains — just to get to a backcountry spot to sleep under the stars, or park next to a river.

The global off-road vehicle market size was estimated at just over $22 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.3% from 2023 to 2030, according to Grand View Research, and cited by Sackrison.

“It’s definitely a market that is growing,” said Mark Han, co-founder and manager for the Torrance-based OVR website, whose company rented 22,000 square feet at the convention floor to show off more than 20 off-road vehicles rigged for the outdoors lifestyle. “When we first started doing these shows two years ago at the LA auto show, 90% who came over to our space said the overland market was new to them. Now we’re speaking to the indoctrinated.”

For automation suppliers, the surge represents both a challenge and an opportunity: robots are emerging as critical tools in building the next generation of energy infrastructure.

Kuka, the Augsburg-based industrial robot maker, says automation is becoming essential for meeting demand at scale while maintaining quality and controlling costs.

Its systems are already being deployed in projects spanning cell assembly, battery pack production, and recycling.

At the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, for example, Kuka robots are part of the AgiloBat project, which uses “mini-environments” to assemble cells.

These enclosures reduce the reliance on large, energy-hungry dry rooms while still ensuring precise environmental control.

In Nuremberg, Kuka Systems has installed a modular production hall at MAN Truck & Bus that can build 50,000 battery packs annually, with scope to double that output.

The facility uses autonomous mobile robots and decoupled stations to increase flexibility, giving manufacturers more room to adapt as technologies and volumes change.

Robotics are also beginning to play a role in disassembly and recycling. In the DeMoBat project at Fraunhofer IPA, Kuka robots are used to dismantle used battery packs, handling diverse designs under real industrial conditions to recover valuable materials safely and efficiently.

The battery market is attracting growing interest from automation suppliers who want to be part of the build-out, working alongside manufacturers to develop scalable production systems.

Comau, the Italian robotics and automation company, has joined the SPRINT project, part of the EU’s Horizon Europe programme, to help develop quasi-solid-state sodium-ion batteries for stationary energy storage.

Although the work is focused on energy technologies rather than robotics, Comau’s role highlights how automation expertise is being drawn into the sector.

The 46-month project is exploring manufacturing processes for sodium-ion cells that use sodium iron phosphate and polymer electrolytes.

Comau is tasked with feasibility studies, process optimization, and designing roadmaps to scale production into industrial environments.

The aim is to cut costs per kilowatt-hour, extend battery life cycles, and increase European autonomy by using materials available in the region.

By engaging in projects like SPRINT, Comau is aligning with European strategies for electrification and sustainability, even if robotics is not the headline element.

The company is already active in industry associations such as the European Battery Alliance and Batteries European Partnership Association, positioning itself to play a role in how Europe builds its energy storage base.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-09-22 15:31:23+00:00,WIRED,Louisiana Hands Meta a Tax Break and Power for Its Biggest Data Center - WIRED,Roshan Abraham,,,,,https://www.wired.com/story/louisiana-hands-meta-a-tax-break-and-power-for-its-biggest-data-center/,"Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta’s massive new data center in Richland Parish.
A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.
Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion.
In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.
“That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.” She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer.","Louisiana planning authorities have voted to rush through approval for three natural gas turbines to power Meta’s massive new data center in Richland Parish. When it’s done, the 4-million-square-foot facility will require more than 2 gigawatts of energy to run.

On August 20, Louisiana’s Public Service Commission voted four to one to approve the construction of the plants, which will be run by the utility company Entergy Louisiana. The decision was met with criticism from members of the public who testified against Entergy and Meta’s plan, claiming that the process was rushed. They voiced concerns about rising energy bills and water shortages.

Documents viewed by WIRED show that state authorities agreed to grant Meta tax breaks and incentives without the company explicitly guaranteeing any full-time jobs for local workers.

Opponents of the plan were angry about the sped-up approval timeline: Entergy submitted its application in 2024, and the vote originally could have taken place this October, to give the commission’s administrative law judge the chance to issue further recommendations. But Entergy filed a motion to move the vote to August, claiming that some of the parties that had previously opposed the project were now in agreement. The rescheduled vote left no time for changes.

Critics also claim the deal doesn’t include stipulations like a cap on how much Entergy could charge utility customers for the construction of the gas plants and transmission lines in Meta’s data center build-out—a concern as massive AI data centers can cause utility bills to spike. While Meta agreed to finance the first 15 years of a 30-year loan to construct the gas plants, the construction of the transmission line will be paid for by utility customers.

“We wanted the commissioners to attach conditions and reasonable safeguards, such as a cost cap, but they instead came to this extremely disappointing and baffling decision,” says Paul Arbaje, an energy analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, which opposed the Entergy application.

During the approval vote, Entergy and Louisiana’s economic development officials repeatedly pointed to the projections shared by Meta, which suggest that the project would bring a $10 billion investment and upwards of 300 to 500 well-paying jobs. In its original 2024 application for the plants, Entergy referenced Richland Parish’s low income levels—one in four residents lives below the poverty line—as a reason to authorize the plan.

“There has never been a better time to lift our residents out of poverty. There has never been a better time to give people in our region better jobs,” said Rob Cleveland, the CEO of Grow NELA, an economic development firm representing northwest Louisiana who testified in support of Entergy’s gas plants, at the hearing.

Meta’s Jobs Pledge

Louisiana politicians sought to rewrite zoning laws and shifted a tax rebate for broadband into a tax exemption for data centers, all to win Meta’s support in late 2024, according to January reporting from Nola.com. But the public had little time to scrutinize Louisiana’s economic development promises. They also heard little from Meta, which was not legally required to take part in the hearings on Entergy’s new gas plants, despite the fact that the gas plants and a new $550 million transmission line connecting energy to the data center and upgrades to a local substation (also approved on August 20) are being built entirely for the company—the latter entirely paid for by Louisiana taxpayers. Repeated attempts to force Meta to produce documents that critics claim they have not received were unsuccessful, including a July subpoena attempt.

One of Meta’s tax incentive agreements with the state, which was signed last fall and viewed by WIRED, does not stipulate that Meta subsidiary Laidley, which is running the data center project, will focus on local hiring, although it does require that all jobs be fulfilled on site. (Separately, Entergy said Meta submitted a letter to the Louisiana Public Service Commission in April saying that it will make “a concerted effort” to hire locally, but this assurance is not binding.)

And the tax incentive agreement does not actually require any of the jobs to be full-time to receive state incentives. Instead it defines “full-time job” to mean any 40-hour workweek fulfilled through any number of part-time jobs. Meta would need to hire these 500 “full-time” jobs by 2035 if it wants to receive the highest level of tax breaks, an 80 percent reduction on the full amount. It does require the jobs to provide health insurance and says the pay for all jobs should average out at $82,000 a year. The contract also charges Meta an “administrative fee” of $10,000 for every $1 billion it spends in the state.

When reached for comment, Kevin Litten, a spokesperson for the state’s economic development authority, said that the agency still expects Meta to create 500 full-time, permanent jobs, per previous announcements. “Meta is expected to create 500 direct new jobs at the facility, which in economic development terms means permanent, full-time jobs,” Litten says.

Entergy’s critics claimed the utility was reluctant to provide specifics on Meta’s job numbers in the lead-up to the August vote, refusing to explain what types of jobs will be created or how Meta estimated 300 to 500 new hires. In an email to WIRED, Entergy only referred to an impact report from Grow NELA but answered no other direct questions.

“We continually asked for analysis with how they came up with this number of jobs, and Entergy has no idea about how many people will be hired,” says Susan Stevens Miller, an attorney representing the Union of Concerned Scientists and Alliance for Affordable Energy, which opposed the application.

In an August 7 filing, Entergy urged the rushed vote on its final agreement with several parties, saying Meta’s subsidiary and the tech industry “prize speed to the market as vital to its competitiveness” and that “the Commission has the flexibility and agility to act at the new speed of business, while reasonably balancing the interests of other Louisiana customers.” Entergy said in a filing it had submitted ample public testimony and the public had a chance to ask questions and that moving quickly was, “the difference between securing the Project for Louisiana or missing out on this massive economic development opportunity, likely to another state willing to move at the speed of business.”

But when several members of the public asked questions during the August 20 hearing about the project, particularly around Meta’s assurances of jobs, they received few details. None of the agreements between Meta and the state of Louisiana that were viewed by WIRED are available in the commission’s public dockets. An earlier, six-page term sheet laying out hiring incentives was published by Power magazine in November, but it did not include further details about whether jobs could be part-time or any other details in the 93-page agreement viewed by WIRED. Advocates with the Alliance for Affordable Energy and Union of Concerned Scientists contacted by WIRED said they had never seen the full agreement until it was sent to them by WIRED.

Louisiana resident Angelle Bradford Rosenberg spoke at the August 20 approval meeting, expressing concern about the impact of the data center’s water usage and its impact on local farmers. She also questioned the impact of jobs on the local economy.

“I want local businesses to be thriving,” she said during the meeting, “but if the average data center permanent jobs are 12 to 15, and y’all saying it’s going to be 500, do y’all have a promise that they’re going to be local jobs? ... Do we actually know that they’re hiring people from Monroe, Rayville, Delhi, Holly Ridge, or are they just saying 500 jobs and they’re bringing in these folks from other places?”

But the tax exemption agreement secured between Meta and Louisiana officials did not secure any guarantee of local hiring. Litten, with Louisiana Economic Development, told WIRED that separate state tax breaks that all companies in the state are eligible for do require local hiring. They include the Quality Jobs Rebate, which provides a 6 percent rebate on payroll expenses, a program set to replace it called High Impact Jobs program.

Most data centers hire specialists from out of state for the technical jobs, according to Kasia Tarczynska, a research analyst who studies data center tax breaks at the nonprofit Good Jobs First. She says data centers employ a mix of low-skill and high-skill technical workers to manage servers in addition to security guards and maintenance roles. She says that while construction is happening, data centers often hire specialist electricians who travel from state to state to set up servers.

For this reason, she says, Meta is not the only tech company hesitant to guarantee local hiring when negotiating data center contracts. “They know that some of these jobs require skills that people in the local community just don’t have.”

In response to questions from WIRED, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said, “We make a concerted effort to source labor locally and provide substantial contributions directly to the community.” Clayton said that for part-time construction roles, its contractors were “working on hiring local talent” and that they would host information fairs early next year. For permanent data center jobs, Clayton said Meta would be hiring “technical operators, electricians, air-conditioning and heating specialists, logistics staff, security, and more.”

Meta’s Louisiana Tax Breaks

The state’s agreement with Meta makes clear that as public land, the property Meta is leasing is exempt from traditional taxes. It creates a menu of options for what the company would potentially owe in “payment in lieu of taxes” (PILOT), a common agreement that lets local governments offer tax breaks with provisions attached. The agreement offers Meta qualified exemptions from both sales tax and property tax.

To get the lowest level of property tax exemptions, Meta would need to invest $5 billion into the state and hire the equivalent of 300 full-time employees. At this level, Meta would have to pay 40 percent of the assessed property tax. If the company invests at least $10 billion by December 2032, it would get the highest exemption, paying 20 percent of the assessed property tax.

The agreement sets out hiring timelines that the company must also hit to receive these tax incentives: Meta can receive the highest property tax exemption as long as it hires the equivalent of 300 “full-time” jobs by 2030, 450 by 2032, 475 by 2033 and 500 by December 31, 2034.

Louisiana’s agreements ask for more than some other states’ tax subsidies. According to Good Jobs First, nearly half of state tax subsidies for data centers don’t require any new jobs to be created. But Miller has concerns that the tax breaks were not necessary at all to entice a company as large as Meta. “While everyone likes to avoid taxes, they’re not going to hire people in Richland [Parish] just because they’re going to get a tax break,” Miller says.

Louisiana had already amended a tax rebate to create an exemption for data centers in 2024 to entice Meta; in its latest iteration, it says data centers can receive a full sales tax exemption for equipment purchases in the state as long as they hire 50 full-time jobs and invest at least $200 million by July 1, 2029. A separate contract viewed by WIRED affirms that this applies to the Richland Parish data center, in addition to the PILOT agreement.

Good Jobs First says that at least 10 states have subsidies for data centers that are worth more than $100 million each, and “have suffered estimated losses of $100 million each in tax revenue for data centers,” according to its data. In total, these states forgo more than $3 billion in taxes annually for data centers. Texas revised the cost of its data center subsidy in 2025 from $130 million to $1 billion. In 2024, a pause on data center subsidies was passed in Georgia but vetoed by governor Brian Kemp.

The Franklin Farms site in Holly Ridge, the area of Richland Parish where Meta’s data center is being built, was purchased by Louisiana specifically for economic development projects. In its ground lease with Meta, Louisiana offered the 1,400-acre plot to the company for $12 million, which the lease says was the cost to the state of acquiring and maintaining the land. The lease also says Meta’s $732,000 a year “rent” is “credit toward the Base Purchase Price,” meaning the company will have paid for the property by a little over 16 years into its 30-year lease.

The price for the potential sale would be slightly higher if Meta does not reach minimum hiring and investment thresholds: As an example, the lease says if Meta only spends $4 billion in the state instead of $5 billion, the property would end up costing it $19 million. Louisiana Economic Development reserves the right to reclaim the property if Meta doesn’t invest at least $3.75 billion and hire the equivalent of 225 “full-time” jobs by 2028. When asked if Meta plans to purchase the property, Clayton said, “We’ll keep you updated on our future plans for this site.”

Meta’s presence has already caused land values to jump. A nearby tract of 4,000 acres of land in Holly Ridge is for sale for $160 million, or $40,000 per acre—more than 4.5 times the price paid by Louisiana for the data center’s site.

But there’s also a concern that Meta could delay or abandon the data center project. The PILOT agreement its subsidiary signed with the state says the company’s timeline will depend on “numerous factors outside of the control of the lessee, such as market orientation and demand, competition, availability of qualified laborers to construct and/or weather conditions.”

“My general fear is that too many data centers are being built,” Miller says. “That means some of the data centers are just going to be abandoned by the owners.”

She says in the scenario that Big Tech cuts back investments in data centers, Meta would not even be able to find another buyer. “Essentially, the state will be stuck with this warehouse full of computers,” Miller says.","https://media.wired.com/photos/68af58f4246764e1f361e9d1/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/What-Meta-Doesn't-Want-You-To-Know-Data-Center-Business-2194360641.jpg",N,,2025-09-22 12:06:54.156332

Cape Town depot upgrade

In South Africa, EV charging solutions provider Autel Energy announced its MaxiCharger DC Fast technology will support the electrification of Cape Town’s bus fleet. Autel will install 50 new charging units at the Arrowgate Depot, where it previously provided 30 units, supporting 120 electric buses. It is the largest public EV bus charging hub in South Africa.

UK firm scores 50 bus supply deal, First Bus adds to its fleet

Elsewhere, UK-based technology company Equipmake has signed a deal with Brazilian vehicle manufacturer Agrale SA to supply it with electric drivetrains for 50 buses.

The £5.45 million order (US$7.35 million) comes after an initial order Agrale made for five zero emission drivetrains in August 2024. Under the terms of this new agreement, Equipmake will deliver fully integrated electric drivetrain systems, combining an electric motor, inverter, control systems, and battery pack, in batches between now and mid-2026.

Brazil recently pioneered a world-first initiative to operate a regular service of fully electric bi-articulated buses.

Also in the UK, Norfolk County Council and First Bus will bring 24 electric double-decker buses to the road in Norfolk, UK, adding to an already operating fleet of 76 electric buses.

Through a £13.8 million investment, £8.9 million of which comes from First Bus, with the remainder provided as part of Norfolk’s Bus Service Improvement Plan grant, will upgrade two depots to support a larger electric fleet.

The Caister Road depot, in Great Yarmouth, will support 10 ebuses and the Vulcan Road depot in Norwich will accommodate 14.

Indian government pledges to double ebus fleet

In India, Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta announced that the number of electric buses operating in the City will double by next year. Currently, 3,000 ebuses operate in the Indian capital, and Gupta committed to increasing the fleet at a ceremony marking the beginning of construction of a Delhi Transport Corporation depot, which will feature 84 charging stations for ebuses.

Gupta said that the project is part of the Delhi government’s vision of a Vikshit (developed) Delhi with “stronger transport and better last-mile connectivity”.

EBRD backs Egyptian ebuses

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), meanwhile, is backing the launch of an inter-city electric bus fleet in Egypt with a €10.6 million (US$12.4 million) loan to Go Bus for Transport, the country’s first privately owned inter-city bus company.

Through its European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus initiative, the European Union will provide 10% first-loss risk cover for the loan, which will enable Go Bus to acquire 30 new buses, six electric micro-buses and three other EVs for intra-city journeys.

Other EV infrastructure funding by EBRD saw €60 million committed to finance construction of 600 EV chargepoints across the Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, due to be fully installed by the end of 2027.

Under the modified ordinance, users of city charging stations will be charged 25 cents per kilowatt-hour for Level 2 charging stations and 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for Level 3 charging stations.

Currently, Batavia has just one Level 2 charging station in the west parking lot at City Hall, per the city. But it’s set to get two Level 3 chargers soon: one downtown and another at Batavia High School, a project partially funded by state grant money.

Level 3 charging, or direct-current fast charging, essentially provides more miles of range with a shorter charge time, according to the Alternative Fuels Data Center from the United States Department of Energy.

Batavia’s new downtown station was originally planned for Shumway Avenue near Flinn Street, but, at a recent meeting, Batavia’s Electric Superintendent Steve Allen said the city is looking for a new location.

The city is aiming to have the Batavia High School chargers go live at the end of the month, a city spokesperson told The Beacon-News on Friday. The city has not yet settled on a downtown location for the second new charging station.

The city first installed a charging station at City Hall in 2018, according to Allen, but he said the current rate of 40 cents per kilowatt-hour is now “much too high.” So, to make rates comparable to nearby communities, he suggested reducing the rate for the Level 2 chargers and instituting a rate of 50 cents per kilowatt-hour for the new Level 3 charging stations.

At the Batavia City Council Committee of the Whole meeting on Sept. 9, council members also discussed instituting a grace period for customers moving their vehicles out of the charging spots and whether to implement a fee for those who leave their cars in the spot beyond it reaching a full charge.

Allen originally suggested a 10-minute grace period, but Ald. Abby Beck suggested increasing it to 20 to 30 minutes.

The council also discussed a fee of $1 per minute that a user would be charged for leaving their car in the space past the grace period to move their vehicle.

Ald. Christopher Solfa said the overage fee seemed “a bit aggressive.”

Ald. Alan Wolff, on the other hand, said that the app customers use to pay for charging prompts customers when their vehicle is finished charging to ensure that the next person can use it.

“It’s not like we’re looking for money to have a parking space there,” Wolff said. “It’s to keep the thing charging cars. When one’s done, move it, get another one in there.”

Allen also indicated that the stations are not intended as a way for the city to generate money.

“I don’t think these are an economic boon, unfortunately,” Allen said. “I just think they’re a great thing for our community to have.”

These conversations are happening as Batavia is considering other aspects of its energy future. Recently, for example, the city passed an updated energy policy meant to guide where the city chooses to source its power from, what kinds of sources it relies on and sustainability goals.

The city currently gets its energy via an agreement with the Northern Illinois Municipal Power Agency, or NIMPA, a joint action agency made up of Batavia, Geneva and the city of Rochelle, according to past reporting. NIMPA is a partial owner of the Prairie State energy campus, according to its website, and power from Prairie State is distributed to NIMPA members, including Batavia.

Prairie State, a coal-fired power plant in southern Illinois, has previously been ranked one of the top 10 biggest polluters in the country, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At the meeting, Beck also expressed support for the charging stations, in particular the locations in the city.

“Having it be a draw, like, ‘Oh, and I can go get a cup of coffee or I can get something while I’m charging,’ is just fantastic,” she said.

The council ultimately landed on considering a 30-minute grace period and the $1 per-minute charge after that, but the details generated further debate from the council when the matter headed to a final vote on Sept. 15.

At that meeting, Ald. Dustin Pieper floated the possibility of putting a cap on how much a person would get charged for leaving their car in the spot and mentioned the possibility of whether a car would be towed if left in one of the spots for a long period of time. He also suggested adding signage that instructs users to contact the city if there’s an extenuating circumstance that prevents someone from moving their car.

Ald. Kevin Malone said he was in support of a cap on an overage fee.

“I think we can set it at a rate that makes it hurt enough that they don’t forget again, but also isn’t … us kind of price-gouging,” Malone said.

The council also discussed modeling the fee after the fee charged when someone parks in an accessible parking space.

Ald. James Fahrenbach said there should be a cap on the fee levied, but said it should be high and noted that the risk of an electric vehicle breaking down is pretty low compared to a non-EV.

Asked by Wolff how this would be monitored, Allen said that use of the charger is monitored through the machine at the charging station, but if someone chose to return to their car to disconnect the charger from the car but leave their car parked there, the city would be reliant on surveillance methods or complaints to enforce compliance.

Beck asked about how many minutes they would enforce the $1 per-minute fee for, and several council members discussed whether situations like this had come up.

Most Batavia residents don’t have electric vehicles currently, per the results of a recent citywide survey of residents. Only 10.6% of just under 800 respondents indicated that they own or lease an electric vehicle, and more than half of respondents said they don’t intend to buy one, according to past reporting.

Allen said the city hasn’t received complaints of cars parked at the charging station while not charging.

Ald. Leah Leman noted that the council was discussing two different situations: a user of the charging station leaving their vehicle in the spot beyond it reaching a full charge, versus a non-EV driver using the space for parking.

Batavia Police Chief Eric Blowers pointed to state statute, which stipulates a $75 fine for parking a non-EV at an EV charging station, and allows municipalities to increase that fine to $100.

Wolff suggested utilizing the $100 fine for a non-EV parked in a city-owned charging station and a $120 cap on the per-minute charge for an electric vehicle staying in the space beyond the grace period, as well as having the city provide a link or QR code at the charging stations to the city ordinance so users are aware of the rules. Malone also supported the $120 cap.

The new rates, along with the 30-minute grace period and a $1 per-minute overage fee, were ultimately approved by the council unanimously on Sept. 15.

Scientists agree that harnessing the energy released as atoms fuse together could produce incredible amounts of low carbon power.
Whichever confinement process is used, the goal is to sustain the fusion reaction long enough and with enough energy to achieve a new power gain.

The remainder of the funding, about $6.1 million will go to the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program to support 20 projects intended to accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities.","WASHINGTON — Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said he believes the United States could be harnessing fusion energy electricity in the next decade.

In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, Wright said, “I believe we will know the commercial pathway to fusion during the Trump administration.”

“Commercial electricity from fusion energy could be as fast as eight years and I’d be very surprised if it’s more than 15,” he added.

The comments by Wright, who studied nuclear fusion while attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and University of California, Berkeley, are similar to statements he made to the BBC earlier this month.

During that interview he said, “With artificial intelligence and what’s going on at the national labs and private companies in the United States, we will have that approach about how to harness fusion energy multiple ways within the next five years.

“The technology, it’ll be on the electric grid in eight to 15 years,” he said.

Scientists agree that harnessing the energy released as atoms fuse together could produce incredible amounts of low carbon power. However, they are generally far less confident than Wright on the timeline for that happening.

The challenge is the complexity of the process. While nuclear fusion occurs all the time in outer space, replicating the process on Earth involves heating atoms to temperatures many times hotter than the sun.

To get a little more technical, it involves heating deuterium and tritium to over 100 million degrees Celsius to create a plasma and then confining this plasma using strong magnetic fields in a tokamak or by applying immense pressure with lasers.

A tokamak is an experimental device that uses powerful magnetic fields to confine plasma in a doughnut shape.

Whichever confinement process is used, the goal is to sustain the fusion reaction long enough and with enough energy to achieve a new power gain.

And it was only three years ago that researchers at the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California announced they were able for the first time to produce a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed.

But the Energy Department remains committed to the cause.

Earlier this month, it announced it was committing $134 million to two programs “designed to secure U.S. leadership in emerging fusion technologies and innovation.”

At the time Wright said, “Fusion power holds the promise of limitless, reliable, American-made energy” and he said the programs – the Fusion Innovation Research Engine collaboratives and the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy would “ensure our innovators have the tools, talent and partnerships to make it a reality.”

Of the total, the Fusion Innovative Research Engine collaboratives will receive about $128 million in funding to be divided among seven teams that are creating a fusion energy science and technology innovation ecosystem composed of virtual, centrally managed teams.

The teams have been charged specifically with creating a bridge between the basic science research programs of the DOE’s Fusion Energy Sciences initiative and growing fusion industries.

The remainder of the funding, about $6.1 million will go to the Innovation Network for Fusion Energy program to support 20 projects intended to accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities.

The projects selected include research in materials science, laser technology development, high temperature superconducting magnet assessment, artificial intelligence learning for fusion modeling and simulation, and enabling technologies to move toward achieving economical fusion energy.

On the private sector side, the potential of fusion energy has led to sizable investments from billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and more recently, sovereign wealth funds and national wealth banks have been throwing their resources behind the effort.

Under the non-binding deal, the EU committed to importing $250 billion annually of US energy, or $750 billion in total, by 2028, with LNG expected to anchor this expansion. The deal covers natural gas, oil, and nuclear fuels, paired with an additional $600 billion of investment in the US economy.

However, GECF labels these targets as unrealistic and believes the deal could face the same fate as the energy targets of the 2019 US–China trade deal, which remained unmet since the deal created no legal obligation for either side, much like the deal in question.

The Forum bases its analysis on several factors, including, among others, the decline in EU gas demand, infrastructure bottlenecks, and the fact that the EU’s climate policies conflict with deeper fossil fuel dependence, as recently echoed by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB).

Background

The US introduced hefty new tariffs in April 2025 to shield domestic industries from foreign competition and to realign international trade in favor of US economic interests. GECF sees this as happening in a context of a seismic shift in the global trade system toward protectionism.

A baseline 10% tariff on imports from 185 countries was introduced, with a 20% country-specific tariff applying to EU member states. These higher tariffs have been repeatedly suspended, which GECF interprets to signal their use as leverage rather than as a permanent trade measure.

The tariffs were paired with an Executive Order providing for the reduction of tariffs if a trading partner takes “substantial steps” to address the US trade deficit. Since the EU represents 18% of total US imports, it emerged as the focal point of the US’s discussions with partners to address trade imbalances.

In late July, the duo worked out a framework trade deal in which most EU goods would be subject to a 15% import tariff. Additionally, the EU committed to importing $750 billion of US energy by 2028 and investing an additional $600 billion in the US economy.

Since the US exported around $70 billion worth of energy to the EU in 2024, the $250 billion annual commitment would represent more than a threefold increase for the EU, whose total energy import bill reached $407 billion in 2024.

Between 2021 and 2024, the share of pipeline gas in total EU consumption dropped by 20%, from 70% to 50%, while LNG’s share rose by the same amount, from 20% to 40%. This enabled the US to boost its gas exports to the EU from 6% to 19% and LNG from 28% to 45% over the same period.

The trend accelerated in the first half of 2025, when LNG imports surpassed pipeline gas imports in the EU for the first time. The North American country’s LNG exports to the EU amounted to $20 billion in 2024.

Possible issues

While the EU’s imports from the US could reach record levels by the year’s end, the report states the trade deal’s targets are highly ambitious, noting that both sides seem to be overpromising what can realistically be bought and sold.

The US currently has 105 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of operational LNG capacity, with an additional 115 Mtpa under construction and 100 Mtpa of planned capacity targeting FID.

Some notable projects in the development stage include Woodside Energy’s Louisiana LNG project, which is said to be 22% complete, and Venture Global’s CP2 LNG, for which $15.1 billion in financing was recently secured.

Therefore, a maximum of 100 Mtpa is theoretically available for future deals. This is expected to be even lower in practice as Asian countries have expressed their interest in purchasing US LNG, for example, in the case of Alaska LNG.

Supplying the full 100 Mtpa at current spot prices would generate only $60 billion annually for the US, which is well below the levels needed to make a meaningful contribution to the EU-US trade agreement, the report states.

An additional issue is the EU’s lack of gas demand to absorb additional LNG volumes from the US. Regional gas consumption fell sharply from 400 bcm in 2021 to 313 bcm in 2024, driven by a combination of structural and cyclical factors.

With the Union’s gas demand expected to remain flat or even decline slightly by the end of this decade, a major expansion of US LNG supply to the EU market could be limited.

Additionally, even though the EU is approving new LNG projects, capacity utilization rates remain around 50% because of the limited gas interconnection infrastructure. One example of this is Spain. While having the largest regasification capacity in the EU, the country lacks pipeline connections with neighbouring countries, so LNG cannot be distributed regionally.

The report further states that substituting spot and short-term LNG volumes from other suppliers is the best course of action for boosting US LNG exports because the majority of gas and LNG imports in the EU are tied to long-term contracts and are not easily redirected. However, there is limited scope for this to happen since a large share of spot and short-term LNG volumes already came from the US in 2024.

Another potential problem highlighted in the report is the fact that, whatever the authorities agree on, the final commercial decisions will rest with private companies. GECF explained that the EU companies base their decisions on profitability, and governments can only signal support or provide incentives, not compel them to buy US gas.

A final consideration is the fact that a boost in US LNG imports is at odds with the EU’s long-term climate objectives and net-zero objectives. The EU methane regulation is an additional factor complicating the situation and making the increase in US LNG imports difficult to achieve.

GECF feels that Europe could be at a disadvantage with the deal, as it could undermine climate credibility, increase the risk of stranded assets, and complicate the clean energy transition intended to support sustainable economic growth.

In conclusion, the organization believes that while the EU–US trade deal could theoretically have an impact on the global LNG market, it is more likely to function as a political signal of solidarity than as a major commercial driver of energy trade growth, particularly in the LNG segment.

“Moreover, roughly 250 Mtpa of LNG export capacity is under construction worldwide, and overall supply is expected to grow in line with rising global gas demand under stable prices. This expansion provides sufficient room for all major LNG suppliers.

“With Asia driving the bulk of future LNG import growth, any additional US LNG directed to the EU is likely to be offset by increased supplies to Asia from other producers, primarily GECF member countries, thereby maintaining overall market equilibrium,” the report concludes.",https://cdn.offshorewind.biz/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/04/29073650/Louisiana-LNG-1.jpg?image-crop-positioner-ts=1745905011,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:58.916852

This summer, Florida was the No. 1 economy in the country in CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings. The achievement comes thanks to the bold leadership of Gov. Ron DeSantis and our state leaders, the illustrious businesses that call this state home and the hard-working families that make it all possible. Recently proposed utility rate hikes would only put an undue burden on the working families that are foundational to Florida’s success.

The day President Donald Trump took office, he vowed to unleash affordable and reliable American energy to curb the rising energy costs that “devastate American consumers by driving up the cost of transportation, heating, utilities, farming and manufacturing, while weakening our national security.” Florida should be following the president’s lead.

I work alongside families, businesses and community leaders across the state, and I’ve seen the negative impact of high energy costs firsthand. Florida must continue innovating and preparing the power grid for growth and storms, but higher utility bills are not the answer, and they fly in the face of Trump and DeSantis’ leadership.

A recent proposal before the Public Service Commission would hike rates by 10.5% for millions of Floridians. Even a modest monthly increase can push working families and seniors on fixed incomes to choose between necessities and will work against our state’s nation-leading economic growth. Further, rate increases have historically failed to deliver on their promised results, a fact commissioners should remember.

The commission should require greater accountability and provide more public transparency before approving new increases. Families, seniors and small businesses deserve assurances that their needs will come first and that any increase truly leads to stronger service and long-term value.

The good news is that we have smarter options.

Florida communities have shown that it is possible to strengthen resilience and reliability without raising household costs. When modern infrastructure and innovative technology are put to work, families benefit from lower electric bills and service they can count on, even when severe storms hit.

These kinds of forward-looking investments prove that innovation can protect both pocketbooks and peace of mind for Florida families. Florida leaders could explore even more market-based approaches to lowering household utility bills by increasing transparency and allowing more public input into the energy resource planning process.

Florida can modernize its grid, expand cleaner and more cost-effective technologies, and prepare for future growth without saddling families with higher bills. Affordability, reliability and innovation must go hand in hand if we want to secure a brighter energy future for Florida.

The U.S. clean energy workforce now stands at 3.56 million. In 2024, 7% of all new jobs in the United States were in clean energy, and clean energy represented 82% of all new energy sector jobs.

Despite these strong numbers, the nearly 100,000 jobs added marked a significant slowdown, adding about 50,000 fewer jobs than in 2023. E2 attributed the slowdown to federal policy uncertainty and an overall slowing economy. Find the full jobs report and methodology here.

In 2025, job growth slowdowns and investment cancellations persist. E2 research shows that since January 2025, businesses cancelled more than $22 billion of planned clean energy factories and projects that were expected to create 16,500 jobs. Analysis by Energy Innovation suggests that more than 830,000 jobs could be lost due to policy rollbacks created by the Trump Administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

(Read: Trump: “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying solar”)

The E2 report said clean energy jobs now represents 42% of all energy jobs in America and 2.3% of the overall national workforce. More people now work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers, said the report.

More than 520,000 jobs have now been added by the clean energy and clean vehicle sectors over the last five years, an increase of 17%, which far outpaces the fossil fuel industry’s creation of jobs and triples the broader U.S. job growth rate over the five year span.

“Every year, clean energy jobs become more intertwined and critical to our overall economy,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications for E2. “These jobs are now a vital anchor of America’s energy workforce.”

On May 29, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill No. 3809 into law, adding new provisions to the Texas Utilities Code that impose decommissioning and financial assurance requirements for certain battery energy storage facility agreements in the state [H.B. 3809]. Shortly thereafter, on June 20, 2025, Governor Abbott signed House Bill No. 3228 into law, creating similar decommissioning and financial assurance obligations for wind and solar facility leases [H.B. 3228].

Both bills took effect on September 1, 2025, and apply only to agreements entered into on or after that date [Section 3 of H.B. 3809; Section 8 of H.B. 3228]. Solar, wind, and energy storage developers operating in Texas should ensure that their lease forms reflect these new obligations.

Battery Energy Storage

Under H.B. 3809, battery energy storage facility leases, other than those involving an electric utility, must include specific obligations for the tenant relating to the decommissioning of the facility, including the safe removal of facility and storage resources and the recycling of all recyclable components [New Sections 303.0004(a)-(b) of the Tex. Util. Code]. Additionally, tenants must provide financial assurance to the landowner before the earlier of the facility lease’s termination date or the 15th-anniversary of the battery operation date [New Section 303.0005(e) of the Tex. Util. Code]. The assurance amount must be sufficient to cover the cost of removal, recycling or disposal, and property restoration, less the salvage value of the facilities and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [Id. at subsection (b)].

Wind Power Facilities

As amended by H.B. 3228, Section 301.0003 of the Texas Utilities Code now requires that wind facility leases include specific obligations for the tenant to recycle or reuse all recyclable components and to dispose of the remaining components at authorized facilities [New Section 301.0003(a-1) of the Tex. Util. Code]. H.B. 3228 also expanded financial assurance requirements for wind projects [New Section 301.0004 of the Tex. Util. Code]. The amount of financial assurance must be sufficient to cover the costs of removal, recycling or disposal, and restoration costs, less the salvage value and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [Id. at subsection (b)]. Updated cost and salvage estimates must be provided at least once every five years for the duration of the agreement, with the tenant responsible for all costs associated with compliance [Id. at subsection (c)].

Solar Facilities

As amended by H.B. 3228, Sections 302.0004 and 302.0005 of the Texas Utilities Code impose similar obligations for solar power facility agreements [New Sections 302.0004-.0005 of the Tex. Util. Code]. Solar power facility agreements must now require tenants to recycle or reuse all recyclable components and to dispose of all other components at designated facilities [Id. at Section 302.0004(a-1)]. Additionally, the amount of financial assurance provided must be sufficient to cover removal, recycling or disposal, and restoration costs, less the salvage value and any portion of the value of the facilities pledged to secure outstanding debt [New Section 302.0005(b) of the Tex. Util. Code]. The first updated estimate is required on or before the tenth anniversary of the commercial operations date and further updates must be provided at least every five years [Id. at subsection (c)(2)]. The tenant is responsible for all associated costs [Id. at subsection (d)].

Conclusion

When taken together, H.B. 3809 and H.B. 3228 impose new requirements for storage, solar, and wind projects in Texas to remove, recycle, and dispose of such facilities [H.B. 3809; H.B. 3228]. Because all leases entered into after September 1, 2025, are required to comply with these new requirements, developers should check their site control forms to ensure that they are compliant with the current version of the Texas Utility Code [Section 3 of H.B. 3809; Section 8 of H.B. 3228].","https://images.passle.net/fit-in/400x400/filters:crop(0,0,2306,1298)/Passle/671960b986748a978b266239/SearchServiceImages/2025-09-22-14-58-02-222-68d163fac4095be329b8b384.jpg",N,,2025-09-22 13:06:59.841212

Dive Brief:

North American utilities are “increasingly looking to distributed resources” to meet data centers’ rapidly growing power demand amid ongoing challenges for large-scale generation deployment, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said last week.

Their interest spurred a surge in virtual power plant deployments last year, Wood Mackenzie Global Head of Grid Edge Ben Hertz-Shargel said in a Sept. 17 note. The numbers of active company deployments, unique offtakers for VPP capacity and monetized VPP programs all grew by at least one-third year over year, according to WoodMac’s data.

But overall VPP capacity in North America grew only 13.7%, to 37.5 GW, indicating “a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening” due to persistent barriers to adoption, Hertz-Shargel said.

Wood Mackenzie counted 1,940 North American virtual power plant deployments this year, up 33% from 2024. Its count of monetized VPP programs — which pay distributed energy resource owners to dispatch energy or curtail consumption — showed the number of programs rose 35% year over year, from 321 last year to 433 this year.

The number of unique offtakers for VPP capacity increased 38% this year from 2024, WoodMac said. More than half of all offtakers increased the number of VPP deployments serving them by at least 30% year over year. And the top 25 offtakers each procured 100 MW or more in 2025.

WoodMac attributed the increased offtake, in part, to an emerging “independent distributed power producer” business model. Independent distributed power producers, it explained, are electricity retailers that finance third-party-owned energy storage offerings through grid service revenue and energy arbitrage — charging batteries when electricity prices are low and discharging them when prices are high.

Third-party-owned energy storage retains relatively favorable regulatory treatment under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republican budget law that curtailed hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy funding authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

WoodMac’s research suggests a correlation between growth in VPP offtakers and utility commitments to data center capacity. The consultancy found particularly robust VPP offtake in the PJM Interconnection and Electric Reliability Council of Texas regions, both of which have substantial existing and projected data center capacity. In July, American Electric Power said its utilities expect to interconnect 18 GW of data center capacity by 2030, largely in ERCOT and PJM.

In his note, Hertz-Shargel said the correlation could set up a win-win-win for utilities, data center operators and distributed energy resource owners.

“This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection,” he said. “Homeowners and business owners [with onsite energy resources] might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.”

But the modest increase in capacity relative to deployments, offtakes and monetized programs reveals obstacles that must be overcome before VPPs can reach their full potential, Hertz-Shargel said.

Those obstacles include enrollment caps on utility VPP programs, power market reforms that reduce VPPs’ capacity accreditation and market barriers for small customers, he said.

Brattle Group principal and distributed energy resources expert Ryan Hledik said the findings align with what he’s seeing in the distributed energy market. But he’s optimistic that VPP capacity will scale soon, given the urgency utilities and data center operators feel to source electrons wherever they can find them.

“Data center load growth appeared almost overnight, and the industry’s appreciation that VPPs could play an important role in that area has emerged even more recently than that,” said Hledik, who was not involved in Wood Mackenzie’s research.

Hledik said VPP providers, utilities and data center companies “are still gearing up to align on the right solutions,” but that work hasn’t significantly impacted overall VPP capacity yet.

“My hunch is that the growth over the next 12 to 18 months will be more noticeable, and over the next three to five years the growth could be explosive,” he said.

Hledik added that some individual VPP programs in states like California are rapidly adding capacity. He pointed to a Brattle Group report last month that showed California’s Demand Side Grid Support VPP discharged 539 MW of average output, or about half the output of a large nuclear reactor, on the evening of July 29. The report said DSGS could provide net system cost savings of between $28 million and $206 million through 2028.

The California legislature unexpectedly zeroed out funding for DSGS earlier this month. A spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom suggested the program is less important now amid a surge in new generation deployments.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4ZrlU_-atHM1ekQWXlKPXqq6QPJivnU6LUq-kXrqq8c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTk1MzEwMzY3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 12:05:48.804519

The U.S. does not have a big enough power grid to accommodate rising energy demand — a fact that’s making electricity less affordable and reliable nationwide.

But there’s broad public support for growing the grid and allowing more electricity, including cheap, clean energy, to come online.

So says a new survey of likely voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania — two states in the severely backlogged PJM Interconnection grid region — and Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, which are covered by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). The survey was conducted by polling firm Cygnal on behalf of the Conservative Energy Network.

Roughly three-fourths of likely voters support expanding the electric grid, the survey found. About two-thirds are in favor of adding more transmission lines to connect clean energy and strengthen grid reliability.

And nearly 90% of respondents are concerned about rising energy costs. A majority of surveyed Republicans, Democrats, and Independents said they are ​“very concerned.”

“This is not a partisan issue. … You don’t have to appeal to one side or another,” said Chris Lane, a senior partner at Cygnal, who previewed the findings at the National Conservative Energy Summit in Cleveland on Aug. 25.

He noted that the results stand out for their consistency between regions and among different groups — including political parties. Even so, the Trump administration has in recent months worked against grid expansion, not toward it.

Adding more ​“lanes” to the grid

Energy costs are climbing in part because of rising power demand from data centers and the electrification of buildings and vehicles. Bringing more electricity generation online — especially quick-to-build, low-cost wind and solar — could increase competition and lower prices under the basic principles of supply and demand.

But just as transportation planners need to make sure highways can handle increased road traffic, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and regional transmission operators need to make sure the grid has room for more electrons. That calls for more ​“lanes” in the form of added transmission lines, plus technologies to squeeze more capacity out of the system overall.

Currently, ​“there aren’t enough power lines, they’re not all in the right places, and the ones we have are too outdated to meet the rising power demand for electricity,” Evelyn Robinson, director of PJM affairs for the renewable-energy industry group MAREC Action, said during a separate panel at the conference in Cleveland.

While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.

Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

They arrive in waves to ravaged areas ready to respond.

First in are the personnel trained to navigate the immediate crisis. Emergency managers run local shelters and coordinate on-the-ground response efforts, medics provide urgent medical care for those in need, and police, firefighters, and other public safety workers conduct search and rescue. Next, the skilled tradespeople show up, ready to restore and repair. Crews of utility linemen reconnect downed power lines, wastewater technicians fix damaged sewage infrastructure, and debris removal workers clear blocked roads and waterways.

Relief workers representing federal agencies, nonprofits, and humanitarian groups set up services to provide things like shelter, food, and water. And then there are crisis counselors, animal rescue units, hazmat crews, contractors, environmental scientists, and many others.

A legion of essential jobs contribute to America’s disaster workforce. As the world burns, floods, and melts around us, those jobs — and the people who do them — have never been more important.

Grist talked with more than a dozen people spread out across the United States who have worked on the ground following catastrophic disasters. We asked them to tell us about their jobs, why they do what they do, and what they’ve learned responding to extreme weather events.

Immediate Relief

Emergency manager

Last October, hours before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida, the Highlands County Emergency Management operations center was abuzz with tension. Staffers, first responders, and volunteers huddled around a large television broadcasting the weather radar. Their eyes were glued to the screen when tornado warnings blared on roughly 60 phones all at once.

The tornadoes were developing on the outer bands of the Category 4 storm, sending county emergency manager Corey Amundsen and his team into a mad dash. They raced to open last-minute shelters, conduct search and rescue operations, and warn community members to stay off roads. A total of 14 warnings were issued for the county; seven tornadoes touched down.

“We could actually see the debris balls from the tornadoes. I’ve got goose bumps now thinking about it,” said Amundsen. “We always hear tornadoes are possible in a hurricane,” but, he continued, “we weren’t expecting the amount of tornadoes. We actually had never seen that before.”

This hurricane season, Amundsen has implemented some new rules: His team is now mandated to begin ramping up operations at least 96 hours before a hurricane is expected to make landfall — up from 72 hours — to take into account the risk of pre-storm tornadoes. Amundsen has also since created step-by-step instructions on how to identify the safest locations for shelters amid tornado warnings and inform county residents where to go that’s out of the path of the storm.

“I’m one person,” he said. “When we go under a local state of emergency, I’m the guy who is supposed to have a plan for everything. I’m supposed to know everything, and I’m supposed to know what to do, how to do it, where to get it. It’s a lot of stress.” Amundsen has worked as an emergency manager for three years now, after seven years spent as a paramedic. “You have to be able to handle the worst possible stress you can without showing it to everyone else. If I look scared and I’m freaking out, then everyone is just going to follow suit, and then you’re going to have pure chaos.”

First responder and firefighter

In the nearly 40 years he’s been a volunteer firefighter in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, Chris Westveer has responded to every type of call imaginable. Fires, medical cases, hazmat incidents, car wrecks, floods. Westveer says the town’s volunteer-run fire station is “basically an all-hazards department.”

In all that time, though, nothing has ever come close to the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene in 2024, which maintained remarkable force by the time it reached North Carolina. “We weren’t caught off guard by its arrival,” he said. “We were caught off guard by how bad it was.”

It was 1:30 a.m. when Westveer was first called in to respond. The historic storm was in the process of dumping more than 2 feet of rain on Spruce Pine, washing out roads, toppling trees, destroying homes and businesses, and cutting power and water service. For the next few days, the tiny mountain community was isolated from the outside world, and Westveer worked nonstop.

The bulk of that period was spent in rescue mode: He pulled people out of homes damaged by mudslides or trees, and helped paramedics save someone having a seizure during the storm. He then focused on trying to clear blocked roadways and beginning to assess the unbelievable damage. “There are literally hundreds of moments that will be, unfortunately, forever etched in my mind,” said Westveer. “Dealing with people that have either lost loved ones or lost their entire belongings, or houses gone — it was a complete gamut of emotions every day.”

The experience prompted Westveer’s department to make significant changes to how seriously it takes hurricane forecasts and how it responds in the storms’ aftermath. Before Helene, not even Westveer had an at-home hurricane preparedness plan. Now, everyone does, and his department has spent the last year investing in updated equipment and resources, including generators for the stations, as well as new brush trucks and four-wheel drive engines to expand their ability to respond. They’ve also supported other public safety departments in the Spruce Pine community that have hosted trainings on how to develop emergency evacuation plans, how to fortify homes and businesses, and what should go into disaster kits, among other things. Those plans are now ready to be put to the test this storm season.

“This year, we’re very vigilant,” he said. “I mean, every time I hear of a storm approaching, I’m watching the news.”

Emergency food worker

In the wake of the July 4 floods in Texas, no two days were the same for Samantha Elfmont. She works as the global response director for the nonprofit World Central Kitchen and arrived in Hunt, Texas, the day after the disaster struck. She immediately jumped into project management mode. She directed mobile units on what to do and where to go; connected with local food banks, chefs, and restaurants for supplies; and communicated with her teams around the world. She spent almost three weeks feeding communities in Hill Country after the floods.

Every morning, she rolled out of bed around 5 a.m. and immediately checked her phone to catch up on any messages she missed from colleagues based around the world during the few hours she was able to sleep.

When Elmont is deployed somewhere, her job is to coordinate whatever resources are needed to make sure people are fed. In Texas, that meant much of her time was spent communicating with vendors and local chefs and ordering thousands of meals that she and her team handed out everyday, all while traveling around the hardest-hit areas to hand out lunches and talk with survivors and first responders. “For me, it’s always that bigger picture: What is our transition plan? Have we worked with the community to see what else they need?” said Elfmont. They also distributed grocery store gift cards for survivors who lost their homes, community members who had lost jobs because their workplaces were destroyed, and volunteer first responders who hadn’t been paid.

As someone who has worked in the humanitarian aid sector for over a decade, Elfmont says her biggest takeaway is that “you just cannot predict anything.” And as the frequency of disasters escalates because of climate change, so does the need for food in moments of emergency. But in those moments, Elfmont said, “It doesn’t matter where it is in the world. What matters is when people need food, and they don’t have access to food.”

Wastewater systems mechanic

Cricket Logan has worked for the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, for 21 years as a wastewater management mechanic. Logan is almost always in motion — identifying where the problems are in his assigned section of the plant that cleans St. Pete’s water, removing debris from pipes using high-pressure fluids, and racing to weld makeshift replacements while figuring out the best possible plans for repairs. “Most of it is straightforward mechanical work,” he said.

Logan’s facility is the only wastewater treatment plant in the city that handles solids. If it goes down, the city’s sewage pipes back up. Logan said it “really doesn’t take near as long as you think” before that sewage begins spilling out into homes and streets.

That’s why, every storm season, Logan and his colleagues are on call before, during, and after hurricanes, while most other residents are hunkered down. Come June, Logan knows he needs to stash about a week’s worth of food and clothes in his locker in preparation. “It’s part of my job,” said Logan, “we’re considered ‘emergency essential.’”

Not much about working in hurricane response had ever rattled Logan — until Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the same stretch of St. Petersburg just weeks apart last fall. The night Helene touched down, Logan’s crew was instructed to leave. “For the first time I’m aware of, in probably 50, 60, 70 years, we shut down the entire plant completely and jumped in our work trucks and drove downtown [to shelter],” he said. “And then at three in the morning, they came in and said, ‘Get back out there.’” The hurricane was still raging on as he rushed back into work.

With the crew off duty, the wastewater systems had failed. Untreated sewage overflowed from dozens of manholes throughout the city and seeped into homes. Residents in some sections of the city were advised not to flush toilets or drain sinks for at least 48 hours after the storm to prevent more backups. “We’re really in a moment that nobody has seen,” he said.

Federal response worker

It was late September 2017, and Hurricane Maria had just lashed Puerto Rico, causing devastating damage to the archipelago, including its hospital infrastructure. As a member of the U.S. Disaster Medical Assistance Team, a subsidiary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Sue Anne Bell was deployed to San Juan, where she spent six weeks providing emergency medical care. Every night, she’d treat up to 80 patients in the tents of a field hospital.

Many patients just needed medication refills. Others needed help with physical injuries caused during the storm or cleanup. Then there was the treatment for conditions likely triggered by the trauma of the hurricane and limited food resources available, such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

Underlying it all was resource strain. Three weeks after Maria roared through Puerto Rico’s main island, a young child and their mom showed up to Bell’s emergency center tent. The child was experiencing a serious asthma attack. Bell and her team didn’t have the facilities to help them. The few hospitals that hadn’t been damaged by the storm denied their requests to transfer the patient because they were under-resourced and understaffed. “I just remember thinking, ‘What will we do if this child’s condition worsens?’” she said.

Bell remembers spending 10 or so hours monitoring the child’s dangerously deteriorating condition in the tent, repeatedly calling hospital after hospital. Finally, they lucked out when one a few miles away agreed to take them.

It’s a situation Bell finds over and over in the field. In the wake of disasters, local hospitals and clinics are quickly overwhelmed. Issues like a lack of power or water send droves of patients to field hospitals that may lack adequate tools or resources to help people. “These other hospitals were saying, ‘We can’t safely care for this patient.’ We’re saying, ‘We can’t safely care for this patient,’” she said. “And so we had to work out, ‘Where can they get the best care they can? And how do we make that decision?’”

Medical specialist

After 35 years as a registered nurse and hospital manager in Sarasota, Florida, Mary Mitchell is no stranger to hurricane response and recovery. Mitchell has lived and worked through dozens of major storms, and in time, she developed a routine for when a hurricane approaches: Walk her team through the hospital’s disaster preparedness checklist, make sure everyone has a personal evacuation plan, prepare backup copies of patient medical records in case of power loss, and pack an overnight bag in case she needs to stay long-term at the hospital.

But when Hurricane Ian barreled through southwestern Florida on September 28, 2022, her regular disaster playbook was thrown out.

The morning after the Category 4 storm hit, killing at least 148 people, Mitchell drove to a disaster response zone assembling outside of a local hospital to handle the large number of patients needing medical care after the storm. She spent four days supporting the work being done in the mobile medical tent, figuring out care logistics, technical and operational necessities, and helping medical staff.

Mitchell vividly remembers seeing “dazed looks” on the faces of those who stopped by the tent for care. “They were pale, and you could tell they were exhausted,” she said. Many of them, mostly elderly, were covered in wounds inflicted by Ian. Others were visibly dehydrated. She couldn’t help but wonder if they had family there to help them, or if they had any neighbors or friends who were aware they had been hurt. “You’re hearing these stories. You’re seeing these patients,” said Mitchell. “Everybody was affected.”

Utility lineman

Zach Wood has worked as a lineman for about a decade, installing and repairing power lines for a number of utility companies across the country. The danger and physical risk is a big downside of the job, he said, but the demand and pay has been growing rapidly in recent years as the planet warms and climate disasters get worse. “The more intense and more frequent storms definitely work out well for linemen. We’re making more money every year that the weather gets crazier,” said Wood.

Last year, Wood took a new approach: He did what he calls “storm chasing.” He moved from job to job on short contracts based on the weather, showing up after everything from hurricanes to winter storms in more than seven states. The days were long and brutal — Wood worked 16-hour shifts on average. He dug holes, reset downed power lines, shimmied up poles, and cleared debris that had fallen on wires. “In a storm, the goal is to get everybody’s lights back on … as fast as we can,” he said. “But I’ve seen many people get hurt and injured because they are moving too fast.”

For someone like Wood, who gets paid more when the damage is worse, it’s easy to feel somewhat conflicted about the progression of climate change. “We know that hurricanes damage people’s lives and stuff, but it’s our livelihood,” he said. “So we’re sitting here, like, rooting for it to turn into a Category 5 and really tear some stuff up, because we’ll get two months of storm pay out of it, which sounds heartless and mean, but … it’s our paycheck. It’s like the funeral business.”

Rebuilding and Recovery

Debris removal crew

When Hurricane Helene tore through Asheville, North Carolina, last September, it dispersed millions of pounds of debris throughout one of the world’s oldest rivers. The French Broad River was “absolutely demolished,” said Jon Stamper — so much so that it prompted the local nonprofit MountainTrue to create his job as a post-Helene river cleanup coordinator.

“It’s really hard for me to describe the scale of the devastation here,” he said. Everything from trees to whole houses was swallowed up by the storm’s high-velocity floods. “It’s photos, it’s trophies, it’s Grandma’s plate set, it’s stuffed animals, it’s toys and playground equipment. I mean, it’s just anything that you could ever think of that existed somewhere in a town, in a home, in a community, or in a factory.”

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and private contractors removed most of the large-scale debris, like houses and cars, from the waterways they littered. That left the rest to local crews like Stamper’s.

On December 4, just a few days on the job, Stamper hosted his first organized cleanup of the watershed. With a donated SUV and a dump trailer, Stamper and 25 volunteers began the grueling work of clearing a sliver of French Broad River by hand. “There are islands on the river that have apartment-sized debris jams, logs, and intertwined PVC pipe that we’re actually out there cutting out,” said Stamper.

Since that first cleanup, his team has removed what Stamper estimates to be 800,000 pounds of debris. The job is a new direction for him: Stamper is a combat veteran of the war in Afghanistan and served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He says he “found his home on the river” after struggling upon returning from military service. His goal is now to protect those places. “This is really hard, tedious work, picking up trash,” he said. “It’s also emotionally taxing. We’re talking about picking up people’s lives. There is no playbook for this.”

Disaster response expert

Jorge Vera was a 34-year-old disaster specialist for the American Red Cross when Hurricane Andrew hit Florida on August 24, 1992. Within 48 hours, he was boarding a military airplane to Miami. When he landed, the scene took his breath away.

“It looked like a bomb had dropped,” he said. “Miami was literally devastated. All of the basic infrastructure in the community was gone. It was chaos.”

For Vera, the next three weeks were a blur. People needed food, medical attention, and a secure place to sleep. Vera’s job was to set up Red Cross shelters equipped to provide all of that and more.

“You have a plan A, plan B, plan C, and then try to sort out which is the better one at the time you respond,” he said. “There’s nothing romantic about it. There’s no room to kind of check yourself, or go, ‘Oh my God, what’s happening?’ Or, ‘What am I doing?’ It’s just go, go, go, go. There’s no time, whatsoever.”

While still working to respond to Andrew, Vera was hired to lead emergency services as a director for the Red Cross in Miami and the Florida Keys. Though he “fell” into the career, in part incentivized by the Red Cross’ tuition reimbursement program, which paid for him to go to college, he ended up working for the organization’s disaster response outfit for nearly a decade.

“The rhythm of the work, and the mission of the work … it appealed to my sense of service,” said Vera. “You find things out about humanity. The best and the worst comes out at times of disasters.”

As the planet warms, and disasters grow in frequency and severity, Vera sees the demand for this type of position growing, too. Back in the ‘90s, when he was responding to Andrew, climate change wasn’t being discussed in the world of disaster relief, he says. That’s no longer the case. “Climate change is changing everything, everything — the world as we know it,” he said. “We already see it.”

Crisis counselor

Priscilla Dass-Brailsford was just four years into her career as a trauma psychologist when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. The floodwaters hadn’t yet begun to recede when she got a call from someone at the Medical Reserve Corps asking if she would travel to Lafayette, Louisiana, to serve as a disaster mental health responder. She boarded a plane from D.C. and landed in a city entirely torn apart by the cataclysmic storm.

For two weeks, Dass-Brailsford helped run a triage mental health clinic in a football arena in Lafayette. She worked shifts at a folding table with a handwritten sign taped to it: “MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.” The line never seemed to end. Dass-Brailford consoled one person who heard from a neighbor that their missing father “had been seen on the dock with a tag on his toe.” She listened to children who just wanted to go home, but had nowhere to return to.

At night, Dass-Brailsford slept in one of the arena’s stadium box rooms alongside dozens of other volunteers.

Crisis counseling looks different for everyone, she said. With one grief-stricken 8-year-old girl, for instance, Dass-Brailsford’s session didn’t require much talking at all. They simply sat, side-by-side, coloring with crayons — a bubble of peace in a space otherwise marked by mayhem.

It wasn’t long before they attracted other kids, who asked if they could color, too. She told them to first ask the little girl if it was okay. “The child had lost all her sense of power. That’s what disasters do. They make you helpless,” said Dass-Brailsford. By the time they finished coloring, some 20 minutes or so later, the girl was beaming.

“People go through traumas and they get resilient,” she said. “Watching them come through something horrific and get to the other side, it gives me tremendous purpose.” A year later, Dass-Brailsford would help launch a mental health walk-in clinic in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. Katrina “had such an impact on me professionally and personally,” she said. She continues to work with disaster survivors in her private practice, and has since published journal articles and books about her experiences counseling in the aftermath of Katrina.

Hazmat manager

In the summer of 2022, the McKinney and Mill fires burned more than 64,000 acres in northern California over nearly two months. When the blazes were snuffed out, six people had been killed and more than 400 structures damaged.

In the months that followed, Shannon Vanella spent each work day outfitted in a hard hat, safety shoes, and other protective clothing, visiting every single parcel of burned land. When a property is incinerated, it leaves remnants of everything that once made that structure a home, from polyester furniture fabric to plastic tupperware to car batteries to solar panels. Vanella’s job with Siskiyou County’s waste management department is to make sure that she and her crew find all leftover hazardous debris and dispose of it correctly. They then test the soil for toxins.

Throughout the process, she’s the person who talks with property owners, gets them to sign the paperwork needed for waste removal, answers questions, and keeps them posted on the crew’s progress. She also produces technical reports documenting each inspection.

“We all have the right to live on clean ground and have clean water and air,” said Vanella. “I can at least make sure that there’s not any heavy metals in somebody’s soil and that the river they live beside isn’t getting runoff from all of the debris.”

Right after the McKinney and Mill fires, there was a local meeting to help fire victims understand available relief and recovery services. While Vanella was there, she ended up in conversation with an older man, who had worked as a firefighter before he retired. “He said, ‘I realize that the place I grew up in will never look the same in my lifetime, and I don’t know if I can live here anymore,’” she recalled. “Then he put his head down in his arm, and he just started sobbing. It was just all I could do to hold it together.” The experience informed how she has since handled communicating with the people in her line of work.

“Whenever you’re working with survivors like that … they don’t process information the same, and they don’t remember things that you’ve said to them,” she said. “You just have to be really patient and give them the time. It’s not the easiest thing to allow the government on your property to scrape up every belonging you ever had and throw it in a trash can.”

Animal rescue

On a Friday night in May 2007, a tornado with wind speeds over 200 miles per hour tore through Greensburg, Kansas. It was one of 22 that developed in the area in the span of five hours.

After seeing the devastation on the news the next morning, veterinarian Christen Skaer, who lived several hours away in Wichita, called the town’s animal control department and asked if it had a plan for affected animals. It didn’t, the person on the line told her, and the city could use all the help it could get, so Skaer sent out an unofficial SOS to her local network of vets and then hit the road.

What she found was appalling. “There were horses with [pieces of] two-by-fours sticking out of their sides. Cats with eyeballs hanging out. There were lots and lots of wounds,” said Skaer. First responders had simply been scooping up wandering dogs and cats and moving them out of the disaster zone. Some animals were literally dropped onto the other side of a fence, just to be moved out of the way.

So Skaer and her volunteer team improvised a response plan. Their top priority was to care for the animals in direst need and treat the ones they could.

Later, they began the onerous process of trying to reunite farm animals and pets with their owners. They posted announcements on social media and in local vet networks. Some people attempted to falsely claim animals — Skaer says this brand of “pet theft” unfortunately tends to happen after disaster events — and in the frenzy, she noted, many animals “just disappeared.” So they began asking for vet records and photos of the animal, and they tested whether animals responded to owners with familiarity.

In the end, they rescued 350 animals displaced from the tornado.

“It was a trial by fire,” said Skaer. But their experiences demonstrated the need for formalizing a disaster unit specifically for animals. Two such units were born after the 2007 tornadoes — the Sedgwick County Animal Response and the Kansas Animal Response Team. Skaer volunteers for both, and they still use much of the base response plan they cobbled together all those years ago.

Emergency Manager

By 6 a.m., the morning after Hurricane Helene, the severity of the storm’s damage in the region around Saluda County, South Carolina, prompted Josh Morton, the county’s emergency director, to pull all his emergency crews off of the road, with the exception of life safety missions. Thirty minutes later, two firefighters en route to respond to a structural fire were killed after multiple trees fell onto their truck. By 7 a.m., there wasn’t a single passable road left in the county.

He and his team knew it would be a long recovery process — clearing roads, opening additional shelters, distributing food, water, and fuel.

There was also the near-total loss of all communications technology. “The one thing we didn’t really have a good plan for was how to effectively go back 100 years and get information out without the use of the internet or cellphones,” Morton said.

In the year since the storm, he and his team have been making plans to be better prepared for the next one. They’ve been printing off pamphlets with information about where to get help, food, or shelter and pasting them on public buildings. Earlier this fall, they also applied for a federal hazard mitigation grant to set up physical communications hubs throughout Saluda County, though they won’t know the outcome of that until next year.“The idea is to have these established sites so that people know, ‘Hey, if there’s a disaster and I can’t get information, here’s where I can go get it,’” said Morton.

“We just want to make sure that never happens again.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/disaster-workforce-recovery-labor.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-22 16:06:20.628302

Among the most closely watched measures are proposals tied to billions of dollars in property tax cuts for both homeowners and businesses.

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature approved the package with a two-thirds majority, authorizing the amendments to appear before voters. The Legislature also passed the state’s two-year budget, which allocates $51 billion specifically for property tax relief.

The funding comes largely from recent budget surpluses, driven by inflation and temporary federal COVID-19 stimulus dollars. Lawmakers have increasingly turned to these surpluses in recent years to finance major tax relief efforts.

Supporters of the measures, including Governor Greg Abbott, argue the tax cuts will strengthen Texas’ reputation as a business-friendly, competitive state, encouraging investment and long-term economic growth. Abbott and other proponents also stress that lowering property tax burdens directly benefits homeowners while creating a more attractive environment for employers.

Voter approval is the final step in the process, and November’s outcome will determine whether these tax cuts and other amendments become part of the Texas Constitution. For Texans, the election represents not only a decision on property taxes, but also a broader choice about how the state leverages its surpluses and shapes its fiscal future.

On November 4, Texans will decide on 17 constitutional amendments, each presented as a statewide proposition. These amendments range from tax relief measures to funding priorities and constitutional clarifications.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): Funding for Texas State Technical College.

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): Ban on a state capital gains tax.

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): Bail reform.

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): Water infrastructure funding.

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): Tax exemption on animal feed.

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): Ban on a state securities tax.

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): Tax exemption for surviving spouses of veterans.

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): Ban on an inheritance tax.

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): Inventory and equipment tax exemption.

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): Property tax exemption for homes destroyed by fire.

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): School tax exemption for elderly or disabled homeowners.

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): Changes to the State Judicial Conduct Commission.

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): Increased school tax exemption for homeowners.

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): Funding for dementia research and prevention.

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): Codifying parental rights.

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): Clarifying citizenship requirement for voters.

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): Property tax exemption for border security infrastructure.

Together, these propositions reflect Texas lawmakers’ focus on property tax relief, infrastructure investments, and constitutional safeguards. Voter approval will determine whether these measures take effect.

What began as a routine enforcement operation has escalated into an international incident that threatens to disrupt domestic battery production timelines, strain the EV supply chain, and potentially reshape foreign investment in America's clean energy transition.

The raid's impact on US battery production

The Georgia facility—a cornerstone of US efforts to secure domestic EV supply chains—now faces significant delays. LG Energy Solution has announced that construction at the plant will remain on hold until the first half of 2026, setting back production by several months and potentially impacting automakers counting on battery deliveries to meet their EV production targets.

Hyundai Motor Chief Executive José Muñoz confirmed the disruption would delay the battery plant's opening by at least two to three months. The facility was set to be a key component of Hyundai's $12.6 billion investment in Georgia, with plans to produce batteries for up to 500,000 hybrid and electric vehicles across the company's portfolio of brands.

""The South Korean workers that were deported were specialized workers in the joint venture battery plant,"" Muñoz told reporters on September 18. ""The company has had to move workers from other plants to make up for the lost labor.""

The raid: Emerging details

On September 4, approximately 400 state and federal law enforcement personnel descended on the Hyundai-LG battery plant under construction in Georgia. The operation resulted in the detention of 475 workers, including more than 300 South Korean nationals. According to the search warrant obtained by the Savannah Morning News, the raid initially targeted just four Mexican nationals as ""targeted persons,"" as reported by Forbes.

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney representing 11 individuals arrested in the raid, noted that ICE agents did not bring Korean language interpreters—suggesting the South Koreans were not the intended targets. Nevertheless, agents decided on-site to arrest all South Korean workers after determining they had entered on B-1 visas or through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).

""One of Kuck's South Korean clients had just arrived the night before and was sitting in a conference room in a business suit, attending a meeting, when arrested by ICE,"" Stuart Anderson wrote in Forbes.The Miller quota connection

Multiple sources point to a White House-imposed arrest quota as the driving force behind the mass detention. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, had publicly stated a goal of 3,000 immigrant arrests per day—a dramatic increase from the previous average of about 660 arrests daily.

""The arrest of the South Koreans was entirely driven by Stephen Miller's arrest quota,"" Kuck told Forbes. ""ICE agents screwed up by arresting people who did not abuse the visa, were eligible to engage in the type of work for which they were admitted, but ICE considered it a successful operation because they met Miller's quota.""

NBC News confirmed that ""The raid was part of a broader deportation drive by the Trump administration, which the White House has described as central to fulfilling U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, has pushed for 3,000 arrests a day.""

Diplomatic fallout

In response to the growing diplomatic crisis, the Trump administration has engaged in damage control. Christopher Landau, a top US diplomat, expressed regret over the immigration raid during meetings with South Korean counterparts, promising that South Korean workers would face no disadvantages in reentering the US and that Washington would work to prevent similar incidents, according to Dylan Butts of NBC News.

The raid has severely strained US-South Korean relations. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called the incident ""bewildering"" and an ""unjust infringement on the activities of our people,"" warning it could discourage future investment in the United States, as reported by both NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.

South Korean media reaction was particularly harsh. Paul Krugman, in his Substack newsletter, cited one South Korean editorial that declared: ""The sight of our workers being led out in chains resembles images of African slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries being dragged out by their owners.""

Investment uncertainty for the battery sector

The raid has raised serious questions about future foreign investment in U.S. battery manufacturing. Charles Kuck told Forbes, ""The ICE raid in Georgia is going to have a massive economic impact. Other attorneys and I are hearing from companies in Asia and Europe who say, 'Maybe we should hold off on big investments in the U.S. for at least three years.'""

This concern directly contradicts the bipartisan goal of building a robust domestic battery supply chain. Many South Korean tech giants, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, have been investing billions into facilities in the US as part of reshoring efforts. The raid could potentially slow this momentum at a critical time for the US battery industry.

Despite these concerns, Hyundai on September 19 confirmed it is moving forward with previously announced plans to expand its Georgia plant, committing $2.7 billion and 3,000 new jobs to phase two of the complex. This recommitment suggests the company is working to maintain its US investment strategy despite the setback.

Visa challenges exposed for the battery tech sector

The incident has highlighted longstanding challenges with U.S. visa policies for skilled foreign workers in the battery technology sector. Currently, the US allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in ""specialty occupations"" under its H-1B visa program; however, the system is highly selective due to an annual cap and a lottery system, as explained by NBC News.

Matters became more complicated on Friday, Sept. 19, when President Trump signed a proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee for H1-B visas granted to skilled foreign workers, leading to what the New York Times termed “a weekend of chaos,” as businesses hurried to try and bring their H-1B-issued employees who were out of the country back to the US before the new rules kicked in on Sunday. On Saturday, the Trump administration announced that the new fee would only be applied to new H-1B applicants.

South Korean President Lee has urged the U.S. ""to normalize the visa process related to investment, whether by securing sufficient visa quotas or by creating a new category of visa,"" according to Forbes.

LGES North America President and Chief Strategy Officer Bob Lee noted that difficulty obtaining visas has long been a challenge for companies like his. ""That was something many people understood, but now, after this crisis, the fact that we're placing attention on it will be a very good thing,"" he said to the Wall Street Journal.

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp suggested that the raid may ultimately lead to improvements in the visa system. He told reporters on September 17 that the incident might ""wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States.""

Implications for the US battery industry

As the US works to establish itself as a major player in global battery production, incidents like the Georgia raid highlight the complex interplay between immigration policy, international relations, and industrial development. For the battery technology sector, several key questions remain:

As the situation continues to unfold, the long-term impact on US-South Korean relations and foreign investment in American battery manufacturing remains to be seen. What is clear is that the raid has exposed significant tensions between aggressive immigration enforcement policies and America's battery technology development goals, creating a complex challenge for the industry on both sides of the Pacific.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt9e22d2ca52b3eca2/68d155927e504efa32d78e54/Korea-ICE-raid-protest-2234262981.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-22 13:05:45.651585

“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”

“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.

Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.

The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.

“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”

The demand for rare earth elements specifically from EV motors reached an impressive 37 kilotons in 2024. This figure is projected to accelerate further, climbing to 43 kilotons in 2025. The scale of production is immense, with the total number of EV motors produced in 2024 reaching 22.9 million units. A significant forecast sees this number growing to 28.1 million units in 2025, highlighting the sector's explosive growth.

The dominant motor technology, Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs), accounted for 19.7 million of these units in 2024 in the permanent magnet market. The adoption of PMSMs is set to continue its upward trend, with an expected 24.1 million units in 2025. Leading the charge, Tesla's production of EVs surpassed 2.1 million units in 2024. In the same year, competitor BYD’s production exceeded 3 million EV units, with both automakers relying heavily on rare earth magnets for their powertrain efficiency and performance.

Renewable Energy Transition Fuels Unprecedented Growth in Magnet Consumption

The global pursuit of clean energy solutions is creating substantial demand for the permanent magnet market, particularly from the wind energy sector. Large permanent magnets are essential for the efficiency of direct-drive wind turbines. China’s commitment to wind power is evident, with its new installations in 2024 totaling a massive 80.45 gigawatts. Forecasts for 2025 anticipate a continued expansion, with 87 gigawatts of new installations planned. This translates directly into significant magnet consumption.

The demand for Neodymium-Iron-Boron (NdFeB) magnets from China's wind sector alone stood at 9,735 metric tons in 2024, illustrating the sector's material-intensive nature. Technological advancements are also pushing demand boundaries. In a significant development, Siemens Gamesa launched a new offshore wind turbine model in 2024. This powerful turbine has a 15 MW capacity and relies on high-performance neodymium magnets, setting a new benchmark for the industry and reinforcing the link between renewable energy goals and the Permanent magnet market.

Automation and Advanced Electronics Drive Widespread Miniaturized Magnet Demand

High-performance magnets in the permanent magnet market are the invisible engines powering modern industrial automation, robotics, and consumer electronics. In manufacturing, it is projected that China's industrial robot production will reach an incredible 941,000 units in 2025. These machines depend on magnetic sensors for precise position feedback and magnetic encoders for accurate motion control. Furthermore, magnetic grippers are employed by robotic arms in automated warehouses, and magnetic levitation systems are revolutionizing automated conveyors by eliminating friction.

In the consumer sphere, the trend of miniaturization ensures consistent demand. Global smartphone shipments reached nearly 1.3 billion units in 2024, with each device containing multiple tiny magnets. The demand for NdFeB magnets from mobile phone production is expected to reach 3,698 metric tons in 2025 across the global permanent magnet market, with production projected at 1.85 billion units. In 2024, air conditioner production, another major consumer, hit 270 million units, creating a demand for 21,000 metric tons of NdFeB magnets. Permanent magnets are now integral to a vast range of devices, including tablets, earbuds, VR headsets, and wireless chargers.

Western Manufacturing Expansion Projects Intend to Diversify Global Supply Chains

In a strategic response to supply chain vulnerabilities, significant investments are being made to establish magnet manufacturing capabilities outside of Asia permanent magnet market. Neo Performance Materials' facility in Estonia is a key project, set to begin commercial production in 2025 with an initial capacity of 2,000 tons per year of NdFeB magnet blocks. A planned second phase aims to increase this capacity to 5,000 tons per year. GKN Powder Metallurgy is also making ambitious moves, planning to establish a total capacity of 4,000 tons per year of rare earth magnets across Europe and North America, with a pilot plant in Germany scheduled to be operational in early 2025.

The United States is a focal point of this diversification. The U.S. Department of Defense has invested heavily, awarding over $439 million since 2020 to establish domestic rare earth supply chains. Key projects include MP Materials' plant in Fort Worth, Texas, which will have a first-phase production capacity of 1,000 tons per year. In parallel, E-VAC Magnetics is establishing a commercial-scale rare earth magnet manufacturing facility in South Carolina, aiming to be fully operational by 2025, significantly boosting the resilience of the North American permanent magnet market.

Circular Economy Initiatives Emerge as a Critical and Viable Solution

Magnet recycling is rapidly transitioning from a niche concept to a critical component of a sustainable supply chain, mitigating raw material risks. HyProMag USA is at the forefront of this movement, aiming to capture 10% of the U.S. domestic NdFeB magnet demand within five years, starting from 2025. Its Texas Hub facility has an ambitious target for annual production, including 750 metric tons of recycled sintered NdFeB magnets and 807 metric tons per annum of associated NdFeB co-products.

The total payable capacity of the HyProMag facility will reach 1,557 metric tons of NdFeB annually. The financial viability is compelling, with an incremental capital cost of approximately US$7 million for the facility's expansion. Highlighting its environmental benefits, a carbon footprint study in March 2025 confirmed a remarkably low CO2 footprint of just 2.35 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of its recycled NdFeB product, showcasing a sustainable path forward for the Permanent magnet market.

Defense and Aerospace Applications Underscore Magnets’ Immense Strategic Importance

The strategic value of permanent magnets is nowhere more apparent than in their critical role within advanced defense systems. The material requirements are substantial: each Arleigh Burke DDG-51 destroyer requires 5,200 pounds of rare earth elements. A single Virginia-class submarine needs an even greater amount at 9,200 pounds of these materials. Furthermore, the technologically sophisticated F-35 aircraft requires more than 900 pounds of rare earth elements for its complex systems to function in the permanent magnet market.

Recognizing this dependency, the U.S. Department of Defense has set a clear goal: to have a sustainable, mine-to-magnet supply chain capable of supporting all U.S. defense requirements by 2027. To achieve this, targeted funding has been deployed. As of March 2024, the DOD had awarded $28.8 million to Noveon Magnetics for a facility in Texas. Other awards include $2.3 million to TDA Magnetics to produce qualified magnets and a substantial $94.1 million award to E-VAC Magnetics to establish commercial-scale magnet manufacturing by 2025.

Innovation and Policy Are Actively Shaping the Future Market Trajectory

The future of the Permanent magnet market is being actively shaped by technological breakthroughs and supportive government policies. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy announced a significant advance in iron-nitride (Fe-N) based permanent magnets, presenting a potential rare-earth-free alternative. The pace of innovation is reflected in intellectual property, with a patent for an iron-rich permanent magnet issued on January 15, 2024, and another granted to Hangzhou Magmax Technology on September 17, 2024, for a novel demagnetization identification method.

Simultaneously, the permanent magnet market is exploring alternatives, evidenced by Valeo and MAHLE launching a magnet-free electric motor in 2024, signaling a potential long-term technological diversification. Policy is also a powerful catalyst. A U.S. bill introduced in February 2025, the Rare Earth Magnet Security Act (REMSA), proposes a production tax credit of $20 per kilogram for magnets manufactured in the United States. This incentive powerfully increases to $30 per kilogram if the component rare earth material is also sourced or recycled domestically.

Two CSU students co-founded a startup called Envirofit International that has evolved into a global leader in designing and manufacturing clean cookstoves and other technologies that enable clean energy access in the developing world.

These technologies help solve critical human health and environmental problems.

Company innovations include both cooking technologies and business models that help make products and services accessible to users.

How do you go from building clean snowmobiles in a campus lab to manufacturing clean cookstoves that help millions of people worldwide?

Ask Tim Bauer and Nathan Lorenz.

The two entrepreneurs started their work as Colorado State University students and rose from the tech transfer ecosystem to deliver 2.5 million clean cookstoves that benefit an estimated 12 million people living in low-income households around the globe, most in Africa and India.

Their 22-year-old social enterprise, Envirofit International, is based in Fort Collins and has grown into a global leader in the design, development and delivery of high-performing clean energy cookstoves that combat toxic indoor air pollution, save lives and reduce carbon emissions across the developing world.

“I could not have imagined, when we were wrenching on snowmobile engines, that we would end up here,” said Lorenz, Envirofit’s chief technology officer. “What we’re doing now has global impact.”

Envirofit’s global reach, especially into the developing world, is unique and notable, said Richard Magid, vice president of technology transfer at CSU STRATA, the university’s tech transfer organization.

“To achieve that impact, they’ve paired technical innovation with incredibly innovative business and financing operations,” Magid said. “Because traditional venture financing won’t generally support social enterprises like Envirofit, they’ve worked with foundations and impact investors to raise capital, as well as being on the cutting edge of carbon credits.”

In 2002, Bauer and Lorenz were undergraduates in mechanical engineering and, as part of a senior capstone, entered a national competition to build cleaner snowmobiles, which are notorious for spewing pollutants from standard two-stroke engines. Working at what is now the Powerhouse Energy Campus, Bauer and Lorenz developed a retrofitting kit to convert a two-stroke carbureted snowmobile engine into one with direct in-cylinder fuel injection – leading to increased engine efficiency and lower emissions. In fact, they built the cleanest snowmobile engine on record at the time.

With that win, Bauer and Lorenz realized that developing nations – teeming with vehicles with two-stroke engines – represented the biggest market for their invention.

So, in 2003, as they were entering graduate studies in mechanical engineering at CSU, the students co-founded a nonprofit startup called Envirofit International with two of their professors, Bryan Willson in mechanical engineering and Paul Hudnut in business. The group explored commercialization of the engine retrofitting kit and even secured initial funding from the Bohemian Foundation, a Fort Collins family foundation.

They might have continued down that path. But other work at the Powerhouse Energy Campus focused on reducing emissions from smoky cookstoves, and the charitable Shell Foundation suggested a partnership to accelerate this cookstove work. Soon, Envirofit added cookstoves to its product portfolio and formed a long-term alliance with the Shell Foundation. The cookstove business overtook the two-stroke business.

Then, in 2012, Envirofit transitioned to a for-profit social benefit corporation and went on to raise multiple rounds of equity and debt financing to enable scale-up.

Backed by investor partnerships, Envirofit tackled a critical problem: An estimated 2.1 billion people worldwide – a quarter of the globe’s population – cook with open fires and inefficient stoves, most often using solid fuels, such as wood, crop waste, charcoal, coal and livestock dung, according to the World Health Organization. Many live in poverty in rural parts of the developing world.

Each year, 3.7 million people die prematurely from illnesses attributed to household air pollution caused by incomplete combustion of solid fuels and kerosene used for cooking. Particulate matter and other pollutants lead to fatal heart disease, stroke, respiratory infection, pulmonary disease and lung cancer, which disproportionately affect women and children who spend more time in noxious home environments, WHO reports.

Meantime, household air pollution is a major contributor to outdoor air pollution – notably, carbon emissions that drive climate change.

To help solve these problems, the Envirofit team developed a line of cookstoves that use wood, charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas, a mix of propane and butane, as fuel. These stoves use less fuel, reduce toxic emissions and cook food quicker than traditional models.

Cost savings on fuel combined with subsidized pricing – largely possible with carbon market strategies – are key factors allowing families to afford the cookstoves, said Bauer, Envirofit president and chief operating officer. Many people in the company’s target market live in energy poverty, spending perhaps 30% of their household incomes on fuel. That has prompted Envirofit to focus much of its business planning on energy access.

“What we’ve really developed is the business model to get these products into people’s lives,” Bauer said. “The key challenge to scale-up is not the product development but rather the business model to enable it.”

Central to its business planning was Envirofit’s move to deal in high-quality carbon credits, which is possible because of significant emissions savings with the company’s products. This allows the company to provide products at a 50% subsidy, which improves affordability and adoption.

Meantime, Envirofit has grown to about 60 employees, has several international offices and is in its fifth consecutive year of profitability.

The company’s goal is to help move people up the “energy ladder” – from using less efficient and higher emitting technologies to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. That means moving from solid fuels to liquefied petroleum gas, a switch that yields benefits for households and the climate alike.

Envirofit has developed a trademarked SmartGas technology to meet that goal: Customers receive cylinders of liquefied petroleum gas and, with a unique valve system, use their smartphones to pay incrementally for daily fuel needs. The “pay-as-you-cook” model keeps costs affordable for customers who cannot buy entire tanks of fuel.

These days, Envirofit is looking ahead to new ways it can provide clean energy access beyond designing and manufacturing cookstoves. As Bauer put it: “We are an energy technology company creating scalable, climate-smart solutions for emerging markets.”

The company has been honored for its solutions. For instance, the Economist, a British news journal, named Envirofit’s founders its 2013 Energy and Environment Innovators.

Willson, a company co-founder, is executive director of CSU’s Energy Institute, which is housed at the Powerhouse Energy Campus – Envirofit’s incubation grounds.

“We have this mantra of science to solutions to scale, and Envirofit embodies that goal,” said Willson, who is also a member of the company’s board of directors. “Envirofit has a unique ability to improve the lives of millions of people, and that’s really cool.”",https://source.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Envirofit-SmartGas_Customer3.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 14:01:17.678751

We Energies earned an F grade at a score of 6 percent in this year’s report.
This is the worst grade We Energies has earned since the Dirty Truth Report began in 2021.
“It is alarming that for the first time since 2021, utilities are regressing on their clean energy transition,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender.
As energy costs rise and extreme weather becomes more frequent, now is the time to phase out polluting, volatile, expensive fossil fuels and invest in stable, reliable, and affordable, clean energy.” ###","MILWAUKEE, Wis. – Today, the Sierra Club released its annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This report shows that—despite their promises—We Energies is still overwhelmingly not planning for the clean energy transition and millions of Americans are facing the consequences of a grid powered by polluting fossil fuels. At the same time, electricity bills are increasing faster than inflation.

We Energies earned an F grade at a score of 6 percent in this year’s report. This is the worst grade We Energies has earned since the Dirty Truth Report began in 2021. WEC Energy Group, We Energies’ parent company, also earned an F grade this year.

“I would be embarrassed if I brought home an ‘F’ on my report card year after year. But We Energies has no shame; they’ve continued to put corporate profits ahead of people, sticking customers with higher utility bills and greater air pollution by building new gas and delaying the Oak Creek coal plant closure time and again,” said Jadine Sonoda, Campaign Coordinator, Sierra Club Wisconsin.

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress–if any–the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

“It is alarming that for the first time since 2021, utilities are regressing on their clean energy transition,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender. “By adding more gas and keeping costly coal plants online, utility companies are ignoring renewable energy—the cheapest form of energy—and forcing their customers to pay more.

Purchasing a new car is often the second most expensive purchase many Americans make. President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) offers new benefits to prospective car buyers that might entice some to buy a car.

However, personal finance expert Suze Orman warned in a recent article on her website of the dangers of using the new benefits to justify an unplanned purchase. Here’s why Orman believes the tax law changes aren’t a license to drive off with a new set of wheels.

Also see the best and worst days of the week to buy a car.

What Are the New Tax Changes?

The OBBBA provides three key tax changes relative to car buying. According to the IRS, one key change is a temporary tax deduction of interest on car loans through 2028. The maximum annual deduction is $10,000, and it phases out with modified adjusted gross income surpassing $100,000 for individuals ($200,000 for joint filers) annually.

Orman also noted two other changes, aimed at ending clean energy credits. Those include ending the federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle (EV) and ending the $1,000 maximum credit on the installation of an at-home EV charging station. The credits now expire on Sept. 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026, respectively.

As with most taxes, there are various carve-outs that may make qualifying for deductions or credits difficult to obtain.

Orman cautioned about what Americans might see as a result of these tax changes. “By the time you read this, I expect we may already be pummeled with advertisements touting the tax breaks if you buy now. Car lots will have plenty of signs touting cars made in America,” Orman said.

Why Benefits Aren’t a Reason To Purchase a New Car

The average cost of a new car is over $49,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, and tariffs may drive prices higher. Deductions or rebates may entice Americans to rush out to purchase a new car.

“A tax break is not a reason to make such a big investment. If you absolutely need a new car, then yes, taking these new car-related tax rules into account makes sense. But what I have no patience for is you using these rules as a rationalization to buy a new car,” Orman said.

Instead, Orman advised driving your car until it’s no longer reliable and focus on setting aside money in a savings account to purchase a car in the future.

Following recommended maintenance protocols is the best way to keep your current car reliable. Failing to do this and rushing to take on a car loan can have significant consequences not only for your budget but also for your long-term goals.

When Should You Buy a Car?

Although tax benefits could be good, they aren’t the only thing that should drive you to purchase a new car. A purchase should occur at the right time for your finances.

“If you truly need a car, I have no problem with that. But your goal should be to buy the least expensive car possible, finance it for the shortest time possible, and then drive it for as long as possible,” Orman said in a different article.

Ideally, you should have a minimum down payment of 20%. Furthermore, your total monthly transportation costs likely shouldn’t exceed 15% of your budget. It’s also wise to have an emergency fund before purchase. If you can reach or exceed these numbers and your car is no longer reliable, it becomes more feasible to justify the purchase.

Tax changes that benefit you can be beneficial. However, using them as justification to make an unplanned, expensive purchase can have serious ramifications. Review your finances thoroughly before jumping into action.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Suze-Orman-shutterstock-editorial-BLU_A104812.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 15:02:48.021320

The Calcasieu-Sabine Basin will get $122 million from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement for drainage improvements geared to help marsh plants grow and halt erosion.

The basin, on trend with the entire Louisiana coastline, has experienced dramatic wetland loss, with more than 128,000 acres lost since 1932 and a projected 110,000 at risk of loss in a future without intervention, based on data from the United States Geological Survey.

The first phase of the project, planned along the southeastern edge of Calcasieu Lake, will build seven drainage structures with elements of a levee that allow water to flow back and forth from either side. The design is meant to balance water and salinity levels between the lake and the rest of the watershed, using natural events such as low tides and cold fronts to keep the marsh from being inundated with water.

“This funding allows us to move from planning to construction on one of our most critical restoration efforts,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Thursday in a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority news release.

Future phases of construction include up to 18 miles of channels to improve water flow into the marsh and deposits of dredged material to promote the growth of marsh vegetation. Existing water control structures around Calcasieu Lake will also get maintenance upgrades as needed.

She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard.
Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers.
“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said.
Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.” “Everyone breathing in California depends on it,” he said.","The California Air Resources Board is getting a new leader at a pivotal moment, as it battles President Donald Trump's administration in court and contends with growing scrutiny from Democrats and voters questioning the price of the state’s climate principles.

Liane Randolph has chaired the board of the state’s top air and climate regulator since 2020. She oversaw a range of policies including landmark clean-car and truck rules, a fuel standard with implications for gas prices and the state’s signature carbon trading program, cap-and-trade. This week, Gov. Gavin Newsom nominated his senior climate advisor, Lauren Sanchez, to replace her.

Randolph, in an interview, told CalMatters her departure was part of her “personal journey,” something she began considering earlier this year.

“I've worked really hard over the last almost five years, and I'm ready for a break,” she said. “I am confident that the transition will go incredibly smoothly.”

Observers say the handover highlights the air board’s key role at a time of political pushback and consumer resistance.

“Pretty much all of the major areas in climate that [the air board] touches are going to be in really significant periods of challenge,” said Danny Cullenward, a climate expert and vice chair of an independent committee that analyzes the cap-and-trade program. “This is not an easy time to take over an agency. It’s a time when sound strategy — and not just autopilot — is going to be required.”

California’s climate ambition meets Trump opposition

Newsom’s 2020 order to phase out gas-car sales by 2035 was a watershed moment for California climate policy. His executive order was a headline-grabbing strike at the oil industry, meant to accelerate not only the state’s adoption of electric cars, but the nation’s.

Newsom said Randolph would be the champion of that effort as his pick to lead the air board just a few months later, calling her “the kind of bold, innovative leader that will lead in our fight against climate change with equity and all California’s communities at heart.”

But Randolph faced a larger challenge than her predecessors: a Trump administration bent on thwarting California’s authority. The White House immediately criticized Newsom’s order as an example of how “extreme the left has become,” evidence that liberal policymakers wanted to “dictate every aspect of every American’s life.”

While Randolph's air board made significant policy during the years of the Biden administration, Trump attacked those efforts once he returned to office.

“Liane didn't have the time or the circumstances to pivot toward a new, adjusted strategy,” said Daniel Sperling, a former member of the board, now the director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at UC Davis. “She inherited the trajectory that California was on, and that the governor was articulating, and then she got undermined by the Trump administration.”

For the gasoline car ban, the air board held months of marathon hearings filled with car owners, environmentalists and industry lobbyists. In 2022, the board approved the measure that Newsom wanted. More rules soon followed, targeting diesel trucks, locomotives and other major polluters.

Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley, said Randolph steered the board through a difficult time.

In disputes involving environmental justice groups, he said, “she really listened to people,” building consensus and lowering tensions.

“She's always very diplomatic,” Elkind said. “She was mild-mannered, she wasn’t polemical, she didn’t use it as a perch to pontificate. She seemed very measured and steady and took her role as the public face, and the need for outreach, very seriously.”

Policies moving the state toward zero emissions vehicles have struggled, as federal and state regulators have pulled industry in opposing directions.

The Biden administration signed off on California’s clean-car rules last year. But the state air board withdrew one of its most aggressive measures on diesel trucks, as well as rules on locomotives, harbor craft and other polluters, in anticipation of Trump’s return.

“There's not a full understanding of how aggressive the administration's attacks on all of California's efforts to achieve climate action have been,” Randolph said at a CalMatters event in San Francisco. She pointed to the Trump administration’s withdrawl of a rule aimed at cleaning up nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.

“That has nothing to do with electric vehicles,” Randolph said. “It was all about just attacking California's authority, and letting the big companies who supported the administration continue to pollute communities.”

Catherine Reheis-Boyd, a senior advisor to the Western States Petroleum Association, said that under Randolph’s tenure, California’s ambition got ahead of consumers and technology. Her pushback echoed the broader clash with the Trump administration, which has targeted electric cars as costly for consumers and impractical.

“We have no problem with electric vehicles,” Reheis-Boyd said, at the San Francisco CalMatters event. But “we think there should be a free market.”

Searing climate battles at home

Last November, the air board revamped its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, a program that uses financial incentives to encourage cleaner fuels as the state phases out gasoline and diesel.

The fight exposed twin challenges arising from within the state: rising costs and lingering environmental harms not addressed by the climate policy. Consumer advocates raised alarms about gas prices, while environmentalists warned that boosting alternatives like biofuels made from cow manure or soybeans offered limited climate benefits.

Phoebe Seaton, co-director of the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said her group “strongly disagrees” with the expansion of the fuel standard program but credited Randolph’s leadership for showing up and listening to all parties.

“We are especially grateful for the time Chair Randolph dedicated to meeting in Pixley and Fresno with people impacted by dairies,” Seaton said.

Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, speaks during an EVgo fast charging station launch event at El Mercado Plaza Shopping Center in Union City on Sept. 25, 2023. The event highlighted California achieving its goal of installing 10,000 direct current fast chargers for electric vehicles. Photo by Loren Elliott for CalMatters Central valley politicians criticized the program for making fuels less affordable. Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield Democrat looking to unseat a moderate Republican in Congress, called for Randolph’s resignation earlier this year. She argued that the air board failed to study the economic impacts of its new standard. Her office did not respond to a request from CalMatters for comment.

Cullenward said the air board hasn’t always clearly said what its programs cost consumers. While Newsom and the legislature will extend cap-and-trade, the board still must decide how to reshape the program after pausing work on it during the reauthorization fight.

“One of the toughest things about this process is that being really honest about what's working — and what's not working — and what the costs of the different options are, is going to be essential,” Cullenward said. “Historically, that's not something staff have ever embraced.”

Newsom praised Randolph for stepping in during a time of uncertainty and leading with “vision and resolve.” She will leave at the end of the month, before the end of her term, which lasts through 2026.

Questions about costs, affordability and environmental concerns will continue to hang over the air board as it decides how to steer cap-and-trade and other programs in the years ahead.

Randolph, in her remarks Wednesday, said California regulators must get creative in the face of federal attacks, while also addressing public concerns and communicating why the state’s policies matter.

“All of the impacts of climate change make things fundamentally unaffordable,” she said.

Newsom’s point person steps in

Randolph’s replacement, Lauren Sanchez, has been the governor’s point person on climate from within the executive office. Translating Newsom’s vision into state policy at a key turning point while also leading a 16-member board and managing the agency’s vast, highly technical staff will present a new challenge.

Sanchez built her climate credentials on the international stage and inside the governor’s office, where she helped steer billions in budget funding for climate programs and advised Newsom on this summer’s high-stakes energy and climate package.

“He turned to the aide he trusts most on climate,” said Dean Florez, the state Senate appointee to the air board. “Lauren’s been at his side drafting the playbook and steering the billions. This isn’t a change in course, it’s keeping faith with his own circle.”

Before joining Newsom’s office in 2021, Sanchez served as a climate negotiator at the U.S. State Department and later advised John Kerry in the Biden administration. She also held senior roles at the California Environmental Protection Agency and the air board, coordinating climate policy across state agencies and shaping California’s international climate work.

“Lauren has been my most trusted climate advisor and the chief architect of California’s bold climate agenda,” Newsom said. “She is a force in her own right: her expertise, tenacity, and vision will serve California well as the Board works to protect our communities and defends our climate progress against relentless attacks from Washington.”

Sanchez played a central role in weaving climate priorities into the state budget in recent years, said Jamie Pew, climate policy advisor with NetxGen Policy. Cap-and-trade pays for a climate credit that consumers see on their utility bills; Pew said Sanchez advocated for expanding the credit during the recent legislative negotiations.

“Lauren has been a champion for getting cap and invest done this year, which will ensure that funding for critical climate programs will continue to grow at a time when federal rollbacks threaten the transition,” Pew said.

Next week, the state's top air and climate regulators will vote on amendments narrowing a previously rescinded truck rule to public fleets. The board is also advancing an emergency regulation to keep its clean-car and truck standards enforceable as the board battles the federal government in court.

Many of the air board's recent accomplishments have run into roadblocks this year. As expected, Trump quickly moved to block California’s mandates aided by Congress, signing three measures in June against clean cars and two others targeting diesel trucks.

Adrian Martinez, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said California’s air board faces “perilous times.”

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 21

Final Rules: 62

2025 Total Pages: 45,217

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$77.1 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$626.6 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week – by a wide margin – was the EPA proposal on “Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.” The proposed rules specifically seeks:

To amend the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) to remove program obligations for most source categories, including the distribution segment of the petroleum and natural gas systems source category (subpart W—Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems), and suspend program obligations for the remaining subpart W segments until reporting year 2034.

The agency estimates that eliminating these reporting requirements will cut 2.6 million hours of paperwork and $303 million in associated costs each year from 2025 through 2033. When discounted out under a 7-percent rate across a 10-year horizon, EPA finds that the total net present value comes out to roughly $2 billion in cost reductions.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

There wasn’t much in the way of major regulatory policy announcements from the White House, but there were some interesting developments on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front. First, on Tuesday, the Senate voted down the motion to proceed on S.J. Res 60, a resolution introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) seeking to repeal a Trump Administration rule. This marked the first formal legislative action on a CRA resolution introduced by a Democratic lawmaker this term.

There was also another batch of CRA resolutions introduced across both chambers and parties. H.J. Res 123 was yet another resolution of disapproval introduced by a Democratic representative directly addressing a Trump-era rule. There were, however, some others with more unique circumstances. H.J. Res 125 (and its Senate companion S.J. Res 82) would repeal a March 2025 Trump-era rule that originally seemed as though it might fall outside the purview of CRA consideration. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that the Act did apply, however. GAO’s determination also factored into the introduction of H.J. Res 124/S.J. Res 80, a pair of resolutions addressing a Department of Interior “Record of Decision” (ROD) from 2022. Despite a years-long gap since the ROD came down and the fact that it was not a typical rulemaking document, a more recent review by GAO led to the determination that “it meets the definition of a rule under APA [Administrative Procedure Act] and no CRA exception applies.”

The American Action Forum (AAF) CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 61 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

One of the benefits to purchasing a new electric vehicle (EV) — in addition to the reduced environmental impact, as well as cost savings due to not spending on gas — is the EV tax credit.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was passed in 2022, this measure provides up to $7,500 in applicable tax credit with the purchase of a qualifying new EV, as a means to incentivize car shoppers into buying an environmentally-friendly EV instead of a gas-powered internal-combustion vehicle.

Find out below when the EV tax credit expires and how to get the tax credit.

What Is Happening to the $7,500 Credit?

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA essentially set the economic agenda for Trump’s second administration by extending a number of tax cuts from his first administration, as well as cutting funding to several programs such as Medicaid and the EV tax credit.

As a result of the OBBBA, the $7,500 EV tax credit will now expire on Sept. 30.

How Can You Still Get the $7,500 Tax Credit?

Following the OBBBA’s passing, auto manufacturers initially assumed that car buyers would have to sign a purchase contract, make a down payment and physically receive their new EV by or before Sept. 30 in order to receive the credit.

However, the IRS has created something of a loophole in the credit’s expiration, per Yahoo Finance. “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” according to the IRS.

In short: As long as an EV buyer signs a purchase contract and pays a deposit (or the full purchase amount) by or before Sept. 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

What does this mean for you?

Monkey Island LNG, the company behind the forthcoming eponymous LNG liquefaction facility in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, has awarded McDermott a master services agreement to provide front-end engineering and planning services on the project, according to a Sept. 8 news release.

Monkey Island LNG plans to invest $25 billion into the facility across two phases, which makes it one of the largest developments of its kind in North America, said Greg Michaels, founder and CEO of Monkey Island LNG, in the release.

“By leveraging LNG mega-modules, we dramatically reduce the site footprint required for world-scale LNG production, which drives down project costs and risks,” said Michaels.

The companies did not disclose the contract value of the MSA.

McDermott, headquartered in Houston, will provide engineering, execution planning and pricing for the facility’s engineering, procurement and construction phase, according to the release. Next, Monkey Island will issue a final EPC contract aligned with the timing of Monkey Island LNG’s financing activities.

Phase 1 of the Monkey Island LNG facility will include three LNG trains with a capacity of 5.2 million metric tons per annum each and a combined production of 15.6 MTPA, according to the release. Future expansion plans include two more trains that would bring the plant’s total capacity to 26 MTPA.

McDermott, which generated $8.9 billion in revenue in 2024 and was the ninth largest builder in the U.S. by that metric, will flex its modular LNG train design on the job. Rob Shaul, senior vice president of low carbon solutions at McDermott, echoed the sentiment.

“This award underscores the depth of expertise of McDermott in LNG and modular design,” Shaul said. “Our integrated delivery model—including self-perform construction and a global network of McDermott-owned fabrication yards—positions us to deliver a solution that maximizes value while minimizing risk.”

Officials expect engineering and permitting to begin in 2026 with the first LNG production slated for the early 2030s, per the release. The project will be led by McDermott’s Houston team, supported by its engineering group in Gurugram, India.

McDermott isn’t the only firm that’s capitalizing on growth in the LNG space — Bechtel, based in Reston, Virginia, got the green light to proceed on the $6.7 billion Train 4 at Rio Grande LNG in Brownsville, Texas, earlier this month.

For more than a decade, these incentives have played a central role in artificially propping up EV sales, coaxing buyers toward electric cars with taxpayer-funded subsidies. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phased them out, and the marketplace is preparing for a major shift. Let the free market be just that, free. Buyers should buy what they want, and not what the states or the federal government want.

For buyers, the deadline creates a clear choice: purchase an electric vehicle now and secure the last available credits, or wait and face a market where EVs must compete without federal assistance. For dealers and automakers, the end of this program marks the beginning of a new chapter in how vehicles are marketed, priced, and sold in the United States. This is actually good news for everyone.

The EV tax credit was originally introduced to jumpstart demand for electric vehicles and help manufacturers reach economies of scale, and entice car buyers to consider an electric vehicle. Automakers like Tesla, GM, and Nissan were among the first to benefit, as subsidies encouraged early adopters to experiment with new technology. Over time, the credit became a standard talking point for dealerships and a cornerstone of federal and some state government policies aimed at accelerating the transition to EVs and the goal of eliminating gas and diesel-powered vehicles.

But the credits also sparked controversy. Critics argued they disproportionately benefited wealthier households, who were more likely to afford EVs even without subsidies, and actually be able to take advantage of the tax credit. Many Americans pointed out that taxpayers who never purchased an EV were footing the bill for those who did. By 2024, as EV sales slowed despite the ongoing credit, questions grew louder about whether the program was delivering meaningful results.

Under the OBBBA, the federal EV tax credit ends September 30, 2025. After that date, buyers will no longer be able to claim the tax credit of up to $7,500 on new EVs, $4,000 on used ones, or the $1,000 credit for a home charger. This change eliminates the point-of-sale rebates that dealers have leaned on heavily to close EV deals.

The immediate impact is urgency. Dealers are moving quickly to advertise “last chance” opportunities for buyers to lock in the tax credit. Automakers with qualifying models are pushing aggressive campaigns to clear inventory before the deadline. Dealers fear they will be stuck with a fleet of electric cars and minimal sales. Buyers who act now could save thousands, but once October arrives, those savings vanish.

Without federal support, the EV market faces a test. Will demand hold steady, or will sales cool once the financial incentive disappears? Industry analysts are divided. What’s my analysis? I see a sharp decline in EV adoption, especially among cost-conscious buyers. I expect the demand to be below a 4% purchase rate in the US. Others believe the market will gradually stabilize as more affordable EV models reach production and as states continue offering their own incentives. The issue is battery costs, increased insurance rates and huge price escalation in electricity prices.

Dealers are preparing for the possibility that EV sales will slow way down. Many are already shifting focus to hybrids and traditional gas-powered vehicles, which remain central to American driving habits. There is another way to save some money for new car buyers, an auto loan interest deduction under the OBBBA, available for U.S.-assembled vehicles of all types, have become a more important sales tool than the expiring EV credit.

One overlooked consequence of the EV credit’s end is its impact on manufacturing strategy. Automakers have spent years aligning production to maximize eligibility, ensuring that vehicles meet North American assembly requirements to qualify for the credit. With that incentive gone, companies will have greater flexibility in where and how they produce EVs. Car companies took massive losses on every vehicle they sold. For lost $40,000 on every Lightning truck, other brands took equal losses. This is not the way to do business. It caused car makers to increase costs on all their vehicles making it harder for many to afford a new car.

At the same time, the OBBBA’s focus on U.S.-assembled vehicles for loan interest deductions keeps domestic manufacturing in the spotlight. Buyers financing new American-assembled cars (whether electric, hybrid, or gas-powered), stand to gain valuable tax savings even after September 30. In effect, the policy is shifting the incentive away from what type of vehicle you buy, and toward where it is built.

For consumers, timing matters. Buyers who are serious about purchasing an EV should act before the deadline to capture the last available credit. However, it’s equally important to evaluate whether the vehicle makes financial sense in the long term without subsidies. Factors such as charging infrastructure, battery replacement costs, and resale value remain significant considerations. Resale value on used electric cars is not good.

Some households may find greater value in waiting. As the market adjusts, automakers may respond with price cuts, new financing options, or incentives of their own to sustain demand. Dealers will be very motivated to move EVs off lots if inventory slows, potentially creating better deals. Leasing would be your smartest move at that point.

The phase-out of EV tax credits is more than a budgetary or political change. It’s a signal of a broader shift in bipartisan policy. For years, Washington used subsidies to push the auto market toward electrification. If they failed to meet the numbers they were fined billion of dollars. Now, the emphasis is moving toward empowering buyers with broader tax relief, such as the new loan interest deduction, while reducing federal dependency on technology-specific incentives.

Whether this results in a more balanced marketplace or a setback for EV adoption remains to be seen. What is certain is that the market will now have to stand on its own. Automakers that can deliver reliable, affordable vehicles that do not rely on subsidies and can produce what consumers want.

September 30 is a clear turning point. For buyers, it is the last chance to claim thousands of dollars in federal support for an EV purchase. For automakers and dealers, it is the end of a crutch that has shaped sales strategies for over a decade. And for the broader economy, it marks the beginning of a new approach – one that rewards American manufacturers and consumer choice rather than federal pressure for a single technology or type of propulsion.

Can the EV market maintain momentum without subsidies, especially in North America? What is for certain, we have a big win for customer choice.

However, personal finance expert Suze Orman warned in a recent article on her website of the dangers of using the new benefits to justify an unplanned purchase. Here’s why Orman believes the tax law changes aren’t a license to drive off with a new set of wheels.

Also see the best and worst days of the week to buy a car.

What Are the New Tax Changes?

The OBBBA provides three key tax changes relative to car buying. According to the IRS, one key change is a temporary tax deduction of interest on car loans through 2028. The maximum annual deduction is $10,000, and it phases out with modified adjusted gross income surpassing $100,000 for individuals ($200,000 for joint filers) annually.

Orman also noted two other changes, aimed at ending clean energy credits. Those include ending the federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle (EV) and ending the $1,000 maximum credit on the installation of an at-home EV charging station. The credits now expire on Sept. 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026, respectively.

As with most taxes, there are various carve-outs that may make qualifying for deductions or credits difficult to obtain.

Orman cautioned about what Americans might see as a result of these tax changes. “By the time you read this, I expect we may already be pummeled with advertisements touting the tax breaks if you buy now. Car lots will have plenty of signs touting cars made in America,” Orman said.

Why Benefits Aren’t a Reason To Purchase a New Car

The average cost of a new car is over $49,000, according to Kelley Blue Book, and tariffs may drive prices higher. Deductions or rebates may entice Americans to rush out to purchase a new car.

“A tax break is not a reason to make such a big investment. If you absolutely need a new car, then yes, taking these new car-related tax rules into account makes sense. But what I have no patience for is you using these rules as a rationalization to buy a new car,” Orman said.

Instead, Orman advised driving your car until it’s no longer reliable and focus on setting aside money in a savings account to purchase a car in the future.

Following recommended maintenance protocols is the best way to keep your current car reliable. Failing to do this and rushing to take on a car loan can have significant consequences not only for your budget but also for your long-term goals.

When Should You Buy a Car?

Although tax benefits could be good, they aren’t the only thing that should drive you to purchase a new car. A purchase should occur at the right time for your finances.

“If you truly need a car, I have no problem with that. But your goal should be to buy the least expensive car possible, finance it for the shortest time possible, and then drive it for as long as possible,” Orman said in a different article.

Ideally, you should have a minimum down payment of 20%. Furthermore, your total monthly transportation costs likely shouldn’t exceed 15% of your budget. It’s also wise to have an emergency fund before purchase. If you can reach or exceed these numbers and your car is no longer reliable, it becomes more feasible to justify the purchase.

Tax changes that benefit you can be beneficial. However, using them as justification to make an unplanned, expensive purchase can have serious ramifications. Review your finances thoroughly before jumping into action.

“There’s this optimism, this feeling that something better could be just over the horizon,” Julien said. “In the background, though, that destruction remains. Behind every smile and every laugh, there’s a temporary moment of pause.”

This isn’t just any time of year in the North Carolina mountains. Helene struck at the most lucrative time for the region: the changing of the autumn leaves. This is when folks in the mountains make their “hibernating money,” as Jackson puts it. They did not get the chance to make that money last year.

Earning a living in a post-Helene NC

Employment has bounced back one year after the storm. Since January, the jobless rate in Buncombe County, home to Asheville, dropped from 6.8% — North Carolina’s highest at the time — down to 4.1% this summer. That’s a sign of a healthy economy returning.

“The health of the body before any injuries is really important to how you recover,” said Clark Duncan, director of the Asheville Chamber of Commerce. “Luckily, we were in robust economic health before the storm.”

Still, many small businesses in the mountains are on shaky ground one year later. They desperately need an injection of money but can’t stand to take out another loan.

In downtown Asheville, however, Meghan Rogers, director of the Asheville Independent Restaurant Coalition, sees reason for cautious optimism.

“I am feeling positive and hopeful, and I tend to be a glass-half-empty kind of girl,” Rogers told CPP.

“I have seen the gumption and the grit that our independent restaurants have shown to get reopened and to hire back. I’ve been overwhelmed at what it takes, what they’ve shown from day one through an entire year. Please come and see us.”

Some businesses and restaurants have even reopened in Asheville’s devastated River Arts District one year after Helene. But the continued health of the small business community relies heavily — perhaps too heavily — on the success of this fall.

“People are on a really thin margin right now,” Jackson said. “We need our fall to behave. We need sunny days and a lot of tourists.”

Visiting a post-Helene NC

The loss of tourism dollars over the past year has been devastating for the region. The immediate loss of the most valuable months was reinforced by the prolonged perception that the mountains were not open for business.

One year later, park visitation at Grandfather Mountain is down nearly 20% compared to this point in 2024.

The leisure and hospitality industry in Asheville is down 10% in terms of employment, Duncan said.

Rutherford County lost up to 50% of is average tourism revenue. The Rutherford County Tourism Development Authority had to lay off three employees, according to director Don Cason.

“It is pretty devastating,” Cason said. “Businesses have had to recover and survive without hardly any income.”

In the destruction, though, Rutherford County sees opportunity to reimagine itself. Before the storm, the upper portion of the Broad River was 100 feet wide. One year later, its banks are 600 feet apart, according to Cason. The county is planning to build hiking and biking trails in that extra space, hopefully attracting more visitors.

Businesses and local governments across the mountains are welcoming everyone back with open arms.

“We need you,” said Jeff Kaplan, director of Venture Asheville. “We are not going to make it back, to build a stronger, better Asheville in the future, without our visitor support. Everyone here benefits from visitors. Please come back.”

Unfortunately, visitor spending across the state has been slow this year so far, according to Marlise Taylor, director of tourism research at VisitNC. That’s due to an uncertain economy and fears of recession — many are closing their pocketbooks and staying put.

Living in a post-storm Western NC

Those economic uncertainties are plaguing folks in the mountains as well one year after Helene. A significant portion of Western North Carolina's population is still struggling to meet basic needs.

Access to food and shelter was already strained in parts of the North Carolina mountains. The storm deepened those insecurities. In communities like Spruce Pine and Swannanoa, grocery stores have not yet reopened. Food banks and housing services are serving record numbers of people.

MANNA Foodbank is seeing more than 170,000 visits per month across its 16-county service area. That’s the most the foodbank has served in its 42-year history.

“This is due to the storm, as well as the rising cost of goods and the stagnant wages in our region,” Micah Chrisman, spokesperson for MANNA, told CPP.

“People are having to work multiple jobs to make ends meet. They’re choosing between buying their medicine or paying for groceries or paying rent. The cost of living is just too high. Businesses in our area may be open, but they are not able to pay livable wages. Rich and poor people are coming to our pantries.”

The increased demand isn't just from people who lost jobs or homes in the storm. One year later, Sarah Banks, health director for Haywood County, describes seeing teachers, nurses and middle-income families accessing county services for the first time.

In Spruce Pine, where the town’s only dedicated grocery store remains closed due to catastrophic flooding, traffic at the local food bank is staggering.

At Mitchell County Shepherd’s Staff, director Starli McDowell says she served 1,979 households in August. The population of Spruce Pine is only 2,192.

McDowell says Shepherd’s Staff is still giving out clean water just as fast as they can get it, and helping folks pay their bills, fix their wells and repair their homes.

Those with homes to repair count themselves lucky. The housing crisis, which already plagued Western North Carolina, continues to fester one year after the storm.

Evictions are on the rise, according to David Bartholomew, an attorney at Pisgah Legal Services. Rents briefly declined immediately after the storm but quickly returned to pre-Helene levels and have remained elevated. Activists were lobbying for an eviction moratorium in the aftermath of the storm, but it never materialized. Bartholomew says as the months pass, landlords and property managers are becoming less inclined to work with assistance programs.

Last week, 100 people in danger of eviction were lined up at the door of Grace Covenant, an Asheville church that has dedicated itself to rent assistance. On that day, Grace Covenant dedicated $50,000 of its funding and $15,000 from the Long-Term Recovery Group to stop evictions, according to pastor Marcia Shoop.

“There are a lot of people on the edge,” Shoop told CPP. “And there are so many kinds of edges people can fall off.”

One year after Helene, street homelessness has increased measurably in Asheville. According to Asheville homeless agency Homeward Bound, point-in-time count data from January 2025 showed 328 unsheltered individuals in the Asheville area, up from 219 in 2024 — an increase of 50%.

Meanwhile, the number of people in transitional housing decreased from 250 to 157. Temporary solutions are running out faster than permanent ones can be found.

Many of Homeward Bound’s clients navigated the everchanging deadlines and extensions for FEMA hotel and temporary shelter vouchers that have now expired.

“That created a lot of instability for our clients, many of whom we are still in the process of rehousing,” said Ansley Carter, spokesperson for Homeward Bound. “A year later, we still see people at the lowest income level struggling to move from those temporary situations into stable housing.”

A year of contradictions

The economic recovery in the mountains defies easy conclusions.

In many ways, the region has bounced back remarkably. Unemployment rates have returned to healthier levels. Most businesses have reopened. Infrastructure is largely restored. The mountains bill themselves as open for business.

But those facts obscure a complex reality. At the one-year mark, much remains to worry about. Food banks are serving more people than ever before. Street homelessness has increased 50% in Asheville. Teachers and nurses are relying on assistance programs. In Spruce Pine, nearly as many households visited the food pantry as live in the town.

Still, hope abounds.

“This is going to sound like a cliché, but it isn’t,” John Mitchell, Henderson County manager, told CPP.

“The residents of this county, the folks who work in emergency management, the churches, everyone else: they have looked after our neighbors. They’ve done the hard work to get this community back on its feet.

“There is still suffering. There is no doubt about that. But this recovery has been profound.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/044400f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2762x1450+0+189/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2Fc9%2F49ff6c8044bbb3869f7ad434fd6b%2Fscreenshot-2025-09-22-at-9-07-18-am.png,N,,2025-09-22 11:04:17.957246

TVA issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) signaling interest in deploying Type One’s “Infinity Two” stellarator fusion technology once it reaches commercial readiness.

Infinity Two is designed as a first-generation baseload fusion plant, employing stellarator technology—a fusion approach already proven to achieve stable, steady-state plasma operation. Type One Energy emphasizes that the plant will use existing materials and technologies, aiming for faster deployment compared with rival fusion concepts that remain in the experimental stage. The LOI also envisions potential training uses for the plant’s prototype facilities, positioning Oak Ridge as a hub for workforce development in advanced nuclear.

TVA President and CEO Don Moul said the project could make Tennessee the home of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion facility, underscoring TVA’s role in supplying reliable, carbon-free energy to support surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing.

For Tennessee, the project bolsters Governor Bill Lee’s broader push to develop a “nuclear ecosystem” in the state. Oak Ridge already has a storied history in nuclear research, and officials say this next phase could deliver both economic growth and high-value jobs in the Tennessee Valley.

Type One Energy, founded in 2019 and venture-backed in 2023, is pursuing what it calls a low-risk commercialization pathway, blending computational physics, advanced manufacturing, and high-field superconducting magnets. The company’s FusionDirect program is designed to shorten the timeline for delivering market-ready plants. CEO Christofer Mowry described the TVA partnership as “the world’s first private-sector fusion power plant project.”

The agreement remains preliminary. Any final commitment to build Infinity Two will require TVA Board approval, regulatory clearance, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes. The LOI does not yet include funding or offtake contracts for the plant’s energy output.

The announcement reflects broader momentum in the U.S. toward advanced nuclear innovation, as utilities explore options beyond fission to meet demand. While fusion remains unproven at commercial scale, the TVA–Type One partnership highlights growing confidence that the technology could move from laboratory experiments toward real-world power generation within the next decade.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/oilprice.com/3270883a29ee4206fc51ec8bddba327e,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:40.755056

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Looking ahead, the Wood Mackenzie report identifies “regulatory pushback” as a key obstacle to further VPP integration, pointing to utilities’ practice of rate basing distributed energy resources – including the cost of distributed energy systems in the utilities’ asset base, from which they can earn a return – as one that limits opportunities for new distributed energy investment.

In most states hosting Microsoft facilities, grid electricity remains at least 50% fossil fuel-generated, and new data centers will instigate additional coal and gas consumption.
“The sheer scale of Microsoft’s AI data center buildout could have global implications for the climate, and it also comes with serious impacts for local communities.
These data centers contribute to higher electricity rates and raise concerns over water supply in the regions where they are clustered,” said Rachel Kitchin, Senior Corporate Campaigner at Stand.earth.

SEATTLE (Traditional Puget Sound Salish and Duwamish Lands) — A new report released today by environmental advocacy group Stand.earth finds that Microsoft’s rapid expansion of AI data centers is set to lock in massive new fossil fuel infrastructure, undermining the company’s 100% renewable energy and carbon-negative commitments, and threatening community health across the U.S.

The report, titled Global Ramifications, Local Impact: Microsoft’s AI Pollution Footprint, finds that Microsoft’s electricity demand for AI data centers will surge over 600% by 2030, which is enough to power the entire New England region, or 12% of all homes in the U.S. Despite the company’s significant investments in renewable-energy generation, the report also reveals that most of Microsoft’s North American data centers still draw at least 50% of their power from coal and gas grids — which will result in utilities planning new gas plants, pipeline expansions, and coal-plant life extensions to meet the growing load.

The report’s key findings include the following:

North American electricity demand from Microsoft data centers will surge over 600% by 2030 — enough to power 12% of all homes in the U.S., or almost the entire electricity consumption of the New England region (i.e., Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont).

In most states hosting Microsoft facilities, grid electricity remains at least 50% fossil fuel-generated, and new data centers will instigate additional coal and gas consumption.

Microsoft’s data center pollution (i.e., Scope 1 and 2) reached over 7.87 million metric tons of CO₂e (i.e., carbon dioxide equivalent) globally in its 2023 fiscal year — an amount that exceeds the annual climate pollution generated by the state of Vermont.

Colocation deals obscure the full scale of pollution: Microsoft leads all hyperscalers in pre-leased third-party capacity, but provides 0% dedicated reporting on its energy use or pollution.

“The sheer scale of Microsoft’s AI data center buildout could have global implications for the climate, and it also comes with serious impacts for local communities. These data centers contribute to higher electricity rates and raise concerns over water supply in the regions where they are clustered,” said Rachel Kitchin, Senior Corporate Campaigner at Stand.earth. “If Microsoft is set to demand as much energy as an entire U.S. region, the least the company can do is ensure that demand isn’t met with fossil fuels that pollute local communities. Microsoft can’t hand-wave away community concerns with sleight-of-hand promises of future clean energy, or greenwash its ongoing love affair with fossil fuels — these new data centers must be backed by new, locally sourced, 24/7 renewable energy before they go online.”

A case study included in the new report analyzes proposals underway in Person County, North Carolina, which is home to multiple coal plants, including one of the largest coal plants in the U.S. As a result, its communities have dealt with decades of toxic pollution, including groundwater with high levels of arsenic, chromium, cobalt, and selenium, as well as radioactivity 11 times the maximum contaminant concentration limit. A planned AI build-out in the county has prompted Duke Energy to propose new gas turbines, pipeline extensions, and even consider extending coal-plant operations — threatening air quality, water supplies, and community well-being in a historically marginalized region. While Microsoft has not formally announced that this site will house a data center, at a spring 2025 hearing held by the North Carolina House Committee on Energy and Public Utilities, an American Petroleum Institute representative gave a presentation that identified this site as a Microsoft data center.

“Big companies like Microsoft can make their own clean energy and work with the utility to make sure that everyone has enough reliable power – and regular customers shouldn’t have to pay for expensive dirty power plants and pipelines when our needs can be served by clean energy,” said Steph Gans, Assistant Director of Clean Water for North Carolina. “It’s like asking us to pay for Bill Gates’s electric bill. If Microsoft really didn’t want their data centers to be used as an excuse to build more fossil fuel projects and charge customers for it, they would intervene in North Carolina’s carbon plan proceedings, they would speak out against lobbyists who use their projects as a reason to push gas-friendly legislation, and they would already have a plan to use clean energy for their projects.”

The report concludes with the following recommendations:

New data centers must be powered by 24/7 renewable energy: To ensure new data center energy demand isn’t being met by fossil fuels or false solutions that pose new risks, Microsoft must make a commitment to build out local, additional 24/7 renewable energy infrastructure before its data centers begin operation.

Increase transparency around hourly matching energy procurement: Microsoft should publicly report granular data around the implementation of hourly matching to ensure the energy needs of its data centers are met by renewable power at all times of the day.

Scale up community benefit programs: Microsoft should ensure timely, active, and good-faith outreach to communities where it wants to establish data centers.

Establish and enforce these same renewable energy, transparency, and community benefit standards for colocation data centers: As a large user of colocation facilities, Microsoft should use its power to pressure the colocation data centers it contracts with to follow the same protocols it implements to reduce environmental and community harms.

Strengthen voluntary and regulatory reporting standards: Leading AI companies must advocate in support of ending reporting loopholes in global target-setting initiatives such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which permit low quality renewable energy procurement, and support a shift to granular (i.e., 24/7) energy accounting.

“Right now we’re at a crossroads. The direction Microsoft chooses for its AI strategy will directly impact both the global climate and local communities across the U.S.,” said Kitchin. “Done correctly, Microsoft and other leading AI providers have a chance to rapidly accelerate our society’s shift to a renewable energy future with a new type of climate commitment fit for the age of AI. Microsoft can provide real benefits to the communities and grids where they operate, and make itself a major force for positive change on both a local and global scale.”

The coming fleet of data centers will feature some of the largest individual sources of electricity demand and while there is substantial uncertainty about exactly how much electricity data centers will consume, growth toward 10 percent of U.S. electricity within this decade is a reasonable estimate. Such growth has raised questions about how the United States can adequately supply electricity to power this technology while maintaining grid security, affordability, and progress toward environmental goals.

Powering AI will surely impact electricity demand, and it is increasingly likely that AI itself will transform electricity grid operations. Modern AI tools can process large amounts of data, explore and optimize solutions to complex problems, and be used by centralized and decentralized decisionmakers to find local and global optima. AI should therefore be particularly helpful in the electricity sector, which is replete with data and clear performance metrics (e.g., price, reliability, revenue, and efficiency). These interventions would be welcomed and timely for the sector, which is now challenged with meeting multiple imperatives and has emerged as a priority issue for policymakers on both sides of the aisle.

Grid Applications of AI

There have been some excellent and in-depth reviews of AI applications to the electricity sector, which have informed and inspired this analysis. In particular, a recent systematic review of papers documenting how AI and machine learning tools can be applied to energy systems found dozens of examples where AI was providing documented improvements over existing practices and key insights for how they can be classified in terms of specific AI technologies and maturity, as well as issues for public policy. Additionally, the Department of Energy published a comprehensive report highlighting AI applications to modernize the grid, and the International Energy Agency published an in-depth study of both the energy demands of AI and its potential applications within energy.

This analysis is not intended to comprehensively identify all potential contributions of AI to the electricity sector, but rather to highlight the near-term solutions readily scalable to help address the three core challenges facing the electricity sector: reliability, operational efficiency, and rapid growth.

Managing AI Induced Grid Vulnerabilities

As these applications demonstrate, AI has the potential to mitigate immediate challenges facing today’s electricity grid. However, implementing these tools requires careful attention to the inevitable new risks that arise from deploying new technologies. Because the electricity sector is so critical, complex, and sensitive, appropriate measures must be put in place to ensure these benefits are safely realized.

The key challenge for policy makers is to strike a balance between encouraging AI adoption where it most enhances reliability, efficiency, and growth while safeguarding critical infrastructure with appropriate governance and oversight mechanisms. Implementation at scale will need appropriate safeguards for maintaining cybersecurity.

Risks from AI integration with the grid span the value chain. In the case of real-time decision support, AI systems are considered black boxes, making it difficult to verify and validate tool outputs before implementing system-wide changes. Faulty or poorly trained models could amplify, rather than reduce, reliability concerns. Similarly, because AI systems themselves are so complex, pairing them with the already complicated grid architecture could lead to new failure modes. Existing literature has sought to highlight these risks and recommend mitigation measures. For example, the DOE Office of Cybersecurity, Energy, and Emergency Response wrote a report on the potential risks of expanding the use of AI in critical energy infrastructure.

Due to the criticality of the grid, electricity planners, regulators, utilities, and operators are historically risk adverse. Integrating AI solutions at scale—especially those informing real-time and automated operational responses—will be a slow process without policymakers supporting clear objectives, industry working together to iterate and learn quickly, and appropriate safeguards in place for consumers and the grid.

Effective risk mitigation will be essential for building confidence in AI applications on the grid. Protecting customer privacy through data anonymization can reduce exposure to misuse of sensitive information, such as household occupancy patterns. Establishing clear industry standards will give utilities and regulators a shared foundation for evaluating tools, while maintaining human oversight in critical decisions can ensure accountability. Robust testing environments, digital twinning, and regulatory sandboxes will allow new applications to be trialed safely before widespread deployment, and system redundancies can provide additional safeguards to preserve reliability if AI-enabled systems fail. Together, these measures can help translate technical innovation into trustworthy practice.

Key Observations and Policy Recommendations

America's AI Action Plan identifies the “limited and slow adoption of AI” as a key bottleneck to realizing its potential economywide impacts, citing “distrust or lack of understanding of the technology, a complex regulatory landscape, and a lack of clear governance and risk mitigation standards.” These barriers are evident in electricity, where AI tools show clear promise but remain at the pilot stage.

Although AI offers significant opportunities for improving reliability, cutting costs, and permitting growth, adoption has been uneven. A Federation of American Scientists report identified 12 high-value AI applications for the grid, yet even the most technically mature are not applied at scale in the United States. Surveys from the International Energy Agency confirm this globally: Grid operators reported using AI for asset management and planning (70 percent) or grid development (54 percent), while fewer than one-quarter (23 percent) reported deploying AI in daily operations such as load forecasting. Operators expressed skepticism about relying on AI for critical decisions, preferring advisory roles for software and maintaining traditional standards.

To realize the benefits of AI in energy, the United States must balance the try-first experimentalism preferred in the digital economy with the stringent safety and reliability demands of the power system. Achieving this balance will require political leadership from the federal government to prioritize strategic projects, support near-term demonstrations, and promote best practices through standards and information sharing.

Some immediate policy recommendations are as follows:

Develop standards to capture reliability benefits of AI. The AI Action Plan calls for a coordinated federal approach to domain-specific efforts led by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In doing so, NIST could lead in adapting its AI Risk Management Framework—a voluntary framework that guides the safe and trustworthy design, deployment, and use of AI—to grid applications for load forecasting, fault detection, and other operational matters. Working with the DOE, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and industry, NIST could define standards that would give operators and their regulators a shared basis for validating AI’s performance and reliability, building confidence in the tools that are developed so that they can be widely adopted. The DOE and states could use those standards in supporting grid enhancement projects and implementation initiatives with grants and loans.

Allow FERC to incorporate AI into grid planning and expansion. Prolonged interconnection processes are stalling the development of new generation. Demonstrations have shown how they can be sped up with AI tools for document management and simulations of the power grid. Defining how these tools can be used by grid planners is a key task for regulators and thus should be a FERC-led process. The Federation of American Scientists recommends that a FERC-DOE-RTO working group convene to “clarify the regulatory pathway for AI use cases in grid planning,” a proposal which would bring the right parties into the process and provide clarity on how AI-enabled tools can inform long-term investment and expansion decisions.

Define priority regions for demonstration projects. The DOE has existing authority to support grid enhancements and projects that would implement AI in applications such as dynamic line ratings. With substantial expertise in grid flows and data center development, the DOE can define priority areas where congestion is exacerbating electricity rates and limiting growth. Deploying AI-assisted tools such as dynamic line ratings and distributed energy resource management in high-impact contexts will build confidence, generate replicable models, and demonstrate the value of federal leadership.

Support demand flexibility, large and small. The AI Action plan cites data center flexibility as a key tool for improving grid efficiency and accommodating new demand. Federal support should extend this principle to encourage distributed participation through virtual power plants and other distributed resources. Expanding demand-side options will give utilities and regulators more tools to deploy during periods of peak load, and consumers access to the benefits ofa more dynamic grid.

Economy-Wide Energy Effects

This paper has thus far focused on what AI can do in support of the electricity sector and highlighted several areas where AI tools can address the challenges that sector faces today. Resolving these issues through the application of AI and broader reforms to the energy sector will be important for a thriving economy in the future. But AI can and will affect energy use more broadly.

AI tools will help deliver efficiencies across energy intensive sectors of the economy, where firms adopt practices to reduce costs and increase output. In its AI and Energy report, the International Energy Agency estimated energy savings across key subsectors by 2035 that could be achieved with AI applications (See Table 2). Based on projected 2035 U.S. demand, AI applications could save nearly 2,500 petajoules (PJ) of energy for the U.S. if fully realized. This translates to approximately 4.5 percent of 2035 demand in the three most energy intensive sectors.

Applications for AI thus create opportunities to make industry, transportation, and buildings more productive in terms of total energy usage (not just electricity). And since these sectors have traditionally been labeled hard to abate because they are difficult to electrify, AI-driven energy reduction could provide another pathway towards marginal decarbonization.

Whether AI can provide tools to accelerate larger increases energy productivity of the economy, in the same way economists expect it to increase labor productivity, is an important question beyond AI’s own energy consumption or applications to the grid.

Conclusion

AI tools are uniquely positioned to address problems in energy, a sector replete with data, complex optimization problems, and multiple layers of governance. The tools already under development will enhance efficiencies, save companies and consumers money, and help realize new business models and technologies. However, without appropriate safeguards and regulatory oversight, the same AI solutions that could enhance grid operations could unleash new vulnerabilities to this critical infrastructure. The question facing policymakers is how those tools might be utilized to solve immediate problems facing society, and how those can be prioritized and accelerated while moderating the degree of additional risk.

The United States has adopted a strong stance toward winning the AI race, recognizing the economic and security stakes of being at the front of the line in this new technology. The country is now rushing to enable that victory by increasing the availability of electricity for datacenters through vigorous investment, accelerated permitting for individual projects, and infrastructure strategies. As that is done, applying AI solutions to the energy sector could help reduce friction in expanding and operating an increasingly complex grid. Reliable and affordable electricity at the scale necessary to meet the needs of innovative industries of the future is key to U.S. economic security and competitiveness. AI is a driver of challenges to the grid but should also be seen as a tool that can be leveraged to enhance the grid and allow the electricity sector to rise to the challenge.

Temperatures flare

Climate change may be a nonstarter for the Trump administration, but activists and scientists haven’t taken their feet off the gas pedal as they pressure the rest of the world to live up to previously agreed climate commitments — a pressure campaign that will be out in full force this week in New York.

Except the specifics of those commitments are largely MIA at the moment.

This year, all countries that signed the Paris Agreement are required to submit their new climate pledges. These nationally determined contributions, or NDCs, must be sent every five years to demonstrate each country’s commitments to help the world stick to the goal of keeping warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Usually, NDCs are submitted long before UNGA, but this year, only 36 out of 197 countries have published their NDCs, writes my colleague Jesse Chase-Lubitz, who will be at Climate Week. Still missing from the list are some of the world’s biggest emitters, including India, Saudi Arabia, the European Union, and Indonesia.

A high-level meeting of 40 heads of state on Sept. 24, when each leader will give a preview of their country’s NDCs, will be the first window into the missing commitments.

“This is an important moment,” Marcos Neto, assistant administrator at the U.N. Development Programme, tells Jesse.

He’s not especially worried about the number of NDCs still to be submitted — pointing out that there has been a consensus throughout the U.N. that “quality and ambition is more important than doing it in a hurry” and that so far the NDCs submitted are “fundamentally a better set of NDCs.”

Those that have already been sent in, he says, are “better, more ambitious, more investible. They take cost into account, and are far more whole-of-society than before.”

Forced reform

Back to UNGA (expect to hear that a lot this week). An overarching theme will be reforming the U.N. itself, motivated in no small part by U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget cuts, which have forced the U.N. to slash its own budget, fire staff, and consolidate agencies, as my colleague Colum Lynch has been detailing for months.

Trump’s fingerprints on the process have engendered deep skepticism among U.N. staffers and experts, who claim the reforms are a hasty cost-cutting exercise rather than a carefully thought-out blueprint for making the U.N. more relevant.

“I have no doubt there’s a lot of efficiencies to be had, and people should be brave and try to tackle it,” Elizabeth Campbell, the executive director of ODI Global Washington, told Colum during a recent Devex Pro Briefing with Richard Gowan, the U.N. and multilateral diplomacy director at the International Crisis Group. “I am highly skeptical that the U.N. itself can effectively pursue that kind of reform. I don’t really see it able to do it,” Campbell said.

For his part, Gowan argues that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres’ consolidation project has been hindered by internal bureaucratic resistance, a lack of clarity in U.S. plans for the U.N., and a dwindling timetable as Guterres enters his final year as head of the world body.

“When you talk to diplomats, most of them will say: Yeah, we support UN80. This needs to happen just to keep the ship afloat, but we’re going to wait for the next person, whoever she is, or whoever he is, and we’re going to see if we can find a new secretary-general who will have the time and the political capital to really drive a much bigger strategic review of where the U.N. is going.”

Fine line

When does sexual education for teenagers cross the line? What is that imaginary line anyway? Who draws it and who has the power to erase it?

There are no easy answers, but it’s a constant battle of wills in today’s culture wars. One of those confrontations is playing out at UNICEF, which scrubbed its website of guides meant to help teenagers navigate their bodies and relationships, after a conservative U.S. advocacy group accused the agency of pushing “sexually explicit programs targeting children.”

For the Center for Family and Human Rights, or C-Fam, UNICEF’s sexual education publications normalized LGBTQ+ relationships, promoted masturbation, and encouraged girls to explore their anatomy, among other things.

For some UNICEF staff, it was critical information that’s now been censored — setting a worrying precedent.

“What do children and young people want and need? That should be the core of what we do — a lot of what was taken down had been designed and discussed with them and with their caretakers,” a staffer tells my colleague Ayenat Mersie.

But Lisa Correnti, C-Fam’s executive vice president, tells Ayenat that taking down web pages did not amount to a win: “The removal of its public-facing material cannot be regarded as a success if the agency continues to promote the same controversial issues and materials in a less visible manner.”

All-nighter

Back in Washington, D.C., lawmakers in the U.S. Congress have been engaged in their own pitched political battles. One notable debate that the development community kept a close eye on was the reauthorization of the U.S. Department of State, which is managing the foreign assistance portfolio it inherited from the U.S. Agency for International Development.

After a nearly 36-hour marathon session, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a set of bills that would not only reauthorize the State Department, but also put in place a new organizational structure and set of policies, including how it would focus foreign assistance — assuming the bills become law.

That’s a long way away. Historically, State Department reauthorizations have been a bear, so getting this latest one out of committee is merely a first step. The full House still needs to approve it. Then the Senate will have its own proposal, which would have to be reconciled with the House version and then approved again by both houses of Congress. Then it heads to Trump’s desk.

Still, the nascent bills offer a useful window into what foreign assistance might look like in its new home. Among other things, they would create an undersecretary for foreign assistance, a director, and an Office of Foreign Assistance Oversight.

Republicans cheered — and pushed through — the passage, while Democrats booed it.

On the overall restructuring of the State Department, Rep. Chris Smith, a Republican from New Jersey, said, “The administration has already showed this model delivers faster, more effective assistance while strengthening U.S. credibility abroad.”

But Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the committee, criticized the bills for “rubber-stamping the Trump administration’s illegal action to shutter USAID.”

The partisan divide mirrors the larger schism over federal spending, which will consume both chambers over the next few weeks, so don’t expect the reauthorization to be a priority, especially as the U.S. government careens toward a shutdown if no budget deal is reached by Sept. 30.

How to Join: Purchase the product in-store or online, share your vision of a fossil fuel–free future through Lush’s interactive activity, and sign up with OCI to keep building the movement.

Every person deserves clean air to breathe, safe water to drink, and a stable climate to live in. But fossil fuel executives knowingly destroy our planet for profit and frontline communities are paying the highest price.

The fossil fuel industry makes billions in record profits, while wildfires choke our air, heat domes scorch our cities, and floods wipe out homes. This isn’t an accident, it’s the cost of their greed.

At Oil Change International (OCI), we fight to stop it. For twenty years, our mission has been to expose the real cost of oil, gas, and coal, and fight for a fast, fair, and funded phaseout of fossil fuels. We’re data-driven, people-powered, and justice focused.

Communities over fossil fuel executives

The climate crisis is a justice issue. Indigenous, Black, and low-income communities are often hit first and worst by climate disasters. They’re also leading the charge for change.

From Louisiana to Nigeria, we partner with frontline organizers who fight back against fossil fuel expansion. In California, we’ve worked alongside youth activists pushing for an end to neighborhood oil drilling. In Japan, we support campaigns to stop dangerous new fossil fuel projects and hold governments and companies accountable.

And we don’t just fight fossil fuels—we follow the money. OCI exposes how governments pour billions into oil and gas projects, even as they make empty climate promises. Our advocacy helps power movements and our research brings the receipts.

The science is clear

To avoid climate collapse, governments must stop approving new fossil fuel projects.

And we can afford it. The billions in fossil fuel subsidies handed out each year could instead fund real climate solutions: renewable energy, green jobs, and investments in the communities hit hardest.

But fossil fuel companies don’t just block action, they sell dangerous distractions. From carbon capture to gas, their techno fixes are just new ways to keep polluting. We’re calling them out and helping people see through the greenwashing.

Hope

All over the world, people protect their homes and families. Communities organize, youth lead. The pressure is mounting. The era of fossil fuels is ending, it’s just a matter of how quickly, and how just the process will be.

A fossil-free world isn’t just possible, it’s necessary. And it’s already being built.

Among all renewable energy generation technologies, solar alone accounted for 6,012 new jobs (between Q4 2023 and Q4 2024) thus expanding its cumulative to 370,556, according to the report by the environmental advocacy group.

The US clean energy jobs now account for 42% of all energy jobs and 2.3% of overall national workforce in the country. E2 shares that now more people work in clean energy related occupations than work as nurses, cashiers, waiters and waitresses, or preschool, elementary, and middle school teachers.

Clean energy and clean vehicle sectors added more than 520,000 jobs with an increase of 17% over the last 5 years, ‘far exceeding’ the gain in employment in fossil fuels, gas and diesel motor vehicles as well as the overall US economy.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said E2’s Executive Director, Bob Keefe. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Citing US Bureau of Labor Statistics, E2 says that at the beginning of 2025, clean energy was expected to remain one of the fastest growing segments of the US economy. Wind turbine technician and solar installation jobs were projected to be the fastest-growing jobs in America.

Recent Trump administration policies have slowed renewable energy growth by cutting tax credits, canceling permits, and adding regulatory hurdles. While the E2 report does not reflect these actions, analysts believe that significant job losses have already taken place in the industry and may lead to more.

Broadly speaking, state lawmakers should strongly consider deploying mandatory GHG emissions reporting programs where they don’t already exist.","In a new phase of the Trump administration’s assault on the federal government, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced last week that it plans to largely dissolve the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The GHGRP is an important, high-quality data resource for federal agencies, industry stakeholders, community advocates, and many others working to advance the clean energy transition, cut pollution, and protect public health.

You can’t manage what you can’t measure, and this move is an extension of the Trump administration’s broader assault on sources of truth. The public has a right to know how much dangerous, planet-warming pollution is being emitted by large industries, and policymakers need these numbers to make informed decisions. Eliminating the GHGRP would limit access to unbiased information on pollution in communities across the country—an intentional move to slow climate progress and let major polluters off the hook.

But states can step up to fill the gap, and advocates can still push back. The comment period on EPA’s decision to eliminate the GHGRP is open until November 3, 2025. This is a moment for vocal resistance, before the White House’s decision is finalized.

What Is the GHGRP, and Why Does It Matter?

The Obama administration established the GHGRP in 2010 as an initiative to track climate-warming pollution from the nation’s biggest emitters. For the last 15 years, the program has collected emissions data on more than half a dozen greenhouse gases from roughly 8,000 of the highest-polluting industrial facilities across the U.S. GHGRP’s datasets. These publicly available emissions records are a treasure trove for lawmakers, businesses, and climate advocates. They can use them to track and compare facilities’ emissions, identify opportunities to cut pollution, and develop informed climate policies. Economists have even found that the GHGRP, by forcing transparency and accountability for major polluters, has helped deter greenwashing and encouraged meaningful corporate environmental initiatives.

If we want to tackle the climate crisis, we need to know where climate pollution is coming from. Pollution monitoring is often a priority for environmental justice advocates and frontline communities because cutting pollution requires understanding its sources. The GHGRP provides that foundational knowledge to empower emissions mitigation initiatives, and closing it down will broadly obscure our visibility into where climate pollution is coming from in the U.S. This move advances the Trump administration’s imperative, backed by the oil and gas industry, to undermine any attempts to combat the climate crisis. But we have the tools to respond.

States Can Fill the Gap Left by the GHGRP

States can establish their own greenhouse gas reporting programs—and several already have. California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Massachusetts, and New Jersey all require some set of major polluters to report their GHG emissions to state agencies. Each state lays out its own methodology for tracking emissions and sets its own thresholds for which entities are required to report, but the ultimate outcome is the same: an entirely state-based program collecting the kind of data that EPA will no longer track.

Those reporting programs are a valuable tool to help states measure their progress toward decarbonization targets, and California and Washington’s enable them to implement nation-leading cap-and-trade initiatives. California’s reporting rule has been on the books since 2007—three years before EPA established the GHGRP. There is a strong precedent for states acting on their own to track major pollution sources.

Other states are lining up for similar initiatives, with greenhouse gas reporting programs currently in development. Earlier this year, for example, New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation released its own draft rule to establish a mandatory GHG reporting program. The rule incorporates lessons learned from the EPA GHGRP and other state reporting programs. Building on those precedents, New York will soon have its own program in place to require annual emissions reporting from the state’s largest polluters—a model that can be replicated by any number of other states looking to maintain high-quality GHG emissions data after the GHGRP is shuttered.

Individual state programs aren’t the only pathway to collecting emissions data without federal buy-in. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has set up a similar system (PDF) across nearly a dozen states. RGGI sets a regional cap on carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution from the power sector and creates an interstate market in emissions allowances, which are distributed to polluters through quarterly auctions. In order to set up and run that allowance market, every RGGI member state sets rules for the covered energy facilities to monitor and report their CO2 pollution.

While these state and regional programs are more limited in scope than the federal GHGRP, they demonstrate clearly that state lawmakers have all the tools at hand to effectively replace the GHGRP for facilities within their jurisdiction. A rollback of the GHGRP would be a major blow to our ability to measure the problem we’re facing, but states can step up to gather and report their own high-quality pollution data without relying on the Trump administration.

What Comes Next?

Broadly speaking, state lawmakers should strongly consider deploying mandatory GHG emissions reporting programs where they don’t already exist. In doing so, they can draw on the reporting rules already written in more than a dozen states; there’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

In the immediate term, states with reporting programs already in development—New York foremost among them—should also accelerate their rulemakings to fill data gaps before GHGRP winds down. As the Trump administration eliminates climate protections across the board, states can take up the mantle of leadership.

Climate advocates also have the opportunity to push back during the open comment period on the decision to shutter GHGRP, which closes on November 3, 2025. Public comments provide a crucial opportunity to build a record of opposition that can slow down the Trump administration’s rollbacks. Adverse comments on Trump’s rollbacks can support legal challenges down the road and serve as extra hoops for agency officials to jump through, because they are legally required to respond to substantive objections. Losing the GHGRP is a setback, but we aren’t left helpless. State leaders and concerned citizens can and must act.

As part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that was passed in 2022, this measure provides up to $7,500 in applicable tax credit with the purchase of a qualifying new EV, as a means to incentivize car shoppers into buying an environmentally-friendly EV instead of a gas-powered internal-combustion vehicle.

Find out below when the EV tax credit expires and how to get the tax credit.

What Is Happening to the $7,500 Credit?

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) into law. The OBBBA essentially set the economic agenda for Trump’s second administration by extending a number of tax cuts from his first administration, as well as cutting funding to several programs such as Medicaid and the EV tax credit.

As a result of the OBBBA, the $7,500 EV tax credit will now expire on Sept. 30.

How Can You Still Get the $7,500 Tax Credit?

Following the OBBBA’s passing, auto manufacturers initially assumed that car buyers would have to sign a purchase contract, make a down payment and physically receive their new EV by or before Sept. 30 in order to receive the credit.

However, the IRS has created something of a loophole in the credit’s expiration, per Yahoo Finance. “If a taxpayer acquires a vehicle by having a written binding contract in place and a payment made on or before Sept. 30, 2025, then the taxpayer will be entitled to claim the credit when they place the vehicle in service (namely, when they take possession of the vehicle), even if the vehicle is placed in service after Sept. 30, 2025,” according to the IRS.

In short: As long as an EV buyer signs a purchase contract and pays a deposit (or the full purchase amount) by or before Sept. 30, that buyer is entitled to the EV tax credit, even if the vehicle isn’t in their possession by that date.

What does this mean for you? Well, if you’ve been planning to purchase an EV and you can affordably make a down payment on an EV between now and Sept. 30, you’ll still be able to receive the IRA’s EV tax credit before it expires for good.

Engineering innovation, customer centricity and collaboration are helping industries meet the challenge.

By Ruben Alvarez, CEO of John Crane

At John Crane, we work with customers across a wide range of industries – from oil and gas to renewables, chemicals and power generation – giving us a front-row view of how the energy transition is taking shape around the world.

From large scale industrial players to regional innovators, there is an urgency, complexity and opportunity involved in decarbonising operations, a process to be engineered in a way that supports the critical systems the world relies on every day.

Facing real-world hurdles on the path to cleaner energy

Transitioning from traditional fuels to cleaner technologies isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. There’s legacy equipment to adapt, regulations to navigate, mandatory legislation to comply with – all while keeping operations safe, reliable and increasingly low-emission.

For many organisations, that means balancing operational performance with the urgent need to decarbonise, reduce fugitive emissions and improve energy efficiency across everything from process equipment to storage.

While traditional energy systems remain essential in many regions today, the focus is shifting toward cleaner, more sustainable solutions, with traditional fuels like liquefied natural gas (LNG) playing an important role along the way.

There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution. The energy transition looks different in every country, and even every facility. But that’s also where the opportunity lies. If you can solve these challenges, you go beyond ticking boxes and start to shape the future of energy.

One of the most effective ways to decarbonise existing fossil fuel power plants is through post-combustion carbon capture, which removes CO₂ from flue gas after combustion. According to the International Energy Agency, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) could reduce energy-related emissions by 13%, with global capture capacity set to grow by 35% and storage by 70% by 2030.

Across the industry, more companies are making CCUS a practical part of their decarbonisation strategies. This technology is rapidly progressing from pilot projects to large-scale operations, often in demanding environments.

First CO2 volumes successfully stored at Northern Lights

Putting customers at the heart of innovation

So, how do we help companies make this shift? It comes down to listening to what customers need and then working with them to deliver real solutions.

The lessons we’re learning from hydrogen projects in Europe are already helping customers in North America and Asia. In water-scarce regions, we’re helping operators use less and recycle more by reducing process losses and improving system efficiency. And in remote locations, our teams are finding ways to keep critical equipment running longer and more reliably. It’s a two-way street: we learn as much from our customers as they do from us.

Take our work with Franco Tosi Meccanica in Italy, for example. Together, we’re supporting a pilot project on supercritical CO₂ power cycles – a technology that could make power generation cleaner and more efficient. Our job is to engineer sealing solutions that can perform under the demanding conditions of advanced power generation systems. It’s a great example of how collaboration is driving real progress.

Innovation is about responding directly to what keeps our customers awake at night.

Growth with purpose

So, what’s next? For me, it’s about growth, but not just in terms of numbers. It’s about growing our impact: helping more customers reach their sustainability goals, investing in our people and nurturing the wider industry, while pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Our partnership with the University of Sheffield in the UK is one example. We’re working with researchers to push the boundaries of sealing technology for high-pressure hydrogen storage and other low-carbon applications. It’s not just about new products. It’s also about investing in the next generation of engineers and making sure the industry has the talent and ideas it needs to thrive.

We’re also seeing growing interest in LNG as a transitional fuel in several markets. While not the end goal, it can offer a practical bridge in reducing emissions where renewables are not yet scalable, and we are helping customers operate these systems more cleanly and reliably.

As the world undergoes this energy transition, engineering advancements and specialised sealing technologies will play a vital role in ensuring the efficient and reliable operation of both renewable and fossil fuel power generation systems.

New energy landscape means new opportunities

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that progress in this industry doesn’t come from standing still. It comes from rolling up our sleeves, collaborating across borders and being open to new ideas.

The road to a cleaner energy future isn’t always smooth, but it’s absolutely worth the effort.

The future of energy is being written right now, all over the world, and I’m excited to see where we can go together.

Dive Brief:

Based on low, medium and high emissions scenarios, the U.S. will reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26%-41% in 2040 compared with 2005 levels, according to Rhodium Group’s Taking Stock 2025 report.

However, the pace of decarbonization will slow dramatically, partially due to recent and potential policy changes by Congress and the Trump administration. Under the high emissions scenario, Rhodium estimates that average annual U.S. GHG emissions reductions were 1.1% from 2005 to 2024. That figure is now projected to fall to just 0.4% from 2025 to 2040, a 64% relative decline.

“The outcomes we report throughout Taking Stock this year are subject to considerable uncertainty, including an incredibly dynamic policy environment and persistent non-cost barriers to clean energy deployment,” the Sept. 10 report says. “These factors will continue to shape how the energy system and GHG emissions evolve in the coming years.”

Dive Insight:

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have adopted or proposed a wide range of policies that are likely to increase climate pollution compared with policies under the Biden administration. Those changes include a second withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, ending federal tax credits for electric vehicles and altering other clean energy credits, eliminating federal rules limiting GHG emissions from fossil fuel power plants, blocking wind and solar projects and more.

“The effects of these policy shifts are compounded by rapid growth in electricity demand driven predominantly by the growth in large AI data centers, a weakening macroeconomic outlook, and an increasingly export-driven fossil fuel sector,” the report says.

Additionally, Rhodium said its estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, given the unstable economic and policy environment.

“Emissions outcomes vary due to a range of expectations for economic growth, future fossil fuel prices, and clean energy cost and performance trends,” according to the report.

Under the medium and low emissions scenarios, decarbonization would likely continue to accelerate rather than slow with annual GHG emissions declining 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively, according to the report.

The power, transportation, and oil and gas sectors are driving emissions reductions in GHG.The power sector is projected to emit 15%-43% fewer emissions in 2040 compared with 2024 levels, despite growing electricity demand, the report found.

“Renewables grow substantially in all three emissions scenarios through 2030 to claim the expiring clean electricity tax credits, but deployment diverges after that,” according to Rhodium.

Transportation emissions, meanwhile, will fall 8%-20%, as zero-emissions vehicles comprise a larger share of the U.S. vehicle fleet, according to Rhodium. The report attributes the increased market share to falling battery prices and greater consumer acceptance.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/KgfDHOMT72pDBeY1K71Kg4sqswL2NkOy789TLOf_T_c/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8yRUFIQUJULmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:04.574279

Pilot Company has opened electric vehicle charging sites at more than 200 of its travel centers across almost 40 states, according to a Sept. 9 announcement.

Recent openings include Pilot’s first EV charging stations in Colorado, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming.

This puts the program, which is being developed through a collaboration with General Motors and charging infrastructure company EVgo, nearly halfway to its goal of 500 locations and 2,000 charging stalls.

Dive Insight:

Pilot is building many of its chargers in rural areas because fewer than half of rural counties had any public EV charging infrastructure, the company noted in its announcement. These could not only be a resource for customers in more remote areas, but can also encourage stops from road-trippers with electric vehicles.

Pilot travel centers are typically located along interstates, which carry more than 20% of total traffic in the U.S., according to the announcement. Its travel centers, which offer on-site restaurants and free WiFi in addition to their 350 kilowatt fast chargers, give customers plenty to do while their cars charge. They also feature Plug & Charge payments for compatible EVs.

“Our collaboration with General Motors and EVgo continues to bring highway-based charging to more routes where this critical infrastructure is needed to enable coast-to-coast EV travel,” said Shannon Sturgil, senior vice president of alternative fuels at Pilot.

To date, Pilot has received $15 million in funding help from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. While the Trump Administration has made some changes to the NEVI program, that funding could still help Pilot, GM and EVgo build more sites.

Pilot said it expects to reach 1,000 stalls in 40 states by the end of this year.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SU47PJuWrsEUqrg0rvP-iooQhdu8PmlIL_VpYMuNcVw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QSWxvdF9HTV9jaGFyZ2luZ185LjIxLjI1LnBuZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:55.988871

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average score across the country was 15 out of 100.

Missouri utilities advocated for a law passed earlier this year that will make it easier to increase utility bills for new gas-burning power plants and future projects approved by regulators who are appointed by the Governor. Kansas passed as similar law last year. Customers will see new rate increases to pay for new gas plants years before they provide service, largely in the name of economic development for multibillion dollar tech companies building power-hungry data centers.

The price of new gas-burning power plants is outpacing inflation, and the trend is likely to continue according to new analysis. Duke University research notes that new demand for electricity, for example from data centers, can be flexed to avoid building expensive new gas plants while maintaining electric grid reliability.

Ameren Missouri earned a 5% (F), an 11% decrease from the previous year. Ameren owns and plans to operate its Labadie coal-burning power plant until 2042, which is the one of the largest, dirtiest, and deadliest power plants in the country, because it lacks all modern pollution controls. Ameren admits its Sioux coal-burning plant is unlikely to operate at least 20% annually, meaning it could be offline when needed as customers continue to pay for the asset. Last year, the Sierra Club told utility regulators that Ameren over-inflated the price of renewable energy when critiquing the cost of Sioux’s extended operation.

AECI earned a 0% (F), which is the same score the utility earned the previous year. AECI is throwing good money after bad at its Thomas Hill coal plant in northern Missouri that has a recent history of breaking down. Thomas Hill didn’t operate for more than six of the last twelve months, including this past January when it was needed to power the grid during a polar vortex. AECI can be more secretive about its financials because it’s not a monopoly utility regulated by the state, nor is it a municipal utility that is overseen by locally elected officials.

Evergy earned a 9% (F), a 3% decrease from the previous year. Evergy was spotlighted in the report because of the utility’s multi-year backslide from renewable energy investments toward extending coal plant operations and building new gas-burning power plants. CEO David Campbell’s pivot toward more coal-burning and gas-burning saw the utility quietly drop its 70% greenhouse gas reduction target by 2030 goal from its website and regulatory filings as the company continues greenwashing its image.

In an interactive webpage, users can see their utility’s score and what progress–if any–the utility has made toward transitioning to cleaner, more affordable energy since the first version of the report in 2021.

Statement from Ty Gorman, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizing Strategist in Kansas:

“The dirty truth is that Evergy is extending uneconomic coal plants and building loads of new gas-burning power plants that will extract a massive amount of wealth from hardworking Kansans and benefit their worldwide shareholders. CEO David Campbell is responsible for this problem, and we need communities to come together and demand that his monopoly utility address its harms. Multibillion dollar tech companies with climate goals must fund clean energy, like Google, because Kansas communities are subsidizing new gas-burning power plants for their power-hungry AI data centers.”

Statement from Brian Smith, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Missouri:

“I’ve talked to cooperative members throughout Missouri, and the dirty truth is that the average person has no clue that AECI exists, let alone the massive influence it has over the rates and power sources for their regional electric cooperatives. Knowing that AECI exists would be like the average cooperative member knowing that Pepsico owns Doritos—choice is an illusion.”

The annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York comes more than a month after a deadline passed that Trump imposed on his Cabinet to identify international organizations that the U.S. should quit, defund or reform.

Since establishing the deadline in February, the president has intensified his attacks on global establishments that were created to combat rising temperatures, while also reversing domestic regulations, laws and commitments designed to expand clean energy and reduce climate pollution.

Now, his administration could be weighing whether to leave the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a move that would reshape international efforts on global warming for years to come, according to former Trump officials and environmental advocates.

The 1992 treaty, known as the UNFCCC, serves as the international structure for efforts by 198 countries to slow the pace of rising levels of greenhouse gases. It’s also the underlying framework for the Paris Agreement, which Trump moved to abandon on his first day in office.

Since then, his administration has dissolved the State Department office responsible for leading U.S. climate negotiations, dismembered a program that tracks the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions and thwarted clean energy policies in favor of expanding oil, gas and coal. Those actions are antithetical to the goals of the UNFCCC.

A high-profile departure from the global framework on climate change would be a marked escalation of Trump’s moves to divorce the U.S. from the nearly unanimous sentiment globally that climate change poses economic and natural upheaval. It would also be the most enduring step that Trump has taken so far, his allies argue.

By comparison, the 2015 Paris Agreement can be left and reentered on the whim of whomever happens to be president. Reentering treaties, such as the UNFCCC, could be more challenging.

“There is zero benefit to remaining in the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change,” Steven Groves, a former Trump official who’s now at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said in an email. “Leaving the Convention would prevent future Democrat administrations from circumventing Senate advice and consent on treaties, as President Obama did with the Paris Agreement.”

Groves, who served as chief of staff to Nikki Haley when she was ambassador to the U.N., said he doesn’t think Trump would use his U.N. speech to withdraw from the climate treaty. Such a move would be “trivial” compared to Trump’s focus on trade, investment and peace deals, Groves said.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said Trump would lay out a vision “for a safe, prosperous, peaceful America and the world” in his speech.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, our country is strong again, which has made the entire globe more stable,” Ingle said. “In only eight months, the President has brokered seven peace deals, secured historic trade deals and investments, and strengthened alliances across the world.”

The White House did not answer questions about whether the U.S. would withdraw from the UNFCCC or whether it was up for discussion.

‘Contrary to American interests’

The UNFCCC was ratified by then-President George H.W. Bush and supported by the Senate — one of the strongest commitments made by America to the climate fight. The United States’ connection to the Paris Agreement is more tenuous. Former President Barack Obama entered into partnership with that pact through an executive action, a move that has continued to irk conservatives.

If Trump does withdraw, it would raise questions about whether the U.S. could reenter the UNFCCC in the future.

Some legal experts say the Senate’s consent does not operate in perpetuity after the U.S. has left a treaty. Others argue that if a president can unilaterally leave a treaty that has earned support from two-thirds of the Senate, they could rejoin it without a new vote.

“Otherwise, you’re just handing this huge amount of power to a president to forever cancel the act of the Senate,” said Jean Galbraith, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written about treaties.

Regardless of the legal pathway, Galbraith said withdrawing from the treaty could pitch the global effort to grapple with rising temperatures into turmoil.

“First, it takes the United States out of the main forum for a crucial conversation about how to save our planet,” she said. “And second, it is a kind of potential path to a lot of instability going forward.”

Whether the review over quitting international fora has risen to Trump’s attention is unclear.

Eugene Chen, a senior fellow at New York University’s Center on International Cooperation, said the U.S. could reshape global plans on energy and environment even if Trump decides against quitting the UNFCCC.

Staying in the treaty, he said, could “have the benefits of being able to influence discussions and gum up the works if they so choose.”

Brett Schaefer, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who produced his own assessment of which organizations he thinks the U.S. should leave, argued that Trump should withdraw from the UNFCCC in part because the U.S. is not behind the more substantive agreements it underpins, including the Paris Agreement.

“If the United States is not going to support the prescriptive agreements, that casts questions over whether we should be participating in that process,” he said.

The review that Trump ordered has made its way through the State Department, according to two former officials who were asked for input during the process about how different organizations and treaties have benefited the United States. That feedback fed into a spreadsheet containing the names of treaties and institutions that included questions about their costs and benefits and asked for quantitative rankings.

It’s unclear where the review stands now. Trump’s February executive order instructed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to deliver it to the White House by early August.

A State Department spokesperson declined to answer detailed questions about the status of the review.

“President Trump ordered a review of U.S. participation in and funding for international organizations to ensure U.S. investments in international organizations are not contrary to American interests,” the spokesperson said in an email.

The executive order also called for input from the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Mike Waltz, who was confirmed for the position Friday, indicated during his Senate hearing that he believes the U.S. is spending too much attention and money on U.N. initiatives, including on climate change.

“It’s quite a list,” Waltz said, adding, “I think it is incumbent on this administration to say, ‘What’s it doing?’”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ee/e2/55507aaa448b97ee7c46587e2f2a/trump-82212.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:06:08.137069

During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.” Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices.
Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada.
Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.
Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.","Nevada is the only state in the nation that can deliver on every phase of the lithium life cycle – from mining to recycling.

Industry experts in the state say that selling point has the potential to make Nevada a leader in the lithium battery supply chain that powers everything from electric vehicles to the data centers driving AI growth.

Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo emphasized the importance of lithium for diversifying Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy at his second annual Nevada Lithium Summit Friday.

The lithium industry, however, has been hammered by falling prices in recent years due to softer demand and an oversupply of the battery metal globally, which has made mining the metal in the U.S. less attractive to investors.

On the second day of the lithium summit, Politico reported the Department of Energy (DOE) was reevaluating a $2.3 billion loan to the Thacker Pass lithium project, a massive proposed mine in Humboldt County near the Nevada-Oregon border. The energy agency cited the drop in price as a key factor in their rethink of the loan.

During the summit, Lombardo said the Thacker Pass lithium project – the largest known lithium deposit in North America – positioned Nevada as “a key player in both national and global supply chains.”

Thacker Pass isn’t the only lithium mine in Nevada feeling the impact of falling lithium prices. Earlier this year, mining developer Ioneer Corp. lost a $490 million investment to their Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron project in Esmeralda County after their investing partner backed out of the project, due in part to plummeting lithium prices.

Lithium prices have fallen more than 80% since their peak in 2022, reshaping market dynamics including in Nevada. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said average lithium fell from nearly $80,000 per tonne globally in December 2022 to about $10,000 per tonne this September. Analysts expect lithium prices to remain volatile the remainder of the year.

“Commodities ebb and flow,” said Tom Burns, the director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED), during a press conference at the summit.

Despite falling prices, Burns said Nevada’s position as the only state in the nation with a complete “Lithium Loop” that could offer mining and processing to battery manufacturing and recycling gave the state an edge for investment.

More investment from the federal government isn’t off the table, said Burns. President Donald Trump has made reducing foreign critical mineral dependency a major priority, citing national and economic security concerns. Nevada is poised to meet that need, said Burns.

“There is movement within the federal government to support critical minerals and mining and processing as a whole,” Burns said. “I think you’ll see that in Nevada.”

“Specifically, the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy has an interest in making sure those are produced here,” Burns continued.

Nevada Battery Coalition CEO Caleb Cage said industry experts believe the growing demand for lithium and battery storage will increase and stabilize prices for the metal over the next decade.

“Looking at it long term, the remarkable demand for lithium in particular should have the market effect of adjusting that price to make some of these projects more viable,” Cage said.

“The demand for battery storage is only growing right now,” Cage said.

Growing battery storage demand has already boosted Nevada’s economy. A decade ago, about 100 people were employed in the battery manufacturing industry, according to GOED. In 2025, more than 14,200 were employed in the industry.

Manufacturing grew by about 83% in Nevada from 2015 to 2025, significantly more than the 13% national average. That growth was largely driven by the battery manufacturing industry boosted by electric vehicles and clean energy demands.

Several companies have invested in battery manufacturing and recycling facilities in Nevada, including Tesla and Redwood Materials.

Major tech companies are now also investing heavily in large AI-enabled data centers, and lithium battery storage will be a part of that, said Cage.

Electricity demand in the U.S. has continued to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4% in 2023 to 12% by 2028. Those data centers will need battery storage systems to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

Growing adoption of renewable energy sources, sustainability objectives, and need for energy efficiency is also driving the transition away from traditional lead-acid batteries to lithium-ion batteries in data centers.

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy to build low-cost energy-storage systems that can meet surging power demand from AI data centers. The company said it’s already powering a modular data center in Sparks, Nevada for AI infrastructure company Cursoe at an energy cost lower than the grid.

“They’ve got that proof of concept out in Northern Nevada right now, and that model is going to be something that they want to replicate,” Cage said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lithiumboom-1024x7681758542925.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=EFWYOxzu,N,,2025-09-22 10:00:41.716904

University of Exeter researchers studied 121 marmalade hoverflies that landed on an oil rig in the Britannia oil field.","Matt Weiner, the founder and CEO of the nonprofit advocacy group Megafire Action, wants to bring some urgency back. This week, the organization launched a six-figure ad campaign in Washington, D.C., aimed at spurring senators to get back to working on wildfire resilience and forestry reform. Though the bill’s approach is divisive — the House version drew initial pushback from more than 100 environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council, and League of Conservation Voters, for opening up large tracts of federal forest to logging, among other concerns — Weiner told me “there’s no huge substantive holdup in the Senate that is keeping it from getting to 60 votes.”

I caught up with Weiner this week to learn more about where things stand with the Fix Our Forests Act and talk through some of the bill’s more controversial regulatory rollbacks. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Catch our readers up: Why the Fix Our Forests Act, and why now?

We’re looking at a generational opportunity to change the way we do land management. This is the most significant change Congress has considered since the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, and maybe even since the original National Forest Act.

The smoke impacts of wildfires are killing more people than the flames. Wildfires are the most significant driver of PM 2.5 emissions growth in the country right now. The clean air community has done a fantastic job of reducing industrial emissions of PM 2.5, which has had real public health impacts, but those gains are in danger of vanishing because of the growth of wildfire smoke exposure.

Then there’s the climate. If you care about carbon emissions, this is a huge opportunity at a time when a lot of other climate issues seem to be on the backburner. The 2020 fire season in California — a particularly bad year — released enough carbon to undo 20 years of the state’s emissions reduction progress. The 2023 Canadian wildfires, if treated as a country, would have been the third-largest emitter in the world that year. And if you start thinking about Alaska and the Boreal burning in the way the West has been burning, it could potentially be game over for the climate. It’s important that people understand that this is an existential climate issue and that we have an opportunity to make progress in a bipartisan way.

You and I have chatted before — we first spoke about the Fix Our Forests Act almost a year ago, now. What’s happened in the past 12 months with the bill?

The bill passed the House right after the Los Angeles fires. The last time we spoke [in October 2024], the bill had passed the House in the previous Congress with a bipartisan margin. But this time, it got a much bigger bipartisan show of support: 64 Democrats and all the Republicans in the House.

The bill saw some changes and improvements to focus on the immediate needs in Los Angeles County [after the January 2025 fires] — things like improving the ability of a city like Los Angeles to gain access to Community Wildfire Defense Grant funding and improvements to the Wildfire Intelligence Center targeted at making sure it plays a role in helping local governments make decisions on where to place assets before a high risk event.

Then the bill went to the Senate, but instead of moving the House bill through, a group of senators came together to write a bipartisan version with some changes. Senator Curtis from Utah was the lead, along with Senators Padilla, Hickenlooper, and Sheehy. Their version included changes to the litigation section from the House bill, which had raised concerns among a lot of environmental organizations, as well as modifications to the permitting section. That earned the bill the support of more environmental organizations than the version from the House — they have the Nature Conservancy, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Audubon Society, and the National Wildlife Federation on board, as well as a lot of local organizations and wildfire groups like the Alliance for Wildfire Resilience.

But then a lot of the oxygen in the Senate was taken up by the reconciliation package. That put a pause on things through the August recess, and now they’re looking to hopefully mark up the bill during the October work period. We’re very optimistic about being able to get floor time. We think there’s a clear path to 60 votes in the Senate for this bill, and if there’s a good, constructive markup, it could be much more than that. There’s no substantive holdup as much as there is the ever-present fear of stasis and losing momentum. That’s why we launched an ad campaign with an eye toward building the urgency back up.

How did the ad campaign come together?

The idea was that this is a bipartisan issue, so where is the support? We didn’t need to launch a big persuasion campaign; we needed to highlight the absurdity of the fact that, eight months after Los Angeles, we still haven’t had any meaningful action from Congress. There is an opportunity before them that would make a big difference in wildfire policy writ large.

I’m interested in your focus on using “state-of-the-art science” and “new and innovative technologies” to address wildfires and forest health. What have you seen in this space that has made you excited?

The bill is about improving the planning and implementation of wildfire policy — especially mitigation work like treatment projects, but also in the built environment. A big cornerstone of that would be the creation of a new Wildfire Intelligence Center, which would use the most advanced technology to understand what our risk profile is on the ground across landscapes and jurisdictions. Right now, there is no one entity in government responsible for taking a comprehensive look at risk across landscapes, what we’re doing on the ground, and how that buys down risk.

At the same time, one of the things we’re negotiating is making sure that the Forest Service and the Department of Interior are positioned to work with some of the companies doing advanced modeling, detection, and tracking work — as opposed to having the government try to build its own clunky system. We’ve modeled it after successful efforts elsewhere in government, such as the Defense Innovation Unit and other Department of Defense and NASA programs that have been great at harnessing private sector innovation for government use. There’s also a new pilot program in the bill, in Section 303, that would create a pathway for the Forest Service to start identifying and piloting new technologies and give them a path to scale across the agency if they find that it helps them do the job better, faster, and cheaper.

The timber industry has collaborated with the Forest Service on fire suppression since the 1920s. In the decades since, “forest management” has at times been used as a euphemism for industry-friendly practices like tree thinning, which many ecologists say would allow invasive species and brush to flourish, and would actually worsen wildfires. How would cutting the red tape around “vegetation management activities” not be a handout to the timber industry?

We all know that the best tool for mitigation is good fire, prescribed fire, beneficial fire, and — where appropriate — managed fire, as well. Unfortunately, because we’ve taken fire out of these landscapes, forested landscapes in particular are so overgrown that you couldn’t introduce good fire even if you wanted to. So mechanical thinning has to be a part of this.

One of the tensions here is that the timber industry wants merchantable timber. They want the big trees, and in a lot of cases, those are the ones we want to keep in the ground with these projects. What we’re focused on is invasive species, overgrown areas, and dead trees from morbidity events like recent droughts so that we can reintroduce good fire at scale. If we all let it burn, like some have proposed, you’d end up with hundreds of thousands of acres of landscape burning at a time, like we saw in the [2021] Caldor fire, where nothing will grow back in a way we recognize for at least decades — and given climate change, maybe not ever.

It’s important to make sure that we don’t go back to the timber wars [of the 1980s and 1990s between environmentalists and loggers in the Pacific Northwest], but at the same time, we need to recognize that the biggest threat to our forests right now is catastrophic fire, not the timber industry. We want to deal with the threat at hand and make sure the pendulum that swung during the timber wars — for very good reason — against the timber industry comes back a little, but doesn’t swing too far in the wrong direction, either. The Senate bill strikes the right balance there.

A number of major environmental groups initially came out in opposition to the Fix Our Forests Act over numerous concerns, including that it erodes Endangered Species Act protections by exempting the Forest Service and BLM from the requirement to adjust land management policies as new information about how projects could affect threatened species arises. What is the other side of this tradeoff? How would limiting the consultation requirement advance the goal of reducing wildfires?

The biggest challenge right now is that, because of all of the regulatory hurdles, it can take upwards of a thousand days to get a project off the ground anywhere in the country. One great example of that is in the Angeles National Forest. They announced a fuel break maintenance strategy in 2020, but they were not able to get the requisite approvals until the start of December 2024. It took four years — and then the last of the permits that were most relevant to Altadena didn’t get approved until March, two months after the fire. There are very real consequences to this kind of delay, both for the environment and for human health and safety, that need to be taken into account.

If you take a step back and look at the bill, the main tool that it uses is not broad NEPA exemptions or writ-large changes in the law. It utilizes categorical exclusions, a method that has been used for energy projects in other areas and is increasingly sought after to advance targeted projects with public benefits.

One great example is the Tahoe categorical exclusion, on which a significant portion of this bill is based. It was a 10,000-acre CE created in 2016, which allowed for work that protected communities and ecosystems and got good fire on the ground. It’s work that directly saved South Lake Tahoe from the Caldor Fire. But one of the challenges right now is that the current level for CE is 3,000 acres, and when we’re talking about landscapes in forests that are hundreds of thousands of miles big and a fireshed that nationwide is 50 million acres, then 3,000 acres is not enough for it to be worth it for the Forest Service and Park Service and DOI officials to go through the CE process — which takes six months and is very rigorous.

But we also wanted to show restraint here for environmental purposes. We wanted to make sure that this was as targeted as it needed to be, and not overly expansive.

The decision drew swift blowback from climate groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council, which called the pipeline a “climate and affordability boondoggle.” The utility’s “own demand forecasts confirm there is no imminent reliability need — capacity is more than sufficient to meet peak demand well into the 2040s, even under unusually cold temperatures,” Chris Casey, the New York utility regulatory director at NRDC, said in a statement. “The Commission’s decision to signal its support for this fracked gas pipeline very likely contradicts state law, is not in the public interest, and will be vigorously challenged.”

2. California Democrat says Interior Department halted solar approvals

Representative Scott Peters, the Democrat who represents part of San Diego, accused the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management of halting permitting on solar projects in California. At a press conference Thursday to promote a bipartisan proposal he drafted along with the Colorado Republican Representative Gabe Evans to ease federal energy permitting, Peters said he had just been told that the agency would not approve any more panels. “It’s hard to get a deal unless we resolve that,” Peters said, according to a post on X from Politico reporter Joshua Siegel.

The proposal is a framework for a bill, essentially a blueprint of what members of the House Problem Solvers Caucus feel constitute reasonable compromises. For Republicans, the agreement offers fewer bureaucratic roadblocks to all kinds of new infrastructure, including gas pipelines. For Democrats, it charts a path for building more of the transmission lines that are key to adding more renewables to the grid. “It’s a big step to have our caucus, which is a pretty significant number of Republicans and Democrats, sign on to a pretty detailed set of policy principles,” Peters said. But as Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin wrote last month, “unless Democrats trust the Trump administration to actually allow renewables projects to go forward, his proposal could be dead on arrival.”

3. New climate tech coalition forms

On Thursday, a new coalition that includes Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, consulting giant McKinsey, and Stanford University’s Doerr School of Sustainability launched the Climate Tech Atlas. The proposal maps out ways to decarbonize different sectors of the economy, and lists priorities for innovation. The idea is not to eliminate potential solutions, Heatmap’s Katie Brigham reported in her scoop about the project, but rather “to enable the next generation of innovators, entrepreneurs, researchers, policymakers, and investors to really focus on where we felt there was the largest opportunity for exploration and for innovation to impact our path to net zero through the lens of technology,” according to Cooper Rinzler, a key collaborator on the initiative and a partner at the venture capital firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

4. Microsoft unveils ‘the world’s most powerful AI data center’ in Wisconsin

Microsoft has announced “the world’s most powerful AI data center” in southeastern Wisconsin. The project, called Fairwater, “is a seamless cluster of hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GB200s, connected by enough fiber to circle the Earth 4.5 times,” CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a post on X. “It will deliver 10x the performance of the world’s fastest supercomputer today, enabling AI training and inference workloads at a level never before seen.” He said Microsoft would match “all of the energy that is consumed with renewable sources.”

That power generation could prove more popular than the data center itself. Just 44% of American voters would support or strongly support a data center being built near them, while 42% would oppose or strongly oppose it, according to a Heatmap Pro poll Matthew covered last week. That mere 2% of net support compares to net support of 34% for a gas plant, 19% for a wind farm, 34% for a solar project, and 11% for batteries.

5. Climeworks inks largest-ever carbon removal deal with Schneider Electric

The carbon removal startup Climeworks just signed its largest-ever deal. By 2039, the Switzerland-based company, one of the biggest direct air capture developers in the world, agreed to suck 31,000 tons of CO2 from the atmosphere on behalf of Schneider Electric, the French industrial giant. Schneider said it remains committed to slashing the direct emissions from its operations by 90% in the next 25 years, and that this deal addresses “future neutralization needs while pursuing aggressive emissions reductions, and supporting the scale-up of an industry crucial for achieving net zero.” In a statement, Schneider’s sustainability chief Esther Finidori said that “both carbon removal and carbon reduction are fundamental to achieving our climate goals, as well as those of the planet.” For Climeworks, the deal is a “milestone,” said CEO Christoph Gebald.

THE KICKER

The speed of climate change may be throwing the insect world out of whack. But a new study has put offshore oil rigs in the North Sea to work identifying the vital role a migratory insect plays. University of Exeter researchers studied 121 marmalade hoverflies that landed on an oil rig in the Britannia oil field. The rig off the coast of Scotland was far from any vegetation or land, so the pollen found on 92% of hoverflies “shows they can transport pollen over great distances, potentially linking plant populations that are hundreds of kilometers apart,” according to a press release. “By analysing the pollen samples and wind patterns, we estimate that many of the hoverflies had flown from places including the Netherlands, northern Germany and Denmark — over 500 kilometers away,” Toby Doyle, Exeter’s Centre for Ecology and Conservation in Cornwall, said in a statement.

Speaking at the 6th CII International Energy Conference & Exhibition, Joshi said the milestone was achieved five years ahead of schedule. “We have already achieved over 50 per cent of our installed power capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, and we have done it 5 years ahead of the timeline. We have also crossed 50 per cent of the 500 GW target (252 GW),” he said.

The minister said nearly 20 lakh households had benefitted from solar under the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana and that schemes such as PM-KUSUM and PM-JANMAN had enabled farmers and villages to access solar pumps and off-grid power. “We are not just giving people free electricity, we are empowering them to become energy producers,” he said.

On investments, Joshi said his ministry had secured commitments worth ₹32.45 lakh crore from banks and industry for clean energy initiatives. He added that insurance surety bonds had been permitted as an alternative to earnest money deposits and performance bank guarantees for renewable projects.

He said India had achieved an installed module manufacturing capacity of more than 100 GW. “So far, almost ₹50,000 crore has been invested under the PLI scheme for high-efficiency solar PV modules, creating more than 12,600 direct jobs,” he said.

Joshi said the government had set a target of achieving domestically manufactured solar cells by 2028, along with a plan for wafers and ingots. “I have also given my ministry clear directions to come up with a trajectory for domestic polysilicon production,” he said.

On tariff levels, Joshi said Madhya Pradesh had recently discovered a price of ₹2.70 per unit for solar with battery storage and ₹2.15 per unit without storage in auctions. “Today, solar-plus battery is costing much less than thermal power,” he said.

This edition of Projects Weekly is highlighting several new solar projects in development in the United States and Canada, plus a healthy dose of financing news. We start off with news from Catalyze, which partnered with CS Energy to develop 27 MW of distributed solar projects in New York. Plus, PowerBank is expected to receive interconnection results soon on three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, while the company also has secured all required municipal approvals for two brownfield solar projects in Skaneateles, New York.

On the financing front, Macquarie Asset Management has committed $350 million to support Nexamp’s utility-scale solar and battery storage expansion in the United States; and Soluna has secured $100 million from Generate Capital to expand green data centers.

Finally, air conditioning manufacturer Daikin has tapped ENGIE to advance the company’s unified solar power strategy across Texas.

Catalyze adds 4 new community solar projects to New York

Catalyze has completed four community solar projects in central and western New York. Developed in partnership with CS Energy, the 27 MW of solar energy adds to Catalyze’s robust New York footprint, helping the state reach its goal of installing 6 GW of distributed solar ahead of schedule.

The projects leveraged standardized design, a consistent racking system, and trusted subcontractor relationships, allowing the Catalyze and CS Energy teams to accelerate schedules and bring power online. At the same time, construction access and laydown areas were carefully managed so that farmland could return to its pre-existing condition, allowing landowners to continue farming outside the solar arrays. These four completed sites represent the first half of an eight-project collaboration between Catalyze and CS Energy. The remaining projects, totaling more than 25 MW, are scheduled for completion over the next year.

Cool factor: The four projects — located in Pavilion, Phelps, Fonda, and Fabius, New Yrok — were designed to integrate seamlessly with the local grid and built with prevailing wage labor, supporting both reliability and clean energy workforce development. The installations were supported by New York State programs, including the Inclusive Community Solar Adder and the Community Adder, which help ensure reliable energy access to low-to-moderate income (LMI) subscribers and disadvantaged communities.

“This milestone is about more than megawatts, it’s about taking action,” said Andrew D’Amico, chief operating officer at Catalyze. “We are seeing businesses move fast to lock in the long-term benefits and cost advantages of solar power while federal tax credits are still in place, with states offering incentives designed to expand access.”

The timing of these projects highlights the importance of acting quickly to secure federal tax incentives. Current solar investment tax credits cover 30% of project costs, with potential bonuses of 10% for domestic content and an additional 10% for projects in designated energy communities.

PowerBank makes progress on solar projects in Nova Scotia and New York

PowerBank Corp. expects receive interconnection results within the next 30 days for three community solar projects in Nova Scotia, plus the company has secured all required municipal approvals for two brownfield solar developments in Skaneateles, New York.

The three projects in Nova Scotia, located in Sydney, Brooklyn, and West Petpeswick, are owned by AI Renewable Flow-through Fund and PowerBank is the lead developer and builder. If the interconnection results are positive and the projects are financially feasible, the PowerBank expects to begin construction in the Spring of 2026. PowerBank will partner with local Nova Scotia engineering firm, Trimac Engineering, to deliver the projects. Over the projects’ lifetimes, they will generate up to a combined $6.95 million in electricity savings for the local communities.

The two projects in New York are located on industrial brownfield sites in Skaneateles, which is in the state’s Finger Lakes Region, in Onondaga County. The projects have secured all required municipal approvals, including variances, site plan approval and special use permit. The projects will now pursue NY Department of Environmental Conservation approval to enter construction.

Cool factor: The Canadian Federal government and the Province of Nova Scotia are very supportive of Community Solar, with a number of incentives, including the Smart Renewables and Electrification Pathways Program (SREPs), Indigenous-Led Clean Energy Stream, and the Low Carbon Communities program.

Following receipt of the necessary permits and financing for the two New Projects, PowerBank intends to commence the construction. Once completed, each of the sites will be operated as a community solar project.

Macquarie Asset Management commits $350 million to support Nexamp projects

Macquarie Asset Management has facilitated $350 million of long-term financing to Nexamp Inc. to support the construction of the company’s first utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.

“We believe this relationship will allow the team to realize rapid success in the utility-scale energy transition market,” said Harlan Cherniak, head of Americas infrastructure debt at Macquarie Asset Management. “Through this $350 million facility, we will continue to solidify our credit and insurance division as a global leader in the infrastructure and asset-based credit market.”

In a separate transaction, Nexamp raised additional development capital from Nomura to advance earlier-stage project development and sustain its robust national pipeline of utility-scale opportunities.

Cool factor: Macquarie’s financing will facilitate the construction of more than 1 GWac of solar and storage projects across the high-demand MISO, ERCOT and NYISO markets, while Nomura’s capital will advance development activities in MISO, NYISO and PJM, three of the nation’s fastest-growing regions for utility-scale renewables. Nexamp’s long-term expertise in greenfield development of commercial distributed generation assets will complement its successful development of new utility-scale projects.

“These financings, secured from two world-class partners, ensure that Nexamp can both deliver on the near-term buildout of utility-scale solar and storage and invest in the development pipeline that will power the next phase of growth,” said Zaid Ashai, chairman and CEO of Nexamp. “This is about building a durable platform that meets the country’s rising demand for easy-to-deploy, more affordable energy.”

Soluna secures $100 million to expand green data centers

Soluna Holdings Inc. has closed on a scalable credit facility in an amount of up to $100 million from Generate Capital. The initial $12.6 million draw will fund refinancing and construction of active data center projects, with additional capital support for Soluna’s 1 GW and expanding pipeline.

“We believe this deal with Generate primes Soluna for scale,” said John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna. “We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing. This deal reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution. We’ve known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward.”

Cool factor: This financing follows over $30 million in funding raised earlier in 2025 from Galaxy Digital, Spring Lane Capital, and a recent public offering. The new agreement adds further momentum to Soluna’s execution roadmap, as the recent addition of 150 MW Projects Gladys and 100 MW Fei pushes the company past 1 gigawatt of renewable computing capacity.

This milestone builds on the recent 48 MW expansion underway at Project Dorothy 2 and the start of construction of Project Kati 1. Soluna also intends to expand its computing offerings beyond Bitcoin mining to include AI workloads, reflecting the growing demand for green computing across various industries.

Daikin selects ENGIE to advance unified solar strategy across Texas

Air conditioning manufacturer Daikin has signed a five-year agreement with ENGIE North America to power all of the company’s Texas facilities with 100% renewable electricity, including the Daikin Texas Technology Park (DTTP), home to its largest manufacturing site and North American headquarters.

“This initiative represents a major step forward in aligning our operations with Daikin’s long-term sustainability goals,” said Mike Knights, senior VP of procurement at Daikin. “By working with ENGIE, a global leader in the energy transition, we’re securing clean electricity for our Texas operations while reinforcing our environmental responsibility goals. The initiative facilitates a transparent, traceable connection between operational energy use and a certified renewable energy source.”

Cool factor: Under the agreement, Daikin will source renewable electricity from the Impact Solar project in North Texas, which is owned and operated by a third party and has been in commercial operation since 2021. This relationship brings Daikin closer to its goal of making the DTTP a Net Zero Factory by 2030 and supports the company’s global Environmental Vision 2050.

This milestone builds on Daikin’s recent installation of a solar array at DTTP, which powers the facility’s central chiller plant and supports grid integration. Together, these efforts reflect a broader strategy shaped by a two-year collaboration with ForeFront Power to evaluate energy usage, sustainability goals, and procurement planning. The result is a forward-looking approach that advances Daikin’s environmental goals while reinforcing its leadership in sustainable manufacturing and corporate responsibility within the HVAC industry.

The center-mounted 140-kWh battery pack provides lower center of gravity, improving handling dynamics while the 800-volt electrical architecture enables rapid DC fast charging compatibility. These aren't simply automotive electric technologies grafted onto an RV – they represent purpose-built solutions for the unique demands of motorhomes.

What truly differentiates this product is its holistic approach to electrification. Beyond just propulsion, the Embark addresses the broader energy ecosystem of RV life with bidirectional power capability that allows it to function as a home backup power source – transforming the RV from a recreational asset into a practical emergency resource. The integration of range extender technology solves the critical infrastructure challenge of limited charging networks in remote recreation areas.

The phased commercialization approach is particularly noteworthy. By first introducing the Embark through THL's rental fleet in 2026, THOR creates a controlled feedback loop for product refinement before full-scale production, significantly reducing market risk.

California will not replace the expiring $7,500 federal EV tax credit, with Gov. Gavin Newsom citing budget constraints and prioritizing infrastructure over direct subsidies.

Automakers lose hoped-for state relief, as companies like Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen had urged California to offer a $5,000 incentive to offset the federal rollback.

Newsom escalates tensions with automakers, accusing GM and CEO Mary Barra of leading efforts against California’s 2035 gas car ban, while leaving open the possibility of a future state credit funded through carbon-trading revenue.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday the state will not replace the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit set to expire Sept. 30, reversing an earlier pledge to restart California’s own subsidies. The decision removes what automakers had hoped would be the nation’s largest state-level incentive in the country’s top EV market.

Newsom, speaking in San Francisco, said the state cannot offset the loss of federal support, calling the phaseout “federal vandalism.” Instead, he told California that it will direct resources toward expanding charging infrastructure rather than direct purchase subsidies.

The announcement delivers a blow to EV makers such as Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, which had urged state leaders to create a $5,000 incentive to soften the impact of the federal rollback. California accounted for about 27% of all EV sales in the United States last year, positioning it as the most critical market for continued consumer adoption.

Newsom’s reversal follows a pledge made in 2024 to backfill the federal program if it were eliminated. However, California’s growing budget deficit derailed those plans. The state ended its previous EV tax credit program in 2023 and now falls outside the group of 17 states still offering some form of incentive, according to the Tax Foundation.

The governor also aimed at Detroit automakers, singling out General Motors and CEO Mary Barra. Newsom accused GM of “selling out” California by leading efforts in Congress to block the state’s 2035 ban on new gasoline-powered vehicle sales. California regulators had estimated the ban would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 35%.

Despite the setback, the governor’s office said California could revive its EV subsidy program next year.

And New York assemblymember Emily Gallagher previewed a state bill she will introduce next week aimed at helping renters access solar panels.","Hundreds of environmentalists gathered in New York City’s Stuyvesant Square Park and a nearby Quaker meeting house on Sunday to rally in support of solar power and other forms of renewable energy. The event was part of a national “day of action” billed Sun Day, founded by veteran environmental activist Bill McKibben and first Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes.

“It’s so sad to watch the sun going to waste,” McKibben said at a press conference, standing beside environmentalists and their children. “Every single day, energy from heaven going to waste while we drill down to hell for another dose of the stuff that is wrecking this planet.”

McKibben was joined at the press conference by other activists, as well as officials from New York and his home state of Vermont.

“We have the ability here to protect our children, to protect our future,” said New York’s lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado.

The event in the park followed an all-afternoon celebration of clean power, with displays of solar panels, child-friendly lessons on renewable technology, and panel discussions. One popular panel featured McKibben and New York City’s comptroller, Brad Lander.

In other parts of the country, activists held more than 500 other actions meant to highlight the creative ways Americans are ditching fossil-based energy. In Virginia, volunteers climbed rooftops to install solar panels on affordable homes built by Habitat for Humanity. In North Carolina, families gathered at a farm powered by solar panels. And in Michigan, organizers held a car show to show off electric vehicles; families also held a beach clean up nearby.

Renewable energy sources have seen unprecedented growth in recent years. Last year, they accounted for over 90% of total energy expansion globally, one analysis found. And the US generated less than half of its energy from fossil fuels for the first time this past March.

Yet the day of action came amid unprecedented attacks on climate protections and the renewable energy transition by the Trump administration. Since January, his administration has rolled back grants for solar, kicked off an all-of-government approach to shut down wind, halted and delayed wind projects, and launched more than 150 other anti-environmental and anti-renewable energy actions. The plans are threatening not only the climate but also Americans’ pocketbooks, said Vermont senator Peter Welch.

“Clean energy is really good for affordability. It lowers the utility bills people are struggling to pay and creates really good jobs,” Welch said in an interview. “What Trump is doing is wrecking that economic potential. Customers are going to get hammered.”

Despite these attacks, the event had an overall air of optimism. McKibben said though the US is backsliding on climate progress, much of the rest of the world is continuing to build out renewable power.

“The pattern around the world is unmistakable,” he said in an interview. “The reason that it’s happening is partly because of the climate crisis but also largely because this is the cheapest form of energy, and it’s getting cheaper every year.”

The Sun Day action came ahead of Climate Week in New York City, an annual event that convenes government officials, corporate actors and activists for a vast array of climate-focused events. It also came one day after the “Make Billionaires Pay” march, for which 25,000 people took to the streets in New York City.

“Billionaires caused the climate chaos, spearheaded the rise of authoritarianism and they continue to profit from our suffering. But they forgot one thing: there are more of us than there are of them,” said Renata Pumarol, an organizer with the environmental justice non-profit Climate Defenders, in a statement about the Saturday protest.

Sun Day participants did not shy away from naming the fossil fuel companies who have been the primary cause of global warming. But it focused largely on solutions aimed at taking on the climate crisis instead of the actors behind it.

McKibben, for instance, praised Utah’s move three months ago to legalize the installation of solar panels on balconies – something that is illegal in all other US states. And New York assemblymember Emily Gallagher previewed a state bill she will introduce next week aimed at helping renters access solar panels.

At the press conference, McKibben noted that though the forecast for Sunday showed cloudy skies, the day was bright and warm.

“The collective power of all of us is enough to bring out the sun,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d71054d057f5e482367ccf359dae619d853207/604_2_4225_3380/master/4225.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0dc6f8d6e142adbaf64c470df97db4a1",N,,2025-09-22 08:59:45.433155

By Marcel Suri, CEO and Co-founder of Solargis

Extreme weather poses a serious threat to the solar energy industry. Higher occurrence of events such as heavy rainfall, fast changing sunny and cloudy weather, snow storms, hurricanes, high atmospheric pollution and hailstorms can significantly disrupt energy generation and cause material damage to PV systems.

In all cases, there are serious financial consequences for PV power plant operators and investors.

The growing pressure is on the US solar industry, too. Throughout the United States, more frequently climate patterns take the form of unusually warm weather, flash floods, wildfires, strong winds, and severe thunderstorms.

To ensure systems are designed and prepared to withstand harsher, less predictable conditions, PV developers must gain a deeper understanding of power supply fluctuations and model them accurately in real time to minimize potential losses.

What the numbers show

At Solargis, we conduct an annual analysis of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) difference, comparing each year’s data against the long-term averages (LTA) – data that directly impacts the performance of solar power plants.

Our 2024 findings reveal significant increases and decreases in solar irradiation across various US regions. For example, an extreme heatwave affected states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. We also observed unusually intense solar irradiation in moderate regions like the Midwest and Northeast, including the Great Lakes area.

These were not isolated events.

Other regions experienced climate-related disruptions too, including wildfires, which burned over one million acres of land in California alone, and late-season snowstorms in the northern Rocky Mountains. In October last year, a tornado significantly damaged a 45MW Lake Placid Solar Power Plant in Florida, shortly before Hurricane Milton hit the area.

Harnessing the power of data

The key to understanding how climate-related events affect PV system performance lies in the granularity and accuracy of the data used to model and simulate solar conditions.

Most solar simulation software today still relies on hourly Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data. These datasets consolidate weather conditions from multiple past years into a single ‘typical’ year, capturing average solar and temperature patterns.

However, TMY fails to reflect real-world variability – whether short-term (intra-hourly) or interannual (year-to-year natural variability cycles). The limited temporal resolution and historical depth of TMY data mean that simulations based on it often overlook these ‘non-typical’ events and fail to account for critical operational risks.

This disconnect between simulation and reality can only be addressed through PV modeling based on higher-resolution datasets. Time Series data, which offers 15-minute granularity over multiple decades, enables significantly more accurate assessments of PV system behavior. But improved datasets alone are not enough – solar developers also need sophisticated software solutions capable of processing and interpreting this data effectively.

Protecting and empowering solar developers and investors

In a future shaped by more challenging weather events, the solar industry cannot afford to rely on legacy approaches. Forward-looking companies must embrace a new standard of modeling – one grounded in real-world physics and supported by data that reflects the full range of environmental conditions a PV power plant encounters.

High-resolution datasets, when paired with advanced simulation software, equip developers and investors with the insights needed to:

Predict weather-related impacts more accurately,

Create more robust designs, plan preventive operation and mitigate downtime,

Improve system resilience and operational efficiency, and

Strengthen confidence among insurers and financial stakeholders.

As the US solar sector faces the mounting challenges of climate volatility, access to granular, long-term data will become indispensable.

Understanding irradiance variability – and being able to model it accurately – is essential for protecting assets, securing investment, and maintaining consistent energy production.

Bob Mumgaard, Co-founder and CEO of CFS, said: “The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid.
As energy demand grows, Eni supports the development of fusion power as a new energy paradigm capable of producing clean, safe, and virtually inexhaustible energy.
This international partnership confirms our commitment to making fusion energy a reality, promoting its industrialization for a more sustainable energy future.”","Italian energy company Eni announced today that it has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) worth more than $1 billion with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), to offtake energy from CFS’ first commercial fusion plant, which is anticipated to come online in Chesterfield County, Virginia in the early 2030s.

Fusion, the process of combining two atoms to form a single atom to release energy, has been long referred to as the “Holy Grail” of clean and abundant energy production, given its potential to produce power from hydrogen – the most common element in the universe – without producing carbon emissions associated with fossil-fuel based power, and without the highly radioactive output of nuclear fission processes. Large scale fusion energy generation has been elusive, however, given the need to create extremely high temperatures and pressure.

Spun out of MIT in 2018, Massachusetts-based CFS is working to develop the world’s first net-energy positive – i.e., producing more energy than it consumes – fusion device, to prove and scale the production of fusion energy. The company is currently collaborating with MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center to build SPARC, the precursor to CFS’s first commercial plant, ARC, which the company expects to be the first grid-scale fusion power plant in the world.

CFS recently raised more than $860 million in a Series B2 fundraising round to advance the commercialization of its fusion technology. The new PPA with Eni follows an offtake agreement recently signed with Google.

Bob Mumgaard, Co-founder and CEO of CFS, said:

“The agreement with Eni demonstrates the value of fusion energy on the grid. It is a big vote of confidence to have Eni, who has contributed to our execution since the beginning, buy the power we intend to make in Virginia. Our fusion power attracts diverse customers across the world — from hyperscalers to traditional energy leaders — because of the promise of clean, almost limitless energy.”

Eni was an early investor in CFS in 2018, and the company increased its investment in CFS’ recent financing round. In 2023 Eni and CFS signed a Collaboration Framework Agreement to accelerate fusion energy development, with the collaboration spanning areas including operational and technological support project execution through the sharing of methodologies learned from the energy industry, and relationships with stakeholders.

Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi said:

“Eni has been strengthening its collaboration with CFS through its technological know-how since it first invested in the company in 2018.

California Stands to Lose the Most Among all U.S. states, California faces the steepest drop if the federal EV tax credit ends.
The scale of California’s reliance on the tax credit is a direct reflection of its aggressive push toward clean energy and transportation alternatives.
Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana are cited as regions where the EV credit had minimal impact in the first place.
The disappearance of the federal tax credit could force these companies to rethink pricing strategies or cut back production plans to match reduced demand.","Over the past few years, the federal EV tax credit has played a crucial role in boosting electric vehicle ownership. Buyers of new electric cars have received an average benefit of $6,700, while those opting for used models claimed around $3,400. In total, Americans claimed $3.3 billion in new EV credits and $95.6 million for used EVs in 2023 alone. This direct financial relief helped make EVs more appealing in a country where gasoline-powered vehicles still dominate.

At the same time, the national market for electric vehicles remains relatively modest. According to Supercar Blondie, EVs accounted for just 1.7 percent of all light-duty vehicles on U.S. roads in 2023, even with the tax credit in place. While that figure marked a slight increase from the previous year’s 1.2 percent, the overall momentum remains fragile, with new EV sales actually falling by 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

California Stands to Lose the Most

Among all U.S. states, California faces the steepest drop if the federal EV tax credit ends. The state, which has long led the country in EV adoption, could miss out on approximately $1.1 billion in incentives. Texas follows with nearly $273 million at stake, and Florida comes next, potentially losing around $201 million in benefits.

The scale of California’s reliance on the tax credit is a direct reflection of its aggressive push toward clean energy and transportation alternatives. But as reported by Supercar Blondie, without this financial support, the affordability of EVs could plummet for thousands of consumers, forcing many to delay or abandon electric vehicle purchases altogether.

In contrast, some states may barely register the change. Mississippi, North Dakota, and Louisiana are cited as regions where the EV credit had minimal impact in the first place. With fewer residents investing in electric vehicles, the loss of the credit in these areas is unlikely to disrupt local markets in any significant way.

Drop in Sales Hints at Waning Momentum

Even before the scheduled end of the credit, EV sales have started to show signs of strain. Nationwide sales of new electric vehicles fell by 6.3 percent in the second quarter of 2025 compared to the same timeframe in the previous year. This downturn suggests a growing hesitation among buyers, potentially tied to the looming expiration of financial incentives.

The trend is especially concerning considering the relatively low base from which EV adoption is growing. At just 1.7 percent of light-duty vehicles, EVs still occupy a small slice of the U.S. automotive market. Without the continued nudge from federal credits, that slice may shrink even further—particularly in areas with limited infrastructure or weak local incentives.

This softening in consumer demand also places pressure on automakers, many of which have expanded their EV lineups in response to environmental goals and evolving regulations. The disappearance of the federal tax credit could force these companies to rethink pricing strategies or cut back production plans to match reduced demand.

Uneven State Infrastructure Could Widen the Gap

The disparity in how different states will be affected by the credit’s end points to deeper structural differences across the country. States like California, Texas, and Florida have made significant investments not only in EV adoption but also in charging infrastructure, public awareness, and state-level incentives. These efforts have created more favorable environments for electric vehicles.

On the other hand, states with limited charging networks or weak policy support may struggle even more to attract EV buyers once the federal incentive is gone. As noted in the same source, this could leave automakers with a “patchwork market,” where progress is clustered in specific regions while others remain stagnant.

The lack of a consistent national strategy means the EV market could fracture along state lines. LendingTree’s analysis, as cited in the article, warns that in the absence of federal support, areas without strong local programs will see demand slow even further, exacerbating the already uneven rollout of electric transportation.",https://thenewswheel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EV-charging-.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:48.262034

With about a week and a half left before the next fiscal year begins, don’t hold your breath on anything happening soon to avoid a government shutdown.

President Donald Trump’s latest comments about negotiating with Democrats are a reminder of the difference between a get-together and getting together. “I’d love to meet with them, but I don’t think it’s going to have any impact,” Trump told reporters over the weekend. “They want all this stuff, they haven’t changed, they haven’t learned from the biggest beating they’ve ever taken, just about.”

Visa Fee Faces Likely Challenges

Trump signed a proclamation Friday that would move to extensively overhaul the H-1B visa program, requiring a $100,000 fee for applications in a bid to curb overuse. The fee, however, flouts clear requirements of federal immigration law and will invite immediate lawsuits, attorneys say.

The fee, which took effect Sunday, could also have devastating effects on businesses that expected to add workers through the specialty occupation visa program this fall. It would be imposed as a condition of US entry for foreign workers hired through the H-1B program popular with the tech sector, although it’s unclear what it would mean for visa holders already in the country.

Redistricting Begins Today in Two States

Two more states are starting the process of revising congressional district lines, Greg Giroux reports.

Ohio’s constitution requires a new map because the one put in place after the 2020 Census wasn’t bipartisan and therefore had to be temporary. A likely scenario there is for the Republican-dominated legislature to miss a Sept. 30 deadline to pass a map supported by a majority of both parties. That would trigger action by the GOP-dominated Ohio Redistricting Commission, with an Oct. 31 deadline to approve new lines in a bipartisan vote. If it doesn’t, the legislature could do its own, at the risk of lawsuits under anti-gerrymandering constitutional provisions. Don’t expect anything to get settled quickly there.

Utah is going to move faster. The state’s Legislative Redistricting Committee will hold two public meetings this week and publish a proposed map on Thursday. It’s revising the state’s four-district map after a judge ruled that the legislature unconstitutionally repealed and replaced a voter-approved anti-gerrymandering initiative. Read More

Kirk Aftermath

In the days before yesterday’s memorial service for slain activist Charlie Kirk, the head of the FCC changed the national conversation around that killing by saying there could be repercussions against ABC for comments made about Kirk’s supporters by late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called that “mafioso” behavior, and another GOP senator now has added to the criticism. Kentucky’s Rand Paul (R) said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the media regulator “has got no business weighing in on this.”

“Any attempt by the government to get involved with speech, I will fight,” Paul said.

Trump and other Republicans have supported the push on broadcasters. “The FCC has a responsibility to call balls and strikes,” Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) said on Fox News Sunday. Read More

Eye on Tariffs

US companies are being pitted against each other over how tariffs should apply to their products. Businesses are able to suggest that their competitors’ products be subject to tariffs through a process that so far has produced lopsided results, Isabel Gottlieb reports.

Earlier this year, the Commerce Department granted virtually all requests to tariff certain products not already falling under another tariff measure or investigation. No rebuttals arguing against them were granted.

The filings in the tariff cases show the complexity of the arguments for protecting US factory production this way. LG Electronics wrote that raising the price of imported household appliances would lead to lower demand, “directly undermining the very type of domestic manufacturing capacity these tariffs are meant to protect.” Read More

Did You Ace the Quiz?

Give yourself a star if you selected Option B — No pricing data required. Though typically required on proposals worth $2 million or more, for Golden Dome the contracting officer is tasked with determining if a vendor “is not likely to offer other than fair and reasonable pricing.”

The other quiz choices are there to entertain procurement professionals. It’s common for companies that lose out on a contract to have future opportunities (Option A) and for proposals to include subcontracting plans (Option C).

As for cybersecurity standards (Option D), BGOV analysts Maika Ito and Paul Murphy flag that that even though the Pentagon’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification doesn’t take effect department-wide until Nov. 10, those meeting Golden Dome’s Oct. 10 bidding deadline also will have to comply.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Governors of more than a quarter of U.S. states are pushing for greater influence over the country's biggest power grid -- PJM Interconnection -- where electricity prices are surging as demand driven by AI data centers outpaces the connection of new supplies.

Rising power bills in PJM, which operates the grid covering 13 states and the District of Columbia, or one in five Americans, have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid.

The group of state leaders plans to announce the ""PJM Governors' Collaborative"" on Monday during a summit in Philadelphia to advocate for their interests in PJM, a member-run organization in which states do not have a vote, according to a person familiar with the plans.

""Among the first ideas the PJM Governors’ Collaborative will discuss at the summit will be historic reforms to PJM governance to give the states a larger role in decision-making moving forward,"" the source said.

Ballooning prices in PJM have been caused by a confluence of factors, including the cost to produce and transport electricity and a surge in demand brought by Big Tech data centers. PJM's territory holds the largest concentration of energy-intensive data centers in the world.

Capacity payments, which are made to power plant operators to guarantee they run during periods of spiking demand to avoid blackouts, are a piece of power bills in the region.

Those payments, determined by annual energy auctions, have risen by about 1,000% over the last two auctions on the projected rise of data center demand coupled with largely stagnating power supply.

PJM is governed by a board of managers, and its voting members include transmission line owners and independent power plant operators.

While states are not given a vote, they have wielded their power over PJM in other ways. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro led a successful push to put a price ceiling and floor on PJM's most recent capacity auction.

Governors are seeking a more formal role in shaping PJM that might be modeled after similar groups in Midwest and New England grids, a source familiar said.

Shapiro, who runs the biggest electricity-producing state in the PJM region, plans to discuss issues including the PJM stakeholder process, market reforms, connecting new power supplies faster and increasing transparency in PJM, according to a release by the governor's office.

The deployments come as renewables, which are tied to many battery projects, are under pressure in the U.S.
Made-in-America challenges While grid batteries emerged from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act with a preserved tax credit, the law is still creating headwinds for the industry.
A wild card for grid batteries is how much domestic manufacturing may step up to get around the FEOC restrictions.
“You don’t need that big of a change in EV demand to really create plenty of opportunities” for grid battery production, she said.","A clean energy technology often linked with renewables is notching record growth in President Donald Trump’s America, encroaching on fossil fuels even in the Texas oil patch.

Batteries that can store and release big amounts of electricity are increasingly connecting to the electricity grid and major industrial projects like data centers, even without the federal grants and loans offered in the Biden administration.

Those batteries are providing critical backup to the wind and solar industries that Republicans routinely chastise as unreliable — and this year stripped of grants and long-term tax cuts.

“This year is looking extremely strong now with some projects moving ahead quicker than anticipated,” said Allison Weis, global head of storage at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

Batteries are expected to account for roughly a quarter of all installations to the grid this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, with storage costs projected to decline substantially in the coming years. In the second quarter of this year, battery installations were 63 percent higher than the same period last year, according to the American Clean Power Association.

All together, the battery market is threatening plans for new natural gas, diesel and coal plants. The reason is simple: Batteries allow companies to store and use power when they need it. That means a data center developer can store solar-generator electricity and use it at night, instead of relying on a fossil fuel plant, like a gas peaker, to step up.

“Batteries and solar are like peanut butter and jelly,” said Mark Dyson, managing director for carbon-free electricity with the environmental group RMI. “There’s a natural diurnal cycle to the sun, obviously, and also therefore to how batteries are going to be operating most economically.”

In deep-red Texas, the battery buzz is growing louder.

“We’re really trying to change the game,” Jon Parrella, the Houston area-based chief executive officer for battery firm Terraflow Energy, said in an interview. “We can get data centers online faster without having to have the grid infrastructure change as massively as everybody thinks [it needs].”

Several factors are driving private investment. Many companies are looking to batteries to meet clean energy pledges — and power demand growth forecasts not witnessed in the U.S. for decades, driven in large part by a scramble to stand up artificial intelligence data centers. Developers are also seizing on batteries to bypass sluggish permitting for new large projects like power plants.

Meanwhile, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the marquee Republican legislation this year that cut wind and solar subsidies, delivered a win for batteries, preserving a key tax credit through 2033.

And signs of trouble in fossil fuel markets are also spurring battery growth. Natural gas prices are projected to rise in the coming years, while low crude oil prices are forecast to stymie U.S. production.

Cutting carbon emissions

Parella’s company is developing a project in Bellville, west of Houston, using vanadium flow batteries. That’s a type of battery technology often considered long-duration energy storage (LDES) because they can discharge electricity for up to 10 hours or more. Other long-duration technologies include iron-air batteries and even pumped hydropower storage.

A separate Terraflow project on the Gulf Coast in the Port of Victoria is also advancing. Project partner Optimus Technology Group is planning to use Terraflow batteries at data center projects in Texas, Arizona, Ohio and other states, according to Keith Borie, vice president at Optimus.

The long-duration systems differ from lithium-ion batteries, which are more prevalent today but discharge for shorter periods of time and pose some risks for leakage and fires.

Parella says batteries are competing with “thermal” power generation, a reference to fossil fuels.

“From a carbon footprint, the biggest thing and impact we have is we significantly reduce the need for thermal generation of data centers,” he said. “They do not have to fire up anywhere near as much, and it gives us the ability to significantly reduce that footprint.”

Terraflow is just one company in a broad battery market in the U.S. that’s racing to catch up with global competitors.

“We are way behind other countries in terms of electrification and moving away from fossil-based economies,” said Anna Siefken, a former DOE official under Biden who now is North America policy and markets lead at the industry association LDES Council. “We have to make the market.”

Lithium-ion batteries, similar to technology in smartphones and electric vehicles, currently dominate the market.

They have changed how the grid operates over the past several years, increasingly providing power when demand surges, such as during evening hours in California when the sun is no longer shining. That differs from initial uses of batteries a decade ago to provide power mainly during small disruptions.

Among the biggest players are Tesla, whichunveiled a new grid battery product last week called Megablock, which combines four existing batteries around a transformer. The company is promising deliveries next year and claims it can reduce construction costs by preengineering the system in the factory, so it can plug easily into the grid.

“Lithium ion has gotten so cheap … it’s almost easier to just add more lithium batteries than to try and switch to a different technology,” said Weis.

As one example, a new battery complex on Oahu, Hawaii, began operating last year with Tesla Megapacks to replace power lost from the state’s last retired coal plant.

Skepticism at DOE

While Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said he supports long-duration storage, he also is critical of renewables.

“We need more affordable energy storage,” Wright said recently at the Council on Foreign Relations, arguing that batteries increase the costs of renewables “five- to fifteen-fold.”

“We don’t have a practical way to firm wind and solar today,” he said, referring to power that can be supplied 24 hours a day.

Battery proponents point to skyrocketing power costs from gas and coal plants during periods of highest demand. Meanwhile, they say batteries and renewables alone are not likely to fully power grids anytime soon, arguing that some gas peaker plants will continue to be important contributions to the grid.

Dyson said it would be “ridiculously expensive” to power grids with only renewables and batteries “because you’d need to oversize all three of those resources to a level that is untenable.”

“Nobody is asking for or suggesting that wind or solar should be 24-7 resources,” he said. “No resource is 24-7 — even so-called baseload power plants have frequent outages that are incredibly disruptive when they occur.”

But experts say Wright’s downbeat comments on batteries don’t match their increasing market penetration.

“Almost all of the planned capacity in Texas is solar and storage, so it must be penciling out for those developers,” said Seth Feaster, an energy data analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Otherwise, you’d be building gas plants.”

“You could have a stampede that’s going over a cliff. I don’t think that’s true in the electricity markets,” he said.

DOE’s loan office is continuing to finance an Eos Energy Enterprises battery project in Pennsylvania, after the Biden administration closed a loan guarantee for the company in December. Other battery producers have applied to the loan office, according to a DOE spokesperson, who did not provide details on the applications.

The deployments come as renewables, which are tied to many battery projects, are under pressure in the U.S.

The Trump administration is frustrating permitting for wind and solar on public lands. In the first half of this year, solar energy provided more than half of new generation to the U.S. electricity grid, according to analysis earlier this month from the Solar Energy Industries Association and Wood Mackenzie. While that data demonstrates strength in the sector, new solar installations dropped in comparison to 2024. The analysis suggests a fifth less solar will be deployed in the U.S. in 2030, compared with previous forecasts.

Made-in-America challenges

While grid batteries emerged from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act with a preserved tax credit, the law is still creating headwinds for the industry.

The megalaw included “foreign entities of concern” provisions set to kick in in January aiming to prohibit imports of components from China, North Korea and other foreign adversaries.

While the measure allowed companies to obtain tax credits if they break ground through 2033, it included tighter timelines for the industry to comply with FEOC restrictions than many other industries. In 2026, storage projects will need to spend 55 percent of costs on non-FEOC components, a percentage that increases to 75 percent by decade’s end.

Considering that most battery components come from China, the restrictions add additional barriers for developers.

“There’s definitely a risk,” said Weis, noting that coming Treasury guidance will clarify how much the rules could exacerbate challenges for the sector. The guidance is required by the end of next year, but could be released earlier.

After the law’s passage in July, analysis firm BloombergNEF estimated grid battery installations could drop 15 percent over the next decade from where they would be otherwise, largely because of the FEOC restrictions.

Treasury’s guidance could be particularly important for battery cells, as the rest of a typical storage system is “relatively easy to source outside of China,” Weis said.

The growth this year is being driven partly by developers aiming to start projects before the restrictions hit in January, analysts say.

There’s a push to “really get things in the ground as fast as possible,” said Weis. The effects of FEOC may not be seen significantly in the industry until 2027, she said.

Tariffs and immigration raids

There also could be a contraction in growth next year because of the uncertainty from tariffs and policy shifts that occurred in the early months of Trump’s presidency — a period that takes time to show up in deployments.

“There was a pause in getting contracts signed,” she said.

After an expected drop in installations in 2026 and 2027, the industry should recover to 2025 levels within five years, but factors such as how much the Trump administration cracks down on permitting for solar projects tied to batteries could change things, according to Weis.

And despite the push for long-duration storage by Wright, that segment of the market may not be competitive until after 2030, said Isshu Kikuma, an analyst at BloombergNEF.

“It will be very difficult” to compete with the low costs of lithium-ion technology, although DOE could play a role in supporting startups, he said.

Among the startups that have pulled back on sodium-ion technology, a potential alternative to lithium-ion, is Bedrock Materials. The company halted operations earlier this year after facing cost challenges.

A wild card for grid batteries is how much domestic manufacturing may step up to get around the FEOC restrictions. Wood Mackenzie’s projections, for example, assume that growth in domestic supplies by the end of the decade will help counter any downturn.

LG Energy Solution, a Korean battery-maker, is among the companies well positioned to help drive domestic manufacturing because it has EV plants that are not being utilized and can be switched to produce grid batteries, Weis said.

“You don’t need that big of a change in EV demand to really create plenty of opportunities” for grid battery production, she said.

The company’s battery plant with Hyundai in Georgia wasrecently delayed after a raid by U.S. immigration authorities. White House immigration policies are threatening a brain drain at EV and battery plants.

Still, Parella said storage demand is likely to outstrip supply over the foreseeable future.

“The manufacturing capacity for long-duration storage is way short of where it needs to be,” he said. “The market’s so massive that there could be 20 more companies like us, and there’s still room for everybody to play.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/e6/15/e41ef7954f28a75308d865ffb12e/ew-0919-dabbs-marshall-batteries-2000-01.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:09.028658

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average score across the country was 15 out of 100.

The updated report comes out after a year of massive giveaways to the coal industry by Governor Braun and President Trump, while the federal government has ramped up attacks on affordable and easily deployable renewable energy resources, like wind and solar, which Indiana severely lacks.

Utility scores below

Duke Indiana earned a 0% (F) for the second year in a row. Since the previous report, Duke had its latest rate case approved by state regulators, locking in customers to higher monthly utility bills than if it were to stop burning coal at Edwardsport, based on the utility’s own financial data. Comparing Duke’s 2021 energy plan to its 2024 energy plan, the utility slashed 3,798 megawatts of clean energy investments and delayed a company-wide exit from coal from 2035 to 2038 by extending the life of its Gibson coal plant in southwest Indiana.

Duke's 2021 energy plan proposed shutting down unit 5 at the Gibson coal plant by 2025 and units 3 and 4 by 2029. Additionally, Duke’s 2021 energy plan proposed 4,697 megawatts of wind, solar, and storage by 2035. In Duke’s new plan, between now and 2035, the utility will only install 499 megawatts of solar and 400 megawatts of battery storage, for a combined total of 899 megawatts of new clean energy. Duke will go from a meager 100 megawatts of wind energy to none by the end of the decade when it lets a power purchase agreement expire, and the utility has no plan to bring new wind energy online between now and 2035.

CenterPoint Energy earned a 33% (D), 25% lower than its score last year. The utility is in the midst of writing its next long-term energy plan, which has a large impact on the evaluation of scores in the Dirty Truth report. CenterPoint was going to retire all coal by 2023 with a resource mix of primarily solar (54%) and wind (27%) according to its previous energy plan. In its current plan, CenterPoint cancelled 285 megawatts of clean energy contracts and is modeling keeping coal online past 2030. While CenterPoint is much smaller than Duke, it has still invested more in renewable energy and is closing coal plants.

The Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) saw its score decrease the most, earning a 57% (B), after earning an 80% (A) last year, its previous lowest score. The score lowered because of planned new gas plants due to growing demand driven by data centers, but the score remains higher than most utilities because it is closing coal plants.

Indiana Michigan Power saw the second largest dip in scores, earning 48% (C) this year after earning 66% (B) last year. I&M’s lower score comes on the heels of parent company AEP’s request to Indiana regulators to shift all costs for the uneconomic OVEC coal plants from being shared between its Michigan and Indiana customers to only Indiana customers. In 2025 alone, Ohio ended all subsidies to the OVEC coal plants and Michigan limited cost recovery, making the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s actions stand out.

AES Indiana saw its score remain unchanged from last year, earning it another 57% (B) in this year’s report. However, in May 2025, AES issued a request for proposal to build two new gas-burning power plants, up to 1,600 megawatts total, to power large load users like data centers, a move that would cause greenhouse gas emissions to skyrocket.

Statement from Megan Anderson, Senior Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Indiana:

“Governor Braun, monopoly utilities, and tech companies are driving up monthly utility bills for Hoosier families by straddling us with expensive coal and gas costs to feed power-hungry data centers. Braun’s executive orders and new laws aimed at bailing out uneconomic coal plants are forcing Hoosiers to subsidize electric infrastructure for data centers, hurting our economy and our health. I hope Gov. Braun is serious about decreasing rates, but it feels disingenuous based on his actions.

“Duke Indiana is not only failing compared to its monopoly utility peers in Indiana, it is also among the worst when compared to utilities across the nation. Duke’s failing strategy was approved by state regulators under Gov. Braun’s watch earlier this year, who granted the monopoly utility a massive rate hike that pumps hundreds of millions into its coal plants, including the economic clunker Edwardsport plant. There’s no better example of Duke’s renewable energy failure than the fact it will not have any wind energy resources after a power purchase agreement expires in a few years.”

Statement from Nicole Chandler, Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in southwest Indiana:

“CenterPoint’s backsliding on renewable energy commitments is a step in the wrong direction for southwest Indiana and Hoosiers. CenterPoint is drafting its next long range energy plan right now, giving its VP Shane Bradford the opportunity to do what is right by Hoosiers and retire its costly and polluting FB Culley coal-burning power plant and commit to investing in more affordable, renewable energy.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 10:01:05.645033

Duke Energy Florida’s inaugural score was 1% (F) in 2021 and peaked at 10% (F) in 2023. Duke’s score remains low because it currently has no plan to stop burning coal at its Crystal River power plant.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country – in an apples-to-apples comparison – of their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. The average utility score was 15% (F), the lowest average score since the report launched in 2021.

Dragging Duke Energy Florida’s score down is the uncertain future of its Crystal River coal-burning power plant. Duke is studying a closure plan for the power plant that will come out later this year. Sierra Club analysis of public data finds the coal plant was only needed 11% of the time during peak summer demand, and proposes that costly polluting power could be replaced by accelerating the utility’s investments in solar and battery storage, providing a hedge against volatile gas costs for customers. Duke can still act now to take advantage of sunsetting renewable energy incentives. Renewable energy is important to the largest tech companies to power their data centers, which Duke wants to attract to its service territory with a new rate structure it seeks approval of from state regulators.

Duke is a monopoly utility, meaning customers do not have a choice in where to buy electricity. High utility bills is one reason that St. Petersburg is evaluating whether it can establish a municipal utility to replace Duke as its electricity provider.

Statement from Walter Smith, Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in Tampa Bay:

“The best thing Duke’s state director Melissa Seixas can do to ease utility bill impacts for customers is to retire the Crystal River coal-burning power plant and replace it with solar and storage. Duke’s peer utilities in Florida have demonstrated it’s possible and practical, and it’s not too late for Melissa Seixas to realize these benefits for customers.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 07:03:17.014626

Oklo Aurora powerhouse (Image: Oklo)

Oklo is participating in the DOE’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program, a pathway created in response to executive orders signed in May 2025 to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment and to modernize nuclear licensing. Aurora-INL is one of three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race. I am honored to be attending today's groundbreaking in order to witness firsthand the innovation and increased energy production we’re seeing under President Donald J. Trump’s American Energy Dominance Agenda.”

The Aurora-INL is a sodium-cooled fast reactor that uses metal fuel and builds on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which ran in Idaho from 1964 to 1994. Oklo was awarded fuel recovered from EBR-II by the DOE in 2019 and has completed two of four steps for DOE authorization to fabricate its initial core at the Aurora Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F) at INL.

“This opportunity positions us to build our first plant more quickly,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come.”

“DOE is excited by the opportunity to work with reactor developers, such as Oklo, to capitalize on this moment of broad support for new nuclear generation and bring the Reactor Pilot Program into reality,” said Robert Boston, manager of the DOE Idaho Operations Office.

Kiewit Nuclear Solutions Co., a subsidiary of Kiewit Corporation, one of North America’s largest construction and engineering organizations, will serve as lead constructor supporting the design, procurement, and construction of the powerhouse under a Master Services Agreement announced in July 2025. Oklo expects to leverage Kiewit’s extensive expertise in delivering large-scale industrial projects on accelerated schedules with reduced costs, while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.

The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F.

“INL has always been where nuclear innovation becomes reality,” said INL Director John Wagner. “Today’s groundbreaking with Oklo continues that legacy, bringing advanced reactor technology from the laboratory to commercial deployment right here in Idaho.”

About Oklo Inc.: Oklo Inc. is developing fast fission power plants to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at scale, establishing a domestic supply chain for critical radioisotopes, and advancing nuclear fuel recycling to convert nuclear waste into clean energy. Oklo was the first to receive a site use permit from the U.S. Department of Energy for a commercial advanced fission plant, was awarded fuel from Idaho National Laboratory, and submitted the first custom combined license application for an advanced reactor to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Oklo is also developing advanced fuel recycling technologies in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. National Laboratories.

PCACS Executive Director Bruce Lindner said the allocated money will allow the agency to assist 2,452 clients or families, which is up from the 2,066 assisted last year. The program will now run until that number has been reached.

Energy Assistance is an income-eligible program designed to help families pay their energy bills. When participants qualify for a determined amount, the payment is electronically paid to the appropriate energy company.

In order to apply for assistance, individuals will need a recent energy bill that is in the applicants’ name, but it does not have to be a disconnect notice. They will also need social security cards for everyone in the household and proof of income from all sources for household members over 18. If applicants are renting, they need to have a Landlord Affidavit completed. This form is available at the trustee offices in Portage, Chesterton and Hebron and at PCACS on its Web page, www.portercountyacs.org. Additional documents may be needed for some circumstances and the staff can identify these before the appointment.

“We are still requesting that those needing assistance call to clarify which documents they will need before attending their appointments,” Lindner said.

Families or individuals can only receive assistance once during the 2011-12 winter season.

For more information or to schedule an appointment, call PCACS at 464-9736.

The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges is an annual report that grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035.

Duke Energy Carolinas & Duke Energy Progress earned 12% (F), while Duke Energy earned 11% (F) for its operations throughout the country, which include Indiana and Florida. The national average for utilities throughout the country was 15 out of 100 possible points.

The failing score for Duke Energy Carolinas & Progress is the result of the company's lackluster investment in renewable energy, like wind and solar, which provide affordable fixed-cost resources to the grid, unlike the volatility of gas prices. Free fuel from the wind and sun, and avoiding the volatile costs of gas, is what would have saved North Carolina utility customers up to $23 billion over 20 years under the climate law that Duke successfully lobbied to weaken earlier this year. Additionally, the price of building new gas plants is going up, on top of concerns about gas-price volatility. The increase in demand from new customers, like data centers, is a convenient scapegoat for Duke’s failure to meaningfully invest in renewable energy.

Statement from Olive Burress, Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign Organizer in North Carolina:

“It’s wrong that monopoly utilities like Duke and multibillion-dollar tech companies are using their power to force North Carolina businesses and families to pay for power-hungry AI data centers. If more people join the growing number of individuals and organizations fighting back against this massive transfer of wealth from average people to the richest companies in the world, we can make them pay their fair share.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 07:03:44.871805

Mayors from Freetown, Paris, Montréal, Chicago, and Phoenix to showcase how cities are stepping up on climate, whilst others step back

On the agenda: green jobs, transforming ports into clean energy hubs, making cities more livable for all, and utilising city success to inspire stronger national climate commitments

World’s largest city climate week sets the stage for November’s Local Leaders Forum in Rio and COP30 talks in Bélem

C40’s delegation for New York Climate Week brings together mayors on the frontline of the climate crisis, all of whom have won election and then, in many cases, re-election, on their pledges to improve the lives of their residents through implementing positive climate policies. The experiences of these mayors are not unique: around the world, 80% of people want their leaders to take stronger action to tackle the climate emergency (according to the 2024 UN People’s Climate Vote), indicating that climate action is not just about protecting people and the planet; it is also politically popular.

Whilst some significant national governments slow or even reverse their climate commitments, C40 Co-Chair Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr of Freetown, Mayor Anne Hidalgo of Paris, Mayor Valérie Plante of Montréal, Mayor Brandon Johnson of Chicago, and Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix will showcase how they are leading their cities through the climate emergency by cutting fossil fuel use, protecting communities from extreme weather, and investing in good green jobs and healthy cities.

C40 representatives will take part in a wide range of events across New York Climate Week, including the Climate Mayors Forum, where Mayor Gallego, as Climate Mayors Chair, will unite 40 US mayors to discuss how to continue to lead on climate action.

Mayor Aki-Sawyerr will also represent cities at the United Nations. At the invitation of the UN Secretary General, she will speak about how businesses, financial institutions, and city leaders can push countries to step up their commitments to reducing emissions (known as Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs). The intention is for these discussions to provide a critical step towards COP30 by sharing best practices, reinforcing credible transition planning, and generating momentum to scale up ambitious net-zero action across sectors and regions. Nearly three-quarters of C40 cities are reducing emissions faster than their national governments.

The development of the green economy is another essential part of making a climate-positive future work for everyone. This will be highlighted in two new C40 reports published during New York Climate Week:

C40 Cities, the Climate Migration Council, and the Mayors Migration Council have collaborated on a new report setting out the investment and training needed for cities to capitalise on the jobs boom created by the green transition.

C40 and Arup have new research coming out that shows how transforming ports into clean energy hubs can bring significant benefits to city residents, by boosting economies, improving public health, and creating new, good green jobs.

The mayors’ work this week will also help set the agenda of city-led climate leadership, building momentum toward the World Mayors Summit in Rio and COP30 later this year. C40 mayors will be heading to Brazil to show how cities are delivering real, practical solutions to pressing global challenges, focusing on urgent delivery, not drawn-out negotiations.

C40 Co-chair and Mayor of Freetown, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, said: “As mayors on the frontlines of the climate crisis, we are not only leading the world on climate action but also demonstrating that real change begins in cities. Every initiative we champion—from cleaner energy to inclusive urban planning—is about securing a greener, more equitable future for generations to come.”

“New York Climate Week is a crucial opportunity to showcase how cities in the Global South are developing practical solutions, and to ensure that the voices of our rapidly growing urban youth are at the heart of the international climate conversation.

“Our work here in New York is a vital step on the road to COP30, where we must see national leaders match our ambition and commitment.”

Mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, said: “We are at a pivotal time in the climate movement – one with challenges, but also opportunities.

“Despite federal policy heading in reverse, mayors across the United States are resolved and delivering and taking action to create safer, healthier, and more affordable communities.

“As more and more Americans are impacted by climate change through extreme weather and rising costs, mayors are here to share a vision of climate action that drives economic prosperity, improved quality of life, and a safer future for our children. New York Climate Week is a chance for us to come together, share our successes, and chart a path forward with our national and global partners.

Deputy Mayor of London and C40 Board Member Mete Coban said: “I am incredibly proud to be attending New York Climate Week at a time when cities are demonstrating that real climate action delivers for everyone.

“In London, we are committed to an ambitious climate plan that is making a real difference to the lives of Londoners, including delivering cleaner air and waterways.

“Cities are playing a vital role in the green transition, and we must ensure it benefits everyone. Our work in New York is a crucial step in showing national leaders how city-led solutions can help to build a greener, fairer, and safer world for all.”

C40 Cities Executive Director, Mark Watts, said: “New York Climate Week is an essential moment for global climate action on the road to COP30.

“As we have seen in cities from Freetown to Chicago, urban leaders are not waiting for permission to act; they’re implementing tangible, science-based solutions that not only cut emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels but also create healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous communities.

“This momentum is what’s needed to spur national governments to step up their ambition and make meaningful commitments at COP30 in Brazil. The work C40 mayors are doing to create green jobs, transition to clean energy, and build livable cities is proof that climate action is not only possible but politically popular and economically smart.”",https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/q_glossy+ret_img+to_webp/www.c40.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cropped-Favicon-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-22 07:01:55.497107

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has been mum on what that will mean starting Oct. 1, nine days from now. But Crain's obtained a copy of her administration's confidential draft contingency plan from 2019, the last time the state was on the brink of a partial shutdown. The impasse then, as now, was over road funding.

The documents, while not a final word by any means, offer a blueprint of what to expect if an agreement is not reached, including how many state workers could be laid off temporarily. Employees and vendors may begin receiving information this week.

And a state shutdown could be coupled with a federal government shutdown the same day as Democrats and Republicans in Washington, D.C., butt heads over health care funding and other issues.

Prisons would stay open. So would psychiatric hospitals, juvenile justice facilities, veterans homes and other 24/7 facilities.

Parole and probation work would be unaffected. Michigan State Police troopers and sergeants would still work. Specialized police operations and investigations would be scaled back. Child protective services and child welfare staff would remain on the job.

People receiving public assistance benefits — Medicaid, cash, food, child care and disability — would keep getting services and payments. Child support collection, adoption subsidies and Medicaid home health services would continue, as would unemployment benefits. Medicaid providers would not be paid until a budget is enacted, however. Child care providers would get their payments.

Emergency response and other health and safety functions could be pared back, including environmental and public health emergency capabilities, lab work and wildfire protection. Fish production would not be disrupted at state hatcheries.

The Mackinac Bridge, the Blue Water Bridge and the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge would remain open but possibly at lower capacities.

Debt service payments would be made.

State road construction and capital outlay projects. Halted road construction could cost the state at least $1 million a day in contractual penalties.

The lottery, which generated more than $3.2 million a day for public education in 2019, would cease, except maybe some daily drawings.

Most licensing, inspection, remediation and permitting programs would be paused, including food, dairy, environmental, occupational and other activities. The insurance, banking, marijuana, energy, payday lending and construction industries are among several that could be impacted.

Secretary of State branch offices would close and online transactions would stop. Law enforcement could not enforce expired vehicle registration and driver's licenses during the shutdown, similar to what happened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

State parks, campgrounds, harbors, historical sites, welcome centers and rest stops would close, too.

Employment and training programs would stop. Academies for state troopers and corrections officers would be suspended or postponed.

The Liquor Control Commission, the state’s liquor wholesaler, would no longer accept retail orders. Alcohol already purchased and in warehouses would be gone after five business days. A one-month shutdown in 2019 would have cost the state $41.5 million in liquor revenue.

Businesses with state contracts likely would be told it is up to them whether to keep providing services, though some would be informed their services are needed to protect residents' health and safety. They generally would not be paid for services rendered until the government reopens, though there might be some exceptions.

Most of Michigan's roughly 50,000 state employees would be instructed to not work. “Essential” workers would work and be paid.

Under the 2019 plan, an estimated 40% state employees would have kept working and 60% would not have. Departments in which a majority of employees would have continued working were corrections, military and veterans affairs, and state police. Many non-essential workers in the other departments would have stopped working.

In 2019, the Michigan Gaming Control Board, which regulates casinos, submitted a contingency plan that called for reduced staffing but enough to keep the three casinos in Detroit open. The state budget office, though, recommended fully shutting down the agency and, therefore, the casinos. It became a moot point because a shutdown was averted.

In 2007, then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm's administration planned for the casinos to close during what was an hours-long shutdown, prompting them to sue and be granted injunctive relief.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Michigan%20Capitol_CL.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:43.860268

On September 8, the 200 MW/400 MWh Lingshou standalone energy storage project in Hebei, China – jointly developed by EVE Energy and State Grid Power Technology – was successfully connected to the grid. It represents the world’s first large-scale application of 628Ah cells in a 100MWh-level facility, setting a new industry benchmark.

EVE Energy delivered and grid-connected 80 Mr.Giant energy storage systems and 40 integrated converter cabins within just one week. “From quality control and engineering coordination to system commissioning and operational support, EVE Energy has proven the maturity and feasibility of big-batteries technology,” the company said in a statement.

Mass production of these large-capacity cells began in December 2024, making EVE Energy the first manufacturer to mass-produce lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells with capacities exceeding 600 Ah for stationary storage applications.

The cells are part of EVE Energy’s Mr. Flagship series designed for battery energy storage system applications. The 628 Ah Mr. Big cell is integrated into the Mr. Giant system – a 20-foot containerised unit with up to 5 MWh energy storage capacity and suitable for 4+ hour long-duration storage.

However, EVE’s Mr. Big is not the largest cell announced to date. For instance, Chinese manufacturer Hithium showcased the industry’s first LFP battery cell breaking the 1000 Ah barrier last year. Their MIC 1130Ah cell is designed for long-duration storage of four to eight hours.

More recently, BYD relased a new battery energy storage system with the world’s largest single-unit capacity of 14.5 MWh. Named HaoHan, the system uses BYD’s self-developed 2,710 Ah Blade Battery cell, which the company claims is the largest energy storage cell in the world.

While 300 Ah+ products remain the industry standard, there are multiple reasons behind the move to even larger capacity cells. Using prismatic LFP cells with double the capacity effectively halves the number of cells, connection points and overall system components. According to many manufacturers, this leads to significant improvements in performance and maintenance efficiency and lower cost – primarily due to increased energy density per square meter.

On the downside, failures in larger cells have a greater impact on the system level, and thermal management becomes more challenging because larger cells emit more heat during charge and discharge cycles, making it harder to maintain uniform temperature.

EVE Energy has already begun shipping the Mr. Giant energy storage system equipped with 628Ah cells overseas. The company completed its first batch of shipments to Australia and Europe on September 10.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eve-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:10.466491

Our mission has always been to improve lives by delivering safe, reliable and cost-effective energy solutions to the people and businesses who depend on us every day. That hasn’t changed. But how we fulfill our mission must continue evolving to meet the demands of a growing region and a dynamic energy landscape.

In the past few months, there have been broader conversations about large-scale developments like data centers and the energy they consume. These proposed projects could support a larger economic development strategy that fosters growth and modernization of our electric infrastructure. Data centers are in no way associated with our current rate review request filed with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

In fact, we’ve developed a strategy that shows no negative impact to existing customer rates should AES Indiana power data centers in the future. This is possible because, even though more investments are required to serve those customers, we will be able to spread our costs over a larger amount of electricity sold.

This information was validated in our most recent Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) public stakeholder meeting. The IRP supports economic decision making and is a critical process for AES Indiana to gather input and analyze the future of our generation resources so we can continue our mission to serve Central Indiana.

The IRP models the cost of new generation resources, changes in fuel, power purchased in the market, and operating and maintenance costs for existing assets and analyzes how these factors could impact our overall costs. This process ensures AES Indiana identifies the best option that meets our customers’ needs in a way that is safe, reliable and cost-effective. AES Indiana is planning on completing its IRP at the end of October.

We understand customers have questions about data centers. If data center agreements progress, we have an obligation to serve existing customers while being transparent with our plans to serve new customers. This will also include following the regulatory framework that requires AES Indiana to go through a public review process to make the investments to serve the data centers and review the rates these data center customers will be charged.

Our job at AES Indiana is to deliver electricity to people and places that make our community prosper. We responsibly manage what is within our control, and we are committed to working with city and state leaders on a long-term vision for a stronger, more resilient energy future.

In addition to sharing costs, the parish and the Corps share responsibilities for the project.
In areas where work has been completed, Raiford said in the past he might have gotten calls about flooded ditches during a 2- or 3-inch rain.","A plan to dredge five Baton Rouge bayous, designed in the 1990s and implemented only after the deadly flooding of 2016, is now successfully protecting homes from floodwater — and it is only 15% complete.

The Five Tributaries Project involves clearing foliage from the banks and snagging obstacles along the bottoms of five bayous in the East Baton Rouge Parish, each of which empties into the Amite River.

With these bayous cleared, their waters can drain more quickly into the Amite instead of rising over their banks and threatening residents' homes.

""If you imagine the trapezoidal channel (of the bayou), we're pretty much clearing all vegetation off the side slopes coming down to about 2 inches above the ground, and then any obstructions or hindrances in the water itself, stumps, branches, anything sticking out, we'll remove those as well,"" said David Bradley, project director with the Army Corps of Engineers.

While the dredging plan was funded in 2018, it wasn't until February 2023 that the first portion of the first bayou had been successfully cleared and snagged.

Fred Raiford, transportation and drainage director for the parish, admitted delays slowed the start of the project, but says now that the lower portions of Bayou Fountain, Ward Creek and Jones Creek have been cleared, he is already seeing results.

""Those areas have always had problems with flooding and drainage, and once we've done that work I've had very, very, very, very few calls about water,"" Raiford said. ""The reason I know that is because I go look out. I mean, I watch when it rains at night. I get up because I know I'm gonna get phone calls, I'd like to at least know I've looked at it.""

Raiford said the completed work on those three bayous has been a ""tremendous plus for us with reducing the flood risk for people in our parish.""

The clearing and snagging of lower Jones Creek was finished in February 2023, Bayou Fountain's lower few miles were done in September 2023, and Ward Creek's part was completed in May 2024.

In total, 11.2 miles of waterway have been cleared, with roughly another 55 miles to go.

Those completed areas were all from the lowest and deepest portions of these bayous, where they bottom out into the Amite River and where the water is deep enough to support barges with excavators used for clearing.

The barges won't be an option for the remaining waterways, and Bradley expects the Corps instead will be using amphibious excavators, sometimes called ""marsh buggies.""

To get these machines to the water, and to store the collected debris, the parish floodwater authority will need to pay residents to use their land.

These right of way parcels could be as small as 25-foot strips along the bayous' banks or up to an acre plot on which to pile whatever is pulled from the water.

Raiford estimated the remaining work will require more than 300 temporary land acquisitions, none of which have been made.

Once all five bayous have been cleared and snagged, the Corps will also construct concrete riprap on the banks of portions of Jones Creek and look to make channel enlargements to parts of Beaver Bayou and Blackwater Bayou in Central.

So, how much longer?

Bradley, with the Corps, said he is waiting to get a better idea of the estimated time for completion for the project before giving a date.

Raiford has estimated the end of 2031.

Both pointed to the unknown variables of ongoing environmental surveys, construction timelines delivered to the directors from contractors, and the specter of hidden utilities needing to be relocated.

Raiford was the parish's public works director when the Five Tributaries plan was first considered in 1995 and 1996. He said despite approval from the Water Resources Development Act for the project to begin construction in 1999, the lack of federal money was a hurdle.

The Five Tributaries project has an estimated cost of $255 million, with the federal money being allocated in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.

But that allocation also requires the Corps' ""non-federal partners"" to pay 25% of the costs of the total project, or roughly $64 million of that $255 million total.

So far, the parish has needed to pay only around $10 million, Raiford estimated, with roughly another $40 million being matched by a capital outlay from the state.

In addition to sharing costs, the parish and the Corps share responsibilities for the project.

The parish must acquire land and relocate utilities, while the Corps must develop environmental impact statements and award construction contracts.

As for what is immediately next: The Corps has completed environmental surveys for the upper portions of Jones Creek and has ongoing surveys for upper Bayou Fountain and upper Ward Creek.

In areas where work has been completed, Raiford said in the past he might have gotten calls about flooded ditches during a 2- or 3-inch rain. Now, the complaints have grown quiet.

Larry Galloway, former president of the Sagefield Homeowners Association, which lies on the other side of Burbank Drive from Bayou Fountain, said his neighbors experienced bad flooding during both 2016 and 2021.

On Friday, standing on the edge of a long ditch where Longwood Plantation Road turns to nothing but grass, Galloway gestured out at where a clogged culvert had to be pulled from the ground after flooding in August 2021.

""Some of them got it in their homes and these down here, they got it real bad. They couldn't get out,"" Galloway said from his neighbor's backyard. ""And boy, some houses that way, most of them it was up to the mailboxes.""

Galloway isn't sure if he has noticed less water backing up in the Bayou Fountain outlets that surround his subdivision, but he hopes Raiford is right that the snagging has helped. Mostly, he is concerned about new development in the area, especially in places that were underwater in 2021, and how those new homes might push water into Sagefield.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/8e/88e2b6b9-8747-46f5-9da0-8dc5e3ce7af6/68cdf86dbb4f6.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:33.293598

The reason: Electricity demand, also known as load growth, is surging, and NIPSCO’s clean energy plans are not keeping pace.
The failures are not happening in isolation: The federal government has eliminated $22 billion of funding for clean energy projects this year alone.
Unless utilities abandon fossil fuel expansion and accelerate clean energy, customers will be stuck with higher bills and dirtier air.
“Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”","In 2024, the planet crossed what many scientists consider a dangerous threshold: It warmed to about 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels, passing the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 °C threshold. That same year, American utility companies largely failed to do their part to ramp down fossil fuel usage. They earned a failing grade in the new The Dirty Truth About Utility Climate Pledges, the Sierra Club’s yearly analysis of utilities’ public commitments to sustainability versus their actual plans to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy.

The report found that the nation’s largest power providers are clinging to coal, one of the dirtiest sources of energy, and racing to build new gas plants. The authors examined the long-term plans of 75 utility companies and found an industry aggregate score of just 15 out of 100—the lowest score in the report’s five-year history. It evaluated utilities based on whether they will phase out coal plants by 2030, stop building new gas plants, and invest in enough clean energy to replace fossil fuels by 2035.

On all fronts, most companies failed.

“So many utilities use load growth as an excuse to backtrack on their climate progress and goals, instead of using it as a bold opportunity to meet the moment and build the clean energy we need for a clean and renewable future,” said Emma Pabst, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign and one of the authors of the study. “The reality is that a lot of utilities are stuck in old, outdated, and dirty habits, and the data shows across the board that clean is more affordable.”

Many utilities are backsliding on their commitments to clean energy sources such as wind and sun, and greenwashing at the same time—even though 65 companies in the study have climate pledges, only three of them received an A rating. Collectively, utilities are planning less renewable capacity than is necessary to replace existing fossil plants, let alone to meet the clean energy targets that most scientists agree are necessary to prevent irreparable climate damage: 80 percent clean electricity by 2030 and 100 percent by 2035.

Despite the relative affordability of renewable energy, utilities are unable or unwilling to untether themselves from coal and gas. The 75 companies in the report plan to retire just 29 percent of coal generation by 2030, and 61 of them intend to build a combined 118 gigawatts of new gas capacity by 2035.

The Dirty Truth report comes at a time when electricity demand has skyrocketed, fueled in part by the rise of energy-intensive data centers. This is the first edition of The Dirty Truth that has taken plans to build clean energy to meet growing electricity demand into account, because it is an increasingly pressing issue for utilities—and many of them meet that demand by investing in fossil fuels.

Few examples illustrate this better than the Northern Indiana Public Service Company. Although NIPSCO earned an A in every former report, its score fell 23 points from last year to this year, dropping to its lowest-ever score of 57 out of 100.

The reason: Electricity demand, also known as load growth, is surging, and NIPSCO’s clean energy plans are not keeping pace. The company predicts far greater load growth than in previous years, but its current renewable energy plans would cover only 31 percent of its existing fossil generation and projected growth. Even though NIPSCO plans to close its remaining coal plants by 2030, the utility is also planning 400 megawatts of new fossil fuel construction at the Schahfer site by 2035. Part of that new load growth is from data centers. For example, NIPSCO plans to power potential hyperscale data center development with over 3,500 megawatts of new gas infrastructure.

NIPSCO has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions by 90 percent by 2035 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2040. But its parent company said in the spring that its climate goals, “may evolve as we assess and respond to business opportunities such as data centers.”

""We have the technologies that we need today in order to solve this. Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”

In Kansas and Missouri, the utility company Evergy scored just 9 points out of 100—only four points above its score in the first edition of the report five years ago. Evergy serves 1.7 million people and is based in Kansas City, one of the most energy-burdened cities in the U.S., where many low-income, Black, and Latino households spend six percent or more of their income on electricity.

Evergy has refused to adopt local climate goals or commit to retiring the Hawthorn coal plant in Kansas City. The utility intends to retire only a third of its coal generation by 2030, while adding more than 5,500 MW of new gas capacity by 2035. If built, that gas capacity would emit as much annual pollution as 2.5 million cars.

Evergy has also walked back its emissions reductions goals. Five years ago, the utility touted its “Sustainability Transformation Plan,” which said Evergy could cut emissions 85 percent by 2030. Since then, Evergy has removed the pledge altogether. The company also proposed fewer plans for clean energy in 2025 than it did in 2024.

The failures are not happening in isolation: The federal government has eliminated $22 billion of funding for clean energy projects this year alone.

“We saw really great climate progress during the previous administration, with the IRA and the (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) and lots of federal rules that cracked down on pollution to make our communities cleaner and safer. We're seeing that get rolled back piece by piece,” said Noah Ver Beek, one of the report’s authors and a senior energy campaigns analyst with the Beyond Coal Campaign. “Even more, we're seeing crackdowns on the amount of clean energy that can get built on public lands, and the processes that a clean energy project needs to go through in order to receive federal permits.”

The consequences of fossil fuel reliance will land on ratepayers. According to a separate report, Assessing Impacts Of The 2025 Reconciliation Bill On U.S. Energy Costs, Jobs, Health, And Emissions, sticking with gas and coal will drive up electricity bills by $120 a year for the average household by 2030, rising to $230 by 2035.

Despite some companies improving their plans since the report’s first edition in 2021, the overall trajectory is moving backward. Unless utilities abandon fossil fuel expansion and accelerate clean energy, customers will be stuck with higher bills and dirtier air.

The Dirty Truth report calls on utilities to recommit themselves to sustainability, even as the Trump Administration does everything in its power to defund renewable energy projects and further entrench the United States in fossil fuel reliance.

“We don't need to wait for some new technology, or something great and special and new to come up. We have the technologies that we need today in order to solve this,” Ver Beek said. “Wind, solar, and storage combined can get us to 80 percent clean energy or beyond.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 08:00:39.762533

Some lawmakers want New Hampshire to be a bigger part of that.,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ai-driving-data-center-boom-some-lawmakers-want-new-hampshire-be-bigger-part,"Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports.
Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.
Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries.
Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said.
But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.","As data center development takes off across the United States and the world, New Hampshire legislators and regulators are weighing what steps their state, and its aging electric grid, should take to prepare.

“For me, it’s worth considering. There may be an opportunity here, but I think there’s also concerns,” said Sen. David Watters, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

Data centers — large, energy-hungry facilities housing computer networks — are rapidly becoming more common nationwide, data center developer Craig McGahey told New Hampshire lawmakers and energy professionals at the 2025 New Hampshire Energy Summit, organized by consulting and lobbying firm Dupont Group on Sept. 15.

The rise of artificial intelligence is the biggest factor contributing to increasing data center demand, McGahey said, citing competition among so-called “hyperscalers” — expansive cloud computing companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, and others.

“As this race for AI dominance continues, we don’t see it stopping, and it’s going to continue on for many, many years,” he said.

Nationally, construction of data centers is at an all-time high, Reuters reports. And as of March 2025, the United States had more of the facilities than any other nation, according to a Statista tally.

In other states, some of which have hundreds of data centers, the facilities have strained electric grids and, in some cases, water supplies. Yet, for now, New Hampshire is not among those: 10 relatively small-scale facilities were listed statewide on the website Data Center Map as of September 2025, putting New Hampshire in the bottom fifth nationally.

Some see an ‘emerging market.’ Others, an environmental threat.

That may, however, be set to change. Low power availability and high electricity costs have so far been the principal factors preventing an influx of data centers in New Hampshire like that seen in some other states, McGahey said. But he added that he considered the Northeast as a whole an “emerging market” for the centers.

Developers like himself, he said, were assessing different states’ regulatory landscapes, land availability, and power supplies to determine where to site new centers, which can range in size from normal office buildings to projects spanning hundreds of acres.

Lawmakers are divided on whether data center development would be an opportunity or a concern for New Hampshire.

Citing property tax revenue and employment benefits, some legislators said they wanted to see New Hampshire create a regulatory environment that would favor data centers.

“I think New Hampshire should court any business into the state,” said Rep. Doug Thomas, vice chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, in an interview. “In order for them to come here, there has to be a market. And so we have to … show them that we’re interested.”

He and House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee Chair Michael Vose cited construction and jobs as a primary benefit of growing data centers in New Hampshire. In his presentation, McGahey said a data center of the scale likely to be established in New Hampshire could employ as many as 40 people full-time, and potentially hundreds more during construction.

Others questioned whether those estimates represented enough jobs to make a meaningful impact on employment. Rep. Thomas Cormen, a member of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, said in an interview the amount of people employed by data centers does not typically scale up proportionally as the centers increase in size. And, he added, for a relatively uncomplicated building like the typical warehouse-style data center, the construction phase might not last particularly long, meaning the bulk of jobs created would be temporary.

Watters said data center jobs were not substantially better-paying than jobs in other preexisting industries. “Some of the biggest ones employ maybe 100 to 200 people at a $40,000 (annual) salary,” Watters said. “I mean, that’s McDonalds. … They might make close to $40,000, too.”

Cormen also raised environmental concerns. Some data centers are cooled with river water, a practice that raises the temperature of the water downstream, Cormen said. This could be harmful to the river itself or cause dangerous ice dams and flooding in winter, he said.

“I think a lot of people have environmental concerns, and power concerns,” Watters said.

Uncertainty about how data centers would be powered, Cormen said, is another hurdle; while drawing from the grid could raise electricity costs for other ratepayers, the type and effects of unregulated local generators are another unknown.

“Before you know it, we’re talking about diesel generation,” he said. “We just don’t know.”

Speculating to meet demand

Some states have weighed implementing special rate schedules to offset the impact of increased on-grid data center demand on ratepayers, but Vose said he did not expect the New Hampshire Legislature to consider such a system in the near future.

Instead, Vose and other legislators discussed ways to increase New Hampshire’s electricity generation down the road, including through speculative technology like small, modular nuclear reactors, or SMRs.

The New Hampshire Department of Energy is assessing whether SMRs could someday be implemented in New Hampshire, Director of Energy Innovation Thomas Barrasso said at the summit. SMRs could power data centers within “microgrids,” small regionalized power grids that could operate either independently of or in tandem with the rest of the grid, he said.

“I think the microgrid piece of this, the grid modernization piece of this, the SMR piece of this kind of all start to fit together,” Barrasso said.

At the summit, Barrasso expressed optimism about small modular reactors, saying he felt the tide of public opinion toward nuclear energy was changing. A Gallup poll published in April supported this impression, showing 61% of Americans in favor of nuclear power — a six percentage point increase over the previous poll in 2023.

However, SMR critics point out that the technology is still in development, questioning Barrasso’s statement at the summit that they could eventually be “plug and play” solutions to bolster New Hampshire’s energy offerings. It may be anywhere from five to 15 years before the generators could hypothetically be deployed, according to Barrasso’s presentation.

SMRs are a “convenient” discussion for people resistant to renewable energy development, Watters said in an interview. “The interest is being driven by people who think SMRs are the answer to every problem in the world,” he said. But they are not the only way data centers could be powered, he noted.

Other technologies, including forms of renewable energy, are deployable now and could be implemented with less investment, said Dan Weeks, of solar developer ReVision Energy, at the summit. Weeks highlighted grid-scale batteries and renewable generation as other options that the state could direct attention to rather than the hypothetical future deployment of SMRs.

“Is the (Department of Energy) thinking about meeting these rising energy needs and cost concerns through … greater deployment of existing technologies that are at this point pretty far down the cost curve and probably a lot closer in the future than SMRs?” Weeks asked.

“My job was to sort of get ‘all of the above’ into the mindset of everyone,” Barrasso responded.

The Legislature has already taken some steps toward localized power generation that could be used to power facilities like data centers through SMRs. House Bill 672, sponsored by Vose and signed by Gov. Ayotte in August, paved the way for off-grid energy generators to sell power directly to buyers. Vose said he hoped that bill would “encourage” microgrids. (The bill also exempts off-grid electricity providers from renewable energy standards and the rate regulations on-grid generation is subject to.)

A resolution to declare the development of advanced nuclear technology “in the best interest of New Hampshire” also passed last session, but legislators failed to pass House Bill 710, which would have allowed utilities to own and operate SMRs. A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Kevin Avard will come before the Legislature in 2026, according to a legislative service request listed on the General Court of New Hampshire website.

McGahey acknowledged the push to build data centers quickly had led developers to look toward more quickly deployable energy solutions than SMRs. In other states, developers have constructed new gas generators to meet data center demand, he said.

“Because this race is so intense, we’re looking for solutions in two to three years. We are looking at battery storage solutions. We’re looking at natural gas plants,” McGahey said.

Looking ahead

During his presentation, McGahey forecasted demand for a wave of smaller data centers within the next three to five years. The appetite of New Hampshire policymakers and utilities toward that development, McGahey said, could play a role in determining to what extent that development progresses locally.

The reality that New Hampshire’s grid is facing, including difficulties from power shortages and aging transmission lines, may make it unlikely that the state ever sees data center development on a large scale, Watters said.

“It’s hard for me to imagine that there’d be an interest in siting them here,” he said.

But the possibility, and related concerns, were worth discussing, he said, and others at the summit agreed.

“We need to get people to the table to start to talk about what the future is going to look like,” Barrasso said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-91/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenter-1024x6831758531830.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=4OppMGlt,N,,2025-09-22 07:02:30.870395

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.","While all of the United States faces delays in getting new energy onto the grid, the problem is worst in the PJM region, where hundreds of projects have been stalled in the queue for years. To deal with the backlog, the grid operator switched to a new interconnection process in 2023; as of June, PJM still had about 63 gigawatts of power, mostly clean energy, stuck in that ​“transition queue.”

Across the country, wind, solar, and battery storage make up most of the resources waiting to come online, and their ​“levelized cost of energy” is cheaper or on par with other electricity sources.

The Trump administration has called for ​“the rapid and efficient buildout” of energy infrastructure, including transmission lines and grid-enhancing technologies, ​“by easing Federal regulatory burdens.”

But the administration’s actions have so far had the opposite effect. A February executive order calling for review of independent agency rulings threatens the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to expand transmission. And in July, the Trump administration canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express — the largest transmission line underway in the United States. The project aims to shuttle gigawatts of wind and solar power from the Great Plains to the East, and Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., has called the cancellation of its federal loan guarantee illegal.

The administration’s policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are also expected to more than halve the amount of clean energy built over the next decade, further exacerbating concerns about soaring power prices and rising demand.

What’s on voters’ minds

The survey results may help the Conservative Energy Network convince decision makers to take steps to expand the grid.

“To the best of my knowledge, this is the first poll that’s been done in the PJM area testing these things, and in the MISO south area,” said John Szoka, the group’s CEO, at the National Conservative Energy Summit.

The polling also gauged the persuasiveness of four statements to support grid expansion. The takeaways could inform how advocates and legislators work to boost public support for clean energy.

Among conservatives in Ohio and Pennsylvania, a message focused on lower costs was about 12 times more likely to shift someone’s opinion than one about preventing blackouts, Lane noted. Messages about increasing American energy production, preventing blackouts, and providing positive job and economic impacts for Americans were more likely to move liberals than one about lowering costs.

Opinions were more divided on whether the federal government, states, or private companies should pay for grid expansion, although a slight majority of respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas said they would be willing to pay a few dollars more per month in the short term if it would reduce outages and lower costs over time.

Respondents were also mixed on who should get to choose how electricity is produced. States, landowners, and local officials all ranked above federal authorities.

Clean energy, meanwhile, received only modest support on its own. About one-fourth of the Ohio and Pennsylvania respondents said using clean energy was one of their top two policy goals, with nearly one-fifth of those surveyed in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri giving that response.

Ultimately, affordability and reliability were the clear consensus energy policy priorities for poll respondents in both the PJM and MISO areas.

With the federal government standing in the way of both grid expansion and clean energy development, however, it will be tough for the voters to get the improvements they want.

Local climate activists held an event Friday to celebrate the ocean’s 3.8 billionth birthday and raise awareness about the impacts of climate change and carbon emissions on the ocean’s health.

Surrounded by artwork produced by local activists, including a painting of flood destruction in Sierra Leone and a banner reading “Fossil Fuel Burning = Ocean Death,” attendees participated in ocean trivia, shared an Ashley’s ice cream cake and listened to discussions of how carbon emissions from fossil fuel-based transportation endanger the ecosystem.

“Coastal displacement!” Jenna Zidan, an organizer for the New Haven Climate Movement, or NHCM, shouted to a crowd on Broadway island.

“Wake up!” the crowd chanted in response.

“Sea ice melting!” Zidan said.

“Wake up!”

The event marked the launch of NHCM’s inaugural GOtober Campaign, which calls for less car and more public transportation use from New Haven residents in October.

The campaign emphasizes that greenhouse gases emitted by transportation are one of the main drivers of ocean acidification, Chris Schweitzer, director of the NHCM, said. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 12 gallons of gasoline — a single tank for many cars — release 235 pounds of carbon dioxide.

Schweitzer hopes that GOtober encourages New Haveners to “defund the OilyGarchy” through concrete decisions they make about their transportation methods.

“Right now, the present administration, supported largely by millions of dollars of fossil fuel donations, is attacking everything to do with the environment,” Schweitzer said. “GOtober is partly a chance for people to say, ‘Yeah, I want to stop supporting the fossil fuel industry and spend the 500 dollars on gas elsewhere.’”

As extreme weather becomes more frequent and temperatures continue to rise, New Haveners at the event said they have noticed their environment shifting in real time.

Ethan Reynolds ’28, who attended the Sound School, a local public school on the New Haven Harbor, said that his proximity to frequent ocean storms made him “really mindful about how the changing water temperature and everything impacts the marine environment.”

Jam Lian ’28 said that while the coast helps moderate seasons, he worries that rising sea levels and temperatures make New Haven vulnerable to hurricanes due to its coastal position.

Organizers and participants alike expressed that while encouraging residents to take public transportation is necessary to stymie climate change, the current inaccessibility of the city’s transit system poses a barrier to many.

Natalie Clorio, a senior at Career High School and a former intern with NHCM, lives 40 minutes away in Derby. Every week, she pays up to $14 to take the bus to and from New Haven for school and work, she said. She said she has a part-time job to help pay for transportation.

“I don’t think high schoolers should be paying for buses,” Clorio said, adding that many of her peers are scared to take public transportation because of fears about danger on buses.

Meredith Polk, who took the bus to Friday’s event, said that her bus ran 15 minutes late, which was “pretty normal.”

“The city is really built for cars,” Polk said. “There’s a lot of parking options, so people aren’t really motivated to take the bus, and it’s not as safe to ride a bike.”

The lack of shelter, seating and signage about schedules at bus stops also makes riding the bus more inaccessible, Schweitzer said. Sandeep Aysola, New Haven’s director of transportation, traffic and parking, did not immediately respond to the News’ questions about shelter and signage. He wrote that the Connecticut Department of Transportation is responsible for buses and their scheduling.

“If you get more people on buses, the buses run more often, which is good for folks who depend on buses,” Schweitzer said.

In 2024, the NHCM proposed the “Transportation Transformation Resolution” to the city, which would require New Haven departments to detail concrete plans for improving public transportation and reducing greenhouse gases.

In March, the Board of Alders heard the NHCM’s proposal and decided to keep the resolution in committee, rather than taking a vote. The city’s alders have not yet voted on the resolution.

According to Connecticut’s latest climate report, transportation was the state’s top source of greenhouse gas emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels, at 42 percent of total emissions.",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/oceanbday_kccc_CatherineCheung_ContributingPhotographer-scaled-1024x732.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 05:59:28.682615

However, these utilities are planning enough clean energy to replace ONLY 32% of existing coal and gas generation and load growth by 2035.

Each year since 2021, the amount of additional load utilities forecast by 2035 has increased, but utilities have failed to make clean energy plans to keep pace. If we assume all planned clean energy would replace existing coal and gas generation first, planned clean energy is barely sufficient to replace half, let alone supply forecast load growth.

Utilities plan to add 118 GW of new gas capacity by 2035- which would be a 20% increase in nationwide gas capacity. While they claim this is needed to meet rising demand, there are three problems with that argument.

First, load growth can be met with clean alternatives like efficiency, transmission upgrades, demand-side management, renewables, and storage. Second, over a third of utilities are planning more gas than needed for their projected growth. Third, new gas is poorly suited for near-term needs, which require faster, more flexible solutions.

To limit global warming to below 1.5°C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientific and policy consensus shows that economies like the U.S. must retire all coal-fired power by 2030. Yet utilities in this study are stubbornly clinging to coal.

Coal is one of the most polluting and often the most expensive way to produce electricity. In fact, coal power was 28% more expensive in 2024 than it was in 2021. Retiring the rest of the coal fleet is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions and lower customer's bills.

Of the 75 companies examined in this study, 65 have some form of climate pledge. Utilities often highlight these commitments as proof of their dedication to clean energy and environmental responsibility. However, the data reveals a different story: most of these pledges are greenwashing, not indicative of genuine plans for a clean energy transition. Despite 65 utilities having climate goals, only 3 received an A.

Utilities that are serious about their climate commitments must do more than set distant goals. They should adopt strong, science-aligned targets with regular interim milestones and back those goals with detailed, actionable plans to achieve them.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-09/bw-istock-525755829-with-cutout-low-crop2-sh.png.webp?itok=BY2f_byt,N,,2025-09-22 09:00:32.749140

By embracing a holistic approach to supporting employees, including assessments along with other strategies, the nuclear industry will be poised to thrive well into the future.","With energy demand soaring due to greater electrification and the growth of data centers, all eyes are now on nuclear power to revive its role as a key component of the U.S. energy portfolio. Recent executive orders are facilitating the reopening of shuttered nuclear plants, such as the Palisades plant in Michigan, which is just one of the planned recommissions around the country.

This “nuclear renaissance” means that more employees are needed in the nuclear sector, and those already employed who have industry expertise need to be retained. The nuclear workforce is already older than other segments of the energy industry, with 60% of nuclear employees aged 30–45. Public and private employers must therefore invest in recruiting and training employees with the necessary technical skills, but they also must identify candidates with the right personality traits for this unique industry.

Working in a nuclear power plant can be stressful — in addition to technical competency, it requires a commitment to safety culture and teamwork. The legacy of accidents such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl means the stakes are high, and 80% of significant events at nuclear facilities have been attributed to human error.

HR teams need a robust toolset to find the right employees and support the physical and mental health of those they currently have. Assessments are a valuable part of that toolset, and they can equip HR professionals in the nuclear industry with data that helps them support the well-being of this critical energy workforce.

How assessments assist in recruiting

Assessments such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory®-3 (MMPI®-3) can bring value by providing information about attitudes and personality traits that can inform how a candidate may approach a given job role. While HR teams should not be expected to interpret the MMPI-3 as clinical practitioners would, the assessment can be a rich source of information for them. By going beyond resumes and interviews, such tools give hiring teams a deeper understanding of work styles, interpersonal dynamics, and potential fit within the organization, helping to make more confident, informed talent decisions.

“Assessments can play a powerful role in proactively spotting signs of emotional distress or maladaptive coping styles,” says Lynsey Psimas, Ph.D., Director of Business Development, Government & Public Safety at Pearson Clinical Assessments. “When applied consistently during recruitment, these tools can reveal skills and personality traits that will either complement — or potentially clash with — the demands of a high-stress role,” she says.

Maintaining employee wellness with assessments

Supporting employees’ holistic well-being requires many strategies, spanning health coverage, time off, and financial security. Assessments add an important layer to this strategy by offering insight into emotional or psychological distress that could impact an employee’s performance.

For example, the Beck Anxiety Inventory® (BAI®) and Beck Depression Inventory® (BDI®) from Pearson are quick 21-item screeners that can help identify symptoms of anxiety or depression. Pearson also offers the Quality of Life Inventory® (QOLI®), which assesses mental health aspects like happiness and satisfaction.

If an employee is struggling with family issues or financial problems, these stressors can affect their work life as well. Assessments help HR teams to proactively identify employees who may need support to handle such challenges and remain healthy and focused at work.

“Assessments can be an integral part of broader wellness and resiliency programs,” Psimas says. “They give employers a way to monitor progress over time, such as within an Employee Assistance Program, providing actionable insights to better support their workforce,” she adds.

Assessments can also help HR teams understand how their workforce approaches teamwork, and who may thrive — or face challenges — in collaborative or leadership roles. The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire® (MPQ®) looks at interpersonal skills, resilience, and social skills that are crucial for employees in an industry like nuclear power, where collaboration and executing on tasks are of the utmost importance. If employee conflicts are an issue or communication needs improvement, starting with an assessment like the MPQ® gives HR teams a data-driven baseline of personality traits, helping teams target development and strengthen workplace dynamics.

How to build the nuclear workforce of the future

As HR teams build up their workforce in the revived nuclear sector, they need a range of tools and tactics to find and retain the right employees who are technically skilled and able to handle this industry’s unique challenges. The need for more electricity will not diminish any time soon, and nuclear power’s emission-free nature means it will be an important part of our energy mix for years to come. As a result, employers must focus on recruiting and retaining the employees who can make this nuclear renaissance a success.

A resilient workforce is key to this process.

Policy Shifts: Carbon Pricing, Subsidies, and Regulatory Frameworks

The 2025 carbon policy landscape is marked by a dual focus on punitive measures for high-emission industries and incentives for sustainable alternatives. Carbon pricing mechanisms, such as expanded cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes, have created a fiscal disincentive for fossil fuel dependency. According to the Future of Jobs Report 2025, 47% of employers anticipate that climate-change mitigation will fundamentally reshape their operations within five years, directly influencing capital allocation toward low-carbon technologies In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ].

Simultaneously, governments are deploying subsidies and industrial policies to accelerate renewable energy adoption. For instance, the report notes that one-third of surveyed organizations are adjusting business models in response to subsidies for green infrastructure, which reduce upfront costs for solar, wind, and energy storage projects These are the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/][ 3 ]. These policies are not merely symbolic; they are recalibrating ROI calculations for investors. The World Economic Forum highlights that 41% of employers expect technological advancements in energy generation and storage to drive operational efficiency, further enhancing the long-term profitability of renewables In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ].

Renewable Energy Jobs: A Proxy for Investment Viability

The surge in demand for green jobs—such as renewable energy engineers and environmental engineers—serves as a barometer for the sector's financial health. The Future of Jobs Report 2025 identifies these roles as among the “15 fastest-growing jobs,” reflecting both policy-driven demand and market confidence in renewable technologies In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ]. This labor market shift underscores a critical point: as nations scale up renewable infrastructure, the associated workforce development and technological innovation create a self-reinforcing cycle of investment.

For example, the report projects that 170 million new jobs will emerge in renewable energy and related fields by 2030 These are the Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/top-10-emerging-technologies-of-2025/][ 3 ]. Such growth signals to investors that the sector is not only aligned with regulatory mandates but also poised for sustained economic returns. The integration of skills like AI and big data into energy systems further enhances operational efficiency, reducing costs and improving project scalability The Future of Jobs Report 2025 - The World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/in-full/3-skills-outlook/][ 4 ].

Geopolitical and Economic Catalysts

Beyond policy, geopolitical dynamics are amplifying the financial case for renewables. The report notes that rising trade tensions—exemplified by tariffs under U.S. President Donald Trump—have prompted countries to localize supply chains and prioritize sustainable alternatives In charts: 7 global shifts defining 2025 so far | World Economic Forum, [https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/08/inflection-points-7-global-shifts-defining-2025-so-far-in-charts/][ 2 ]. This “geoeconomic fragmentation” is driving investment into domestic renewable energy projects, as nations seek to reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels and secure energy independence.

Moreover, emerging technologies such as osmotic power systems and advanced nuclear reactors are diversifying the renewable energy portfolio, offering new avenues for high-ROI infrastructure. The Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025 highlights innovations like structural battery composites, which could revolutionize energy storage for electric vehicles, further de-risking long-term investments .

Conclusion: A Tipping Point for Renewable Energy

The convergence of carbon policy reforms, technological innovation, and geopolitical realignments is creating a tipping point for renewable energy infrastructure. While specific ROI metrics remain sparse in the 2025 data, the broader trends—such as job growth, subsidy-driven cost reductions, and the de-risking of green technologies—paint a compelling picture of financial viability. Investors who align with these shifts are not only complying with regulatory frameworks but also capitalizing on a sector poised for exponential growth.

There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says.","The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he announced rollbacks.

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future.

The deployment will see the company secure Fuso eCanter trucks and Mercedes-Benz eSprinter vans that will operate across metropolitan areas, beginning with Adelaide before expanding to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

Peter Langley, FedEx Australasia Regional Vice-President, confirmed that the initial rollout will commence with 15 Fuso eCanter trucks in Adelaide, representing the first phase of a broader expansion plan.

“The introduction of these EVs to our pickup and delivery fleet in Australia marks a pivotal moment in our operations,” Langley said. The company plans to expand into additional regional and metropolitan areas as EV charging infrastructure is installed.

The EVs are expected to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 8.5 tonnes per vehicle annually, contributing to FedEx's global goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040.

This Australian deployment follows FedEx's successful introduction of EVs in New Zealand and aligns with the company's global strategy to electrify its entire parcel pickup and delivery fleet by 2040.

The move comes amid increasing EV adoption in Australia's logistics sector. In recent weeks, ANC Delivers added 111 electric vehicles to its fleet through a project co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).

Australia Post introduced 36 Mercedes-Benz electric vans in August, while Linfox announced plans to purchase 30 heavy-duty electric trucks in May.

Beyond vehicle electrification, FedEx is investing in aircraft modernisation, sustainable fuels, renewable energy, and efficient facilities to support its sustainability goals.

As EV charging infrastructure expands across Australia, FedEx plans to continue its electrification efforts in line with its global commitment of AU$2 billion (US$1.32 billion) initial investment in vehicle electrification, sustainable energy and carbon sequestration technologies.

FedEx’s announcement comes days after ARENA committed AU$12.3 million to develop Australia's first dedicated electric truck charging hub in Melbourne.

Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced fission power plants to deliver scalable clean energy and commercializes nuclear fuel recycling to convert waste into usable reactor fuel. During the September 9 episode, Cramer said that he does not think that the company’s stock is “done going higher,” as he remarked:

“Then viewers urged me to focus on nuclear power. When I looked up over, when I looked over the group, I found one that seemed like a serious spec, Oklo, which is building small form nuclear reactors. Given the high demand for electricity thanks to the data center buildout, which we heard just again tonight with Oracle, and the fact that Oklo’s a company with significant customer interest, I decided to suspend my critical judgment. And I told you that it might take only one positive headline for this stock to rock, and sure enough, a $33 stock gapped up when it was selected for a DoD contract. I don’t think it’s done going higher.”

E3's ability to produce lithium with a low carbon footprint and minimal water usage could make it a preferred supplier in a market where ESG compliance is becoming a competitive differentiator.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Investment

E3 Lithium's strategic advancements—from DLE technology to regulatory progress—position it as a key enabler of North American EV manufacturing. Its phased production plan, coupled with partnerships and cost advantages, creates a compelling value proposition for investors. As the continent races to build a self-sufficient battery supply chain, E3's ability to deliver high-purity lithium carbonate at scale could not only disrupt the market but also redefine the economics of EV production.

I’ve been a regular visitor to Australia’s university campuses since my appointment to the science and innovation portfolios four months ago.

In fact, some weeks I spend more time on campus than I did in my final year as an undergraduate student at the University of Sydney.

I acknowledge the many hardworking public service agency leaders, directors of institutes, CEOs of important professional associations, deans and professors, researchers and postgraduate students here today.

Australian Public Policy Institute

There’s so much about this Institute that I have admired since its establishment under the leadership of my friend Dr Patricia Azarias.

In those early says of the James Martin Institute, the decision of the then-government of NSW to find a role for this institution really did set this organisation up to make that contribution.

There is enormous value in your online publications, research reports and podcasts.

But what impresses me most is the way this Institute is building a reliable pipeline of timely expertise that feeds directly into the policy process.

The Policy Challenge Grants are spectacular. They are mission-led, collaborative and directly geared to solving real-world problems that matter right now.

The findings from those projects are all the more impactful thanks to your partnerships with the university sector, the NSW Government and more recently the Australian Public Service Commission.

To the extent that I studied public policy, there was this dry language used to describe policy activism – I think the phrase ‘policy entrepreneurship’ sticks in my head as a particularly banal, individualistic conception of how policymaking works.

I really do like how Peter described tripartism. Tripartism – or this radical concept, pluralism – means the role of institutions working together in a credible way in the national interest.

That really does underline the way that the Albanese government thinks about public policymaking.

It’s a partnership with our institutions and business community. The university sector and the research sector more broadly. Our trade unions. Civil society. All working with government to solve national problems.

Think of how influential Australia’s leading economists were in the 1950s and 1960s as Australia mobilised its industrial and human resources after the second world war.

And in the 1980s, when economic expertise helped drive the modernisation of Australian industry and the internationalisation of the wider economy.

Social scientists across many disciplines have co-created a positive, distinctly Australian approach to anti-discrimination and equal opportunity for women, migrants and the First Australians.

Health economists helped design Australia’s public health insurance system.

Australia’s epidemiologists and visionary public servants, political advisers and ministers spearheaded Australian responses to the HIV-AIDS crisis in the 1980s and 1990s – and that set us up well for Australia’s COVID pandemic response.

Active collaboration between researchers and policymakers has done so much good for the health and living standards of Australians over the years.

Australia’s climate journey

Of course, there is one policy area where Australia’s world-leading researchers have, at times, been disrespected and ignored for ideological and opportunistic reasons, and at great cost to Australia.

I’m speaking, of course, about climate and energy policy, and its implications for industry policy.

Fifty years ago, researchers began referring to ‘global warming’ in scientific journals to describe the effect of carbon emissions on earth’s atmosphere.

And for 40 years at least, policymakers have been deliberating in national and international fora in search of substantial, practical responses.

Australia has everything at stake here.

A failure to lead on the global response would exacerbate all of the agricultural, industrial, public health, strategic and other risks set out in the National Climate Risk Assessment, released last week.

The Treasury modelling, and common sense, ably demonstrate the consequence of policy paralysis or inadequate, stop-start approaches to energy and industrial policy.

And more than any other place on earth, we have most to gain from a low-carbon global economy thanks to our vast solar and wind resources, mineral wealth, proximity to growing markets and strategic partnerships.

As a highly carbon-intensive and trade-oriented economy, Australia was always going to find decarbonisation to be a big challenge.

Early on, Australian governments respected the scientists who were diagnosing the problem as well as the economists and social scientists who were proposing practicable, pragmatic solutions in Australia’s national interest.

The Keating Government put Australia’s signature to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change – showing that Australia was serious about its role in reducing global carbon emissions.

The Howard Government – rarely progressive but usually pragmatic – legislated Australia’s first mandatory renewable energy target and developed plans for an emissions trading scheme.

The Rudd and Gillard Labor Governments moved heaven and earth to find a way through the political quagmire in which good climate and energy policy got stuck after 2009, when an unholy alliance of Coalition and Greens senators scuttled Labor’s emissions trading scheme.

None of those governments got everything right.

But nobody doubted their policy seriousness, their commitment to answering big problems with practical solutions, and their respect for the expert advice of scientists, researchers, the academy and the public service.

As a result, Australia has a range of tools at its disposal - renewable energy and emissions reduction targets, special investment vehicles for clean energy finance and industrial decarbonisation, and strong global partnerships – to draw on in the mission to avoid dangerous levels of warming.

The wasted decade

Of course, Australians know that the strategic leadership and evidence-based approach adopted by earlier governments was not sustained during the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison years.

The Coalition spent nine years in government engaged in an internal contest over climate and energy policy.

The result of those years and that paralysis was 22 discarded climate and energy policies and enormous investment uncertainty.

It seems obvious, but policy stability really matters for attracting the investment to drive big missions like industrial decarbonisation, research and development in energy efficiency and boosting the contribution of renewable energy resources to the Australian grid.

And for the regional Australian communities whose jobs are concentrated in heavy industries, policy stability matters too.

Instead, what we saw was policy chaos leading to corporate underinvestment in new and emerging technologies, including energy generation and infrastructure and new production processes, and in fact disinvestment in nation-building energy projects.

At the same time, Australia became a leading global exporter of LNG and, regrettably, an importer of the world’s volatile and high gas prices.

Taken together, unaffordable energy and domestic underinvestment, along with overcapacity in other markets and disruptions in global trade, have left Australia’s industrial sector in a precarious position.

Industry policy that works

In the face of growing economic and strategic competition, Australia must strengthen its existing industrial infrastructure, not abandon it.

That’s why the Albanese Labor Government has undertaken major and transformational industry policy with the Future Made in Australia agenda, encouraging investment and creating opportunity for Australian firms, workers and regional communities, so that they can share in the benefits of the shift to a low carbon economy.

This is a modern industrial policy framework. It doesn’t start with the premise that traditionally informed industry policy, which was focused upon the economic and social benefit of investment in industrial capability. But it starts, as the Future Made in Australia Act does, with what the national objectives and imperatives are.

For the Future Made in Australia, the two national interest framework principles are, firstly, founded in economic resilience and a security and strategic rationale, and secondly, in establishing Australia’s future competitive and comparative advantages in our mineral resources and low cost future energy capability.

The economic and social outcomes, which will be felt mostly in our outer suburbs and our industrial regions – again, I think of the sterile language of the economists here – as spillover benefits.

That is modern industrial policy – focused on the national interest.

Turning challenge into opportunity for revitalised industries, greater economic complexity, national resilience and good jobs

That’s what modern industrial policy can deliver when it really works.

Let me set out just one industrial and resource opportunity: the iron and steel sector.

Australia should use its vast iron ore resources and renewable energy to manufacture iron here and export value-added iron and steel products to our partners around the world, decarbonising iron and steel industrial processes for our steelmaking partners, and protecting our iron ore exporters from replacement as our customers invest in other mining regions.

The Albanese government is investing $1 billion through the Green Iron Investment Fund to support early movers to establish in Australia.

We’re backing battery manufacturing through the Battery Breakthrough Initiative.

And delivering a long-term capability in aluminium production using renewable energy through the Green Aluminium Production Credit.

In terms of the iron possibilities for Australia, the proposition that we might remove for our steelmaking partners the most emissions-intensive step in global steelmaking (which contributes about 8 per cent to global emissions) and onshore that capability here and protect the future of our iron ore sector – so reducing emissions, protecting the future of our iron ore sector, delivering good jobs, improving Australia’s economic complexity and having a big impact on productivity – that is a nation-building

objective worth fighting for.

That’s what this industrial policy framework is directed towards.

The Albanese Government routinely draws on Australia’s own scientific, economic and strategic expertise – at the CSIRO, at our university campuses, and in this sector, at the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre, and in the private sector – to make sure Australia can become a low-carbon powerhouse for the region and the world.

Change on this scale requires a clear vision for the future, courage, and a willingness take decisions in the present that make that future reachable.

This is not without its challenges. Australia’s old and unreliable coal-power stations and unaffordable gas is putting significant pressure on Australia’s industrial facilities.

For some sectors, abatement technology does not exist or is too expensive.

The Industry Sector Plan that I released with Minister Chris Bowen last week acknowledges these challenges in an honest and forthright way, and lays out a credible path for how industry can invest in new capital to reduce emissions and become more internationally competitive.

The Commonwealth and the states need to build the modern renewable energy grid faster and address the energy market pressures that could stand in the way of a Future Made in Australia.

The work of my colleagues, Minister Bowen and Minister Madeline King, on the Gas Market Review and the National Electricity Market wholesale market settings review, is particularly important.

As is the work of Minister Murray Watt in reforming environmental approvals that will expedite renewable generation and transmission projects, while protecting Australia’s environment.

The new $5 billion Net Zero Fund within the National Reconstruction Fund, announced last week, will be another tool to support Australian heavy industry to increase energy efficiency, become more productive and to decarbonise, as well as encouraging the scale-up of low emissions technology manufacturing.

I look forward to opening consultation on the Fund in a matter of days.

I’m determined to make it work for industry to meet the kind of objectives that I set out a few minutes ago, in heavy industry terms, in new technology terms, and making a real contribution to Australia’s future economic complexity.

Conclusion

In aggregate, these initiatives offer a purposeful agenda for lower emissions, more dynamic and productive industries and a more economically resilient Australia.

This is the core business of government – making choices in the present that enable a better, stronger, fairer and more resilient Australian society.

That’s hard work, and it depends on a huge range of skills and talents, wisdom and expertise, to make it happen.

I am absolutely optimistic – this is an optimistic government – that if Australia’s collective talents are mobilised – and that has to include the talents of our university sector, researchers and policy experts – then Australia will meet the industrial challenge successfully.

​“I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.” Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming.
Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country.
Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability.
Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.","Funding for Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency programs could be cut by more than $42 million next year in an effort to rein in residents’ soaring power bills. That rollback would deprive the state of more than $90 million in benefits and potentially eliminate hundreds of jobs while creating only modest up-front savings, a new analysis finds.

Rhode Island Energy, the utility that administers the state’s energy-efficiency offerings, has proposed to slash spending on that front by 18% compared to last year and more than 30% compared to the budget originally projected in the nonbinding three-year plan introduced in 2023. If approved, the cuts will save the average household $1.87 per month, according to Rhode Island Energy.

The result of these changes, according to climate action nonprofit Acadia Center, would be more expensive electricity and more exposure to volatile natural gas prices in the long run.

“Energy efficiency is a tool for suppressing supply costs, for suppressing infrastructure costs in the long-term,” said Emily Koo, Acadia Center’s program director for Rhode Island and one of the authors of the group’s analysis. ​“I am not seeing our leaders think beyond the immediate.”

Rhode Island has traditionally been a leader in energy-efficiency programming. Over the past 15 years, the state has repeatedly placed among the top 10 states in the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy’s annual energy-efficiency scorecard. Since 2009, the state has spent more than $2 billion on efficiency incentives and services, yielding more than $6 billion in environmental and social benefits.

Now, however, the dynamics of energy markets are creating new obstacles. Nationwide, electricity costs have gone up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year, and gas prices have increased by more than four times the inflation rate. Rhode Island, like other New England states, has the added difficulty of already having some of the highest electricity rates in the country. Add in cold Northeastern winters, and the state is girding for an expensive season ahead.

As in neighboring states, regulators, elected officials, and utilities in Rhode Island are scrambling for ways to provide some relief for residents and businesses. These efforts have increasingly looked to the bill fees that fund renewable energy incentives and energy-efficiency programs as possible targets for quick, if small, bill reductions. In Maine, for example, leaders from both sides of the aisle have sought to lower incentives for customers and community solar developments that send power back to the grid, and in Massachusetts, utility regulators ordered energy-efficiency administrators to cut $500 million from a planned $5 billion three-year budget.

Now, Rhode Island Energy is proposing rollbacks of its own, saying that its latest plan prioritizes customer affordability. The company has the support of the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, which points to the growth in accounts with overdue utility bills to bolster its argument that the changes will provide needed relief to consumers.

“There is simply a financial limit as to how much cost the ratepayers can bear,” the department wrote in its public comments on the proposal.

Advocates, however, say the approach is short-sighted.

“This is weaker. It’s a retreat,” said Larry Chretien, executive director of the nonprofit Green Energy Consumers Alliance, which opposes the proposed cuts. ​“It just feeds into the narrative — that we don’t accept — that ratepayers aren’t seeing benefits from energy efficiency.”

Rhode Island’s energy-efficiency offerings include home energy assessments, weatherization services, rebates on energy-saving appliances and heating and cooling systems, and contractor training. Residents and businesses that take advantage of these programs generally save money by reducing their energy use.

The programs also create savings for the average consumer, whether or not they participate. Because the improvements slow energy consumption, they allow utilities to build less pricey infrastructure, the cost of which is passed on to customers. Efficiency measures can also lower peak demand, reducing the need to buy costlier, dirtier power from peaker plants. In Rhode Island, efficiency programs lowered electricity use 5% between 2005 and 2024; without these interventions, use would have increased 15%, according to an annual state report.

Advocates, therefore, argue that Rhode Island Energy’s plan to shrink energy-efficiency spending won’t actually result in more affordable power in the long run.

“You spend money on energy efficiency or you’re going to spend even more money on power supply,” said Forest Bradley-Wright, state and utility director for the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.

Acadia Center’s analysis also finds that more than 800 jobs in the energy-efficiency sector could be at risk if the cuts are adopted.

The draft plan has been through multiple iterations; the most recent version was released on Sept. 5. The state energy-efficiency council is expected to vote on the proposal at its Sept. 25 meeting. The plan will then go to utility regulators for final approval.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2212482104.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0a863a9da97f5262d36eadbc29f9d0e7,N,,2025-09-22 03:58:56.449398

Eleven of the 20 countries surveyed have increased their plans for fossil fuel production since they were last analysed in 2023.
“We are in the foothills of an energy transition that is going to reshape fossil fuel demand,” said Grant.","Governments around the world are ramping up coal, gas and oil extraction which will put climate goals beyond reach, new data has shown.

Far from reducing reliance on fossil fuels, nations are planning higher levels of fossil fuel production for the coming decades than they did in 2023, the last time comparable data was compiled.

This increase goes against the commitments that countries have made at UN climate summits to “transition away from fossil fuels” and phase down production, particularly of coal.

If all of the planned new extraction takes place, the world will produce more than double the quantity of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with holding global temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.

Emily Ghosh, a programme director at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) in the US, said: “Fossil fuel production should have peaked and started to fall. Every year of delay [to the peak and rapid fall required] significantly increases the pressure [on the climate].”

She said an urgent “course correction” from governments was needed, but the current and planned overproduction of fossil fuels meant the world was burning through its remaining “carbon budget” – the amount that can be emitted without permanently exceeding the 1.5C threshold – at a rapid rate.

The Production Gap 2025 report, from the SEI, the Climate Analytics thinktank and the International Institute for Sustainable Development, analysed 20 major producers of fossil fuels around the world, including the US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China, Canada, Brazil, Australia and the UK, together representing about 80% of global fossil fuel production.

Only the UK, Australia and Norway plan to reduce production of oil and gas by 2030, compared with 2023 levels. Eleven of the 20 countries surveyed have increased their plans for fossil fuel production since they were last analysed in 2023.

Several countries are planning at least to cut coal production, including China, the US, Germany and Indonesia. But India, Russia, Colombia and Australia will ramp up their mining.

Demand for fossil fuels is also key – countries must pursue renewable energy and use energy more efficiently to obviate the need for new oil, gas and coal production. Neil Grant, of Climate Analytics, said: “So far, renewable energy growth has been an addition, alongside fossil fuel demand, and we haven’t seen peak demand. But given the pace of change in the energy system that could change quite significantly.”

As transport, heating and other functions become electrified, less primary energy is needed, as electrification is much more efficient. But less demand for fossil fuels could also make them cheaper, spurring a rebound effect.

“We are in the foothills of an energy transition that is going to reshape fossil fuel demand,” said Grant. “But many governments are thinking in terms of a world where the energy transition happens very incrementally. There’s a lot of danger, [including that] the voice of the fossil fuel lobby only gets louder and holds us back from this change to a cleaner, better, greener economy. That would lead to climate chaos or significant negative economic impacts.”

All countries agreed at the Cop26 UN climate meeting in 2021 to “phase down” coal. The original commitment was to “phase out”, though without a timeline, but a last-minute intervention by China and India resulted in the weaker language being accepted.

At the Cop28 summit in Dubai in 2023, countries agreed to “transition away from fossil fuels”, though without specifying what this would mean in practice.

Derik Broekhoff, the lead author of the report published on Monday, said: “In 2023, governments formally acknowledged the need to move away from fossil fuels to mitigate climate change. But as our report makes clear, while many countries have committed to a clean energy transition, many others appear to be stuck using a fossil-fuel-dependent playbook, planning even more production than they were two years ago.”

The Production Gap 2025 report comes as world leaders prepare to meet the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, in New York this week on the sidelines of the UN general assembly.

Guterres will urge countries to come up with fresh commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ahead of the Cop30 summit in Brazil this November. Under the 2015 Paris agreement, governments must submit new national plans this year setting out their plans to 2035.

But the UN’s climate chief, Simon Stiell, has already told the Guardian that the national plans would be inadequate to keep the world within the 1.5C limit. Instead, the UN is hoping that countries will agree ways to strengthen their commitments in future and to bring other forces, such as private sector investment, to bear.

On Monday, a separate report from the Industrial Transition Accelerator estimated that of more than 700 low-carbon industrial installations in planning and development around the world, only 15 a year were gaining the finance necessary to go into full production. This represented a $1.6tn (£1.2tn) opportunity for investors, the group said.

“To keep the 1.5C goal in reach, the world needs rapid reductions in coal, oil and gas investments, redirecting those resources towards an energy transition that prioritises equity and justice,” said Ghosh. “Governments must commit to expand renewables, phase out fossil fuels, manage energy demands and implement community-centred energy transitions.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0520a9a0c8854327786deba4c661621fa617df8/707_0_7108_5686/master/7108.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=912c0142c0789f188d5bcb66da890cfe",N,,2025-09-22 03:59:00.779398

🌱 What is a Power Purchase Agreement?

A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a long-term contract between a power producer and a buyer for the purchase of electricity. Often referred to as Green Power Purchase Agreements (Green PPAs), these agreements typically last between 5 to 20 years.

Under a PPA, developers sell electricity at a fixed rate, usually lower than utility retail prices, providing cost stability and clean energy benefits to buyers. The agreement ensures that developers earn revenue not only from electricity sales but also from tax credits and renewable incentives.

At the end of the PPA term, customers often have the option to extend the agreement or purchase the renewable system outright.

🔑 Key Findings of the Study

As a key raw material for lithium-ion batteries, lithium prices are closely tied to the dynamics of the EV industry. In 2022, battery-grade lithium carbonate prices in China hit a record high due to expectations of explosive demand, but subsequently experienced a sharp correction. Although prices recently saw a short-lived rebound driven by supply concerns from Chinese mines, the overall market remains oversupplied.

However, amid widespread pessimism toward the lithium sector, contrarian investing thinking reminds us that the most profound opportunities often emerge during the coldest winters. Investing in lithium stocks is not based on short-term price movements but on a deep understanding of several core logics.

First, the underlying trend of energy transition is irreversible. The carbon neutrality goals set by major global economies are not short-term policies but represent a fundamental transformation of the energy structure over the coming decades. Despite short-term challenges such as slowing growth in the EV industry and insufficient charging infrastructure, the long-term shift from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs remains unchanged. The current industry downturn will likely weed out weaker players, paving the way for healthier future development.

At the same time, supply-side consolidation is inevitable. Current low prices are putting significant pressure on high-cost producers and will continue to do so. When prices remain below cash costs for an extended period, mines will be forced to halt production, undergo maintenance, or shut down, while financing and construction of new projects will face delays. This process will effectively reduce supply, creating conditions for the next rebalancing of supply and demand. Investing in industry leaders with low costs and strong financials during this period is akin to being greedy when others are fearful.

Based on this analysis, the following lithium stocks and ETFs are worth watching:

1. Industry Leader: Albemarle (ALB)

As one of the world’s largest lithium producers, Albemarle strengthens its industry position with a global presence across six continents and a vertically integrated business model (covering mining, refining, and purification). Long-term contracts effectively hedge against lithium price volatility, while its bromine and catalyst businesses provide diversified revenue streams. Recently, the company has accelerated its strategic moves: two lithium processing capacity expansion projects are in their final stages, and it has announced a new lithium conversion facility in the southeastern U.S. with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons (expected to be operational by the end of 2029).

2. Automaker-Backed Strategy: Livent (LTHM)

Livent, with its core expertise in battery-grade lithium hydroxide, has secured a six-year supply agreement with General Motors (GM) starting in 2025 and plans to relocate all its downstream production lines to North America. A €285 million lithium supply agreement with the BMW Group further solidifies its demand outlook. To meet surging demand, the company is tripling its lithium carbonate capacity in Argentina and expanding lithium hydroxide production across multiple global locations. Capacity expansion and long-term contracts form a solid foundation for growth.

3. Technology Innovator: Standard Lithium (SLI)

The company leverages its 150,000-acre Smackover project in Arkansas and the Bristol Lake project in California, adopting revolutionary LiSTR Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology to significantly improve recovery rates and reduce environmental impact. Its partnership with Norwegian energy giant Equinor provides financial security, while recent collaboration with Telescope Innovations on carbon reduction technology promotes greener production processes.

4. Resource Giant: Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (SQM)

With its resources in the Atacama Salt Flat, SQM remains the world’s largest lithium producer. The company plans to increase its production capacity to 230,000 tons by 2025, including a $490 million investment to build the world’s largest lithium refinery. Recent lithium hydroxide supply agreements with Hyundai-Kia and a joint venture with Chile’s state-owned copper producer Codelco (extending through 2060) highlight its strategic positioning.

As the knowledge partner for the ICC Global Business Summit 2025, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) contributed to the Green Tech & Energy Forum, emphasizing the critical link between India’s clean energy goals and its workforce.

The forum’s opening address by Mr Anil Razdan, former Secretary at the Ministry of Power, underscored the urgent need to mitigate global warming. He highlighted that this is the era of chemical engineers and innovators who must solve complex challenges and stressed the need for global collaboration to train both current and future generations in emerging technologies.

Mr AK Saxena, Senior Director at TERI, reinforced this message by pointing to the “twin drivers” of demand-pull and knowledge-push in technology development. He stressed the importance of aligning India’s human capital with its clean energy ambitions.

In this context, TERI has released a knowledge paper, “Emerging Energy Technologies and Workforce Transformation in India.” The paper outlines key technology trends, market trajectories, and skill gaps, proposing a strategic roadmap to align the nation’s workforce with its clean energy future.

Context

India’s transition to a clean, resilient economy by 2047 depends not just on technology but on a skilled workforce. Rapid advancements in sectors like green hydrogen, semiconductors, and AI are facing a significant constraint: a talent shortage that could slow down progress.

Technology and Market Landscape

Green Hydrogen: India targets 5 MMT per annum by 2030, backed by ₹19,744 crore under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Electrolyser manufacturing is scaling, with tenders breaking the ₹50/kg green ammonia barrier. The challenge is cost competitiveness and creating skilled talent for stack engineering, hydrogen safety, and compression-logistics.

Waste-to-Energy: Installed capacity has nearly doubled since 2020, but at ~855 MW remains only 15 per cent of potential. Projects are challenged by poor waste segregation, public acceptance, and shortage of plant-ready operators. Policy reforms, PPPs, and better training can unlock urban waste’s 5,690 MW energy potential.

Semiconductors: The $10 billion India Semiconductor Mission has attracted multiple fab and ATMP proposals. Micron’s $2.75 billion facility is a milestone, but fewer than 200 professionals in India have fab experience, making workforce development urgent.

AI & Data Centres: Data centre capacity is projected to grow 6–7× by 2030, with $14 billion in committed investment. AI adoption can cut renewable forecasting errors by 20–30 per cent, but a shortage of grid-AI engineers, MLOps specialists, and critical-environment technicians is a significant risk.

Skill Gap and Workforce Imperatives

Current workforce readiness is inadequate: over 65 % of new clean-energy roles require re-skilling, yet formal vocational training reaches only 4 % of India’s labour force. Semiconductor fabs, hydrogen hubs, and AI-driven grid projects face project delays if talent gaps persist. Key roles identified include electrolyser stack engineers, CBG process operators, cleanroom technicians, and grid-AI engineers. Demand for many of these roles is projected to more than double by 2030, underscoring the need for immediate action on curricula, apprenticeships, and certification pathways.

Strategic Roadmap

The report recommends integrating human capital development into every mission and incentive programme. The roadmap proposes:

Integrated Planning: Workforce annexes specifying role counts and training targets for every major project.

Certification First: Nationally recognised, vendor-validated credentials to make skills portable and trusted.

Practice-Focused Training: Labs, simulators, and plant residencies to shorten time from training to deployment.

Demand Aggregation: Industry clusters to publish 3–5-year hiring forecasts to guide academic capacity planning.

Enablers and Outcomes

Four system-level enablers are critical:

Workforce mandates embedded in tenders

Outcome-linked funding tied to placement rates

A national skills dashboard for real-time visibility

Faculty and trainer development through industry sabbaticals

If implemented, this strategy could deliver higher placement rates, higher productivity across assets, and an exportable pool of skilled professionals, turning India’s demographic dividend into a competitive advantage in the global clean energy economy.

For several decades, Congress has been gridlocked on environmental health protections, while lobbying and lawsuits have halted most regulatory actions.
RFK Jr. talks a good game about “making America healthy again.” But governors and state legislators are actually getting it done.
She is the author of the forthcoming book A Healthy Union: How States Can Lead on Environmental Health.","Some of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s plans to improve the nation’s health are based on solid evidence. His observation about children’s increased rates of chronic disease is correct, as are some of the likely contributors he points to, such as pesticides and microplastics.

However, the Health and Human Services secretary appears unable or unwilling to implement plans to address that issue. While he previously criticized the country’s “chemical-industrial agriculture” model, RFK Jr. has not proposed actions to reduce pesticides in food. In fact, he recently gave assurances to industry representatives that backpedaled on his past statements. And the Environmental Protection Agency, which has the primary authority to reduce pesticide use, has been approving new pesticides and aiming to bring back others that had been banned or restricted, like dicamba.

But policymakers at the state level aren’t waiting for federal action. Across a wide political spectrum, lawmakers — shored up by concerned parents — are making significant progress.

The National Caucus of Environmental Legislators reports, for example, that so far in 2025 lawmakers in 37 states — from Alabama to Iowa to New Jersey — have proposed legislation aimed at reducing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Added to items from cookware to firefighting foam and known as “forever chemicals” due to their persistence in the environment, PFAS are linked with a range of serious health problems.

There are many more examples of state action across the country and across political perspectives. Arkansas, for instance, now requires warning labels on hair relaxer products that contain certain toxic chemicals.

This action at the state level is not new. For several decades, Congress has been gridlocked on environmental health protections, while lobbying and lawsuits have halted most regulatory actions. To fill these gaps, some statehouses have taken up the slack — and this pattern is growing.

State-led efforts have appeal across the political spectrum. For those who dislike federal intrusion into local matters, this movement prioritizes the preferences of states’ residents. For those troubled by the inadequacy of federal protections, state action offers an alternate route to protecting communities from pollution and toxic chemicals.

States that are starting to take steps in this direction can learn from successful policies elsewhere. When it comes to protecting children from pesticides, Texas was already in the lead, with a farsighted law that requires every school district to implement policies and practices to reduce pesticide use. It girds this mandate with extensive education, technical assistance and enforcement.

Massachusetts’ Toxics Use Reduction Act requires industrial facilities that manufacture, process or otherwise use certain toxic chemicals to report their use and develop strategies to reduce harm. As with Texas’ pesticide law, a partnership among state agencies, a university and industry ensures that the latest know-how is developed and applied.

State efforts to protect their residents’ health are by no means limited to regulating harmful chemicals. In Tennessee, representatives of 24 state agencies, departments and commissions that impact health — from environment, conservation and agriculture to education and human services — meet regularly to get to know each other’s work and identify opportunities for collaboration.

A leading example of what is known as “health in all policies,“ Tennessee’s effort breaks down silos that are often found in government. Cross-departmental collaboration aims to coordinate services for food, housing and transit. Transportation staff work with health officials, so opportunities for safe walking and bicycling are included in road planning.

Regional efforts are on the rise too. When a group of states that share climate and culture join forces, they can accomplish more than they can singly. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states has successfully reduced warming emissions through a structure in which participants share resources, achieving greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. And the Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability brings together environmental and military officials from six states to sustain both natural resources and national defense assets in the region. The program has leveraged private funding to protect and restore more than 1.3 million acres of land while preserving mission-critical infrastructure and capabilities.

Many of these best-practice policies have been evaluated, so information on outcomes and lessons learned is available. Common contributors to successful state initiatives include environmental health education and analyses that examine a broad range of costs and benefits of policies.

RFK Jr. talks a good game about “making America healthy again.” But governors and state legislators are actually getting it done.

BARCELONA (Reuters) -When Javier Hernandez went car shopping in Barcelona, he ended up choosing a plug-in hybrid by China’s BYD – swayed by a price nearly 10,000 euros cheaper than European rivals.

The 51-year-old Spanish excavator operator wanted something cheap and versatile for city drives and trips to the Catalan mountains, but had doubts about Chinese electrified cars as he didn’t know the brands well.

With government subsidies, the BYD Seal U DM-I Hernandez opted for starts at around 30,000 euros ($35,289) in Spain, compared to over 40,000 euros for VW’s Tiguan and Peugeot’s 3008 plug-in hybrid models.

“The value for money was better, I tried it out and they could give it to me right away,” he told Reuters.

CHEAPER CARS, MORE DEALERSHIPS

Cost-conscious buyers like Hernandez are fuelling rapid growth for Chinese EV carmakers like BYD in Spain and around Europe, stepping up competition with regional and U.S. rivals like Tesla, Stellantis and Volkswagen.

“Until the arrival of BYD, if you wanted to buy an electric vehicle, you had to spend a hell of a lot of money,” BYD country manager for Spain and Portugal Alberto De Aza told Reuters.

BYD’s Spanish dealership network has nearly quadrupled to almost 100 dealers from 25 last year, De Aza said, accompanied by aggressive marketing and discounts.

Meanwhile, most established car brands have closed dealerships. Data from Faconauto shows legacy brands had 1,648 dealerships in 2024, down from 2,164 a decade ago. Volkswagen and Audi dealerships fell 40% in that period.

“Chinese competitors are increasing the pressure, and not just on us,” Markus Haupt, interim CEO of Volkswagen-owned SEAT told Reuters last week.

CHINESE EV SURGE IN MARKET SHARE

BYD’s share of Spain’s EV market, including fully-electric models and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), climbed to more than 10% in Spain in July despite EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. That’s more than double its European average and three times Tesla’s 3.3%.

Its share of Spain’s total car market has risen to 1.8% through August from 0.3% last year, surpassing brands like Stellantis’ Jeep or Volvo, data by industry group ANFAC shows. The Seal U is Spain’s most popular plug-in hybrid so far this year.

Still, it trails behind top selling brands like Toyota, Renault and Volkswagen.

SPAIN: A GATEWAY FOR EXPANSION

Spain’s lack of a national automotive champion makes it fertile ground for Chinese expansion, analysts say.

“It doesn’t have a strong local carmaker,” said Felipe Munoz, analyst at JATO Dynamics, adding that SEAT had lost some of its Spanish identity having been bought by Germany’s VW and looked the most exposed.

SEAT’s sales are up 4% so far this year, underperforming the broader Spanish market which rose 15%, ANFAC data shows. SEAT’s sister brand, up-market Cupra slightly outperformed, with sales up 17%.

Sales of Chinese cars are growing faster. SAIC-owned MG was up 58%, while Chery’s Omoda more than doubled its sales in Spain year-on-year through August. BYD sales were up 675% through August to over 14,000 cars.

BYD EYES EUROPEAN PRODUCTION

With cutthroat competition in their domestic market, Chinese brands are increasingly targeting Europe.

BYD aims to produce all EVs for sale in Europe locally within three years and is building a plant in Hungary. Spain could be an ideal location for further expansion thanks to its industrial infrastructure and cheap electricity, said De Aza.

Still, challenges remain.

Combined battery-electric and plug-in hybrid sales in Spain made up 21% of total car sales in July versus 10% in August last year, but below the European average of 27%.

Insufficient charging infrastructure has caused slower-than-expected EV uptake in many European markets, especially in the south. Spain has some 50,000 charging points, a third of the number in the Netherlands despite a far larger population.

For now, Spanish motorists much prefer hybrids and PHEVs, which are central to BYD’s European expansion plans.

One of them is Juan Gonzalez, a 56-year-old head of an IT department who has solar panels that could charge any EV model, but bought a BYD plug-in hybrid because he worried about longer journeys.

“If you run out of battery and you have to tackle a mountain pass you’re really in trouble,” he said.

But I wanted to tell all of you about how Sun Day played out across the country today before I fell into bed. In a word, spectacular.

You know, from reading these missives, that this day has been in the works a long time; we needed, in the face of massive and bizarre attacks from the White House and Congress on sun and windpower, to stand up for the idea of cheap, clean energy. At nearly five hundred events across the country, that’s what happened. From one corner of the continent to the other (still waiting for pictures to come in from Alaska and Hawaii) Americans figured out dozens of ways to make their hopes for the future felt, even in this darkest of political periods. A remarkable account in the New York Times quoted one organizer, summing it up beautifully:

“I really wanted it to be celebratory and uplifting,” said Laura Iwanaga, who led the organization for Portland’s Sun Day event for the local chapter of Third Act, a nationwide climate advocacy organization founded by Mr. McKibben. “We all know what we’re fighting against but we don’t always think about what we’re fighting for.”

For me, the very first picture of the day came from my grandson, out to greet the rising sun.

Soon they were pouring in from events across the country. Many featured big crowds and important people: I was in New York, where people crammed into a downtown church to hear the city’s comptroller Brad Lander talk about deploying the city’s $300 billion pension fund to back clean energy

and then spilled out into a nearby park for speeches from a U.S. Senator (Peter Welch), the state’s remarkable lieutenant governor (Antonio Delgado), a state assemblywoman (Emily Gallagher), and the ever-present and ever-powerful Rev. Lennox Yearwood. Oh, and a unforgettable rendition of Here Comes the Sun from Sun Day musical ambassador Antonique Smith

Those were powerful memories that will last my life. But I was also taken by the pictures that showed quieter moments—for instance, people huddled in basements so that they could see their neighbor’s heat pumps or solar inverters, demystifying the whole process of converting to clean power. This is from South Carolina—and it’s how we’re going to turn people into solar consumers across the country.

And here are Wisconsites setting out on a solar tour of the state’s capital

Some of the images were spectacularly beautiful. Christal Brown choreographed a dance among the solar panels on the campus of Middlebury College.

And some were literally sweet—here’s someone making s’mores in a solar oven in San Leandro California

Everywhere the beauty of the logo (thanks Brian Collins, Beth Johnson, Eron Lutterman) was on display. (Oh, and read the account of its design from Fast Company)

So many people and organizations helped make the day happen: Fossil Free Media, of course, with Jamie Henn and Deirdre Shelly leading an amazing crew; Solar United Neighbors, the Sierra Club, Mothers Out Front, Climate Revival, Green Faith, Dayenu, a hundred more. My colleagues at Third Act were absolutely crucial: here’s Deborah Moore and Anna Goldstein, who worked around the clock

But everywhere there were kids out enjoying the spectacle. Our great hope is that they’ll grow up in a world where it seems utterly obvious to power the planet with clean energy from the sun, instead of filling the air (and their lungs) with the smoke from humanity’s fires.

For a day it was possible to believe in all of that—and the human energy that belief unleashes allows us to make it happen. Even as the afternoon went on I was hearing of plans to introduce balcony solar laws in half a dozen states (and of plans to take this day global in the years ahead). In some sense the work has just begun

I’ll have many more images and reports in the days ahead—we’ve barely begun to sift through all that’s been pouring in these last hours. But time for a well-earned rest (and I have an early morning trip to Chicago—the beat goes on!). As the sun goes down (and the batteries that have been soaking up sunshine all afternoon kick in) I just want to say: Thank you all so very very much

+Wildfire smoke in America is now killing 40,000 people a year, more than car crashes. As the Washington Post reports:

“Those are huge numbers,” said Minghao Qiu, assistant professor at Stony Brook University and lead author of the paper published Thursday in the journal Nature. “This is one of the most costly and important climate impacts in the U.S.”

Between 2006 and 2019, the average cumulative smoke exposure across the country each year hovered around 100 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic meter of air, according to a preprint paper by the same author group that has yet to undergo peer review. But since 2020, Americans have increasingly been bombarded by toxic smoke. In 2023, when a sickly orange glow filled the skies of New York City and other East Coast metropolises, Americans experienced levels eight times higher. The years 2020 through 2024 have been the most extreme smoke years on record.

+New York’s utility regulator has endorsed a new gas pipeline across the Empire State—the residue of a deal by governor Kathy Hochul with Donald Trump

“This is not how you stand up for New York ratepayers, let alone our children and grandchildren who will be saddled with the true cost of this folly,” said state Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who opposes the project.

The pipeline would run under New York Harbor and connect to natural gas infrastructure that’s already in place off the coast of Queens.

A sardonic ad takes on the governor’s trademark weakness

+A big new campaign for public renewable power is underway across the country. Advocates argue that

Traditional for-profit models of renewable energy development are not moving fast enough.

By adding public renewable energy developers, states and cities can accelerate the transition, build projects that otherwise would not get built, cut costs for schools communities, and deploy resources at the scale needed to meet our climate goals.

An early project: a case study on how public power projects have made Connecticut the leader in school rooftop solar.

+Germany’s largest agrivoltaic project has come online. As Sandra Enkhardt reports:

For livestock farming, six mobile chicken coops, each housing up to 2,500 chickens, are planned. A conventional four-crop rotation is also foreseen for arable land. Vattenfall said the modules are mounted on a longitudinal axis and can tilt east-west from a horizontal position. Wider spacing between rows allows access for agricultural machinery.

+Tax credits for EVs are ending in America in ten days time, ten years ahead of schedule (thanks GOP Congress!). But automakers have a plan: much cheaper EV pickup trucks are coming soon, from a start up called Slate, and from Ford. As Kyle Stock explains,

A decade ago, someone in the market for a new car with less than $25,000 to spend, had 43 different models to choose from. Today, there are five, according to Cox Automotive. None is electric.

But stalwarts like Ford Motor Co. and startups like Slate Auto are looking to change that, and they’re focusing on Americans’ favorite vehicle: the pickup.

With President Donald Trump’s tax bill killing EV incentives at the end of the month, the push for a sub-$30,000 vehicle that runs on electrons may help buttress the projected dip in sales.

+Amidst the joy of today’s celebrations, a really sad note. Global Witness just released its annual report on the environmental defenders killed in the past year. I got to lead the ceremony for these dead a few years ago; every year the numbers remind me not to feel sorry for myself, even in newly repressive America. It could be worse.

Last year, 146 people were murdered or disappeared for doing this work.

We acknowledge that the names of many defenders who were killed or disappeared last year may be missing and we may never know how many more gave their lives to protect our planet. We honour their work too.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute.
There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.
His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.
""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says.","The world is producing too much coal, oil and natural gas to meet the targets set 10 years ago under the Paris Agreement, in which countries agreed to limit climate pollution and avoid the worst effects of global warming.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office. His administration has proposed a series of policy changes, including repealing climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, reversing a 2009 finding that climate pollution harms people and eliminating climate pollution limits on vehicles.

The top U.S. environmental regulator has touted the administration's efforts to roll back plans to address climate change.

""We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,"" Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency said in March, when he announced rollbacks.

Grant says Trump's effect on the world's climate efforts will depend on whether other countries choose to follow the President's lead.

""We saw in 2016 to 2020 that Trump tried to kill climate action and tried to kill the Paris Agreement,"" Grant says. ""He hasn't succeeded. I'm confident that he won't succeed again.""

And for now, most countries are sticking with their commitments to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, even if this report shows they're not on track to do that. The authors of this report say achieving that now will require an even steeper decline in fossil fuel production and use in the future.

Ben Hulac: The short answer, the technical answer is Republicans were looking for ways to pay for their broader tax breaks for corporations.
Remember, Congress is in charge of writing tax law and administrations carry out tax law.
But also, I should mention a commercial scale solar tax credit will be phased out next summer.
And that was also a Biden-era tax credit that was going to go for about a decade.","Homeowners in New Jersey and beyond are rushing to install solar panels on their rooftops in order to qualify for a federal tax credit that expires at the end of the year.

Congress zeroed out that tax credit, which covers 30% of a new residential solar project, as part of a broader Republican budget law.

The loss of that federal incentive is one several threats facing the domestic solar industry, as our correspondent in Washington, Ben Hulac, explains. This interview has been excerpted and lightly edited.

Briana Vannozzi, anchor: So, Ben, this tax credit was supposed to last until 2032. Why then did Congress decide to cut it nearly a decade short?

Ben Hulac: The short answer, the technical answer is Republicans were looking for ways to pay for their broader tax breaks for corporations. This was part, if we remember back to the summer, there was a lot of debate here on the Hill about how to pass and how to pay for this massive trillion dollar bill now law.

And this was an item that Republicans wanted. So they essentially went through lots of Biden-era tax breaks for renewables, for wind, for solar, and phased them out early in order to pay for their broader package.

BV: So I know you write, you report that demand has just gone through the roof. This really lit a fire under people. What does that looked like on the ground? I mean, how many people are actually calling and requesting quotes? And we should note this is, you know, really for residential homes.

BH: Right. So I talked with two people I mentioned Lyle Rawlings, who’s a business owner owns his own solar company. And he said salespeople are just swamped. And then I talked to a woman named Emily Walker, who works for a company called EnergySage. And EnergySage crunches data and numbers about solar demand. Their numbers show that just within New Jersey, from June to July, people requesting quotes for what it would cost to put solar on their homes, which skyrocketed 109%.

So that’s a huge jump. And that coincides with Congress debating this broader law. So the interest. And New Jersey is not an outlier in this. There is a race nationwide. If you are interested in putting solar on your home, you are pedal to the metal now.

BV: Yeah, 109% that’s significant. I mean, okay, if I’m a homeowner and I want to get this installed connected before the deadline, is that even possible? And what do I need to know then?

BH: Right. It is possible. You should probably do it now. And I actually talked with a solar advocate in Philadelphia, a woman named Elowyn Corby with a solar advocacy group called Vote Solar. And this is what she said.

Elowyn Corby: If you’re interested in going solar, you should start soon. The process of getting solar is much more than the, you know, two or three days it can take to put the actual solar on your roof. It includes permitting. It includes a number of logistical steps that I would recommend not rushing. You also want to make sure that you’re taking the time to make sure you’re working with a reputable installer, someone who you trust, someone who’s done a lot of work in the community. So start now because there can be more steps than, you know, starting five days before the deadline isn’t going to work out the way you hope it will.

BV: Yeah. And so, Ben, then what happens if someone is not connected in time for the deadline?

BH: If someone is not connected, then they are likely out this tax credit, which on average could defray about $9,000 worth of the cost. So it costs tens of thousands of dollars to install panels on your home. That’s a ballpark figure. Maybe about $30,000 is a good sort of rule of thumb. This $9,000 chunk of that money could be massive and could mean the difference between someone saying, yes, I’d like to take this plunge and go solar and try to maybe in theory, go off the grid and be my own little electrical island. Or going back and canceling those plans. So it’s a big deal.

BV: How does all of this play into the broader energy policy that we’re seeing from the White House and also some retroactive tariffs that could really impact the industry, as you note? How does this all play together?

BH: The tenor on science and on renewables out of this administration has been extremely aggressive and negative. The energy secretary actually recently assembled an anti-climate science report that purported to debunk well-established climate science that is of course, not true. Humans are warming the planet by burning fossil fuels oil, coal and gas. But this is this is sort of one tendril.

This solar, this anti-solar approach, this one tendril out of Congress, out of the Republican-led administration to slow efforts to clean up the power grid, to decarbonize the broader U.S. energy system. I would say it just it fits the pattern in a lot of ways and a lot of the money. Remember, Congress is in charge of writing tax law and administrations carry out tax law. But this cut that we’ve been talking about, Bri, is just one of many that this Congress has doled out so far.

BV: Yeah. And I wonder just about the long term impact here. What did some of the advocates say who you spoke with about how this affects the industry in the long term and maybe even some of these policies in the long term, you know, the appetite for it all?

BH: Right. It’s really put a damper on the appetite. There is a lot of frenetic energy in this moment to get people hooked up to the grid, to get people on solar before the year is out. But also, I should mention a commercial scale solar tax credit will be phased out next summer. And that was also a Biden-era tax credit that was going to go for about a decade.

Now, they’re nine years roughly short of that original target. And so people are scrambling on the commercial solar side as well. And then, of course, we haven’t really delved into this, but tariffs are another massive sort of ax hanging over this industry. The administration has floated retroactive tariffs, which would be extremely destabilizing for the industry and could go back two years and charge importers on what is already on U.S. shores.

A new report, led by the nonprofit research group Stockholm Environment Institute, shows countries plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

The 2025 Production Gap Report comes as countries are submitting their nationally determined contributions, ahead of the annual United Nations climate conference in November in Belém, Brazil. NDCs are meant to show the progress countries are making toward the Paris Agreement goals of dramatically reducing the human sources of greenhouse gases that are heating the planet.

The SEI report shows the 20 most polluting countries, including China, the U.S. and India, actually plan to produce even more fossil fuels than they did two years ago, when the report was last updated.

""In particular, the near-term gap has increased with projected 2030 production exceeding levels consistent with 1.5 degrees [Celsius] by more than 120%, up from 110% in 2023,"" Derik Broekhoff, senior scientist at SEI and report co-author, said on a call with reporters.

China is driving much of the increase, according to the report, because it now plans to reduce coal production more slowly through 2030 than it did in the 2023 Production Gap Report. ""And China, because it represents over half of total global coal production, drives a lot of those numbers,"" Broekhoff says. Among fossil fuels, coal is the dirtiest in terms of climate pollution.

""The reality is stark,"" says Melanie Robinson, global climate director at the World Resources Institute. During a recent presentation, she said countries reviewed their progress at the 2023 UN climate meeting in Dubai and found they need to move away from fossil fuels, triple renewables, double energy efficiency, end deforestation and cut transportation pollution. ""And this wasn't a wish list — it's a to-do list. Countries pledged to it in Dubai, so now it is time to deliver,"" she says.

This report doesn't take into account Trump administration policies that are aimed at boosting U.S. fossil fuel production and limiting cleaner sources of electricity, such as wind and solar. It's based on data collected when President Biden was in office.

While Trump's flurry of executive orders and regulation changes are altering the country's climate and energy policies, those changes won't happen quickly. There are still state and local policies focused on the Paris Agreement goals and investments that companies have already made under laws passed during the Biden administration.

""The level of impact that the Trump administration is able to have on global climate is still an open question,"" says Neil Grant, analyst at Climate Analytics and co-author of the report.

Trump has already started the process to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, something he did during his first term in office.

NJ utility bills spike, fueling voter backlash and concern

Author urges lawmakers to balance cost, reliability, environment

Natural gas remains critical to grid stability and demand, writer says

Calls for investment in modern energy infrastructure

Lawmakers are looking for answers in the face of recent increases to electric utility bills. With already high living costs, the public response to these increases has come in the form of a swift and justified backlash. And not surprisingly, this complex and multifaceted issue – which requires a balancing of cost, reliability and the environment – is center stage in the gubernatorial election.

The outcome of the most recent annual regional capacity market auction sent a clear message: demand is rising, supply is lagging, and the consequences are significant and impact everyone. And the time is now to reexamine the state’s energy policies to make certain they are consistent and keeping pace with the needs of the state and its residents.

Key to any honest energy discussion is the observation that demand for energy is going up. This requires more power from more sources and the avoidance of prematurely retiring energy sources – especially natural gas – without viable, scalable replacements.

It goes without debate that a robust, well-functioning and reliable power system is essential to the health, safety, and prosperity at both the state and federal levels. Accordingly, the state and region need the right combination of resources – power plants and energy efficiency as well as accompanying infrastructure – to ensure reliability, particularly when demand is most significant and pronounced during heat waves and cold snaps.

We must prioritize investment in transmission and delivery infrastructure. The best mix of energy sources is only as strong as the grid that carries it. That means removing unnecessary regulatory roadblocks, upgrading aging systems and building with the future in mind. Without a robust and flexible grid, even the most ambitious clean energy goals will fall short.

Right now, about 72% of New Jersey households rely on natural gas as their primary heating fuel and 17% use electricity for space heating. Additionally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, almost half of the power consumed is derived from natural gas.

This isn’t about turning our backs on alternative energy sources, rather, it’s about complementing them. Natural gas isn’t the enemy of renewable power, it’s an ally. It provides crucial backup to intermittent resources. Natural gas plants can ramp up quickly to meet sudden spikes in demand, something renewables, for all their promise, cannot yet do consistently or reliably on their own. That flexibility is essential for managing cold snaps, heatwaves and periods of rapid economic growth.

This isn’t about turning our backs on alternative energy sources, rather, it’s about complementing them.

Having an approach that takes advantage of all energy sources doesn’t just help stabilize electric prices and strengthen reliability, it also supports thousands of good-paying union jobs, keeps our manufacturing sector competitive, and helps ensure that major employers like hospitals and tech firms don’t start looking elsewhere for more dependable energy solutions.

The next governor should promote a diverse and reliable energy mix and have policies that support carbon reduction through innovation and infrastructure, not through mandates that ignore economic and logistical realities. Leadership doesn’t mean pretending we can leap to a zero-carbon future overnight, rather it means creating a clear, achievable roadmap that protects our environment while also protecting ratepayers and preserving our economic competitiveness.

Energy policy doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. We can support all types of energy sources including the vital role conventional fuels play in our current system. To do otherwise we risk failing on all three fronts: the environment, grid reliability, and price.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/09/Electric-Bill-illustration.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 00:58:41.278712

It’s only been a few months since the Trump administration and lawmakers like Missouri Senator Josh Hawley succeeded in derailing the Grain Belt Express, a high-voltage transmission line that would have brought clean energy to much of the upper Midwest. It’s not clear whether the project will go forward, but it’s already clear that people will pay more for electricity as a result—and nowhere is that more clear than in Missouri.

The Grain Belt Express would have carried 5,000 megawatts of wind power from Kansas across Missouri and Illinois into Indiana. The 1,280-kilometre project, slated to cost $11 billion and scheduled to begin construction next year, has drawn fire from critics—whose opposition includes its use of eminent domain to cross private property—and has been the target of Republican opponents like Hawley for well over a decade.

After years of lawsuits, regulatory review, and political battles in the Show-Me State, Invenergy, the nation’s largest privately-held clean energy supplier, received state approval from Kansas and Missouri in 2019. It began acquiring access to land as similar work proceeded elsewhere along the route. In March, Andrew Bailey, who was until recently Missouri’s attorney general, urged Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to cancel the loan. He called the Grain Belt Express a project by “far-left deep staters” dedicated to undermining farmers.

Bailey opened an investigation into the project in July, alleging that Invenergy had overstated its economic benefits, and called on the state Public Service Commission to reconsider its approval. President Trump, with Hawley’s encouragement, reportedly called Energy Secretary Chris Wright and told him to cancel a US$5 billion conditional loan the Department of Energy approved in November to underwrite construction. The agency did just that on July 23, a move Hawley called “a huge win” for Missouri.

However, it’s likely that Missourians will suffer if the line is not built: It was predicted to save state ratepayers almost $18 billion in utility bills in the coming years—though Bailey has called that figure an overstatement. Jesse Jenkins, of Princeton’s REPEAT Project, which analyzes how federal climate and energy policies impact emissions and energy systems, said it’s useful to think of Grain Belt Express as “roughly five nuclear reactors’ worth of low-cost energy.” Thirty-nine municipal utilities across Missouri—including several in the same rural communities Hawley claims would be harmed by the transmission line—have already signed up to tap that supply. If the line is not built, “all the customers in all these cities are going to see higher prices than they normally would have,” said Andy Knott of the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign.

Hawley’s offices in Washington, D.C. and Columbia, Missouri did not return emails and phone calls seeking comment.

This, on top of the local impacts of the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill spending package—which one study suggested will cause Missouri electricity bills to skyrocket more than any other state—could create a dire situation for those already struggling to make ends meet. Kera Mashek, of the United Way of Greater Kansas City, said more than 14,000 people have called the Kansas City area 211 line seeking utility assistance so far this year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to increase Missourians’ electricity bills $240 a year by 2030 and $800 a year by 2035, according to a study from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy policy think tank. It also could hinder climate progress. Clean energy tax credits granted by the Biden administration and rescinded by the Trump administration likely would have incentivized power companies to bring cheaper energy sources online. Without the incentives, they’ll probably continue repairing aging coal-fired plant infrastructure indefinitely, said Megan Mahajan, a co-author of the study.

The idea that people’s bills are going to go up is “certainly concerning for us,” Mashek said. Given the looming cuts to Medicaid and federal assistance programs, particularly those that help low-income people pay energy bills, under Trump’s spending package, “We could be looking at a very dire situation for a lot of households that are suddenly just simply not going to be able to afford to keep their lights on,” Mashek said.

Invenergy accused Hawley of “trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability.” It plans to proceed with construction of what it calls “the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history” using private financing. It’s got plenty of backers, including Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm.

“A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company said in a statement. It might also connect a natural gas plant to what was initially a green energy line, the company announced in July.

Invenergy took Bailey’s office to court, demanding that the attorney general withdraw the investigation. But last week, Bailey announced he’d be leaving his post to join the FBI. Governor Mike Kehoe appointed former state House speaker and federal prosecutor Catherine Hanaway, who most recently worked as lead counsel for Grain Belt Express. Hanaway says the case will proceed, and that she has recused herself.

For Knott, of Beyond Coal, the decade-plus battle over Grain Belt Express is less about what would benefit Missourians and more about a culture war over what “energy dominance” means. “They have politicized clean energy,” he said, “which is honestly just a very weird and illogical thing to do, because clean energy is much, much cheaper than fossil fuels, and we need as much energy on the grid as possible right now.”

This, on top of the local impacts of the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill spending package—which one study suggested will cause Missouri electricity bills to skyrocket more than any other state—could create a dire situation for those already struggling to make ends meet. Kera Mashek, of the United Way of Greater Kansas City, said more than 14,000 people have called the Kansas City area 211 line seeking utility assistance so far this year.

The One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to increase Missourians’ electricity bills $240 a year by 2030 and $800 a year by 2035, according to a study from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy policy think tank. It also could hinder climate progress. Clean energy tax credits granted by the Biden administration and rescinded by the Trump administration likely would have incentivized power companies to bring cheaper energy sources online. Without the incentives, they’ll probably continue repairing aging coal-fired plant infrastructure indefinitely, said Megan Mahajan, a co-author of the study.

The idea that people’s bills are going to go up is “certainly concerning for us,” Mashek said. Given the looming cuts to Medicaid and federal assistance programs, particularly those that help low-income people pay energy bills, under Trump’s spending package, “We could be looking at a very dire situation for a lot of households that are suddenly just simply not going to be able to afford to keep their lights on,” Mashek said.

Invenergy accused Hawley of “trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability.” It plans to proceed with construction of what it calls “the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history” using private financing. It’s got plenty of backers, including Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity firm.

“A privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company said in a statement. It might also connect a natural gas plant to what was initially a green energy line, the company announced in July.

Invenergy took Bailey’s office to court, demanding that the attorney general withdraw the investigation. But last week, Bailey announced he’d be leaving his post to join the FBI. Governor Mike Kehoe appointed former state House speaker and federal prosecutor Catherine Hanaway, who most recently worked as lead counsel for Grain Belt Express. Hanaway says the case will proceed, and that she has recused herself.

For Knott, of Beyond Coal, the decade-plus battle over Grain Belt Express is less about what would benefit Missourians and more about a culture war over what “energy dominance” means. “They have politicized clean energy,” he said, “which is honestly just a very weird and illogical thing to do, because clean energy is much, much cheaper than fossil fuels, and we need as much energy on the grid as possible right now.”",https://www.theenergymix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/grain-belt-express-clean-energy-missouri-trump-hawley.webp,N,,2025-09-22 00:59:10.512115

The money-losing California-based company broke ground mid-September nearAtlanta despite U.S. president Donald Trump’s successful push to roll back electric vehicle tax credits, The Associated Press reported. Starting Sept. 30, buyers will no longer qualify for savings of up to $7,500 per car.

CEO RJ Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian will sell its R2 sport utility vehicles not for environmental or tax incentive reasons, but because it’s a superior vehicle.

“The description I’ll say for R2 is it isn’t an electric vehicle,” he said. “I describe R2 as an incredible five-passenger offroad machine. And it happens to be electric.”

Georgia Plant Is Key to a Mass Market and Profitability

The Georgia plant, first announced in 2021, is Rivian’s key to reaching profitability. Now the company makes the high-end R1T pickup truck and the R1S SUV in Normal, Illinois, as well as delivery vans for Amazon and others. Its truck prices start at $71,000.

The Illinois plant will begin making the smaller R2 next year, with prices starting at $45,000. An expanded Illinois plant will be able to assemble 215,000 vehicles yearly. But if the R2 is a hit, and if Rivian successfully produces an even smaller R3, it will need more capacity. Scaringe said the Georgia operation, able to make 200,000 vehicles yearly starting in 2028, is the “foundation for our growth.” Rivian plans another 200,000 in capacity in phase two, volume that would spread fixed costs over many more vehicles.

The projections would be a big leap from the 40,000 to 46,000 vehicles Rivian expects to deliver this year, down from 52,000 last year. The company says it’s limiting production in part to launch 2026 models.

“For Rivian, it’s do-or-die time,” said Alex Oyler, North American director of auto research firm SBD Automotive. “We saw with Tesla that the key to profitability is scale, and you can’t scale if your cheapest vehicle is $70,000. So they need that plant online to achieve a level of scale of R2 and ultimately R3.”

Challenges In the Electric Vehicle Market

Sales growth is slowing for EVs in the United States, rising only 1.5% in 2025’s first half, according to Cox Automotive.

Tesla accounted for almost 45% of U.S. EV sales in that period, according to Cox. But the giant is losing market share as others gain: General Motors’ slice of American EV sales has climbed to 13%. By comparison, Rivian had a 3% share in the first half of the year, behind Tesla and six traditional automakers.

But excluding Tesla, Rivian is the most successful startup automaker.

The company initially tapped a largely unfilled niche: demand for electric pickups and SUVs. But competition now includes Ford’s F-150 Lightning and the electric Chevrolet Silverado.

After an initial public offering in 2021, Rivian shares have fallen by more than 80%, while automaker shares overall have outpaced the broader stock market. Rivian lost $1.66 billion in 2025’s first half.

At the same time, some automakers’ ardor for electric vehicles is cooling. Stellantis last week canceled Ram’s electric truck program. Ford has delayed production at a new Tennessee plant. And General Motors abandoned plans to build electric vehicles in suburban Detroit.

“With all the competition out there in this market and the slowing growth of EVs, it does not play in Rivian’s favor,” said Sam Fiorani, a vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “However, there still is an EV market out there.”

$1.5 Billion in Incentives for 7,500 Jobs

Georgia has pledged $1.5 billion of incentives to Rivian in exchange for 7,500 company jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average. Rivian can’t benefit from most incentives unless it meets employment goals, but the state is already spending $175 million to buy and grade land and improve roads.

Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, says he wants to make Georgia “the electric mobility capital of America,” but acknowledged that “the road to get here has not been smooth.” He voiced confidence that Rivian can deliver “an innovation revolution” benefitting Georgians.

While Tesla has thousands of employees in California and Texas, some new electric vehicle plants have sputtered. Two separate EV makers that hoped to assemble vehicles in a former GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, went bankrupt. Georgia’s Hyundai complex near Savannah is faring better, with production underway. However, a battery plant there has been delayed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arresting 475 people on site, including more than 300 South Koreans.

Rivian was supposed to be making trucks by now at the 2,000-acre (800-hectare) site near Social Circle, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) east of Atlanta. As the company burned through cash in 2024, it paused construction. But German automaker Volkswagen agreed to invest $5.8 billion in Rivian in exchange for software and electrical technology. And then-President Joe Biden’s administration agreed to loan Rivian $6.6 billion to build the Georgia plant.

Despite the Trump administration’s hostility toward EVs, Scaringe said Tuesday that Rivian has built “a very close relationship” with the U.S. Department of Energy and that the company’s goals align with some of Trump’s big ones, including “U.S. manufacturing, U.S. technology, U.S. technology that supports global business, and leading in all those areas.”

Kemp said he has urged Energy Secretary Chris Wright to back Rivian.

Some Neighbours Still Oppose the Plant

Rivian also faces opposition from some residents who say the plant is an inappropriate neighbour to farms and will pollute the groundwater.

“I planned on dying and retiring on the front porch and the biggest project in Georgia has to go next door to me, of all places in the country?” asked Eddie Clay, who lives less than a mile away. He says his well water turned mud-choked after excavation at the Rivian site.

There are other challenges for Rivian, including tariffs costing $2,000 per vehicle, the Trump administration ending a tax-credit program that will cost the company $140 million in revenue this year, and long-term threats from low-priced, cutting-edge Chinese EVs. But Scaringe said the start of construction shows Rivian is working through its challenges.

“These are not the kinds of things you start without having clear sight to be able to fully finish and launch,” he said.

The court reversed the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s decision and ordered Hoosier to stop raising prices and to immediately dismiss Duke’s rate increase application. The ruling has been welcomed by several public interest institutions aimed at representing the interests of the average American.

The Indiana Court of Appeals has given the people of the region a win against high prices

Every single American is slowly being subjected to increases in cost across several key sectors of everyday life. The rising cost of living in the United States has seen increases in the cost of everything from cars to eggs, and more in between. In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented new rules for treating and disposing of toxic coal ash, and Duke has several coal-powered electricity generation plants in Indiana.

They began to spend essential money to try to comply with the new regulations. And have recently put in an application to try to recoup some of those operational costs by increasing prices for customers, which did not go down well, to say the least. Several organizations have reportedly planned to challenge the action. And the court agrees with them.

The Indiana Court of Appeals has reversed the action taken by Duke Energy over the past four years

The court has ruled that Duke’s plan to increase prices over the past four years was considered illegal retroactive ratemaking. Which speaks volumes about the company’s policies and views of their customer base, of which there are millions. Duke Energy operates several sites in the Indiana region, and the apparent price increases amount to a total of around $88 million in costs incurred from 2019 through 2023.

They even had plans to expand their recouperation efforts for the period between 2024 and 2030, claiming $238 million in projected operational costs in that time frame. Judge Paul Mathias delivered the ruling, which his colleagues on the bench agreed with.

“As our Supreme Court has made clear: ‘a statute operates prospectively when it is applied to the operative event of the statute, and that event occurs after the statute took effect,’ – Judge Paul Mathias of the Indiana Court of Appeals

The ruling also encouraged the Citizens Action Coalition to pursue legal action and sue Duke, which creates a split in the energy sector in the region. The Trump administration has led efforts to increase production in the energy sector across the board and will surely see the ruling as a mere speed bump on the way to energy independence for the United States.

“This is a big win. It’s quite simply, from our perspective, retroactive rate making, which is not allowed. The commission should have known better, and now we’re pretty happy with this (decision). Duke challenged our standing in the case and the court rejected those arguments soundly. We’ve seen more and more challenges on standing, so that (decision) was good.” – Kerwin Olson, Executive Director of Citizens Action Coalition

Will the federal government take steps to intervene in the court ruling

In the midst of all these court rulings and supposed interventions from the federal government, the ruling could be a positive one for the customer base, but ultimately, the industry will feel the effects on the levels of production in the downstream sector. The recent news of Nigeria’s struggles with its workforce has accelerated the Trump administration’s job creation efforts in the energy sector, no doubt aiming to avoid any more legal actions. Will the Trump government intervene? Time will tell.

In conclusion, Ghana’s financial and energy sectors present compelling investment opportunities, but careful planning, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies are essential.","By Africa Risk Control West Africa Desk: Ghana, located in West Africa along the Gulf of Guinea, has a population of approximately 34 million and a GDP of around $90 billion (2024 estimate). Known for its political stability and relatively strong governance, Ghana has consistently been one of Africa’s most attractive destinations for foreign investment.

The economy is diversified, with major contributions from agriculture (~20%), services (~50%), and industry (~30%). Key sectors driving growth include energy, financial services, ICT, and construction. The government has implemented economic reforms to improve ease of doing business, modernize the financial sector, and expand renewable energy, making Ghana a prime destination for investors seeking opportunities in West Africa. Understanding Ghana’s regulatory environment, sector-specific opportunities, and the major players is critical for successful market entry.

Regulatory Landscape

Foreign investors in Ghana should be aware of several key regulatory aspects:

Company Registration: The Registrar General’s Department oversees company incorporation. Investors can establish a limited liability company, branch, or joint venture. The process has been streamlined for faster registration.

Licensing and Permits: Specific sectors such as energy, banking, and telecommunications require sector-specific licenses from regulatory authorities including the Energy Commission and Bank of Ghana.

Tax Incentives: Ghana provides tax holidays, exemptions, and preferential tariffs for companies in strategic sectors like energy, manufacturing, and financial services.

Compliance Considerations: Investors must comply with labor laws, environmental standards, and foreign ownership regulations.

Key Investment Opportunities

Financial Sector

For most of the past half century, the H1-B visa program has been a conduit for global talent into the American economy. It has not been a minor contribution but a central driver of U.S. leadership in high technology. Scratch most successful firms of the last 50 years, and H1-B holders figure prominently in their intellectual capital and executive leadership.

Year after year, between 65 and 75 percent of H1-B recipients have come from India. The pattern is striking. Indian engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians have arrived in numbers that transformed entire industries. They filled programming roles in Silicon Valley, built quantitative models on Wall Street, managed semiconductor design in Texas, and supported every stage of the IT services industry.

China has been the second largest source country, contributing engineers in chip design, material sciences, and advanced manufacturing. Canada and South Korea have provided smaller but steady flows of specialists, particularly in artificial intelligence, aerospace, and telecommunications. The Philippines has supplied healthcare professionals and technical staff. Eastern Europe has contributed in mathematics-heavy fields like cryptography and software security. The United States drew selectively and broadly from this global pool, and for decades it reinforced an innovation ecosystem that relied on constant renewal from abroad.

These workers did not settle into one narrow niche. They worked in Microsoft’s Redmond offices writing operating system code. They staffed Google’s Mountain View teams designing algorithms that underpin global search and advertising. At Tesla in Palo Alto, they worked on battery management systems and autonomous driving stacks. They joined biotech labs in Boston, research centers in Austin, and clean energy startups in Colorado and Arizona. They were critical in engineering departments of utilities modernizing their grids. They were present in almost every major R&D center run by multinationals, from automotive OEMs in Michigan to chip designers in California. Universities relied on them as postdocs and assistant professors, who in turn trained the next generation of American students. Without them, many projects would not have been possible at the speed and scale the U.S. achieved.

The $100,000 fee attached to every new H1-B application with Trump’s most recent executive order changes that foundation. Startups, which live on slim budgets and early-stage venture funding, simply cannot absorb such a surcharge. A two-person energy storage startup hoping to bring in one specialist from India would need to raise an additional $100,000 before even paying salary and benefits. Most will abandon the idea and either hire remotely abroad or leave the role vacant. Larger firms have more flexibility, but even there the calculus changes. A multinational automaker might decide to relocate a promising engineer to a German or Canadian subsidiary rather than pay $100,000 to move them to Detroit. The pipeline of foreign graduate students finishing master’s and PhD programs in the United States will find fewer opportunities to stay. They will either return home or find openings in other countries that maintain more welcoming policies.

Layered on top of this immigration barrier, the One Big Beautiful Bill strips away much of the long-term certainty created by the Inflation Reduction Act. Manufacturing credits that were designed to give a decade or more of visibility now cut off in 2027. Critical mineral credits begin phasing out, and even coal is inserted as an eligible “critical” input. Foreign entity restrictions have been tightened and paired with recapture provisions that extend for a decade, raising financing costs and legal risks for investors. Loan guarantee capacity at the Department of Energy has been rescinded. Together, these shifts make clean technology projects in the United States riskier and less attractive. Developers and manufacturers do not make multi-billion-dollar decisions without predictable policy support, and that predictability has been undercut.

The countries that benefit most are those that were already feeding talent and supply chains into the U.S. India is first in line. With seven out of ten H1-B visas historically going to its citizens, India now retains that pool. Engineers and scientists who would have staffed U.S. offices will instead work from Bangalore or Hyderabad. Multinationals that relied on transferring staff into the U.S. will expand their Indian campuses instead. Venture capital that might have funded a Silicon Valley clean-tech startup will increasingly back Indian founders, confident the talent will remain in place. Over time, this compounds into a stronger domestic innovation ecosystem. More patents are filed in India, more startups are born there, and more global clean-tech firms build significant engineering footprints there.

China gains by virtue of its manufacturing scale. The U.S. stepping back from long-term subsidies for batteries, wind, and solar makes China’s factories more competitive. American gigafactories that were planned may stall, but Chinese exports will continue to flow. Solar supply chains that were slowly reorienting toward U.S. manufacturing under the IRA will instead remain anchored in China. The nascent battery manufacturing industry in the USA will find it very difficult to grow and for those factories that already started production, very difficult to stabilize quality. Every year of uncertainty in U.S. policy is another year of entrenchment for Chinese supply dominance.

Southeast Asia stands to pick up more of the middle links in the supply chain. Indonesia has been aggressive in attracting nickel processing and battery production, and higher U.S. visa costs and weaker incentives make that proposition more compelling for investors. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand, already integrated into electronics manufacturing, will see more orders for modules, components, and subassemblies. As U.S. firms look to reduce risk and cost, they will push more of this work into these countries. Canada and Mexico, with geographic proximity and trade agreements, will also benefit as nearshore alternatives. A U.S. company that cannot afford to bring in foreign engineers may instead set up an R&D center in Toronto or Monterrey, where the visa rules are easier and the costs lower.

Artificial intelligence startups are among the most exposed to these shifts. For years they have drawn from graduate programs where the majority of students are from India, China, and other countries. Those graduates often transitioned to H1-B visas and staffed early teams in San Francisco, Boston, and New York. With a $100,000 surcharge attached to each petition, that pipeline is effectively cut off. Startups running on seed or Series A budgets cannot justify spending that much on a single hire, no matter how talented. Larger firms may still bring in a handful of foreign specialists, but the flow into the early-stage ecosystem will dry up. The result is that intellectual property that might have been created in the United States will instead be created in Bangalore, Toronto, or Berlin, where immigration pathways are open and financing confidence is higher.

The consequences ripple outward quickly. Investors back companies that can access the best people, and they will redirect capital if U.S. startups are constrained. Some American AI firms will register overseas subsidiaries to tap talent abroad, but that complicates intellectual property ownership and weakens the case for scaling in the United States. At the same time, Canada, Europe, and India will benefit from denser AI clusters, richer networks, and faster company formation. Once those ecosystems mature, they will reinforce themselves. For the U.S., the effect is a gradual erosion of relevance in a field that is central not only to economic growth but also to national security and strategic advantage.

The structural problem for the U.S. is that once these shifts occur, they are hard to reverse. Talent pools build density where they are welcomed. If India’s engineers now remain in India, they will start more companies there, join more local firms, and strengthen the ecosystem further. Manufacturing supply chains are sticky. Once a battery plant is built in Indonesia or a module assembly line is set up in Vietnam, it is not likely to move to the United States later. Investors allocate capital based on trust in long-term rules, and trust is slow to rebuild once lost. The rollback of IRA provisions signals that U.S. policy can change rapidly, and the $100,000 H1-B fee signals that the U.S. no longer values incoming talent as it once did. Together, they push money and people elsewhere.

This positions the United States for declining relevance in the industries that will define the rest of this century. Electric vehicles, batteries, wind, solar, grid storage and AI are not side projects. They are the backbone of the global energy and information transition. Countries that build and dominate them will shape trade, employment, and industrial strength for decades. By shutting down its own talent inflows and reducing its investment signals, the U.S. gives away opportunities.

Others will take them. India will grow stronger in technology and clean energy innovation. China will deepen its control of manufacturing. Both countries will end up with stronger AI ecosystems. Southeast Asia will expand its role in critical minerals and midstream processing. Canada, Mexico, and Europe will secure more design and engineering centers. The U.S. will find itself importing more technology and exporting less, a reversal of the pattern that defined its economic strength for the last century.

Reversing this trend will not be simple. Even if a future administration removes the H1-B fee and restores clean energy incentives, the intervening years will have shifted ecosystems abroad. The companies that were not formed in the U.S. will have formed elsewhere. The factories that were not built in the U.S. will already be running overseas. The trust of investors and talent will have been eroded. America can recover in part, but it will be rebuilding against competitors that have gained ground while it stepped back. The risk is not just slower growth, but a lasting decline in relevance in the technologies that matter most for the future economy. It is a choice that reshapes global competition, and one that will be very hard to undo.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ChatGPT-Image-Sep-21-2025-06_08_21-PM.png,N,,2025-09-22 01:57:27.248290

WARREN COUNTY, OH -- Thomas Jefferson described Hugh Williamson’s role at the Philadelphia Convention as, “He was a useful member, of an acute mind, attentive to business, and of a high degree of erudition.” (That means being learned and scholarly.)

Jefferson may have been too modest describing Hugh Williamson. What Williamson accomplished at the Constitutional Convention was the following: He remained at the convention for the entire time and signed the Constitution for the state of North Carolina. He served on five committees, offered 23 motions, and delivered over 70 speeches. Williamson’s main role at the convention was in proposing and supporting certain compromises that ultimately made ratification a reality.

He proposed an impeachment procedure for the chief executive, endorsed a six-year term for U.S. senators, recommended that a free and slave population census be taken in support of the Three-Fifths Compromise, and favored the extension of slavery until a future date to give all states conditions that they could accept in the Constitution.

Williamson did not approve of slavery and never owned slaves, but he believed it better to have all the states within the Union, rather than excluding some by adopting provisions that everyone knew would not be accepted. His experiences convinced him that only a strong central government could adequately protect and foster the political, economic, and intellectual future of the new nation.

Williamson was a scholar of international renown. He was an educator, mathematician, physician, legislator, merchant, scientist, and scholar. Williamson was born and grew up in Pennsylvania and entered the College of Philadelphia (later to become the University of Pennsylvania) at 18. He received a degree in mathematics. Immediately afterwards, he studied theology and received a license to preach in the Presbyterian Church. After that he began studying medicine and then left for Europe to study in Scotland, London, and Utrecht, the Netherlands, where he received an M.D. degree.

He traveled around Europe and upon his return, was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was drawn into scholarly and scientific circles and traveled in America and Europe conducting experiments. It was in Europe that it is thought he collaborated with Benjamin Franklin. While in Boston before sailing to Europe, Williamson observed the Boston Tea Party and was the first to bring the news to England.

During the Revolutionary War, Williamson was unique in that he contributed his talents in shipbuilding, working in a tannery, being a physician and natural scientist to the American war effort primarily in North Carolina, where he now lived. His important medical and scientific accomplishments included vaccinating North Carolina troops against small pox; at the Battle of Camden, he went behind enemy lines under a truce flag to care for American prisoners and provided medical consultation for a British officer.

In the Great Dismal Swamp, Williamson conducted experiments implementing dietary controls, instituting the use of proper clothing in keeping with local environmental conditions, and establishing specific sanitary procedures. Out of a force of between 500 and 1,200 men during the winter of 1780, only two men died from disease and no one was granted sick leave. Williamson advanced his own funds to the state to purchase medical supplies that would be needed in the event of a protracted campaign.

Hugh Williamson was a hugely influential person in North Carolina during and after the War. At the Second Constitutional Convention at Fayetteville, NC in 1789, Williamson made the initial motion on the floor to adopt the document that he had signed for the state. He served with distinction in state and national government and politics but always kept close ties with North Carolina. He was a true Renaissance Man.

The outlet quoted Ahmad as saying: ""As I have always said, it is not a matter of 'if,' but 'when.' I am responsible for fulfilling this directive, and the question now is the method, timing, and approach.""

Several of Malaysia's neighbors have already enacted their own vape bans. They've been banned in Singapore since 2018, and the government recently advanced even tougher enforcement measures. Thailand and Vietnam have also outlawed vaping, with heavy fines and jail time awaiting any violators.

For some, the proposed measures are a cause for concern. Malaysia has around 1.4 million users and a vape industry worth over $1.1 billion annually. According to The Straits Times, some retailers are perplexed by the move to curtail vaping, pointing to equally harmful products that remain perfectly legal, like cigarettes and alcohol.

Still, there's no doubt that vaping involves serious health and environmental consequences.

Disposable vapes are one of the most significant contributors to the growing problem of toxic e-waste that is clogging landfills. In 2023, Americans discarded the equivalent of 5.7 vapes every second.

Research conducted by the UN indicates that around 60-90% of all e-waste is illegally dumped. Fortunately, a better way to deal with most unwanted electronics exists: cashing in on old devices.

As national delegations, activists and other attendees struggle to find affordable places to stay by November, with some deciding not to go at all, Tilvawala, who lives in London, has spent hours working from afar to find lodging in Belem, negotiate prices and contracts and put down deposits. She did all that to create a housing portal specifically for young people who want to be part of the international conference. If not enough people sign up for the housing she’s secured, she might lose some of what she’s put down.

“There’s always a huge number of fossil fuel company representatives there. And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

Exmouth trial shows potential for V2G to power homes, reduce power bills

Technology has the potential to manage two-way charging to stabilise electricity grid

Horizon Power has successfully completed a 12-month trial testing technology to facilitate two-way charging of electric vehicles (EVs).

The Exmouth trial demonstrated that Horizon Power's vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has the potential to manage the two-way flow of energy from EVs charging and discharging into the power network, while ensuring stability and reliability.

The technology enables EVs to act as mobile energy storage systems.

Horizon Power conducted a range of tests exploring the future possibility of using V2G energy flow to power homes, reduce power bills, and stabilise the electricity grid.

It will use the findings of the trial to inform the development of products that will allow customers to get more from their EVs than just getting them from A to B. This could include helping them to power their homes or even earn money by feeding energy back to the grid.

The trial was the first of its kind in Western Australia and was conducted using the regional energy provider's Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS).

DERMS used data from Horizon Power's power systems, connected solar, the EVs and weather forecasts (predicting the availability of solar energy), to successfully balance power system stability with customer needs.

DERMS is already used to ease electricity grid capacity constraints, enabling more regional households to connect rooftop solar.

As part of the Cook Government's Electric Vehicle Action Plan, the trial has enhanced Horizon Power's understanding of how energy flow from EVs can be incorporated into its microgrids, especially in regional and remote towns.

As Horizon Power develops DERMS, EVs have the potential to draw power from the grid to charge but also feed power back into the network when needed - for example, when demands for energy are at their peak or when the flow of energy in the system needs to be stabilised.

Horizon Power partnered with the Gascoyne Development Commission, Shire of Exmouth, Exmouth Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and WA Country Health Service, providing them each with a V2G-compatible Nissan Leaf EV and V2G smart-charging equipment for the trial.

Further information about Horizon Power's V2G trial can be found at www.horizonpower.com.au/evorchestration

Comments attributed to Energy and Decarbonisation Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson:

""The success of this regional trial in Exmouth is an important milestone in our clean energy transition and in testing the technology that could make two-way charging a possibility in Western Australia.

""The findings confirmed for Horizon Power that its technology can manage EV charging and discharging intelligently, helping it to keep the grid stable while paving the way for flexible, customer-led energy products.

""Electric vehicle batteries are powerful. As well as helping to stabilise the grid they have the capacity to power homes and reduce energy bills.

This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and WABE, Atlanta's NPR station.

While any election brings ads, events, door-knocking and other efforts to remind people to get to the polls, this year campaign workers concerned with Georgia's Public Service Commission races have another hurdle: education.

Climate and environment organizers gathered in Atlanta recently to strategize about how to mobilize voters ahead of November's election for two seats on the Georgia commission. Dubbed ""Watts at Stake,"" the event brought together organizers, community leaders and influencers to hear about the importance of the somewhat obscure state agency — a message the speakers view as critical this election cycle.

""If you ask most people, they don't know what the PSC is,"" Russell Armstrong with Black Futures Lab, a group focused on leveraging Black electoral power, told Grist.

But, Armstrong and others said, voters care about what the commission does, once they understand it.

The commission regulates utilities in Georgia, including overseeing Georgia Power's plans and rates — and power bills are climbing. That motivates voters, according to strategists across the political spectrum.

""That's a galvanizing, dare I say energizing, message that will get Georgia voters out,"" said Carmen Bergman, an adviser to the campaign of incumbent Republican commissioner Fitz Johnson.

Experts and advocates elsewhere are also invested in the commission because while power bills are going up nationwide, Georgia is one of only 10 states that directly elects the utility commissioners who have final say over electricity rates.

""There actually is more power for the consumer in a state like Georgia than in any other state because they vote for their regulators,"" Charles Hua, founder of the utility advocacy and education group PowerLines, told reporters ahead this month's organizing event. ""The challenge is how do we get that education and awareness in front of as many folks as possible?""

One of the biggest jobs for the Georgia PSC is regulating Georgia Power. That includes how power is made — which has an impact on climate change because power plants are a major source of emissions — and how much energy costs, which affects the millions of Georgians who get their electricity from the company.

There are five statewide elected commissioners who serve staggered terms. Currently they are all Republicans. This year, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are up for election. Johnson is running against Democrat Peter Hubbard, and Echols is facing Democrat Alicia Johnson.

Helping voters make the connection between their power bills and the two seats on the ballot this year is proving to be an all-out, statewide effort. Groups like Georgia Conservation Voters, one of the organizers of the organizing event, said they are holding both virtual and in-person town halls to educate voters. Black Futures Lab has volunteers knocking on doors and is holding a series of events in South Georgia.

""The main thing is showing people that, hey, we hold the power, we hold the keys to this election and every other election from here to come,"" said Omega Calhoun, who spearheads their efforts in Valdosta.

Bergman said the Johnson campaign is taking an ""all of the above"" approach to getting the word out, including events, canvassing and ads.

""There's going to be no stone left unturned to make sure voters know that there is a difference on the ballot,"" she said.

This kind of effort is pretty novel for a down-ballot race in Georgia, according to Georgia State University public policy professor Tammy Greer. Voters would benefit from more education and engagement in other races, too, she said, including lieutenant governor and the commissioners of insurance, labor and agriculture.

""These spaces have so much policy implications over people in the state that we really don't pay attention to,"" Greer said. ""If we paid closer attention to their platforms then perhaps we can start electing individuals that are looking out for all of our best interests.""

This is also an unusual year for a typically low-profile election because the commission seats are the only statewide races on the ballot, but there are local elections in some of the major cities, including Atlanta. So while Georgia's Republican-leaning rural areas often carry state elections, without a governor's race or even mayoral race to get many rural voters to the polls, Greer said, Democratic voters in cities could decide the races.

""And I think that the folks on the commission understand that,"" Greer said. ""They understand the tide is changing.""

She pointed to the commission's unanimous vote earlier this year to temporarily freeze power rates as a sign the five current commissioners know that high power bills are driving voters and that what Greer called ""a bit of dissent"" could soon join the currently all-Republican commission.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/img/2025/09/23/103789765_20250611-AMX-US-NEWS-BIG-ELECTION-WITH-TINY-TURNOUT-1-AT_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-09-21 18:59:24.622454

The goal behind the bill is to streamline the permitting process for cross-border energy projects.

The bill passed the House with bipartisan support in a vote of 224-203. Seven Democrats joined all voting republicans to pass the bill, with five members not voting.

The bill’s primary focus is to standardize and streamline the permitting process for the import and export of oil, natural gas, and electricity transmission. This would be a boon for oil-rich states near the US border.

The new law would require congressional approval to remove permitting for cross-border pipelines. That portion of the law is in response to President Joe Biden’s executive order removing permitting for the Keystone XL pipeline, an infrastructure project that stalled for more than 12 years before being canceled after then-President Biden’s executive order.

Under the proposed bill, the president would lose the ability to remove permits with an executive order and would need congressional approval.

In a speech on the House floor, arguing for the bill, Congresswoman Fedorchak said, “The Keystone XL pipeline should have never been cancelled. Yet on his first day in office, President Biden used the stroke of a pen to shut it down,” Fedorchak continued, “by passing my legislation, the House has taken a critical step to end years of regulatory uncertainty and partisan games that have delayed energy infrastructure projects, crushed good-paying jobs, and undermined America’s energy security.”

The bill now awaits a hearing from the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. It will face a slightly tougher audience in the Senate with Republicans’ razor-thin margin.

Journalism student enrollments soared by 93% between 1970 and 1975, per the New York Times, which can largely be accredited to the journalistic work of Woodward and Bernstein.

The release of “All the President's Men” in 1976 coincided with a 72% public trust in media that year across the United States according to a survey conducted by Gallup — the highest since the company began asking this question in 1972. This surge in trust underscores the substantial impact that Woodward and Bernstein’s investigation — and Redford’s production of the story and acting in the film — had on elevating the power of journalism.

Championing environmentalism

Since the beginning of the modern environmentalist movement, which began in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, Redford used his public persona to push for environmental causes.

Over the last five decades of his life, Redford worked closely with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) as a trustee.

He also consistently advocated for environmental justice. In the late ‘70s, Redford advocated for the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which expanded the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — a more than 19 million-acre protected home to an abundance of wildlife.

Most recently, Redford publicly supported clean energy legislation, which turned into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 — the largest climate and clean energy bill in United States history.

“The environmental movement has lost a giant,” NRDC president and CEO Manish Bapna said in a press release. “Nobody has done more to shine a light on the most important environmental issues from the dawn of the environmental movement in the ‘70s through the biodiversity and climate crises of today. We must continue to honor his vision in the difficult environmental landscape we face today.”

Empowering independent filmmakers

Despite receiving numerous Academy Award nominations and epitomizing the classic Hollywood movie star, perhaps Redford’s most defining traits were his significant contributions to independent filmmakers and the indie film industry.

In 1969, Redford purchased land to open the Sundance Mountain Resort in Utah, which he later fostered into a space for the Sundance Institute — a nonprofit organization dedicated to celebrating and cultivating independent filmmakers. Despite his success in acting and directing, Redford recognized that smaller creative minds lacked the opportunities and attention they deserved.

The institute hosts the annual Sundance Film Festival, which has helped launch some of the biggest director names in Hollywood, including Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson.

Brittany Friesner, managing director for the Indiana University Cinema, worked with Sundance in theater operations from 2008-2015 and remembers the feelings surrounding Redford within the organization.

“It was electric to have him in the building and there to remind everyone of the heart and soul and original intent of the festival,” Friesner said. “To highlight independent filmmakers, to celebrate their work, to gather together in a communal space, to connect and reflect on the stories we all have inside of us.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/d5ff2322-a3f2-48ec-a298-2b95511b960c.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-21 17:59:52.106177

But the domestic nuclear sector is in severe decline, and the nuclear fleet is rapidly aging, with many of the nation’s reactors scheduled to be retired in the coming years. Reviving the sector could be a huge boon to national energy security and global climate goals, but building new plants is prohibitively expensive.

In the past few decades, the United States has only built one new nuclear power plant, Waynesboro, Georgia’s Plant Vogtle. Vogtle has the distinction of being the most expensive infrastructure project of any kind in U.S. history, clocking in at a whopping $35 billion after years of delays. First approved in 2009, the last reactor finally came online in April of last year.

The project is considered by most to be a bloated disaster, with the potential to derail momentum toward a nuclear renaissance in the United States. “But there are two ways to interpret the cautionary tale presented by Vogtle,” Oilprice reported as the project was wrapping up last year. “ Either you think that the lesson is not to build new reactors, or that the lesson is to build nuclear reactors better.”

A number of labs and startups across the United States have opted for the latter. Scientists and engineers are hard at work trying to figure out how to build nuclear reactors better and more cheaply than ever before.

One of the biggest focuses of nuclear innovation is the development of small modular reactors (SMRs) which will make nuclear power more scalable and streamlined, lowering up-front development costs. These smaller reactors can be mass-produced offsite in a factory setting and then assembled onsite, avoiding the extremely costly design and permitting process of traditional nuclear plants. Already, two SMR models have been approved for rollout in the United States, and many more are in the pipeline.

Meanwhile, Oak Ridge National Laboratory is working on integrating cutting-edge technologies into nuclear plant design for more efficient and effective designs and processes, including 3-D printing and artificial intelligence. The Tennessee-based National Laboratory says it has “successfully developed and validated large-scale, 3D-printed polymer composite forms for casting complex, high-precision concrete structures that would be technically challenging and costly to produce using conventional methods.”

The use of these 3-D printed composite forms can considerably cut down on production times. Typically, the casting of “complex structural components with unique geometries” can take weeks, but with these molds, nuclear projects can cast the parts on-site in a matter of days and with greater precision. The design of the 3-D molds has been tested and validated as part of the construction process for the Hermes Low-Power Demonstration Reactor at Kairos Power’s Oak Ridge campus.

“At ORNL, we’re showing that the future of nuclear construction doesn’t have to look like the past,” says Ryan Dehoff, director of the lab’s Manufacturing Demonstration Facility. “We’re combining national lab capabilities with MDF’s legacy of taking big, ambitious swings — moonshots that turn bold ideas into practical solutions — to accelerate new commercial nuclear energy.”

The timing is right – nuclear is a rare bipartisan priority in the United States and the current policy climate is bullish on a homegrown nuclear revival. At COP28, during the Biden administration, the United States was one of more than 20 countries that cooperated to launch the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy. And so far, anomalously, the Trump administration has shown no signs of walking back that pledge. Just this week, Donald Trump signed a flurry of nuclear deals with the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, amounting to multiple billions of dollars to expand nuclear energy power production capacity across both nations.

The expansion, managed by the Kenya Electricity Transmission Co., will ease pressure on strained power lines, replace costly gas turbines, and help ensure reliable electricity for homes and businesses from an unlimited underground energy source.

Geothermal energy taps heat from beneath the Earth's surface to generate electricity. Unlike fossil fuels, it produces virtually no harmful carbon pollution, making it a game changer for public health and the planet.

By diversifying its energy grid with this abundant and clean energy resource, Kenya is cutting pollution, curbing climate threats, and saving money on fuel imports. Kenyans will benefit from lower energy costs, as these plants produce steady, low-cost electricity that will stabilize the national grid, fostering community and economic growth.

The project is a $120 million investment to expand Kenya's transmission network, with additional lines planned nationwide. Officials recently approved the Olkaria VII power station, adding another 80 megawatts of clean capacity.

The move has drawn praise as a model for sustainable growth and reflects the government's focus on green energy development.

Kenya Electricity Generating Co. CEO Eng. Peter Njenga said in a press release: ""We are conscious about our carbon footprint and that is why we are deliberate about our focus on green energy projects, which are not only climate-sensitive but are also sustainable.""

While geothermal is taking center stage in Kenya, households everywhere can contribute to clean energy. Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack, bringing costs down to nearly zero. EnergySage offers a service that allows for easy comparison of quotes from vetted local installers to save as much as $10,000 on solar installations.

Going solar also makes other efficient appliances cheaper, such as heat pumps, which use a similar operating principle to geothermal energy. Mitsubishi offers affordable pumps with high-quality options to help you choose one.

Since 2017, the state has retired 2,500 megawatts of reliable power plants, including coal and nuclear.
Meanwhile, reliable power plants continue to be retired faster than they can be replaced.
Some states, like Kentucky, are ensuring utilities maintain “steel in the ground” — the dispatchable power plants capable of meeting customer needs at any hour.
A reliable grid is the foundation of our national security, economic strength, and technological leadership.","Americans often take for granted that when we flip a switch, the lights turn on.

But behind that simple act is one of the most complex machines ever built — the electric grid. In the eastern United States, PJM Interconnection is the grid operator that coordinates electricity for 65 million people across 13 states and the District of Columbia. PJM’s mission is clear: keep the power flowing reliably and affordably. But today, that mission is being jeopardized by political interference.

Several governors within the PJM footprint are attempting to alter its governance, blaming PJM for higher electricity costs instead of acknowledging the consequences of their own state energy policies. Maryland and New Jersey, for example, are pushing for changes to PJM’s Board of Managers, while governors in Pennsylvania and Virginia are trying to force political nominees onto PJM’s governing body. But PJM is not a government agency. Allowing politicians to dictate who serves on the PJM board would fundamentally change how the grid operates and inject politics into decisions that must remain firmly apolitical.

For decades, the electric grid has been governed by organizations like PJM that prioritize reliability, engineering, and market economics, not political agendas. When politics takes priority, reliability becomes the first casualty.

This has been evident in many of the same states that have criticized PJM. These states have adopted policies that undercut electric reliability, including the premature shutdown of reliable power sources like coal and nuclear plants, the establishment of unrealistic renewable mandates, and the failure to require new industrial loads like data centers to secure sufficient generation resources. The result is a tighter market, rising costs, and growing threats to reliability. These state-level mistakes were compounded by federal policies under the Biden administration that accelerated baseload plant closures and weakened the resilience of the grid.

Take New Jersey, for example. Since 2017, the state has retired 2,500 megawatts of reliable power plants, including coal and nuclear. Offshore wind projects meant to replace that capacity have collapsed, forcing New Jersey to import roughly 35 percent of its electricity while residents’ bills soar by 20 percent. Maryland has followed a similar path, closing 16 coal plants in just over a decade. The state now imports 40 percent of its electricity and is blocking a critical transmission project that would improve reliability throughout the region.

Instead of accepting responsibility for their reckless policy decisions, these governors are blaming PJM and even threatening lawsuits. Lawsuits, however, won’t keep the lights on. Nor will state policies that attempt to micromanage PJM’s wholesale markets or impose artificial price caps. These short-sighted measures only discourage investment in new, reliable generation.

PJM’s most recent capacity auction, designed to ensure there are enough power plants to meet future demand, fell short of its reserve reliability target for the first time. Demand is expected to continue rising, which could lead to shortfalls as early as 2026 and 2027, driven largely by data center growth. Meanwhile, reliable power plants continue to be retired faster than they can be replaced. This is a dangerous recipe for rolling blackouts.

PJM is sounding the alarm on the need to keep existing resources, like coal, online longer, and is also prioritizing reliable, always-available projects like natural gas and nuclear. But states must do their part. They control siting, permitting, and the integration of new loads. Some states, like Kentucky, are ensuring utilities maintain “steel in the ground” — the dispatchable power plants capable of meeting customer needs at any hour.

Others, however, are simply leaning on PJM’s wholesale market while refusing to expedite the permitting and build-out of the resources needed to keep the system operating.

PJM’s customers cannot afford for it to become a political football. If governors are allowed to bend PJM’s governance to their whims, the consequences will ripple across the 13-state region. Politicizing PJM will not build a single new power plant, nor will it lower prices. It will only erode investor confidence and jeopardize the market principles that have delivered reliability for decades.

Coal and other dispatchable resources should not be viewed as obstacles to the energy transition. They are the bridge that ensures reliability until other resources can provide the 24/7 power needed to sustain our economy. Europe’s recent blackout in Portugal and Spain is a stark warning: When policymakers ignore reliability, grids fail. The United States cannot afford to follow that path.

A reliable grid is the foundation of our national security, economic strength, and technological leadership. To protect it, PJM’s governance must remain independent and free from political manipulation so that it can correctly value always-on, dispatchable resources. And states must step up to secure sufficient generation within their borders.

A great starting point for your Rivian Automotive research is our analysis highlighting that could impact your investment decision.","Rivian Automotive (RIVN) has just broken ground on its new Georgia manufacturing plant, a move that is turning heads well beyond the electric vehicle crowd. With backing from both the federal government and state officials, along with support from Volkswagen and a multibillion dollar federal loan, Rivian is making a bold bet on scaling up. The facility is not just about new concrete and steel; it is about preparing for the launch of next-generation models like the midsize R2 SUV and R3 crossover, and expanding Rivian’s reach across the U.S. and international markets.

This announcement comes at a time when Rivian’s momentum has seen some bumps. Sales of existing models have cooled since their 2023 peak, and the company is facing challenges like rising competition, shrinking EV tax credits, and ongoing losses. Still, the stock is up over 5% after the groundbreaking news, building on steady gains of nearly 23% over the past year after a rocky prior stretch. The market seems keen on the idea that production scale and new vehicles could reignite growth, though real certainty is still a ways off.

So here is the real question: with the Georgia plant promising fresh capacity and new models on the horizon, is Rivian stock trading below its true value, or is the market already pricing in all the future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 2.4% Overvalued

The current consensus among analysts views Rivian as slightly overvalued, with the share price just above the estimated fair value according to their latest projections.

Rivian is positioned to benefit from the anticipated long-term acceleration of EV adoption, supported by expanding addressable market and increasing consumer demand for sustainable products.

Solar power has been apart of the American energy sector for nearly thirty years and still serves as a crucial energy provider.
The sector has plans to increase the percentage of power generation that solar provides in the United States.
The solar sector could set a new record if all units come online this year, as the renewable sector finds a more substantial foothold in the energy sector worldwide.
– Ralph Nader (Implicitly supports solar power) “Energy is essential for development, and sustainable energy is essential for sustainable development”.","The EIA or US Energy Information Administration has revealed the substantial importance that solar will provide the American energy sector as it forecasts increased energy demands for the years to come. The United States has seen a rise in solar power generation, thanks in no small part to the rise in solar power production in Texas. The US is on track to increase energy demands, thanks to an increase in population density and new and innovative tech sectors becoming more dominant in the United States.

The EIA states that solar is key to America’s plans for energy independence

As the energy demands worldwide are on an upward trajectory, several countries have made significant investments in the renewable energy sector. And the most dominant force in the renewable energy sector is, without a doubt, solar. Solar power has been apart of the American energy sector for nearly thirty years and still serves as a crucial energy provider.

US Energy Information Administration has announced that during the first half of 2025, developers added 12 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar electric generating capacity in the United States. The sector has plans to increase the percentage of power generation that solar provides in the United States. If those plans become a reality, they could add another 21 GW in the second half of the year.

New records could be set for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online in 2025

The previous record for U.S. generating capacity additions was set in 2002, when developers added an astonishing 58 GW to the grid. The vast majority of that addition came from natural gas, which is where this new record differs. The solar sector could set a new record if all units come online this year, as the renewable sector finds a more substantial foothold in the energy sector worldwide.

Texas has played a crucial role in the rise in solar usage in the energy sector in the United States. Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity only last year, and projections are that Texas’s fondness and proclivity for solar is only going to grow as energy demands rise in the United States. Kansas has seen recent discoveries of cast troves of hydrogen that could accelerate the US energy independence efforts.

“Clearly, we need more incentives to quickly increase the use of wind and solar power; they will cut costs, increase our energy independence and our national security and reduce the consequences of global warming”. – Ralph Nader

Jennifer Morgan Jennifer Morgan has been a central figure in international climate policy for over two decades, contributing to the climate crisis response through activism, diplomacy, and leadership in global climate negotiations.
She’s incredibly experienced in the sector and has held previous roles at some of the industry’s biggest hitters, including working at the Climate Action Network in the Nineties, leading the WWF’s Global Climate Change Program and then taking on the role of global climate change director for the think tank E3G.
The previous year, he swam 100 miles across the Red Sea to underline the impact of climate change on fragile coral reefs.
In June, Garcetti was named ambassador for global climate diplomacy for the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.","The grip of the climate crisis is tightening, with records continuing to tumble as the world heats up and the natural world suffers increasing harm.

Temperatures reached a worldwide high in 2024, research revealed, following on from the record set in 2023. The UK this year had its hottest spring and summer since records began in 1884, with multiple heatwaves causing droughts and wildfires .

In his inaugural state of climate and nature speech, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, Ed Miliband, cited research that the UK had become one of the most “nature-depleted countries in the world”. He said: “These are uncomfortable, sobering facts, and we should make no mistake: we must act on the climate and nature crisis … because no sector or part of our society is immune from those risks.”

Outside of the UK, attitudes are different. Donald Trump’s scepticism has seen green initiatives rolled back, while reliance on fossil fuels has increased. Yet Florida just had the worst drought in 24 years, with almost the entire state affected, and the LA fires in January displaced thousands of people as their homes were destroyed and hundreds also lost their lives.

Even the Nordic countries have experienced extensive heatwaves this summer and scientists believe the rapid loss of Antarctic sea ice is accelerating the problem to tipping point, with potentially irreversible global consequences.

It may sound like a dismal state of affairs, but there’s always hope, as Sir David Attenborough revealed in his Ocean documentary that the ocean can regenerate itself. Aside from the broadcaster, there’s a whole host of people dedicating their lives to improving the environment before it’s too late, and making others see that we need to change our ways.

You’ll find many of them in the second edition of The Independent’s Climate 100 List, following on from the success of our first edition last year.

The list isn’t in order of importance, nor does it compare or rank one change maker against another. Instead, it’s a recognition of the people and companies dedicated to finding positive climate solutions. Some have made a splash recently with a notable contribution to the fight, while others are celebrated for their long-term commitment and contribution. We also asked you, our readers, to nominate five unsung climate heroes.

The publication coincides with Climate Week NYC – one of the climate world’s biggest events – where The Independent will be hosting its own Climate 100 event, including a keynote speech from Greg Jackson, the founder and CEO of Octopus Energy.

So, meet the inspirational people solving the planet’s greatest challenges.

Arts & Fashion

1. Abi Daré

Winning the first Climate Fiction prize in May of this year, British-Nigerian writerAbi Daré’s novel And So I Roar documents how the climate crisis also triggers social crisis. She unravels the effects of this on rural Nigerian communities, especially women and girls, deepening the inequality that already exists.

On winning, she told The Independent ,""it shows that stories from all over the world, from Africa, from Nigeria, matter. And that people have heard the voices of the girls because they were roaring in the book, as the title says. That means a lot to me.""

It also gives a voice to Africa’s climate narrative and that of the Global South too. As the continent contributes an estimated 4 per cent of global emissions, yet it bears a disproportionate brunt of the impacts of the crisis.

And So I Roar is the sequel to The Girl with the Louding Voice. In 2023, she launched The Louding Voice Foundation, which supports educational scholarships and empowerment programmes for women and girls in underserved Nigerian communities.

2. Edward Burtynsky

Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky has used most of his photography career to powerfully track humanity’s disastrous environmental footprint. His work provides the urgent environmental commentary many can’t convey with words alone.

He focuses on sites such as oil fields, mines, quarries, and those that have suffered from droughts or deforestation and uses his lens to stir much-needed conversations of human impact. His images are often stark and positioned from a bird’s eye view, encapsulating the sheer size, made more damning by often including tiny human figures for scale.

Sometimes, his pieces might look like a study of colour or pattern, until it becomes clear it’s actually something much more shocking, like the remnants of an extracted copper mine and huge craters in the land and varying rusty colours.

His recent exhibition at New York’s International Center of Photography (ICP), The Great Acceleration, portrays the effects on glacier retreats, coastal erosion and industrial landscapes.

3. Arizona Muse

British-American model Arizona Muse is the founder of the charity Dirt, a non-profit organisation aiming to change the fashion industry by tackling its many problems from the ground up, literally.

Her focus is on soil health and regenerative farming and growing methods, after witnessing the fashion industry’s impacts from within. Muse now speaks out about the hidden costs of fashion on the environment and communities, including ethical and sustainability-related problems associated with exploitation. When she first started her campaigning, she says she lost a lot of followers, but set about engaging her audience in her message. She has spent the past decade highlighting the importance of regenerative organic agriculture, especially for growing the raw materials needed to make our clothes.

Muse is working to convince the larger fashion houses and brands to change how they work, and to not only prioritise revenue. Her vision is to bring the industry more in line with the food and wine sector, which has certifications and standards for produce made following environmentally conscious practices. As there’s nothing like it, Muse is working on her own set of standards.

4. Aziza Chaouni

Architect, activist and professor Aziza Chaouni – the first Moroccan national to study architecture at Harvard University – addresses climate resilience, ecological sustainability, and social empowerment through design.

Chauni’s most prominent project has been creating earthquake-resistant buildings in Morocco, following a devastating earthquake in 2023 that claimed the lives of around 3,000 people.

Remote areas in the Atlas mountains, where buildings were made from unreinforced brick and masonry, were the worst affected by the 6.8-magnitude disaster. Chaouni’s designs are not only affordable, but are built with compressed bricks made of 95 per cent earth that are interlocked with mortar and vaulted brick roofs reinforced with steel rods, while wastewater is filtered to be reused.

The project exemplifies the need for climate-sensitive, socially responsible architecture, and for her work Chauni was awarded the 2024 IMA “Impact” Design Award in October.

5. Livia Giuggioli Firth

Livia Giuggioli Firth’s environmental contribution was almost entirely rooted in fashion, until she spent the lockdown on her twin brother’s organic farm in Umbria. Now she has moved to working on the sustainable and regenerative farm project known as Quintosapore (meaning fifth taste).

For decades, Firth committed to raising awareness on sustainability in the fashion industry. In 2010, she founded the Green Carpet Challenge, bringing sustainability to the forefront by encouraging celebrities and designers to choose eco-friendly materials and follow ethical practices on the red carpet, spotlighting the environmental costs of fast fashion.

Her 2015 documentary, The True Cost, highlighted the hidden environmental and ethical toll of fast fashion, largely on women in the Global South. Through her activism, she has influenced major fashion brands to adopt more sustainable practices and sparked a movement towards greater transparency and accountability in the industry. Last year, she closed her longstanding consultancy business, Eco-Age, after 17 years.

6. Natsai Audrey Chieza

Fashion has a pollution problem, but Zimbabwe-born Natsai Audrey Chieza found an unlikely solution in biology. Most of the textile industry’s ecological damage happens near the end of the process at the dyeing stage, as it requires a huge amount of water and many chemicals used are petroleum-based. Chieza came across a solution in the pigment found in mould, which she harnessed to create a toxin-free dye, creating a groundbreaking alternative technique.

It’s just one achievement out of her design, research and development studio Faber Futures. Set up in 2018, it designs at the intersection of nature, tech, science and sustainability, using biology to address problems caused by the climate crisis. Her work within the biodesign sector not only reduces the environmental impact of textile production but also promotes a broader dialogue about the role of biology in sustainable design.

Her success led her to co-found Normal Phenomena of Life (NPOL), a pioneering biodesign brand aiming to change the fashion industry’s over-reliance on petrochemicals. Instead it offers grown-to-order products such as bacterially dyed garments, algae-ink prints, and microbial bioconcrete. It’s part of working towards her future vision that all materials, whether for our clothes or construction, will be made from living organisms.

7. Stella McCartney

Even before sustainability became a buzzword, Stella McCartney’s name had long been associated with sustainable fashion as she used her status and following to speak out on environmental issues. Inspired by her mother Linda, an animal rights activist, McCartney has become one of the most influential figures in fashion, refusing to use any kind of animal products, and encouraging the reuse and recycling of materials, as well as the reduction of waste.

She launched her eponymous fashion line in 2001 and has been committed to ethical and environmentally conscious practices since. She has recently gone on to champion regenerative farming practices in her supply chain and has expanded the use of bio-based materials.

Earlier this year, she launched her most sustainable collection yet, made from 100 per cent cruelty-free materials, using materials such as fungi-based vegan leather and yarns from seaweed. She’s also partnered with materials company, Balena, to create a completely biodegradable shoe sole in a bid to reduce waste.

Business & Finance

8. Greg Jackson

Paving the way for modern energy companies in the UK is the founder and CEO of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson. With a long-standing interest in the climate from a young age and a member of Greenpeace aged 16, he went on to create Octopus in 2016, which sources a large portion of its energy from renewables. Jackson has turned green tech into a formidable force and wants to make renewable energy smart, affordable, and undeniably consumer-friendly.

Octopus is currently the UK’s largest energy supplier, thanks to Jackson’s attitude of not being afraid to shake things up, mainly with its dynamic pricing. It is investing heavily in wind and solar, where most of its renewables also come from, and it uses a tech platform to incentivise customers to use energy when more renewables have been generated, or when it’s at its cheapest and cleanest. For his services to the energy industry, he was awarded an OBE last year.

9. Scott Strazik

Scott Strazik is the CEO and president of GE Vernova, one of the largest producers of electricity in the world. Since being named to run the power division of General Electric when it was spun off into a separate company in the spring of 2024, Strazik has presided over a more than fourfold gain in the company’s stock price.

GE is one of the biggest players in the renewable energy business, managing sizeable operations in wind, nuclear, hydropower, and electricity generation. It has become a favourite of investors who are looking to cash in on the booming business for AI and in particular powering data centres for technology giants.

Strazik is a career GE executive, having previously run both its gas power business and aviation commercial engine business. GE Vernova is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

10. Andrew Forrest

Andrew Forrest is one of Australia’s richest men, having founded the Fortescue Metals Group 20 years ago, and is now a philanthropist and green energy advocate using his billions to help mitigate climate change.

Forrest’s fortune is estimated by Forbes to be above $17bn (£12.8bn), much of which he has ploughed back into his privately held Squadron Energy venture, which he founded in 2022. The company paid around $2.6bn that year for Australia’s biggest wind energy company, CWP Renewables.

Among other philanthropic endeavours, he has pledged to help rebuild Ukraine into a clean energy giant once the war with Russia is over. Forrest is known for railing against oil executives and the markets-based system of measuring corporate performance by quarterly earnings or half-year earnings, which he said is too short a timespan to allow companies to invest in meaningful change.

11. Eva Zabey

Eva Zabey is the CEO of Business for Nature, a Geneva-based group of more than 100 organisations seeking to work with business and policymakers on behalf of the environment. The group refreshed its ambitious plans to achieve a nature-positive economy for all by 2030 earlier this year to focus, among other things, on national deep dives with local partners in places such as South America, Africa and Asia. Within this plan, she is calling for it to become mandatory for all companies to report on their impact on nature, part of the Target 15 initiative.

Before joining Business for Nature, Zabey was a senior member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development for 15 years. As an ecologist, she has long been associated with work to reverse the loss of important natural systems, as well as biodiversity initiatives.

12. Jonathan Maxwell

The British investment banking entrepreneur Jonathan Maxwell created Sustainable Development Capital LLP almost 17 years ago to seek opportunities in the booming market for energy efficiency. Since then, it has been at the forefront of creating value from wasted heat and gas.

Maxwell notes that up to a third of global emissions are caused by the construction sector, from cement and steel to inefficient lighting and air conditioning systems. Whether it’s steel mills in the US to olive presses in Spain, the company works with large commercial operations to find ways for them to save energy by reducing waste.

In the past year, Maxwell has hit the television news circuit in the UK and US to alert viewers to the dangers of cuts to climate funding in both places and to promote his book, The Edge: How Competition for Resources is Pushing the World, and its Climate, to the Brink – and What we Can Do About it. Sustainable Development also did a major deal with equity firm General Atlantic to sell a minority stake to one of the investment giant’s climate funds.

13. Carole Bamford

As the founder of Daylesford and her eponymous brand, Bamford, Carole Bamford champions not only British farming, but sustainable food production and the benefits of organics. She has undeniably been a key driving force in making ethical and sustainable everyday living attractive to the general public. At Daylesford pubs and cottages, all run from 100 per cent renewables, reducing waste is essential, whether it’s turning spent coffee grounds into body scrubs, fermenting glugs of produce, or turning beeswax into beauty products.

Last November, she was a prominent voice in criticising the government’s controversial family farm tax, which she says will threaten farm sustainability.

This year, she has just hosted Daylesford’s inaugural event, Down To Earth: The Daylesford Nature Summit, which saw 150 leaders across food, farming, fashion and sustainability come together to discuss important topics such as land stewardship and organic innovation.

14. Scott Tew

Scott Tew knows better than anybody the opportunities – and risks – inherent in fighting climate change. Tew is managing director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Sustainability at Trane Technologies, one of the world’s largest industrial cooling and heating companies.

In a world in which record temperatures are being set every month, there is arguably no better position to be in than working at an air conditioning company. Tew is one of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) world’s most prominent corporate innovators, drawing large audiences when he discusses how companies need to develop sustainability cultures.

Trane is based in North Carolina but domiciled in Ireland, and its stock is among the best performers on Wall Street of any clean tech stocks of the last few years. It has continued its run so far in 2025, up more than 17 per cent through June. With 15 per cent of emissions coming from inefficient heating and cooling systems, and another 10 per cent from food transportation, Tew and Trane are in a strong position to influence how the world reacts to global warming, and how companies can prepare.

15. Stefania Di Bartolomeo

Stefania Di Bartolomeo is the founder of Physis Investment, a Boston-based asset manager with an all-woman executive team dedicated to making investing in the fight against climate change profitable and transparent.

A Harvard graduate who grew up in Italy, she became focused on sustainable finance in her early twenties after taking a call from an investor asking how her money, specifically, was making a difference.

Di Bartolomeo conceived a software portfolio package that would show investors not just how much money they were making or losing on a stock, but also how that company uses money on things like water security, energy efficiency, corporate philanthropy, or to increase the number of women in its senior management ranks.

Physis, a fintech company whose name is Greek for nature or law of nature, is dedicated to advocating the position that there are important metrics to investing in companies beyond just profit and loss. Over the last year, it became one of the first sustainable investing companies to incorporate AI into its algorithm for picking stocks in a transparent manner that would benefit the environment and be good investments.

16. Nick Mabey

As the founder of global think tank Leading E3G, (which stands for Third Generation Environmentalism), Nick Mabey has been the CEO since 2006 and has steered the company in climate policy and diplomacy to work towards transitioning to a greener future. He was also an early adopter of the idea that the climate crisis poses serious risks to national and global security, back in the 1990s.

As part of this, he launched the annual London Climate Action Week event in 2019, in partnership with the Mayor of London, which is now held every June. Since then, it’s gone on to become one of the world’s largest independent climate-focused events.

He has also authored and co-authored several books and reports, including Argument in the Greenhouse: The International Economics of Controlling Global Warming back in 1996. He was awarded an OBE in 2022, for his climate leadership and role in supporting the UK Cop26 in Glasgow, where he served as a “Friend of Cop26”, advising the UK COP presidency.

17. Yvon Chouinard

Yvon Chouinard is one of the most influential businessmen in the climate world. A rock climber, environmentalist and philanthropist, he became a billionaire after founding Patagonia, the California-based maker of outdoor recreation clothing, in 1973.

In 2022, Chouinard stunned both the environmental and corporate worlds by donating all of Patagonia’s investing stock (while keeping control of its voting stock) to a trust to ensure that future profits are used to address the climate crisis. Since then, the trust has directed more than $71m (£56m) to environmental causes, including a campaign in the last year to encourage its outdoor enthusiast customers to vote for climate candidates in local and national elections.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Chouinard was a well-known mountain and ice climber in Europe and the US, and started out making steel pitons (spikes) for climbing. In the 1970s, when he learned that the steel pitons were cracking the rock faces in Yosemite National Park, he changed the material to aluminium and, in the process, invented what is now called “clean climbing”.

18. Michael Bloomberg

Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York and founder of Bloomberg Philanthropies, has a two-pronged approach to fighting the climate crisis – policy advocacy and financial innovation.

During his 11 years as mayor, he reduced the city’s carbon footprint by 13 per cent. Since leaving politics, he has continued to call for the phasing-out of coal power and through Bloomberg Philanthropies, created a $500m (£372m) fund dedicated to closing coal plants and transitioning to cleaner energy sources.

In January, Bloomberg said his philanthropies arm would step in to cover US funding for the United Nations’ climate budget after President Trump said he would end the country’s international climate funding and withdraw from the terms of the Paris Agreement.

19. Kathryn Murdoch

Kathryn Murdoch isn’t just funding climate action, she’s also playing a part in reshaping it and is able to push for systemic environmental change. As co-founder of the Quadrivium Foundation, along with her husband James Murdoch – son of media mogul Rupert – she backs science-backed initiatives that drive climate action, strengthen democracy, and promote ocean health. A former strategist at the Clinton Climate Initiative, Murdoch has spent over a decade pushing for better climate solutions.

She sits on the boards of the Environmental Defense Fund, Climate Central, and the Climate Leadership Council, informing high-level climate strategy. In 2023, she co-launched Futurific Studios to tell hopeful, solutions-focused stories about the planet’s future, including the PBS docuseries A Brief History of the Future, showing what a better world could actually look like.

NGOs, Non-Profits & Philanthropists

20. Jennifer Morgan

Jennifer Morgan has been a central figure in international climate policy for over two decades, contributing to the climate crisis response through activism, diplomacy, and leadership in global climate negotiations.

She became Germany’s special envoy for international climate action in 2022, the first person to hold the role, and now steers Germany’s climate policy on the world stage, where she’s working towards a faster shift to renewable energy sources.

She’s incredibly experienced in the sector and has held previous roles at some of the industry’s biggest hitters, including working at the Climate Action Network in the Nineties, leading the WWF’s Global Climate Change Program and then taking on the role of global climate change director for the think tank E3G.

She is also the former CEO of Greenpeace International. Recently, after protests at Cop29 in Baku, she spoke out about how she thinks the events are essential, as every country in the world has a seat at the table.

21. Bill Gates

Though best known for founding Microsoft and his philanthropy through the Gates Foundation, Bill Gates is pouring a significant amount of his time and wealth into tackling the climate crisis. He founded the investment firm Breakthrough Energy in 2015, which backs tech companies focused on climate solutions.

His approach to net zero is grounded in his tech world background. In an interview with Fortune he said “planting trees will not solve the climate problem” and added that “doing climate policy by brute force will not work either”.

He believes the answer is to “invest in new technologies for carbon removal, clean energy, and electric vehicles and to implement policies like carbon taxes that could fund future green technologies”. Over the past few months, Gates has tailored his climate efforts less toward investing, given the headwinds against climate action from the Trump administration, and more towards encouraging climate entrepreneurship to lay the seeds for future innovation.

In his 2021 book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, he outlined a comprehensive plan for reaching net zero emissions, emphasising the importance of global cooperation and innovation.

22. Rita Maria El Zaghloul

With just 17 per cent of the world’s land and a mere 8 per cent of its oceans under formal protection, the planet remains acutely vulnerable to biodiversity loss and ecological collapse. Rita Maria El Zaghloul is working towards changing that.

As the 2024 Earthshot prize winner in the Revive Our Oceans category, El Zaghloul is at the forefront of a global push to protect at least 30 per cent of the world’s land and oceans by 2030. She leads the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, an alliance focused on preserving carbon sinks, boosting ecosystem resilience, and halting destructive practices like illegal overfishing and the extraction of resources.

Under her, it has already secured support from over 120 countries, and now she’s pushing for accountability, ensuring commitments are turned into tangible action. Progress is visible though, as nearly 50 member states have begun strengthening conservation laws, like Chile’s expansion of marine protected areas to around 1.5 million square kilometres.

El Zaghloul’s work is essential for creating a coordinated defence of the planet’s remaining wild spaces, before they’re gone.

23. Alice Ruhweza

Alice Ruhweza is one of Africa’s most respected voices in sustainable development, with nearly three decades of experience working at the intersection of climate, agriculture, and economic policy. In March, she took on one of the most influential roles in African agriculture as president of AGRA (the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa), an organisation that drives climate-resilient and inclusive farming systems.

Her appointment comes at a critical time, as Africa faces the converging crises of climate shocks, food insecurity, and biodiversity loss. She previously led WWF Africa’s regional work on regenerative agrifood systems and spearheaded data-driven environmental policy as co-director of the Vital Signs Program at Conservation International.

At UNDP, she mobilised an estimated $1bn (£743m) for green projects in more than 40 African countries. Now at AGRA, Ruhweza’s focus is to champion homegrown solutions, empower smallholder farmers, and ensure Africa’s agricultural transformation is both just and ecologically sound.

24. Mithika Mwenda

Mithika Mwenda is the co-founder and executive director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), a collection of more than 70 non-governmental organisations that have come together to address problems around the climate crisis.

Mwenda has worked in the climate sector for a decade and has a strong influence over climate policy. He advocates for sustainable solutions that are specifically tailored to the needs of African countries rather than those of the Western world, while also ensuring Africa’s development.

At Cop29 last year in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mwenda delivered a powerful appeal, rejecting the burden of loans on African nations and advocating instead for grant-based, equitable climate finance. He stressed the importance of justice for accessible, affordable funding for the communities who are most vulnerable to climate risk.

In 2023, the PACJA criticised the decision to appoint oil executive Sultan al-Jaber to lead Cop28, a move it called the “lowest moment” for the UN. In May last year, the PACJA hosted the UN Civil Society Conference in Kenya – the first time the event has been held there – as a precursor to the Summit of the Future at the UN in New York this month.

25. Ann Lee

Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which reached a magnitude of 7 and tragically killed more than 220,000, Ann Lee co-founded a crisis relief organisation, Community Organized Relief Effort (Core), along with actor Sean Penn.

Lee has been the CEO since 2015, and has led the relief efforts across the world including, the Ukraine invasion, the Sudan War, Covid-19 Pandemic, Pakistan floods and Hurricane Helene.

She works on preparedness efforts with communities around the world to help them bolster against climate-driven disasters, such as watershed management, agroforestry, biodiversity protection, and soil conservation, where Lee and Penn often highlight the role human impact plays a part in the increasing disasters.

They work in disaster-prone regions like North Carolina which suffers from hurricanes and Northern California that's prone to wildfires, working alongside local communities to strengthen infrastructure and reduce vulnerability to extreme weather exacerbated by climate change. Earlier this year, Core focused its emergency response efforts on the Los Angeles wildfire.

26. Boyan Slat

Boyan Slat is a Dutch inventor and entrepreneur who founded The Ocean Cleanup in 2013 when he was just 18 years old, after he went scuba diving off the coast of Greece and noticed more plastic in the ocean than fish.

The project centers around a giant plastic tube with a thick nylon screen that can trap plastic as small as a millimeter in size but won't ensnare any sea creatures.

Slat, now aged 31, recently announced a project that plans to stop some of the plastics entering the ocean in the first place. He will deploy the technology to the rivers of around 30 cities to catch plastic as it makes its way out toward the oceans.

The Ocean Cleanup, a non-profit based in the Netherlands, announced this past spring that it has captured more than 11.5 million tonnes of plastic this year, more than all the previous years combined.

27. Mafalda Duarte

Mafalda Duarte is executive director of the Green Climate Fund, which claims to be the largest multilateral climate fund in the world, with a portfolio of $18bn (£13.3) in approved funding for projects.

Born in Portugal, Duarte has spent her career working in more than 30 developing countries on climate projects. She also managed the Climate Investment Funds, a pool of more than $8bn being put to work in more than 70 developing countries. Before that, she worked at the African Development Bank and World Bank.

She recently spoke about the potential for Brazil to play a major role in developing climate finance and is expected to be a key player at the United Nations climate summit, Cop30, in Belem, Brazil in November.

28. Inger Andersen

Inger Andersen is a Danish economist who leads the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep). Her recent achievements include leading global negotiations on plastic pollution, which have been moving ever closer towards an international, legally binding deal to tackle a burgeoning global problem, both for the environment and public health. However, negotiations have failed in the past few months to finalise a treaty. Europe wants to reduce the creation of plastic, while oil states such as Russia want to increase recycling programmes instead.

“To stop plastic pollution, we need to start at the start and end at the end,” she said at an event last year. “This means crafting an instrument that ensures we use fewer virgin materials and less problematic plastic. That we design for circularity. That we use, reuse and recycle resources more efficiently. This is the instrument we need to protect human and ecosystem health – while ensuring a just transition and space for the private sector to thrive in a new sustainable economy.”

Though there have been deadlocks, there's hope to regroup to review the treaty.

29. Juan Carlos Jintiach

Ecuadorian-born Juan Carlos Jintiach has dedicated his life to ensuring indigenous communities’ voices are heard on the frontlines of the climate movement. He is a member of the Shuar People of the Ecuadorian Amazon, and is calling for world leaders to listen to them, emphasising that the crisis stems from a broken relationship with nature and says indigenous people's knowledge is integral to the solutions.

As executive secretary of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities (GATC), he represents 35 million people managing vast swathes of forests across 24 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. He believes Indigenous communities are the best stewards of their territories, having lived in harmony with nature for generations.

The GATC have established Shandia, which is a platform that is dedicated to supporting and directing Indigenous funds, and ensuring accurate tracking of them. He is also a technical adviser for the Coordinator of Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin (COICA), a major Amazonian Indigenous federation. For his work, in 2023 he was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize.

30. Dame Lisbet Rausing

As heiress to Sweden’s Tetra-Pak business, a science historian, co-founder of philanthropic foundations Arcadia and the Lund Trust, and a landowner in Scotland, Dame Lisbet Rausing has many strings to her bow. Collectively, they all play a part in her environmental work.

Dame Lisbet owns the 57,000-acre Corrour Estate in the Scottish Highlands, and since 2015 has worked on environmental projects including deer management, planting native woodlands, restoring peat bogs and reintroducing red squirrels.

The Arcadia Fund, which Dame Lisbet co-founded, has donated more than $1.3bm (£996m) to environmental causes and this year received a damehood for her philanthropic work.

Last year, Corrour Estate joined Loch Abar Mòr, a nature preservation partnership that already included the National Trust for Scotland, Glenaladale Estate, The Woodland Trust, Glen Nevis Estate and the Nevis Landscape Partnership. Together, they will restore a large part of the Lochaber area in the Highlands to make it more ecologically diverse and so more resilient to the effects of the climate crisis over the next 50 years.

31. MacKenzie Scott

An author and philanthropist, MacKenzie Scott is still perhaps best-known for who she used to be married to – Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But since 2019, she has emerged as a major force in environmental giving.

She has given $19.2bn (£14bn) via more than 400 grants in the past five years, including almost 200 grants worth $2bn last December alone.

Scott has donated $15m to Global Fishing Watch, an independent nonprofit that creates and shares data on the ocean to increase the transparency of fisheries and help improve marine resilience. She has also donated $20m to Blue Ventures, which supports coastal communities and small-scale fishing operations.

Scott’s approach to funding is unique: her grants are “unrestricted”, which gives organisations more autonomy and helps empower grassroots groups living and working on the frontline of environmental issues.

32. Rena Lee

As Singapore’s Ambassador for Oceans and Law, Rena Lee advocates for the vital but often overlooked relationship between ocean health and climate. Her work shows ocean governance is essential to climate resilience to protect the planet’s largest, yet most neglected, climate regulator, the ocean.

Lee played a pivotal role in the landmark United Nations High Seas Treaty in 2023, the first-ever international agreement to protect biodiversity in international waters, covering nearly two-thirds of the world’s oceans. This treaty represents a major breakthrough, enabling the creation of protected marine areas beyond national jurisdictions and offering a lifeline to the ocean’s ability to regulate the climate. For her work on this, she was recognised as one of Time's 100 most influential people.

In late 2024, she spoke at the International Court of Justice, urging world leaders to take their legal duties on climate change seriously.

33. Helen Clarkson

After tackling humanitarian crises while working for Médecins Sans Frontières in countries including Sudan and Pakistan, Helen Clarkson moved her career focus to the planet’s wellbeing.

Now she's the CEO of the Climate Group, a non-profit driving businesses towards net-zero emissions, which also runs the annual Climate Week event, held every September in New York. Clarkson is responsible for taking Climate Week from its humble beginnings in 2009 as a panel discussion to the globally important, myriad of events it is now. She advocates for systemic change, pushing for ambitious climate policies and fostering collaboration between businesses and governments.

Clarkson emphasised that energy affordability and climate action must be addressed together. In 2022, she was awarded an OBE for services to environmentalism and supporting the UK’s presidency of Cop26.

Food & Agriculture

34. Doug McMaster

Claiming to be the world’s first zero waste restaurant is a lofty claim, but it’s one that owner and chef Doug McMaster can attain to as there aren’t bins in his restaurant.

Silo first opened in Brighton in 2014, and later moved to east London’s Hackney Wick. Everything in the restaurant is reused or recycled. Beyond the food, the furniture is upcycled or recycled and tables are made from recycled plastics too.

His most recent project is using koji, a traditional Japanese mould, to ferment hard-to-reuse food scraps giving them new life to produce misos and fermented sauces like shoyus and garums, which can be used as flavour enhancers for dishes in the restaurant.

McMaster’s work is not just about food, it’s about creating a scalable solution to hospitality’s food waste and he’s a pioneer in how waste can be drastically limited and reused within the industry.

35. Chantelle Nicholson

One of just 36 UK chefs awarded a Green Michelin Star, Chantelle Nicholson is a leader in regenerative practices in the food world. At her Mayfair restaurant Apricity, her regenerative ethos runs through everything, as Nicholson believes in going beyond simply “sustaining” to actively regenerating.

She’s a powerhouse for championing seasonal and local produce, innovatively minimising food waste and excess packaging, and avoiding unnecessary energy use, down to details like using rechargeable candles instead of single use and switching off unused fridges, preventing energy waste, which is rife in busy working kitchens.

This year Nicholson is expanding her vision and branching out from London with a new project, Fjora a restaurant in the 1 Hotel in Copenhagen. It follows her regenerative ethos with a Nordic-inspired menu that’s deeply rooted in her connection to nature.

36. Caroline Bennett

After struggling to source sustainable and ethically caught fish for her sushi restaurant, Moshi Moshi in London’s Liverpool Street station, Caroline Bennett took a leap of faith, and did it herself.

Setting up Sole of Discretion in 2016, an ethical online fishmonger, she connected the dots between fishers in Plymouth harbour with not only her London restaurant, but also people at home who could buy quality British fish, knowing exactly where it came from. Supporting small-scale, low-impact fisheries, she works with small day boats that don’t have the same damaging impact on the ocean as industrial boats do. Each fish is traceable, labelled with information on where it was caught, the method, the name of the skipper and the boat, as for too long, all of this information was lost at port.

This year, she’s working with Scottish charity, Open Seas, on its #DivedNotDredged Campaign, which is amplifying the intense desolation dredgers cause to the ocean bed, which can take up to 10 years to recover after just one dredge. Instead it champions the far less impactful hand-dived scallops. It also reflects the important message of Sir David Attenborough’s seismic documentary Ocean, which focuses on this very issue.

37. Andy Cato

Andy Cato, former electronic musician and half of Groove Armada, made an unexpected shift from music to farming almost two decades ago. After selling his music rights, he bought a farm in France and became deeply invested in soil health, biodiversity, and access to better food systems. This led him to become a voice for regenerative agriculture, where he advocates for the importance of farming regeneratively, looking after soil and water health, and food security.

Cato brought this message to a mainstream audience through a guest appearance on Clarkson’s Farm, where he successfully encouraged Jeremy Clarkson to trial regenerative practices, which he’s continued.

In 2018, Cato co-founded Wildfarmed with former broadcaster George Lamb and finance expert Edd Lees. The company now works with over 150 farms across the UK and France, all adhering to a set of agreed regenerative methods Wildfarmed laid out, including maintaining crop cover, integrating livestock, and avoiding synthetic pesticides.

Wildfarmed produces flour and bread for both wholesale and consumers, aiming to make regenerative food systems affordable and accessible to all, and so is available in supermarkets. Their work blends innovation, ecological responsibility, and social equity in the quest for a healthier food future.

38. Dr Mariangela Hungria

Dr Mariangela Hungria, a Brazilian agronomist and microbiologist, was named the 2025 World Food Prize Laureate, an honour often referred to as the Nobel Prize for Agriculture. The award recognises her four decades of pioneering research into biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) as a sustainable alternative to synthetic nitrogen fertilisers.

Working with Brazil’s Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), Dr Hungria has developed innovative microbial inoculants that enable crops, particularly soybeans, beans, and other legumes, to naturally absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere. Her work has transformed tropical agriculture, improving soil health, reducing input costs, and minimising environmental damage.

Today, her BNF methods are applied to more than 40 million hectares of Brazilian farmland, saving farmers up to $40bn (£30bn) annually and avoiding more than 180 million metric tons of CO2 emissions each year. Her research also supports global climate goals by reducing dependence on fossil fuel-derived fertilisers and increasing long-term agricultural resilience.

39. Vandana Shiva

A former physicist, Dr Vandana Shiva became an activist in the 1970s and has gone on to focus her work on protecting seeds and food sovereignty, which she’s regarded as the leading voice on. She famously campaigned against laws that would prevent farmers saving, sharing, or replanting seeds, which would give big corporations ownership of seeds and destroy traditional farming. To protect them, she set up more than 150 seed banks in India.

In her work, she also advocates for ecology, environmentalism and eco-feminism – a branch of the movement that combines feminism with political ecology. A key part of that is the “invisible” work women do that goes unnoticed, but is key to protecting the environment, such as water collection.

She believes an intersectional approach is key to climate adaptation and justice, which she sees as a biodiverse women and community-led approach to agriculture, especially in more climate-vulnerable regions. To promote this, she set up her own NGO, Navdanya.

40. Nidhi Pant

Combating food waste, rural poverty and gender inequality – three of the Indian farming community’s biggest issues – is S4S Technologies, which was co-founded in 2013 by Nidhi Pant and six university friends.

It creates pioneering solar-powered dehydrators, which are used to prevent food waste. By drying food out without using electricity, it enables rural smallholder farmers to financially benefit from being able to sell their entire crop. Previously around 30 per cent could be lost due to bad weather, being misshapen or market price fluctuations. It’s a life-changing move for rural farmers living in poverty.

Since it began, S4S Technologies has helped provide sustainable incomes for around 300,000 rural farming women across 400 villages, vastly improving gender inequality in the process. Pant was awarded the Earthshot Prize in 2023 by Prince William. The team has prevented 60,000 tonnes of food waste and averted 300,000 tonnes of C02 emissions.

41. Sean Sherman

Chef Sean Sherman, a member of the Oglala Lakota Sioux tribe, wanted to preserve his own heritage, so he founded The Sioux Chef, which promotes food sovereignty and educates others on Indigenous cultures and the importance of their environmental stewardship.

His ethos is to source local, wild and heirloom ingredients and follow the sustainable practices that Indigenous communities have used for generations.

This November, he’ll be publishing his latest cookbook, Turtle Island, which is the Indigenous name for North America. He’s also working on a new hub for indigenous food culture, Wóyute Thipi (meaning ‘food building’ in the Dakota language), which is set to open in Minneapolis later this year.

In 2021 Sherman and restaurateur Dana Thompson founded the restaurant Owamni (which translates to the place of falling, swirling water) in Minneapolis. The following year, it won the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. It’s mostly staffed by Indigenous people and serves Indigenous dishes without ingredients introduced by Europeans, such as butter and sugar. Since 2023, it has been run as a non-profit. For his work, Sherman won the prestigious Julia Child Award in 2023.

Activists

42. Pua Lay Peng

Nicknamed the Erin Brockovich of Malaysia, former chemist Pua Lay Peng became an activist after realising her community in Jenjarom, in the state of Selangor, was suffering from the devastating effects of the increased amount of plastic being illegally dumped there.

The crisis escalated after China banned plastic waste imports in 2018. Illegal plastic recycling factories opened, emitted toxic fumes with an acrid smell in the air, polluted waterways, and left residents suffering from respiratory issues and fatigue.

To combat it, she co-founded the Kuala Langat Environmental group (Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala). Peng has rallied everyone in the community to push for action from local authorities, and has even faced death threats for it.

She’s been successful in shutting down more than 300 illegal recycling factories by visiting sites, filming it and posting it to YouTube, but more are beginning to reappear again. They’ve improved both the air and water quality and empowered communities to succeed in regional action, not only in her community but across the country too.

43. Ayisha Siddiqa

At just 26 years old, Ayisha Siddiqa has achieved a lot as a climate justice and human rights advocate. She campaigns for Indigenous people’s rights and the rights of women, who she recognises are disproportionately affected by floods and other devastation caused by the climate crisis.

Born in Pakistan, she moved to Brooklyn as a child, and believes solutions to the crisis are too often developed from a global North perspective, which doesn’t work for many of the countries worst affected.

At just 14, she saw the effects of climate change not only on the environment, but also on humans, after family members in Pakistan became ill from polluted river water. This led her to get involved in climate activism, and she went on to found her university’s branch of Extinction Rebellion in 2019 and lead a strike involving 300,000 people. In 2020 she co-founded Polluters Out, a global youth movement, and helped create an activist training course, the Fossil Free University.

She is also a climate advisor to the UN secretary general and UN youth envoy. This year she’s studying law at UCLA in Los Angeles, where she’s gearing up to tackle the climate crisis not just in the streets, but in the courtroom, to push for systemic change.

44. Bill McKibben

Author, environmentalist and activist Bill McKibben has been a key climate protest organiser for decades and has made many contributions to the fight, including being awarded the Gandhi Peace Award in 2013. In 1989, he wrote The End of Nature, which is widely recognised as the first book for a general audience about climate change and is still in print in 24 languages.

This year, his key driving message is that solar energy is the path to a greener future, and is pushing for the clean energy source to be more widely adopted. He has organised the inaugural Sun Day, a national day calling for action, on 21 September, chosen as it’s one of two solar equinox days. It’s also the subject of his new book, Here Comes the Sun: A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization, published this month.

He co-founded the global grassroots organisation 350.org in 2008, which aims to end our reliance on fossil fuels. The name is an ode to climate scientist James Hansen, who warned that any atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide above 350 parts per million (ppm) was unsafe. Currently, the planet’s concentration is over 420ppm. In 2021, he founded Third Act, an activist group for older environmentalists, with the support of big names including Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda.

45. Greta Thunberg

Aged just 22, Greta Thunberg has dedicated her life to the climate crisis and already achieved what other activists have struggled to do by bringing the severity and urgency of the climate crisis into homes across the world. So impactful has she been, it’s been dubbed the “Greta effect”.

To reduce her carbon footprint, she became vegan and refused to travel by aeroplane, aged just eight. In 2018, Thunberg inspired a global movement after holding her first school climate strike outside the Swedish parliament, which called for the end of reliance on fossil fuels. She was just 15 and inspired thousands of students around the world to join her Fridays for Future strikes.

Since then, she’s consistently called out world leaders in her sharp speeches for their inaction on climate change, including last November when she protested Cop29 being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, saying the authoritarian petrostate was given a chance to greenwash its human rights abuses.

Thunberg was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize every year between 2019 and 2023. In 2019, she became the youngest person to be named Time magazine’s Person of the Year. In 2022, she published The Climate Book, a “book of the year” for many top publications. She has also inspired others with Asperger’s (which she calls her superpower) to feel included and take a stand.

Since finishing her schooling in 2023, Thunberg ramped up her activism, including in the past year in support of Gaza. Last year, she was acquitted of charges of blocking an oil conference. After the verdict, she said: “We must remember who the real enemy is.”

46. Nemonte Nenquimo

She is the first woman president of the Waorani people of Pastaza and co-founder of the Indigenous-led, non-profit organisation, Ceibo Alliance, which is the first of its kind between four ancestral nations within Ecuador, Peru and Colombia.

She won a case against the Ecuadorian government in 2019, protecting half a million acres of Waorani ancestral land in the Amazon rainforest from oil drilling. It set a landmark legal precedent to protect a further seven million acres from planned oil auctions. But now, it’s under threat once again.

She told The Independent last year: “I’ve often thought that it must be easy to destroy what you don’t understand,"" which is why she co-wrote her debut book last year, We Will Not Be Saved, with her husband Mitch Anderson. The memoir is one of hope and resistance and was well reviewed by critics.

She was the first Indigenous woman to be included on the Time 100 list, and she was one of six environmental leaders to be awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize. In 2020, the United Nations Environment Programme awarded her its Champions of the Earth award in the category Inspiration and Action.

47. Neeshad Shafi

Qatar regularly experiences some of the world’s highest temperatures, which regularly hit 44C, but can reach as high as an unbearable 50C.

As co-founder of the Arab Youth Climate Movement Qatar (AYCM), Neeshad Shafi has created a first-of-its-kind study on public perceptions of climate change in his home country, as he says “global warming” is over and the period of “global boiling” has begun.

Through his work, Shafi attempts to change the minds of the proportion of people in Qatar who don’t believe in the climate crisis, by showing them how the effects will impact them. One of the biggest battles Shafi has faced is some people’s belief that they can’t do anything to help change the situation, and countering that view is a major focus for him. In June this year, he was involved in the Doha Climate Talks, which focused on demanding action to address the crisis.

48. Julia Olson

Julia Olson is the founder and executive director of Our Children’s Trust, a not-for-profit law firm which empowers young people to hold governments accountable for their climate inaction.

It has won several landmark cases against state and local governments over the right to a healthy environment, including high-profile cases suing the US government for prioritising fossil fuels over ensuring a safe climate for future generations. Cases have been won across Montana, Colombia, Germany, and South Korea.

Last year, the US Supreme Court rejected a petition to review a constitutional climate lawsuit against the US government after a lower court rejected it. Attorneys in the case of Juliana vs United States vowed to fight on in other legal avenues.

Olson, an attorney, founded the trust in 2010 while pregnant with her second child and after watching Al Gore’s climate documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, where it dawned on her that future generations could be left with a near-devastated world without drastic action.

49. Wawa Gatheru

Kenyan-American climate activist Wawa Gatheru is the founder of Black Girl Environmentalist, which supports women of colour and gender expansive people. Its aim is to create a representative and inclusive climate movement, and to champion Black women as the leaders they already are. It is now one of the biggest Black youth-led climate organisations in the US, making her a powerful voice for underrepresented communities.

Last year, she spoke at The Independent’s inaugural Climate 100 event and told the audience, “There’s no such thing as a perfect environmentalist,” hitting back at the idea that people who care about the climate crisis must be perfectionists.

She was aware of the climate crisis while growing up, but came to the realisation that those most affected by it – people of colour – were generally not the same people making the decisions. She saw that the narrative for people of colour was more likely to be “victim” than “problem solver”, and also recognised that women had even less of a voice. Instead, she works to ensure Black voices are also at the centre of the climate movement too.

50. Desmond Alugnoa

Climate activist and co-founder of the Green Africa Youth Organization (GAYO), a Ghana-based NGO, is Desmond Alugnoa, who is tackling waste, air pollution, and environmental injustice. In 2024, GAYO won the Earthshot Prize in the “clean our air” category for its Zero Waste Model, an innovative community-based system that reduces landfill use, stops open waste burning, and creates dignified green jobs for waste workers.

The organisation’s work not only improves public health and air quality but also helps build local, circular economies and climate-resilient communities.

The Earthshot recognition came with £1m in funding to scale the project, and Alugnoa is aiming to reduce air pollution by up to 70 per cent and divert thousands of tonnes of waste by 2030.

51. Raoni Metuktire

Spending his lifetime protecting the Amazon, the chief of Brazil’s Kayapo tribe, Raoni Metuktire is now 93 years old, and hasn’t slowed down yet. One of Brazil’s most influential people, he’s often referred to as the most effective protector of the Amazon, yet growing up following a nomadic lifestyle in the Amazon, he didn’t encounter the outside world until age 22.

Even a decade ago, as reported by The Independent, Metuktire said the developed world was intent on “destroying everything” and urged its citizens to fundamentally change the way they think. At last year's New York Climate Week, he called on global leaders to reflect on their responsibilities to help end extractive and illegal mining and logging, which are making way for increasing droughts and wildfires.

He became famous after campaigning with pop star Sting (also in this list) and his wife Trudie Styler in the late 1980s, to prevent hydroelectric dams being built on the Xingu River, a major tributary of the Amazon.

His memoir, Memórias do Cacique (The Chief’s Memoirs) was published in July, where he claimed Brazil's previous right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, wanted to exterminate the country’s Indigenous people. This year, he met with Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and warned him of the devastating effects of oil drilling. Here, Metuktire was also awarded the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit, Brazil’s highest civilian honour, recognising his lifetime of defending the environment and Indigenous rights.

Entertainment, Royalty & Sport

52. Billie Eilish

Multi-award-winning singer-songwriter Billie Eilish is the epitome of a Gen Z’er using their platform (she has a whopping 125 million followers on Instagram alone) to spread their message.

As a vegan since the age of 12, she ensures that only vegan food is sold at her gigs, though this has been controversial lately for some fans. She also asks the venues to encourage fans to come with reusable water bottles and makes sure there are refill stations to avoid plastic waste.

She ran her own climate event, OVERHEATED, in both London and Berlin this year, and will be debuting in the US soon. It’s based on the 2022 documentary she released of the same name, and brings together activists, musicians and designers discussing the biggest issues surrounding the climate crisis and calling on people to take action.

At her concerts, she also has “Eco Villages”, which is described as a hub to raise awareness of the climate crisis, and inspires fans to connect with environmental groups, learn more about a plant-based diet and to understand the detrimental effects of fast fashion.

53. Don Cheadle

Actor and Goodwill United Nations Ambassador Don Cheadle has previously asked, “What is more important than food and clean air?” Such a simple sentence, which gets to the crux of what we’re fighting for, serves as a simple reminder of the key issues at stake.

He was one of the founders of the humanitarian Not On Our Watch Project in 2008, which has since merged with The Sentry organisation, involving other celebrities including George Clooney and Matt Damon. The organisation urges leaders to protect vulnerable, marginalised and displaced communities, such as those in Darfur in Sudan. For this work, he and Clooney were awarded the Summit Peace Award.

Cheadle also worked with actor Harrison Ford to create Years of Living Dangerously, a documentary TV series tackling climate issues.

He’s a member of the board of directors for the Solutions Project (co-founded by actor Mark Ruffalo, also in this list), which has supported more than 300 community organisations fighting for climate justice in 45 states, and highlights racial and gender inequities.

Last September, as part of the Our Kids’ Climate initiative, Cheadle combined his parental role with his climate action work, urging the importance of protecting the planet for future generations. He signed an open letter along with more than 150 other parents including actors Emma Thompson and Julianne Moore.

54. Jessie Diggins

As a board member of POW, (Protect Our Winters), one of the world’s largest climate advocacy groups, American cross-country skier Jessie Diggins vocalises how increasingly warming winters are changing not only winter sports, but also the lives of the communities who live on and around the snow and have a reliance on it.

As a two-time cross-country World Cup champion who has been competing for 15 years, she says she’s seen winters change dramatically and speaks about the severity of winter environments disappearing before our eyes. In an interview last November, she said: “I will not shut up and ski,” highlighting the importance of the voices of people who see climate issues first hand too.

Ahead of the Nordic World Championships in Trondheim in February, Diggins and her teammates debuted race suits featuring images of melting glaciers, an impactful visual no one could ignore. She also endorsed the ban on PFAS chemicals in ski wax on the World Cup circuit, marking a major step toward reducing the environmental footprint of snow sports.

55. Jane Fonda

Activism has long been an important part of life for Jane Fonda. Many years since her days of anti-Vietnam war campaigning in the 1960s, the 87-year-old Oscar-winning actor now channels her energy into climate activism.

Earlier this year, Fonda became involved in the conservation of the Amazon rainforest, aligning with Amazon Frontlines and the Ceibo Alliance, an Indigenous-led coalition representing multiple tribes (also featured in this list under Nemonte Nenquimo’s entry), to protect their ancestral lands. The aim is to convince Ecuador’s Constitutional Court to enshrine the rights of Indigenous people, which allows them to decide what happens in their home, and means they must be informed before any action is taken. It follows Ecuador’s president Daniel Noboa’s plans to auction off more than 8 million acres of Amazonian Indigenous lands to oil companies.

Fonda has been arrested five times for civil disobedience while marching and protesting in recent years. In 2019 alongside Greenpeace, she launched Fire Drill Fridays, a series of weekly protests in Washington DC to urge political leaders to take stronger action on climate change. These protests, inspired by Greta Thunberg, galvanised public support and then became educational virtual events that educated people about climate justice, sustainability, and environmental policy, until it ended last year.

She also founded the Jane Fonda Climate Political Action Committee in 2022, which raises money to defeat the fossil fuel industry’s influence on US politics and elect climate champions across government.

56. Lewis Pugh

British-South African former maritime lawyer Lewis Pugh is an endurance swimmer and prominent speaker on the effects of the climate crisis on our rivers and oceans. He completes long-distance swims in some of the planet’s most vulnerable and challenging waters – including the Arctic and Antarctic – to highlight the importance of marine conservation.

In May, he took on a 62-mile swim in 8C waters around Martha’s Vineyard, an island off the coast of Cape Cod. It’s known as the filming location for Jaws, which turned 50 this year, and was tied into his event’s aim to raise awareness for the critical need for shark conservation, and to change the public’s perception of them as vicious, cold-blooded killers. He was the first person ever to achieve this.

In 2023, he swam all 315 miles of the Hudson River and wrote an opinion piece about it for The Independent to highlight the importance of clean rivers. He also became the first person to swim the full length of the River Thames in 2006. The previous year, he swam 100 miles across the Red Sea to underline the impact of climate change on fragile coral reefs. He is a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, and part of the 30x30 campaign, which aims to protect 30 per cent of the world’s oceans by 2030. His work, and epic swims, are inspiring global efforts to safeguard marine ecosystems.

57. Mark Ruffalo

The anti-fracking movement’s most famous face, actor Mark Ruffalo has been an environmentalist for years, and uses the term “fractivists” to describe this particular branch of activism.

In 2016 he, Colin Firth and the late Vivienne Westwood wrote an open letter to then prime minister David Cameron to oppose fracking. In 2013, he co-founded The Solutions Project, an organisation committed to promoting 100 per cent renewable energy. In February 2024, Ruffalo worked with politicians to ban a new type of fracking, which swaps the use of water for pressurised carbon dioxide to get at methane trapped in shale. Fracking companies say this is a carbon-neutral fuel operation, but “fractivists” disagree.

Last October, he urged people to sign a petition to prevent the Irish Green Party from passing a “bill to fast track building liquid natural gas terminals that would import fracked gas from the United States”, he said in a video he posted to his Instagram. He’s also joining fellow members of SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) in calling for their pension fund to divest more than an estimated $100m (£74m) from fossil fuel stocks, and instead reinvest in green funds.

58. Sting

A British singer and an Amazonian tribal chief may seem unlikely friends, but environmentalism brought Sting and Chief Raoni Metuktire (also included in this list) of the Brazilian Kayapo tribe together.

After Metuktire asked for Sting’s help in protecting their Indigenous land and people, he and Sting, along with his wife Trudie Styler, founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund, a charity dedicated to raising awareness of deforestation and the rights of Indigenous people. For nearly four decades, the fund has donated to projects that have saved 28 million acres in 20 different rainforest countries.

More recently, in January, Sting performed at FireAid in LA, the concert held to raise money for those affected, following the devastating wildfires that burned through the area, destroying more than 22,000 homes and 40,000 acres. The set included a rendition of the repurposed song, Message in a Bottle – a powerful call for action on climate change. The newer version was aimed at world leaders attending Cop26 that year in Glasgow, urging them to “do something now” for the planet.

59. King Charles III and Prince William

Since he was a young man, King Charles III has been a green champion, long before sustainability became the buzzword it is today. It’s a trait that appears to have been passed down to his son and heir, Prince William, who has picked up the baton and launched his own initiative to tackle the climate crisis.

The king was head of the Duchy Estate for seven decades (a role now passed to Prince William), and he has been a tireless champion of organic food and agriculture.

For his unwavering focus on green issues, Tony Juniper, chair of Natural England and former director of Friends of the Earth, praised the king as “possibly the most significant environmentalist in history”. It is something that he has continued since ascending to the throne, installing the first solar panels on Windsor Castle and using biofuel in royal cars as he strives to reach net zero within the palace walls.

Prince William, who has followed in the footsteps of his environmentalist father and philanthropist mother, used his speech at the celebrations for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in 2022 to talk about the crisis. Although we have “increased our awareness of the impact humans have on our world, our planet has become more fragile”, he said, adding “the pressing need to protect and restore our planet has never been more urgent”.

This year, he supported Dartmoor peatland restoration and the planting of hundreds of saplings in Wistman’s Wood there too. He also launched a documentary series, Guardians, spotlighting wildlife rangers working in perilous conditions across habitats like the Amazon, Himalayas, and Africa.

His flagship initiative is the Earthshot Prize, launched five years ago. It supports young innovators from around the world in their ambitious attempts to solve our biggest environmental problems, from ocean pollution to poor air quality, by awarding five winners with £1m each.

60. Arnold Schwarzenegger

The former bodybuilding champion, movie star and politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has long been a proponent of fighting the climate crisis, which he said is an ineffective term that should instead be called just pollution.

He formed the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative in 2017 to “terminate pollution” and has been actively campaigning for smart solutions to mitigate climate change and for less political rhetoric.

Speaking in June at the Austrian World Summit, which he helps organise each year and is a key event in the climate calendar, Schwarzenegger challenged world leaders and climate advocates to “stop whining” and to focus on doing something in terms of workable solutions to help battle global warming.

During his time as governor of California two decades ago, Schwarzenegger was one of the first politicians to advocate transitioning to clean energy and finding ways to cut harmful carbon in places such as San Diego.

Politics & Government

61. Mark Carney

As prime minister of Canada, Mark Carney faces a climate challenge far bigger than in any of his previous roles, which included governor of the Bank of England and before that, governor of the Bank of Canada.

A long-time advocate for using the financial industry to help fight global warming by leading a transition to renewable energy, Carney was a mainstay on the global environmental conference circuit.

Since he was elected prime minister, Carney now runs one of the largest oil producing nations. He must balance his enthusiasm for a green energy transition in Canada and around the world with the energy politics in his country.

Carney scrapped an unpopular consumer carbon tax soon after being elected. He is considering imposing a carbon border tax to impose on importing countries with weaker environmental rules but so far that is still being studied.

62. Ed Miliband

As the former leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband's commitment to finding solutions to the climate crisis has run deep through his career. As the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, the role is similar to the one he held 15 years ago when Labour was last in government, where he played a pivotal role in shaping the UK’s Climate Change Act in 2008.

Shortly after he was re-appointed to the role following Labour's win last year, Miliband lifted the offshore wind ban and increased the renewable energy budget to a record figure of more than £1.5bn.

More recently, he's brought in the Great British Energy Act, which became law in May and aims to speed up the UK’s shift to renewable energy. He also delivered the first of what he plans to be an annual speech on Climate Crisis and Nature Decline, where he stated the two crises are inseparable. In the speech, he warned: “We must act on the climate and nature crisis to protect our British way of life, because no sector or part of our society is immune from those risks.”

63. Claudia Sheinbaum

Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is a climate scientist with a strong background in renewable energy projects. She has contributed to the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and as mayor of Mexico City she worked to put solar panels in public places and electrify the city's transportation system.

Her presidential campaign included a commitment to invest more than $13bn (£10.4bn) in clean energy by 2030, but now that she is president she faces challenges in weighing her climate-fighting desires against the importance of Mexico's oil-producing legacy. In particular, she must tread lightly in her handling of Pemex, the state-owned energy company, which is a national leader in fossil fuel production.

Sheinbaum has also been a force behind designing a 30-year water plan for the country, to help manage water supply for its vital agricultural industry.

64. Sir Sadiq Khan

London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan, who is now in his third term, was the first mayor to be knighted in the New Year's List 2025. Throughout his tenure, he’s put the climate crisis at the forefront and has made significant strides in reducing the city’s carbon footprint. He's focused on tackling air pollution with Ulez (Ultra Low Emission Zone) and 20mph areas, and has just announced that one of the city's busiest shopping areas, Oxford Street, will become pedestrianised.

This year, he's opposed London Heathrow's proposed third runway, citing pollution concerns and the impact it could have on Britain's climate targets. He's also launched a £12m Green Roots Fund to support community-led projects that enhance parks, wetlands and rivers, improving urban biodiversity.

In an opinion piece for The Independent’s Climate 100 series last year, he called London’s air pollution the “gravest environmental threat to human health… with our poorest citizens and minority ethnic communities suffering the worst effects”.

Under new Ulez rules, roadside nitrogen dioxide levels have been halved since 2016, pollution has been cut by over 20 per cent in outer London, and the capital’s “air quality is improving at a faster rate than the rest of England’s average,” he says.

65. Mary Robinson

After serving as Ireland’s first female president, Mary Robinson, a lifelong champion of human rights, has established her own climate group, Project Dandelion, which pushes for women to be prioritised within the climate crisis response. The group launched a short film, We Are Dandelions, which premiered at the virtual Unite for Climate Solutions: A Women-Led Summit event, ahead of Cop28.

As well as advocating for women, she also emphasises the need for inclusive solutions that properly serve the needs of marginalised communities. For her work, she has become one of the most highly respected people in the climate conversation.

In her humanitarian work, she has been vocal in speaking out against Israel's aid block and has been to the Rafah Crossing as a member of The Elders, (which was founded by the late Nelson Mandela in 2007). The group is made up of a group of global leaders working together for peace, justice, human rights and a sustainable planet, which she is the chair of.

In an interview with The Independent in 2023, she explained that she thinks the US, which is responsible for the largest share of historic greenhouse gas emissions, could do more in the fight against the climate crisis.

66. Lord Deben (John Gummer)

The Tory peer John Gummer, has been a steadfast advocate for environmentalism for decades. He served as Conservative Party chairman under Margaret Thatcher and as environment secretary in John Major’s government. More recently he was chair of the UK’s Climate Change Committee (CCC) between 2012 and 2023. In this role he played a crucial part in shaping the nation’s climate policies and guiding the UK towards its goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

Despite the CCC being the government’s own watchdog on climate, Lord Deben has spoken out about worries the previous government would not meet its climate targets. In June 2023, he said it had been “too slow to act”.

This year, though he supports increasing the UK’s onshore renewable efforts, he has spoken out against Lionlink energy cables going through the countryside. Instead, he says, cables should be taken under the sea, which he argues has the least impact on biodiversity, and brought onshore to brownfield sites.

For The Independent’s Climate 100 series last year, he wrote that, despite the crisis surging on, it is still within our collective power to mitigate its effects.

67. Marina Silva

Earlier this year, the Brazilian environment minister Marina Silva, warned that we’re already at the limit of liveable climate.

As a native Amazonian from a rubber-tapping family, Silva is serving as environment minister for the second time, having also held the role from 2003 to 2008. Back then, she implemented policies that significantly reduced deforestation rates, and she is continuing that work now, as well as being a staunch defender of Indigenous rights and biodiversity.

Silva is regarded as one of the most influential ministers in Brazil thanks to her work to rebuild the country’s capacity to halt rampant illegal deforestation in the Amazon. She believes protecting the Amazon rainforest, almost two thirds of which is in Brazil, is key to staving off the worst effects of the climate crisis.

In July, however, this came under threat following what has become known as the “devastation bill”, signed by President Lula, which stripped powers from Silva’s ministry. It allows companies to self-license for big construction projects such as building new roads, which will have devastating effects on the environment.

Silva has described the passing of this bill as a “death blow”, saying it threatens the country’s pledge to eliminate deforestation by 2030.

68. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva

As president of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, known as Lula, is arguably on the hottest climate change seat in the world this year.

Brazil plays host in November to the annual United National climate summit, this year dubbed Cop30, and Lula’s government has promised to host the tens of thousands of expected delegates in Belem, a small city on the Amazon Basin.

Lula and his team want to spotlight the damage being done to the Amazon – generally acknowledged to be the world’s largest natural carbon sink, for the ability of its trees and jungle to suck harmful carbon out of the atmosphere – by fossil fuel interests and cattle ranching.

The logistical challenge of bringing so many people to Belem and finding rooms is just one of the headaches Lula must deal with as he seeks to keep his country on track to fight global warming after four disastrous years of pollution and land clearing by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.

How Lula performs this year and in coming years will largely cement his legacy as either a climate advocate or a politician who was unable to control the vast oil and cattle interests that dominate his country.

69. Mia Mottley

Mia Mottley is a woman of many firsts, including, in 2018, becoming the first female prime minister of Barbados, and also the first prime minister to serve after Barbados became a republic in November 2021. The following year, she announced her landmark Bridgetown Initiative, which proposes to entirely reform how global debt works.

The plan calls for wealthier nations to contribute far more financially to the global climate fight, as poorer nations are bearing the physical and financial brunt of the crisis despite having contributed the least to it. It’s her central call, and one she spoke about at Cop29 in Baku last year, emphasising the need for global financial architecture reforms as the planet was “hurtling towards catastrophe” with increasing extreme weather events.

After floods, hurricanes or droughts, poorer nations struggle to financially rebuild due to their high debt. This can be as much as 12-14 per cent in poorer nations, compared to 1-4 per cent for wealthier countries. Mottley argues that if these high repayment interest rates are not paused or even cancelled – as was done for some countries after the Second World War – then they could be a death sentence for countries like hers.

Last December, Barbados benefitted from its first “debt for climate resilience swap”, meaning it replaced expensive debt with more affordable financing, generating $125m (£93m) in savings, which has been turned into a water and sewage project to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

70. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

A rising Democrat star and congressional representative from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quickly established herself as a lightning rod for climate change criticism after she was first elected in 2018 at the age of 29.

Also known as AOC, she was a co-sponsor of a bill called the Green New Deal, which called for a series of initiatives to combat global warming and housing inequality to support a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

The Green New Deal became an attacking point of President Trump in his first term and remains so to this day, even though it has largely been put aside by Democrats. AOC, now a seasoned insider on Capitol Hill, is still is a leading spokesperson for environmental efforts and has positioned herself as one of the greatest critics of Trump’s policies to attack renewable energy in his second term.

She also continues to search for ways to incorporate parts of the Green New Deal into other legislation or programs to help mitigate the worst effects of global warming, both in New York and around the country.

71. Kathy Hochul

Kathy Hochul is governor of the state of New York and from the beginning of her leadership she has fought climate change, making herself a prominent target of President Trump’s efforts to thwart climate control.

In December, Hochul signed a Climate Superfund Act that requires fossil fuel companies to help finance climate adaptation projects in New York, particularly around low-carbon infrastructure. She has led state investments of more than $1bn (£743) in renewable energy projects and campaigned for social justice tied to environmental practices.

Her most controversial act was to implement traffic congestion pricing in New York City in January to slash traffic into Manhattan and lower carbon emissions, following a lead from London and other cities. President Trump has ordered her to reverse the order and threatened to withhold federal funding from New York state if she does not.

By May, the city reported more than $200m in new revenue from the pricing plan, which is set to be used to update and replace its aging public transportation system.

72. Ursula von der Leyen

As President of the European Commission in Brussels, Ursula von der Leyen has made climate change a central focus of her efforts since she was first elected in 2019.

Working toward a European Green Deal with other like-minded members of the EU, she pushed through policies and legislation designed to reduce harmful carbon emissions on the continent by 90 per cent by 2040 and completely by 2050, which would make Europe the first carbon-neutral continent.

But since last year’s EU elections, when a wave of right-wing members were elected as part of a backlash against rising energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, von der Leyen has faced rising challenges implementing green policies.

In June, she was forced to cut out large parts of the European Green Deal in order to push it through, which will affect most of her ambitious timelines.

73. Pope Leo XIV

Since Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost became Pope Leo XIV in May, he has quickly adopted climate change and the environment as one of his major focuses, as did his predecessor, Pope Francis, who was known as the “climate pope”.

Leo has actively addressed the destruction of the environment and in particular its effects on the poor. He has celebrated “green masses” to emphasise the Church’s responsibility to the Earth, and is even attempting to build a solar farm in the Vatican.

Shortly after becoming Pope, he celebrated the 10th anniversary of Francis’s Laudato si’, a 184-page letter to bishops that tied climate change to the Church’s social mission and condemned the destruction of the environment for financial gain, asking for a “relationship of reciprocity” with the environment.

74. Eric Garcetti

As mayor of Los Angeles from 2013 to 2022, Eric Garcetti fought to make the city a global leader in mitigating climate change, committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and establishing preventative measures to fight California’s growing trend of destructive wildfires.

In June, Garcetti was named ambassador for global climate diplomacy for the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. His new role will help him represent other cities and mayors in global climate leadership talks, particularly those arranged by the United Nations.

The leadership of cities has become a battleground in the fight against global warming as federal policies in the US and regional policies in the EU have shifted against green transition plans after a pushback over rising energy prices.

Climate advocates are focusing their attention on how each individual city can fight to protect itself and limit its carbon output despite the broader attack on climate policies. Garcetti will be a key figure at Cop30 this November in Belem, Brazil.

75. António Guterres

Under the leadership of Secretary General António Guterres, the United Nations has intensified efforts to push for ambitious climate action, urging countries to meet and exceed the goals of 2015’s legally binding Paris Agreement, which was enforced the following year.

Guterres frames the climate crisis as the defining issue of our time, and has championed the need to transition to renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions and protect vulnerable communities.

He continues to push for global net zero by 2050, though he now thinks richer nations should aim for 2040, and calls for greater international cooperation to address biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. His advocacy often runs into conflict with governments – such as in the US this year – that are hostile toward investing in climate mitigation or providing money to nations hit hard by global pollution.

Guterres faces a defining moment this November when the UN hosts its 30th annual climate summit, Cop30, in Brazil, whose portion of the Amazon Basin is threatened by logging and agriculture interests. Climate scientists say loss of the Amazon, one of the world's largest carbon sinks, would be devastating throughout the region. Guterres will deliver his message to delegates from countries that have moved decidedly away from sustainability in recent years because of costs and a global energy crisis.

76. Al Gore

After leaving public office as US vice president in 2001, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Al Gore has become one of the best known leaders of the climate fight.

In 2006 he founded the Climate Reality Project, which has trained more than 3.5 million people worldwide, empowering them to devise climate solutions for their communities. The same year, Gore’s documentary An Inconvenient Truth brought the realities of climate change to the fore and sparked a global conversation.

This past spring, Gore was a headline speaker at San Francisco Climate Week, where he blasted the Trump administration for its attack on government subsidies for renewable energy and for its attempts to override Congress on its traditional taxing and spending powers.

He also kicked off an international tour in March in Paris for his nonprofit Climate Reality Project, to use training centres and youth programs in other countries to expand public support for renewable alternatives to oil and gas. Gore said the strategy is designed to help support climate activism in parts of the world where there is still motivation to mitigate extreme heat and weather, despite setbacks in the US.

77. Sarah Johnson

As the head of peatland nature recovery at Lancashire's Wildlife Trust (LWT), Sarah Johnson has spent decades championing the need to restore peatlands.

Thanks to her, she's responsible for saving and recovering thousands of acres of upland and lowland peatlands, which are huge carbon sinks. The dense areas have the ability to lock away carbon for long periods of time, which are thought to be twice as effective as forests.

She's working to help protect the peatlands, which are vastly unprotected and have been heavily drained since after the Second World War. It's only recently that the UK has realised their importance, resulting in around 80 per cent of them being damaged. To do this, she works closely with local farmers to ensure wetter lowlands areas can both help farming and wildlife.

Part of this collaboration includes encouraging farmers to plant bullrushes to create an environmental filler for puffer jackets and pioneering carbon farms establishing new coverings of sphagnum moss to trap carbon.

78. Robbie Macpherson

Robbie Macpherson is a vocal advocate for driving the national economy away from oil and gas and transitioning to a green future to reduce harmful emissions and mitigate the worst effects of climate change. .

A graduate of the University of Sheffield, he was until last year the senior political adviser to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on climate change in the UK Parliament. Macpherson has written for national newspapers and appeared on broadcast media to discuss and advocate ways the government can better speed the climate transition.

In October, 2024, Macpherson was given a Churchill Fellowship, named after Winston Churchill, to study what lessons the UK can learn from countries such as Denmark and Colombia in their efforts to transition away from oil and gas to sustainable energy economies.

79. Ben von Wong

Canadian visual artist Ben von Wong's most recent installation sat outside the Plastic Treaty negotiations at Geneva’s Palais des Nations, where talks were held.

The 20ft structure, known as 'The Thinker's Burden', highlighted the reliance of plastics and the problem of microplastics. The traditional looking stone sculpture, which symbolises mother earth, was almost drowning in plastic waste, which he'd been adding to for weeks, and was designed to encourage people to think about and recognise the health problems plastic causes, not just for us, but future generations.

His work covers social and environmental issues, such as e-waste (discarded electronics) where he created The Skull of Satoshi in collaboration with Greenpeace in 2023 to raise awareness of the environmental damage Bitcoin mining creates. While in 2018 his 'Strawpocalyps' piece won him a Guiness World Record as the largest installation created from drinking straws to raise awareness about the damage they cause in the ocean.

80. Frances Fox

Frances Fox is the founder and UK director of Climate Live, a five-year-old group dedicated to using music festivals and concerts to bring climate activism to a new generation.

A long time music fan and graduate of the University of East Anglia, Fox is passionate about using music to spread the message of environmentalism. Fox was responsible for creating the solar-powered pink bus stage and music stall at music festivals across the UK and at climate events in as many as 30 other countries to spread the word. She is an active public speaker and writer.

This past summer, she appeared on the Drowned in Sound podcast to discuss her evolution from music fan to climate activist, and why music festivals themselves are under threat from climate change.

81. Sarah Small

While cycling over 4,500km this year, Sarah Small also had her 4ft wood instrument in tow, strapped to the back of her bike. It wasn't an endurance event, instead, she was on tour – taking the slow road. By travelling on two wheels around the UK, she highlighted the environmental impact of the traditional way of touring for musicians, usually reliant on flying or cars or coaches.

Playing the Viola da Gamba (also known as a viol), which was popular during the Renaissance period, she gave 31 performances and also wanted to perform at music venues outside of the main cities.

She began in May and finished at the end of July, traversing a large loop of most of the UK sticking to the coastlines of England and Wales, and much of Scotland, including the western isles. In an Instagram video she said this is the only way that she's not felt guilty for the way she's travelled.

Scientists & Academics

82. Sir David Attenborough

No one has been a greater force in raising awareness of the climate and environmental crises than Sir David Attenborough. The British documentarian and naturalist is behind dozens of TV series, beaming unforgettable portraits of animals and plants in their natural habitats into the homes of millions around the world, while also painting a very vivid picture of the disastrous realities the planet faces at the hands of humans. His enthusiasm and respect for our uniquely diverse planet has inspired generations of scientists, academics, conservationists and activists.

Known as “the voice of nature”, Sir David is still working and broadcasting with his signature eloquence at the age of 99. He has reported from some of the world’s toughest environments, and at every opportunity, uses his platform to advocate for immediate action to combat environmental degradation through programmes including Natural World, Wildlife on One and the Planet Earth series. The Blue Planet is regarded as having drawn attention to the global problem of plastic pollution, and The Life of Mammals explored the threat humanity has posed to every other species on Earth.

This year, he has already launched two documentaries, Parenthood and Ocean with David Attenborough. The latter was released on his 99th birthday – one critic called it the “greatest message he’s told” – and it described the startling effect dredging has on the ocean floor, and how important the oceans, which he calls “our life support system and our greatest ally against climate catastrophe”, are to the future of our world

83. Gretchen Goldman

Gretchen Goldman is an American environmental scientist and president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit advocacy group that uses scientific research to push for solutions to environmental problems.

Before that, she was director of climate change research and technology at the US state department after holding a leadership role at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Biden.

In her current role, which she assumed in February, Goldman intends to be a leading voice among scientists increasingly concerned by President Trump’s anti-environmental policies and attacks on renewable energy.

As the Trump administration seeks to limit environmental data and in some cases remove research from government websites, more and more pressure will build on scientists to find new ways to promote fact-based environmental research.

84. Dr Ayana Elizabeth Johnson

Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is an American marine biologist and co-founder of the nonprofit Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for policy on coastal cities. She has long promoted ocean conservation and co-authored the Blue New Deal, a plan for including the oceans in climate policy. She has also been involved with environmental policy, written books and articles on the subject, and co-hosted the podcast How To Save A Planet.

Adding to her long history of climate work, last year she published her own book, What If We Get It Right? Visions of Climate Futures, which one critic called “a much-needed antidote to ‘climate grief’”. The book is a collection of essays, poems and musings on potential climate futures by people working in areas ranging from farming to architecture. It promotes the idea that there may be many different solutions to the climate emergency – not just one sole plan of action.

85. Fatih Birol

Fatih Birol is executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which helps countries to form energy policy. He is known for championing the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future, and has emphasised the need for urgent, coordinated global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C.

Renewables grew rapidly in the past few years and Birol has said the IEA expects renewable energy use to increase by 2.5 times by 2030, but that that would still fall short of the tripling that nations agreed at the Cop28 climate summit two years ago. He added that the goal is still reachable, though success hinges on increasing funds for clean energy in developing countries.

He also previously said the war in Gaza has proven that “oil and gas are no longer safe choices”, and that the Middle East crisis could accelerate the move to clean energy.

In January at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Birol singled out India as a developing country on the right track, noting its 40 per cent surge in renewable energy investment in 2024. Later this year, Birol will help preside over the critical Cop30 climate summit in Brazil, which will focus on ways to contain damage to the Amazon basin, among other things.

He must also navigate increasing pressure from the fossil fuel industry and from governments such as the US that want to drill more. He has said existing oil and gas fields do require investment but that must not detract the world from its mission to transition from oil and gas to clean energy.

86. Dr Jane Goodall

Jane Goodall’s name is synonymous with her groundbreaking work on the study of chimpanzees, which she began in 1960. She is a renowned conservationist and ethologist (the study of non-human animal behaviour) who at 91 continues to show an unwavering commitment to conservation.

Through the Jane Goodall Institute, her work focuses on education and community conservation projects. In 1991, she set up Roots & Shoots, supporting young people to work on environmental, conservation and humanitarian issues. In 2023, Goodall launched the Trees for Jane campaign, promoting tree planting and forest preservation worldwide.

Speaking in London at the South by Southwest festival in June, Goodall reflected on the horrors of Gaza and Ukraine and the damage the environment has suffered from them. However, she added that she is still hopeful that the younger generation, who make up a large section of her supporters, will change things while there is still time.

She also commented on the surge in AI usage and said it was a tool whose impact on the world will depend on how it is used by society.

87. Dr Kimberley Budil and team

For 70 years, scientists have attempted to replicate the energy process that powers the sun. Three years ago, a team in California finally managed to do it after 13 years of trying.

Physicist Kim Budil is the director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. She is the first woman to hold the position, and it was under her leadership that her team made its historic breakthrough in nuclear fusion.Since then, investors have poured money into fusion technologies and companies purporting to be on the cusp of a breakthrough to scale the process. The Trump administration recently said the US was committed to all forms of nuclear energy, including fusion.

Nuclear fusion offers the promise of providing nearly limitless clean energy, which could revolutionise efforts to meet the world’s energy needs sustainably, changing the trajectory of the climate crisis. Known as a “net energy gain” – producing more energy in a fusion reaction than was used to ignite it – the experiment delivered 2.05 megajoules of energy to the target, resulting in 3.15 MJ of energy output.

88. Michael Mann

For Michael Mann, climate scientist, author and professor of climate science at the University of Pennsylvania, the problem of climate denial has been at the heart of a major libel case that has continued for 12 years.

In February 2024, Mann, who is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences, was awarded damages after winning a case against two writers who, in a blogpost for the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, compared Mann’s depictions of global warming to child molestation but against data, which Mann says damaged his reputation. After the verdict was announced, Mann said: “It’s a good day for us. It’s a good day for science.” The case has become a symbol of upholding of s","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/18/13/29/climate100100herosplitNEW.jpeg?trim=0,1,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-09-21 15:00:39.825707

We now have nearly 15 years of additional experience and data to support the Endangerment Finding more thoroughly and with greater confidence.","MADISON | Wisconsin’s Green Fire (WGF), a science-based conservation nonprofit, urges the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to keep the 2009 Endangerment Finding in place and to maintain the greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. WGF is submitting detailed comments opposing the EPA’s proposed rule (Federal Register Number 2025-14572). WGF’s comments were prepared by subject matter experts on climate change and are available on the WGF website here. The EPA’s public comment period on this topic closes on September 22nd, 2025.

In a 2007 US Supreme Court decision, the nation’s highest court ruled that greenhouse gases qualified as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The US EPA subsequently issued the 2009 Endangerment Finding. It stated that: 1) that greenhouse gases threaten public health and 2) that motor vehicles contribute to greenhouse gas pollution. These findings are the basis for emissions standards that aim to reduce pollution and protect public health. There have been no new developments, particularly no peer-reviewed scientific studies, that cast doubt on the reliability of the 2009 Endangerment Finding or challenge its assumptions. Counter to the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment, the EPA is ignoring or misconstruing the science and the obvious facts: climate change is a grave existential threat to human health and welfare.

We now have nearly 15 years of additional experience and data to support the Endangerment Finding more thoroughly and with greater confidence. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the past 10 years have been the 10 warmest years on record since 1850. Additionally, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have occurred since 1995. This is not a random coincidence.

These changes impact Wisconsin directly, too. According to the 2021 Assessment Report from the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI), “In the last decade, nearly every region of our state has experienced extreme rainfall events that led to flooding of roads, homes, businesses, and farm fields.” The August 2025 flooding in Milwaukee and other parts of southeastern Wisconsin is just one example of a 1000-year rainstorm. From 1980 to 2024, NOAA documented 44 severe storms in the Midwest, including Wisconsin. In a similar time frame from 1988 to 2023, there were nine droughts. Droughts are associated with health risks like heat stress. Furthermore, droughts can cause widespread crop losses to economically important crops like corn and soybeans. Life-threatening weather events are becoming almost annual in our region.

Beyond weather events, greenhouse gases endanger public health by lowering the air quality. Emissions from vehicles and other sources create smog. Warm temperatures accelerate those smog-creating conditions. Smog harms human health, resulting in acute respiratory symptoms that lead to reduced productivity (missed school and work days), hospitalizations, and premature death.

Warming temperatures and changing weather patterns also bring increased risks of vector-borne disease like Lyme disease, West Nile virus, dengue fever, and Zika virus. According to BioMed Research International, since 2009, cases of dengue have been documented in Florida for the first time in 75 years. The warmer and wetter conditions caused by global warming will make some areas of the US more conducive to the spread of mosquitoes and ticks that spread these dangerous diseases.

The climate factors occurring today, including temperature increases, changing precipitation patterns, changes in humidity and other factors are different in one dramatic and devastating regard—the rapid rate of change. Thousands of species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians, trees, coral reef species, and others are threatened with extinction. In 2020, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessed that climate change was the biggest factor leading to extinction.

For New Pittsburgh Courier

In August 2025, the Black unemployment rate surged to 7.5 percent —about twice the rate for White workers (3.7 percent) and well above the national average of 4.3 percent. Washington, D.C., and Michigan had the highest Black unemployment rates in the second quarter of 2025, at 10.3 percent and 10 percent, respectively.

These numbers are not mere statistics—they signal families set back, dreams delayed, and communities left more vulnerable each time the economy falters. For Black Americans, downturns hit harder, and recovery is slower. In these moments, only true wealth infrastructure—assets, homeownership, savings, and entrepreneurship—can anchor families and offer a genuine path forward.

As federal layoffs accelerate and key industries shed workers, families without assets face a familiar crisis: unemployment that threatens not just monthly bills, but housing stability and children’s futures. Black workers bear the heaviest burden, losing jobs first and finding new ones last each time the economy turns.

The Promise of the Family Self-Sufficiency Program

One model stands out: the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, HUD’s proven approach for helping low-income families turn rental assistance into long-term wealth. As participants’ incomes rise, so do their savings—thanks to an innovative escrow account that captures what otherwise would have gone toward higher rent. By graduation, many families have enough for a down payment, tuition, or even a small business venture. With $141 million in federal appropriations for 2025, FSS is a rare example of scalable, bipartisan anti-poverty policy—yet it faces perennial funding threats that put its gains at risk.

Asset-building programs like FSS, which Congress has protected even as recent budgets have targeted them for cuts, are essential to help families weather unemployment, avoid eviction, and create security that income alone cannot guarantee. In the wake of these disruptions, Black wealth infrastructure isn’t just important; it is essential for community and generational resilience. The effects are visible in lives transformed.

Take Marisabel, who entered the FSS Homeownership Track in Massachusetts as a renter struggling to get ahead. Through steady work, saving, and coaching, she bought her first home —turning uncertainty into lasting security for her family. Likewise, Tanisha Durrett, a single mother, became the proud owner of a bookkeeping business after completing FSS, crediting the program’s financial coaching for her leap into entrepreneurship.

Closing the Racial Wealth Gap

However, even diligent saving can’t close the racial wealth gap alone. The pathways to prosperity increasingly run through new engines of economic growth —like clean energy, a $23 trillion market by 2030, expected to generate over a million jobs in the coming years. Yet Black Americans currently hold only 8 percent of jobs in the sector and own less than 1 percent of its companies. Even as industry leaders clamor to hire—“We need to hire 500,000 people in the next decade,” says Jason Grumet of the American Clean Power Association—systemic barriers persist.

Chief among these obstacles is unpaid training. As CEO Carla Walker-Miller notes, “If you want [Black people] to be trained, pay us… We need to be paid while we’re trained.” Without paid opportunities, participation remains limited—no matter how dire the labor shortage. For those who do break in, union positions offer real security: 8–19 percent higher wages and strong benefits. Most new roles require no college degree, making these jobs especially valuable for displaced workers.

Business ownership—vital for family and community wealth —remains out of reach for many. Fewer than a quarter of Black-owned clean energy companies get bank financing, compared to nearly half of White-owned firms. This persistent financing gap prevents Black entrepreneurs from scaling up and sharing new opportunities.

Programs like FSS, the Dearfield Fund for Black Wealth, and D.C.’s Black Homeownership Fund reveal what’s possible. These efforts turn passive hope into asset-building action, helping families achieve homeownership, launch businesses, and stabilize entire neighborhoods.

To create lasting resilience, we must do three things:

Expand asset-building programs like FSS and down payment supports nationwide so every hardworking family can own a home and build security.

Open pathways to emerging industries with paid training, union jobs, and fair business opportunities.

Reform lending and homeownership systems with targeted community investments and strict anti-discrimination rules.

If policymakers act with purpose—grounded in evidence —Black families will not only weather economic storms, but thrive: launching businesses, sending children to college, and building communities with enduring strength. True wealth infrastructure is more than a safety net—it’s the foundation for real and lasting mobility. There is no Black mobility without Black sustainability.

In a 2022 report, the industry itself admitted only 6% of its methane emissions were leaks, the rest were intentional releases.

They’re making a false argument that increasing methane production and exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) worldwide will somehow help meet Global Methane Pledge goals.
Methane still offers a tremendous opportunity to make climate progress, provided we make tremendous progress on actually cutting methane emissions.","U.S. energy policy stinks because it accelerates rising methane emissions, which accelerate climate change. The Trump administration is attacking renewable energy, most recently taking a whole-of-government approach to savaging wind power, while aggressively pushing dirty natural gas production and LNG exports, and even threatening countries that try to decrease reliance on fossil fuels.

This is a recipe for disaster. Fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure inevitably release methane, a greenhouse gas more than 80 times more powerful than carbon dioxide over 20 years. Methane has likely caused 40-50% of all warming in the past 20 years. Cutting it is our best chance to slow warming, but we’re blowing it. Methane emissions continue to climb with “no foreseeable slowdown,” a new study in the journal Nature finds.

We can’t change this trajectory unless we stop drilling for oil and gas. “Overall emissions will remain high as long as the industry is drilling new wells…That’s just the nature of the beast,” a petroleum expert told ProPublica this month, as it reported on how permits for Texas wells to vent and flare their natural gas (i.e., methane) are rubber stamped, with 99.6% approved. In fact, in Texas and some other states, oil well methane emissions are so normalized that some permits are issued automatically, without applications.

The industry literally can’t exist without pollution, because oil and gas operations must release methane and other pollutants to regulate equipment pressures, which is why they routinely get air pollution permits. The problem is much bigger than accidental leaks. In a 2022 report, the industry itself admitted only 6% of its methane emissions were leaks, the rest were intentional releases.

The Permian Basin in Texas alone emits more than 256,000 kilograms of methane per hour (about 2.2 million metric tons a year) the climate equivalent of 161 natural gas-fired power plants. And even in purportedly low-emitting oilfields, we know emissions are grossly underestimated.

So as leaders gather at Climate Week NYC to discuss solutions, they should start there: methane emissions are required for oil and gas production, “clean” natural gas is a scam, so to stop methane emissions we must stop drilling new wells.

We already agree on the need to stop methane. I was at the 2021 COP26 climate summit in Glasgow when the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030 was launched. So far 159 countries including the United States have signed it. But as I said then, “A pledge is not a plan.” Today, roughly halfway to the 2030 deadline, global methane emissions are up, not down, by some 40 million tons, largely from growing energy sector emissions — the equivalent of building 296 new coal-fired powerplants.

Meanwhile, oil and gas executives advertise flashy new emissions controls and misleading performance metrics to justify more production, even as methane emissions rise. They’re making a false argument that increasing methane production and exporting liquified natural gas (LNG) worldwide will somehow help meet Global Methane Pledge goals.

Their playbook is to ignore lifecycle emissions, cherry pick certain examples, and peddle the notion that natural gas can be “clean,” even though natural gas is methane and venting and flaring it is endemic.

But LNG is not “clean;” studies show it is 33% worse for the climate than coal. Leading environmental scientist Bob Howarth calls LNG “the worst of any fossil fuel.” Besides the methane emissions required in all natural gas production and transmission, LNG involves liquifying the gas, transporting it on boats, then more processing to make it usable in the destination countries, all of which causes massive additional emissions.

But we can still reverse the trend and bring methane levels down. Since it has a short lifespan in the atmosphere, the International Energy Agency points out that “sharp cuts in methane can deliver a net cooling effect within a relatively short period,” giving us time to “pursue lasting reductions in carbon dioxide.”

Although the Global Methane Pledge hasn’t delivered actual methane reductions yet, the IEA’s fundamental logic is correct. Methane still offers a tremendous opportunity to make climate progress, provided we make tremendous progress on actually cutting methane emissions. But accomplishing this will take more than non-binding pledges and fossil fuel industry spin. It will take putting a stop to oil and gas expansion.

No amount of emissions gadgets or performance certifications can fix an industry that must pollute to exist. Once we admit that, we can finally move from pledges to actual plans, and from methane-intensive energy to renewables.",https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1392949973.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:43.981298

“… It’s important to note that Duane Arnold Energy Center operated safely for decades, providing reliable, emissions-free energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.
Linn County’s outdoor sirens, originally installed by Duane Arnold, were donated to Linn County and its communities when the plant closed.","PALO — At Whiskey River Grill, a bar and restaurant that sits a couple miles from the decommissioned Duane Arnold Energy Center, co-owner Lacey Christiansen remembers when the lunch crowd was steady, fueled by technicians and operators coming off shifts at Iowa’s only nuclear plant.

“When we first opened six years ago, they were still up and running, and there was just a lot more lunch business,” Christiansen said. “We definitely saw a decline after it all closed down.”

Now, with plant owner NextEra Energy weighing a plan to restart operations at Duane Arnold by the end of the decade, Christiansen sees reason for optimism.

“I haven’t heard anything negative about it,” she said. “We hear, you know, 1,000 people can be coming to work. … And that's exciting for us, right? You know, because these people are going to be coming right through here to go to work every day and going home every day. So that's a big deal for a small business like us.”

Her reaction is echoed across rural Linn County, where residents and business leaders are bracing for an economic revival spurred by the prospect hundreds of high-wage jobs, a multiyear construction surge, and new housing demand.

Palo and Center Point businesses, union leaders and city officials say the economic ripple would be significant.

Impact of decommissioning

Duane Arnold, a single-unit boiling water reactor, entered service in 1975. It was decommissioned in 2020, after more than four decades of producing around 600 megawatts of power and supplying about 8 percent of Iowa’s electricity.

The decision was driven by a combination of economic factors — with Alliant Energy, the plant’s primary electricity customer choosing to exit its power purchase agreement years early — and was hastened by the August 2020 derecho, which caused “extensive” damage to the facility’s cooling towers.

Officials for both Alliant and NextEra at the time said the declining market value of energy from sources like wind, which had dropped below the cost of nuclear generation, prompted the decision to close Duane Arnold.

Alliant Energy customers were projected to save nearly $300 million in energy costs over 21 years — or about $42 a year for residential customers, starting in 2021 — due to the plant’s closure, The Gazette reported at the time.

Since then, NextEra says recommissioning is needed to meet surging electricity demand driven by data centers and other energy-intensive growth.

For nearby communities like Palo and Center Point, the loss was felt both in jobs and in identity.

“I think the biggest impact was more of, ‘Oh no, the nuclear plant shut down. That sucks,” said Palo Mayor Eric Van Kerckhove. “That's kind of been part of Palo’s identity” for a long time.“

Though Palo has grown with new homes and businesses, the mayor said reduced foot traffic and spending were noticeable.

In Center Point, Mayor Traer Morgan saw the closure more directly. His neighbor lost his job at the plant.

“There are people who had to find work elsewhere since the decommissioning,” Morgan said.

City Administrator Joe Taylor described the loss as a “gradual impact” typical of large employer closures.

“You have a negative impact that’s gradually felt, as opposed to just an immediate shock,” he said.

Businesses wait for return

Restaurants and small businesses reported declines in daytime customers once the plant went offline.

“The lunch rush just hasn’t been the same,” Christiansen said of Whiskey River.

Anticipation for new activity has been building since NextEra confirmed it is exploring recommissioning. The project could bring a thousand or more of temporary construction workers and eventually several hundred permanent employees back to the site.

In Center Point, Taylor said the prospect has already sparked some interest from developers.

“We're examining the aspect now of conducting a hotel study,” he said. “They had attempted to do one about 10 years ago, and the numbers just really didn't jive — didn't validate any forward movement past the initial phase,” but the potential bringing a thousand or more temporary construction workers to the area over three to four years changes the tone and urgency.

“They are going to need places to stay, places to eat, places to do (things),” Taylor said. “And so, you know, where our population and our development is already headed that way, something like this obviously spurs some interest from (developers) who are like, ‘Oh, well, you know, there's a possibility to capitalize on something and go from there,’ and with our position on (Interstate) 380 it makes sense, right?”

Economic stakes

A 2014 economic study by the Nuclear Energy Institute estimated Duane Arnold’s operation pumped $246 million annually into Benton and Linn counties, supported 978 jobs locally, and contributed $25.6 million in tax revenue across federal, state and local levels.

At its peak, the plant directly employed nearly 600 workers, with average wages in Linn County topping $82,000 — far above the county average of $45,690 at the time.

Ron Corbett, vice president of economic development for the Cedar Rapids Metro Economic Alliance, said restarting could restore that kind of economic engine.

He said NextEra is working on an updated economic impact study.

“We know the impact will be substantial,” Corbett said. “ … We are thrilled there is a chance to bring these jobs back with the reopening of the nuclear power plant.”

He said the average wage at Duane Arnold before closing was over $100,000.

Housing demand

New demand for housing is a near certainty, according to local officials. Palo has seen a wave of new single-family homes, and developers are preparing for more.

“My hope is that we'll see a lot of homes sell pretty quickly and be in the situation where we need to build more faster,” Van Kerckhove said.

The Palo mayor also expressed excitement about the broader opportunities for new industry in and around Palo. While he said he could not share any specific companies that Palo hopes to attract with the potential restart of the Duane Arnold nuclear plant, Van Kerckhove said a recommissioned plant could attract companies that require significant clean energy, such as data centers and manufacturers.

Center Point has annexed land across Interstate 380 in anticipation of growth.

“Even in my short tenure here — I got here in September of 2021 — land that was in essence considered pretty much off limits … is now for sale,” Taylor said, noting developers are already positioning for new demand.

He said the “sweet spot” for growth remains homes priced at $350,000 or below, which he now considers the affordable range for new construction. If the plant returns, he expects a wave of new neighborhoods to follow.

“At that price point, you could have a pretty good boom on your hands,” Taylor said.

A recently built 42-unit apartment complex is already full, with some tenants working on new data centers or on early Duane Arnold-related projects.

“That’s a direct impact,” Taylor said.

Union’s perspective

For labor unions, Duane Arnold’s potential restart represents more than jobs — it’s about stability and growth.

“It was a huge deal for us,” said Jon Van Zante, business manager for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 204. At its height, the plant employed more than 350 of his members.

Even if staffing levels today are smaller — perhaps 150 to 200 permanent union jobs — Van Zante said the ripple effects across trades would be significant.

“These are highly skilled jobs that pay extremely well,” Van Zante said, estimating wages could exceed $120,000 annually. “That’s long-term employment, not just a project.”

Beyond the permanent workforce, the project would draw hundreds of contractors and tradespeople during construction and scheduled maintenance. Electricians, plumbers, carpenters and other skilled laborers would see steady demand, echoing the plant’s past role as a major source of work for union members across Iowa, he said.

The facility previously paid nearly $3 million annually in property taxes, supporting schools and county infrastructure. Van Zante said reopening would restore that revenue stream, strengthening local services and community projects.

Local businesses would also benefit from increased foot traffic and disposable income. Restaurants, health clubs and service providers once thrived on plant workers and could again, Van Zante and city officials said. Housing demand is expected to rise as workers and families move closer to the site, fueling new construction and boosting property values.

Former employees have expressed interest in returning, Van Zante added. Some transferred to Alliant Energy’s Prairie Creek Generating Station in Cedar Rapids or other nuclear plants nationwide, he said.

“Some of them (who have left and went to work at other nuclear facilities elsewhere in the United States), even still have houses here,” Van Zante said. “And so they would love the option to be able to come back. So I think it creates a lot of good potential.”

And with the state’s growing energy needs driven by data centers and other industries, he said Duane Arnold’s return would ripple well beyond Linn County, supporting suppliers and utilities across the region.

The union also sees a chance to train the next generation.

“I tell my 18-year-old son, there’s never been a better time to go into the trades,” Van Zante said. “I’ve never seen growth like this in 28 years.”

Ripple effects

Beyond jobs and wages, local leaders expect a cascading economic effect.

Restaurants, gas stations, auto shops and retailers all stand to benefit from increased daily traffic, Van Kerckhove said

“You’ll see more people coming in for lunch, getting their oil changed, buying groceries,” he said.

For Center Point, the benefit could extend to schools.

“Good-paying jobs mean stronger school districts,” Taylor said. “... It’s the rising tide that lifts all boats.”

The 2014 study quantified that ripple: for every $1 of output from Duane Arnold, the local economy generated $1.23, while the state economy produced $1.27.

NextEra’s plans

While no final decision has been made, Duane Arnold Energy Center spokesperson Bill Orlove said the company is conducting engineering studies, recruiting licensed nuclear operators and working with potential customers.

If the project moves forward, Duane Arnold would add 600 megawatts of power generation, contributing to the Trump administration’s target of 5,000 megawatts of new nuclear energy by 2030. NextEra said a restart would bring “hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs” back to Linn County and generate millions in tax revenue for schools and local governments.

The company stressed safety remains the top priority, noting Duane Arnold had operated safely for decades before its 2020 closure.

“Restarting a nuclear power plant is a serious undertaking,” Orlove said in a statement. “… It’s important to note that Duane Arnold Energy Center operated safely for decades, providing reliable, emissions-free energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses. The health and safety of the public is always our top priority. Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.

“As we continue to go through this process, we are committed to remaining engaged with local and state stakeholders.”

From Palo’s vantage, Van Kerckhove said, “It feels more like when, not if.” He expects construction could take about three years once approved, bringing a surge of temporary workers.

NextEra has historically invested in community amenities, from donating a splash pad in Palo to supporting local fire departments. Leaders expect that outreach to continue if the restart proceeds.

Safety and community response

Unlike contentious solar projects that sparked opposition in Linn County, leaders say the nuclear restart has drawn little pushback.

“We haven’t heard any complaints,” Taylor said. “It’s been excitement.”

Van Kerckhove agreed: “I’ve heard nothing but positive remarks. People see it as putting Palo back on the map.”

Emergency planning, once tied closely to the plant, also will return. Palo’s fire department still uses equipment donated when the plant closed. Linn County’s outdoor sirens, originally installed by Duane Arnold, were donated to Linn County and its communities when the plant closed. Officials expect those partnerships to be reactivated.

“The community is very familiar with it,” Morgan said. “It’s not new. It’s been here for 40 years.”

A sense of identity

Palo City Council member Jen Welton said the town has long identified with the plant.

“I think a lot of people would consider Palo as the home of the Duane Arnold power plant, and they take great pride in that,” Welton said. “… There was a sense of loss when it was decommissioned. People really felt strongly about the power plant and felt that it brought a lot of great things to the community over the years for us.”

Welton said residents view the possibility of bringing back hundreds of high-paying jobs as “absolutely great for economic development,” benefiting not only Palo but surrounding communities such as Cedar Rapids, Hiawatha and Marion. The plant’s return, she added, could also spark interest from industries looking for clean power and encourage further housing and business development.

“I haven’t met one person that hasn’t really found this to be a positive,” she said. “It was really hard when the plant closed. When it becomes part of who you are as a community, to lose something of that size and magnitude is tough.”

At Whiskey River, Christiansen sees that identity translating into customers again.

“It’s exciting,” she said. “These are good jobs, good people, and they’re going to be coming right through here every day.”

For union members, it’s a chance to reestablish a pillar of the local labor economy.

“I don’t see anything but positives,” Van Zante said. “It makes our union stronger, and it makes the community stronger.”

And for Center Point’s administrator, the restart could mark a turning point.

What’s everyone think about the EV tax credit going away? Do you see manufacturers rolling out bigger rebates to keep sales moving, or will prices just crash harder? Will this kill EV demand, or could it actually push used EV values down even more?

I own a dealership that exclusively sells used EV’s.. (in a very red state).. my experience says those that are interested in EV’s will buy them either way as long as they are affordable. Most my customers are buying around the $15-$20k mark as an affordable way to test an EV for their lifestyle. That’s the biggest barrier to entry for most in the new car sector. Until the last year we’ve really lacked “affordable” new EV’s with logical use range… Even with the tax rebate. With the new Leaf coming out, Chevy’s Equinox doing well, and whatever Ford has planned.. we are seeing that change.

On the flip side.. manufacturers like Cadillac who have rolled out a phenomenal line of EV’s… Most their customers aren’t going to qualify for the rebate and they seem to only be picking up momentum with some ridiculously big number like 80% of their EV buyers being new to the brand. They are showing that if you build attractive EV’s that feel and look worth the money.. there’s a market.

From the used side.. we actually stopped utilizing the rebate this last week out of fear we might not get paid as it wraps up this week (which talking to other EV dealers.. that seems to be the case)… We still had our best week in 2 months.

I do expect to see a bigger spread in pricing on used EV’s. We won’t see vehicles with 50k miles priced so close to vehicles with 100k miles since they won’t be trying to stuff every price under the $25k threshold of the used EV credit.",,N,,2025-09-21 15:00:10.732368

The move is part of a broader strategy to stimulate local demand for green technologies and respond to external trade pressures.

Policy Shift Aims to Boost Domestic Consumption

The tax cut applies to a range of equipment used in the renewable energy sector, including solar panels, , and related components. By lowering the tax burden, the government seeks to make these technologies more affordable for domestic consumers and businesses. This is expected to encourage investment in clean energy projects and accelerate India’s transition toward renewable sources.

The reduction comes as part of a series of fiscal adjustments aimed at supporting the country’s energy infrastructure goals. By reducing the cost of imported and locally manufactured equipment, the policy is intended to enhance the competitiveness of India’s renewable energy market.

Strategic Response to External Trade Developments

While the government has not explicitly referenced trade dynamics, the timing of the tax cut is seen as a strategic move to offset the impact of potential external tariffs. The policy change is expected to cushion the Indian manufacturing and energy sectors against the financial implications of higher import costs that could stem from foreign trade barriers.

The adjustment also reflects the government’s commitment to promoting self-reliance in the energy sector. By making renewable energy equipment more accessible, the policy is expected to support domestic manufacturing and encourage the adoption of green technologies across industries.

Implementation Set for Mid-September

, giving businesses and consumers time to adjust to the new fiscal environment. Industry stakeholders have welcomed the move as a positive signal for the sector, with expectations that the reduced tax rate will translate into faster project approvals and increased investment.

The government has emphasized that the change will be applied uniformly across the relevant product categories. Importers and local manufacturers will both benefit from the lower tax rate, which is expected to improve margins and reduce the overall cost of renewable energy infrastructure.

Sector Readiness and Future Outlook

With the tax cut now in place, the focus will shift to how quickly the market adapts to the new framework. The government’s policy has the potential to reduce the cost of setting up solar and wind projects, making it more attractive for private sector participation. .

The move underscores the government’s continued support for the renewable energy sector as a key pillar of India’s energy strategy. By reducing financial barriers, the policy aims to create a more favorable environment for long-term investments in clean energy infrastructure. {}",https://lh-prod-oper-pub-opercenter.s3.amazonaws.com/discovery-image/compress-19bd2643784bc002.png,N,,2025-09-21 15:59:26.778114

CID Gulf LLC, an Omani-Moroccan engineering consultancy firm, has announced that it has secured a prestigious contract to provide design consultancy services for the establishment of Oman’s first wind turbine manufacturing project at Duqm SEZ. The client is Mawarid Turbines — a subsidiary of Oman’s integrated energy powerhouse, OQ Group.

Muscat-based CID Gulf is a joint venture established by Khonji Engineering Consultancy, a member of Mohamed & Ahmed Alkhonji LLC (MAK), a leading Omani tech-based products and services holding company and Conseil, Ingénierie et Développement (CID), a Moroccan consultancy engineering firm operating across the African continent and the Middle East.

“This project represents a cornerstone in the Sultanate of Oman’s move towards clean energy, local industrialisation and long-term sustainability. We are honoured to contribute to this national initiative alongside key government and private sector stakeholders”, CID Gulf noted in a post on Friday.

The award underscores a fast-track approach to the implementation of Mawarid Turbines — a landmark bid to localise wind turbine manufacturing to cater to the large domestic market as well as regional demand. Oman’s requirement for wind turbines to support the country’s energy transition — spanning grid-connected clean energy generation and the ambitious green hydrogen sector — is estimated in the thousands over the next couple of decades.

Phase 1 of the facility, to be developed on a sprawling 550,000 m² site in the SEZ, entails an investment of around RO 70 million. The wind turbine manufacturing capacity of this phase is projected at around 1,100 MW per year, focusing on the production of two turbine models — the 6.25 MW and the 9.6 MW. Technology for the project will be licensed from Shanghai Electric Group, a major player in China’s clean energy equipment manufacturing sector.

Among the first recipients of the turbines — covering not only nacelle hubs housing the generators but potentially other components as well — are grid —connected, wind-based Independent Power Projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah. While these projects will be developed by international developers (supported by their local consortium partners) selected through a competitive tender managed by Nama Power & Water Procurement (Nama PWP), OQ Alternative Energy (OQAE) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of OQ Group — has been assured a stake in them. This stake commitment, consistent with OQAE’s mandate as the national champion for renewable energy, covers an equity share of up to 25 per cent in all future renewable energy projects procured by Nama PWP, starting with the Ibri III Solar PV project — a 500 MW scheme slated for implementation in Al Dhahirah Governorate. In the case of the wind projects planned in Al Duqm, Mahout and Sadah, OQAE’s investment — in the form of locally manufactured wind turbines and potentially other contributions — will correspond to an equivalent stake in the respective project companies, it is learnt.

Phase 1 of Mawarid Turbines is expected to come on stream by late 2026 or early 2027.",https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2025/09/21/thumbs/600x600/3135108.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 13:00:34.929370

The Trump administration has signed into law several executive orders aimed at reducing the standing of renewable energies in the United States. The Trump administration has implemented a new approach to the energy sector that sees the traditional gas and coal sectors being favored instead of the wind and solar power sectors that have become more popular in recent years.

U.S. Wind alleges federal officials were under pressure from the Trump administration

A recent court filing has revealed that the Trump administration filed a request to a federal court to vacate a permit approved for US Wind’s proposed Maryland Offshore Wind project. The project could have a significant impact on the energy sector in the United States and has the capacity to provide enough electricity to power 718,000 homes. So why the filing from the Trump administration, you ask?

That filing states that US Wind’s project could create issues with search and rescue operations and commercial fisheries. If that sounds like a stretch to you, you are not alone. Several key players in the energy sector have come out to state their disapproval with the court filing by the Trump administration, claiming the only reason the current administration made the filing was because the project gained approval from the Biden administration.

The action was filed in the US District Court for the District of Maryland in Baltimore, and the Trump administration has been hard at work trying to find a feasible reason for asking the court to cease the approval process. The filing stated that the previous administration misinterpreted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which enabled the government to manage several key projects in federal waters across the country.

US Wind fights back against the recent action taken by the Trump administration

US Wind is not going to sit by and watch one of its most promising projects being taken away by the Trump administration, and has filed motions to dismiss parts of the suit and requested extensions for responses to the amended complaint.

“Political pressure was applied to the Federal Defendants’ decisionmakers, and the pressure caused those decisionmakers to rely on improper factors,” U.S. Wind alleged in the filing.

The company has claimed that the suit is a part of the Trump administration’s coordinated efforts to repeal any and all projects set up during the previous administration. U.S. Wind received approval to begin construction for the Maryland project in December 2024 and took pride in the fact that the project was the 10th commercial-scale wind project approved in the U.S. The evidence suggests that Trump has a personal vendetta against large wind farms.

The suit has local politicians split as to whether this is the right move for the energy sector in the United States. In August of this year, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced it was pulling $679 million from offshore wind projects nationwide. Maryland House Republicans praised the administration’s decision to revoke the permit and stated the project was “a bad idea that was never going to come to fruition.”

It’s precisely the kind of forward-thinking approach labor needs to take on industrial policy.
Public projects can be financed over a longer term and better withstand the volatility of national energy policy than strictly private alternatives.
Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table.","A consensus is emerging across the political spectrum around the need for industrial policy. Whether in the form of the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act under Joe Biden in 2022 or the haphazard tariff policy of Donald Trump implemented earlier this year, political leaders on both sides of the aisle are clearly searching for answers regarding how to revive the United States’s flagging manufacturing base.

While the Trump administration places a lot of rhetorical emphasis on bringing back industrial jobs, its policies so far have displayed a profound lack of seriousness or coherence. Trump’s tariffs have not been focused on strategic industries or paired with the investment and planning required to make jobs actually materialize. Attacks on agencies like the Department of Energy will make it difficult to build out even those energy sources that Trump claims to favor, like nuclear.

At the same time, the “abundance” debate, kicked off by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’s book of the same name, has drawn additional attention to the need for increased state capacity to make things and deliver improvements for ordinary people. This, the book’s authors argue, is the way to revive both the American economy and the Democratic Party. The discussion, fraught and flawed as it is, has captured the attention and imagination of liberals who don’t usually make a habit of thinking about industrial policy.

But there’s one constituency whose voice is missing and sorely needed in that debate: industrial workers and their unions. A new report from the United Auto Workers (UAW) Region 6 titled “Organize, Industrialize, Decarbonize: A Pro-Worker, Green Industrial Policy for California” takes up the challenge, providing a compelling example of how labor can weigh in on the reindustrialization conversation.

The report presents a vision for how the state can deploy a range of industrial policy tools to expand clean energy industries like offshore wind, electric vehicle batteries, and heat pumps. The same strategies would ensure that jobs created in this build-out become high-quality union careers. It’s precisely the kind of forward-thinking approach labor needs to take on industrial policy.

Trump’s return to office has effectively killed the momentum behind pro-labor clean energy investment that built up under Biden. Even while the current administration has expressed support for nuclear and geothermal development, its lack of appetite for competent state capacity throws serious doubt on its ability to follow through on a build-out.

In this bleak federal context, states can partner with trade unions to lead on industrial policies that show how a clean energy transition can create good jobs. The more progress is made on forming these coalitions now, the better positioned they’ll be when a more favorable national political climate emerges.

The Industrial Policy Tool Kit

The UAW Region 6 report begins by outlining the dilemmas that presently make carrying out a clean energy transition so challenging, especially if left up to private industry and markets. While working-class families are already reeling from inflation, private utilities are paying for climate investments by raising rates for consumers. Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry remains a rare source of good blue-collar union jobs, and workers are rightfully concerned about their disappearance.

But the UAW believes that California’s rich research ecosystem and advanced manufacturing experience puts it in a strong position to be able to build out clean energy technologies. The report helpfully breaks down a range of industrial policy tools, from public procurement to enabling institutions, that the state can employ to favor union labor.

California already uses many of these tools successfully in different contexts. For example, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority has a public procurement provision that gives preference to bidders who create jobs within the county. The PowerForward ZEV Battery Manufacturing grant program incentivizes grant recipients to enter a card check neutrality agreement, have a collective bargaining agreement, and offer comprehensive benefits to their workers.

Enabling institutions, a designation that refers to government entities that carry out research and coordination between public and private institutions, are on the more ambitious side of the policy menu. These represent the building of actual state capacity instead of mere regulation. Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is an example of such an enabling institution and played a crucial role in crafting Japan’s postwar economic boom.

UAW Region 6 is focusing its legislative campaigning on Senate Bill 787, which would create a state-level enabling institution in California to facilitate the growth of zero-emission vehicles and batteries (ZEVs), offshore wind, and heat pump manufacturing. It would require state agencies to coordinate funding in line with the goals of supply chain development and energy affordability.

A Pro-Worker Abundance

California contains the natural wealth to make this vision possible. The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab has estimated that up to eighteen million metric tons of lithium exist in the state’s Salton Sea Region in the Imperial Valley. This is enough to build 375 million EV batteries. The report advocates expanding EV battery recycling capacity in order to create a fully self-sufficient supply chain.

Two hundred gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind potential exists off California’s coast, and the state already has the highest density of non-aircraft turbine manufacturing in the country. Just last year, voters approved a bond measure that earmarked $475 million for offshore wind port infrastructure. The UAW believes these conditions make the industry ripe for expansion in the state with the right level of planning. The report recommends that California seek to round out the supply chain by also producing component parts like generators, cells, and power converters.

With the Trump administration launching an all-out attack on offshore wind, it’s even more important for states like California to develop their own capacities to build out the industry and integrate the supply chain. Public projects can be financed over a longer term and better withstand the volatility of national energy policy than strictly private alternatives. For example, Golden State Wind is a joint venture between Ocean Winds and Reventus Power, which is owned by the national public pension plan in Canada. They plan to deploy 2 GW of wind capacity in the state.

Heat pumps are HVAC systems that use electricity instead of gas to heat and cool buildings. They get less attention as a clean energy technology, but they will play a vital role in reducing building emissions. Demand for heat pumps is projected to grow, and California has set a goal of six million installations over the next five years. UAW Region 6 argues that this is a perfect opportunity to use public procurement to create local, unionized employment.

Overall, this UAW report is an all-too-rare example of a union getting serious about a vision for industrial policy and putting real legislation on the table. While other important clean energy sources like nuclear power and geothermal are left out, the policy proposals play to California’s natural strengths and build on already existing successful initiatives.

Many on the Left have wholly dismissed the abundance concept as repackaged neoliberalism. But others have begun to thoughtfully argue that a chief concern of the Left should be increased state capacity to create good jobs and deliver improved lives. If we don’t offer a compelling vision for how to do this, others will.

The authors of the UAW report conclude by stating that they “wholeheartedly agree with authors Derek Thompson and Ezra Klein” on the need for “increased state capacity, empowered public authorities, and investments in innovation.” The UAW’s fight for SB 707 could be an important first step towards a pro-union abundance agenda.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20114054/uaw-green.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:03:56.716048

The European Union has taken another major step towards cleaner skies with the announcement of €945 million in funding for a new wave of research and demonstration projects under its Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking.

Approved on 9 September, the investment will support 12 projects that promise to push the boundaries of propulsion, systems, and aircraft design.

This third call for proposals represents the largest single package to date under the Clean Aviation programme, which falls within Horizon Europe. It is designed to accelerate the development of next-generation regional and short-medium range aircraft capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% compared with 2020 technology.

Work on the projects is due to start at the beginning of 2026, with first flight tests expected in the 2028–2029 timeframe. By laying the groundwork for new aircraft entering service around 2035, the initiative is a central pillar of Europe’s aviation decarbonisation roadmap.

The €945 million pot combines EU grants with industry contributions and in-kind support. It has been divided between large demonstration programmes for regional and short-medium range aircraft, a set of “Fast Track” enabler projects, and transversal studies into aircraft concept integration and environmental impact.

“The results of Call 3 show the variety of innovative technological concepts to boost the entry-into-service of highly efficient aircraft by 2035,” says Axel Krein, Executive Director of the Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking. “These projects have high potential to make major advancements towards climate neutrality and sustainability.”

Collectively, the 12 winners represent a blend of established OEMs, engine makers, electrical specialists, and smaller innovators, all aligned behind the EU’s climate ambitions.

The EU Clean Aviation chosen dozen

TAKE OFF

Led by Safran Aircraft Engines, TAKE OFF – Technology And Knowledge for European Open Fan Flight – will push forward open fan architecture engines. This disruptive engine design promises significant improvements in propulsive efficiency and is one of the most visible bets on how the next generation of single-aisle aircraft might take shape.

LEIA

Airbus Operations GmbH is coordinating LEIA, the Large scalE Integration demonstrator of hybrid electrical Architecture. The programme will explore how large-scale hybrid-electric power architectures can be integrated into commercial aircraft, bringing together multiple propulsion and energy systems in a single demonstrator.

UNIFIED

Rolls-Royce plc is taking forward UNIFIED, or Ultra Novel and Innovative Fully Integrated Engine Demonstrations. The project will develop and integrate advanced propulsion technologies into a next-generation powerplant concept, paving the way for more efficient and lower-emission short-medium range aircraft.

PHARES

PHARES – Powerplant Hybrid Application for Regional Segment – is coordinated by Pratt & Whitney Canada. It combines a turboprop engine derived from the PW127XT with a powerful electric motor and optimised gearbox. The ambition is to cut regional aircraft fuel burn by around 20%, with a consortium that also includes ATR and Collins Aerospace.

DEMETRA

ATR leads DEMETRA, the Demonstrator of an Electrified Modern Efficient Transport Regional Aircraft. The project will create a flight demonstrator as part of ATR’s broader Evo programme, advancing its ambition to deliver hybrid-electric aircraft to the market in the next decade.

OSYRYS

Safran Electrical & Power is behind OSYRYS – On-board SYstems Relevant for hYbridization of Regional aircraftS. The project will focus on developing and testing the electrical systems required to make hybridisation feasible on regional aircraft, from power distribution to thermal management.

CRYOSTAR

CRYOSTAR, led by the Università degli Studi della Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, will concentrate on the certification roadmap for cryogenic liquid hydrogen tanks. By investigating crashworthiness and safety methodologies, it aims to clear a critical regulatory hurdle for hydrogen-powered aviation.

MODABAT

Germany’s Fraunhofer Gesellschaft will run MODABAT – Modular, scalable and technology-Open Design for future Aviation BATteries. This fast-track project will look at ways of designing modular and scalable battery systems that can be adapted for different aviation applications.

POWER4AIR

Spanish SME Skylife Engineering leads POWER4AIR, which targets the challenges of arc fault detection, electromagnetic interference and reliability in high-voltage power electronics. These are essential elements for making electric and hybrid-electric propulsion safe and certifiable.

LIME

French start-up Ascendance Flight Technologies will coordinate LIME – Lithium based Innovation for Modular Energy. The project is expected to explore lithium-based modular energy systems that can be scaled and integrated into aircraft designs.

HERACLES

HERACLES – Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft Concept for Low EmissionS – is another ATR-led project. Unlike DEMETRA, which is demonstrator-focused, HERACLES will concentrate on conceptual design and environmental assessment of hybrid-electric regional aircraft, providing the analytical foundation for future models.

ACI&I

Finally, Airbus is also responsible for ACI&I, or Short Medium Range – Aircraft Configuration Integration and Impact. This project will examine how various new propulsion and airframe technologies integrate in short- to medium-range aircraft, evaluating the performance and environmental impact of different configurations.

What happens next

Although the projects have been selected, their official launch depends on finalising grant agreements, expected by the end of 2025. Work will formally begin in early 2026, with development efforts running into the latter part of the decade.

The most ambitious undertakings, including PHARES, DEMETRA and TAKE OFF, are aiming for flight testing between 2028 and 2029.

The road ahead is steep. Hybrid-electric propulsion introduces complex systems integration and certification questions, hydrogen storage requires entirely new safety standards, and advanced batteries must meet aviation’s uncompromising performance and reliability demands. By pooling public funding, industrial expertise and fresh thinking from smaller players, Clean Aviation hopes to overcome these hurdles.

If the programme delivers on its ambitions, Europe could see the first genuinely climate-friendly regional and short-medium range aircraft entering service by 2035. That would not only bring the sector closer to its net-zero targets but also help secure Europe’s place at the forefront of global aerospace innovation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/plane-flight-sky-travel-aircraft-sunset-1575625-pxhere.com_.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 12:04:00.778600

As national delegations, activists and other attendees struggle to find affordable places to stay by November, with some deciding not to go at all, Tilvawala, who lives in London, has spent hours working from afar to find lodging in Belem, negotiate prices and contracts and put down deposits. She did all that to create a housing portal specifically for young people who want to be part of the international conference. If not enough people sign up for the housing she’s secured, she might lose some of what she’s put down.

“There’s always a huge number of fossil fuel company representatives there. And who’s going to be there to combat those voices and those negotiating influences?” said Tilvawala, founder and executive director of the global organization Youth Climate Collaborative. “So I was like, ‘We need to be here.’”

With less than two months before this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP30, only about 36% of the 196 participating countries have confirmed attendance and paid for accommodations, according to a spokesperson for the conference presidency.

Activists and poorer nations are feeling the crunch as hotel prices have skyrocketed and even private homes, love motels and other makeshift accommodation options are charging a minimum of several hundred dollars a night.

The Brazilian government chose Belem because it’s part of the Amazon and to underscore the problems common to growing cities in the developing world, but some prospective attendees are raising questions about how productive the talks will be if they are overshadowed by a big drop in attendance.

Many haven’t confirmed housing yet, and the pressure is on

The Brazilian government has taken steps to address the problem. Climate Minister Marina Silva said 10 to 20 rooms have been made available “at accessible prices” for vulnerable countries. The government has also brought in two large cruise ships that can house as many as 6,000 people.

“Everybody will have access to participate in COP30,” Silva said at a recent press briefing. “Facing climate change must be done by all of us, by all the parties of the convention and especially by those who are already living the consequences of climate change.”

But U.N. Climate Change executive secretary Simon Stiell sent a letter on Sept. 9 asking that agencies in the U.N. system, and related organizations, review how many people they’re sending to COP30 and reduce it where possible.

To add to the pressure, a construction workers’ strike started Sept. 15 and includes areas being worked on for COP30.

A challenge for a city chosen to illustrate climate realities

Belem was initially excited to host the conference, said Arnaldo Vaz Neto, a Brazilian financial adviser who has been working with an organization called the Young Scholars Initiative as an intermediary between locals and COP30 visitors seeking housing. “It’s kind of taught in our childhood to have this behavior of hospitality,” he said.

But that was followed by the realization that the United Nations had high international standards for its guests. It was difficult to manage expectations on both sides, Vaz Neto said.

Belem isn’t the only city hosting a U.N. climate conference where lodging rates have gone far higher than usual. Silva said it’s happened at nearly all such conferences, with prices three or even four times market rates.

“A lot of people here are expecting to charge $1,000 a night but that’s beyond the average,” Hugo Pinheiro, a secretary who works for K Pine Mobile in Belem, and has worked to match delegations with housing and to negotiate on prices.

The “accessible” rooms made available by the Brazilian government will rent for between $200 and $600 a night, according to a COP30 presidency spokesperson.

Brazilian officials have expressed confidence that all 196 nations will find housing and come to Belem. In a statement, the presidency said it expects 50,000 participants and Belem currently offers 53,000 beds. That’s fewer people than recent COPs, even though the Brazil meeting is considered one of the most important negotiations in years because countries have to update and strengthen their carbon pollution plans.

Hard decisions

Still, housing is making it more difficult for people from some poorer countries and Indigenous groups to attend, as well as for those that traditionally attend COP outside of a country delegation, including activists, NGO and nonprofit groups and youth observers. Some organizations that represent them expect to send fewer people.

Hailey Campbell leads Care About Climate, a youth-oriented NGO that was one of the first of its kind to be accredited to attend COP over 10 years ago. Campbell said her group has “never faced such difficulties with access to accommodation.” The group posted about the issue on Instagram with the hashtag “#DontPriceUsOut.”

Many individual attendees have already decided they can’t come. Others are on the fence. Some who will attend are considering options like camping in a tent.

This year Hikaru Hayakawa said he’s heard from more people who have decided not to go than he remembers at this time in years past — already maybe 30 or 40 people, by his estimate.

That’s worrisome because many activists from other countries will now miss out on experiencing the strong civil society culture in Brazil, said Hayakawa, executive director of Climate Cardinals, which translates climate information and trains young people.

“It could potentially be lost opportunity to build these global networks,” he said.

raises a critical question: Is the company's stock undervalued relative to its growth potential?

Financial Resilience Amid Transition

NRG's Q2 2025 financial results underscore its operational resilience. Despite a GAAP net loss of $104 million, the company reported Adjusted Net Income of $339 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $909 million, reaffirming its 2025 guidance for Adjusted EBITDA ($3.875–$4.025 billion) and Free Cash Flow before Growth Investments (FCFbG) of $2.1–$2.25 billion NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results and Reaffirms 2025 Financial Guidance[ 1 ]. This performance reflects NRG's ability to balance near-term challenges—such as market volatility and operational costs—with long-term strategic gains.

The company's capital allocation strategy further strengthens its financial profile. Through $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $345 million in dividends in 2025,

As of July 31, 2025, it had already repurchased $768 million in shares and distributed $173 million in dividends NRG Energy, Inc. Reports Second Quarter Results and Reaffirms 2025 Financial Guidance[ 1 ]. This dual focus on returns and reinvestment positions NRG to navigate the capital-intensive nature of the energy transition.

Strategic Moves in Renewables and Grid Services

NRG's most transformative initiative is the $12 billion acquisition of LS Power's generation portfolio, which nearly doubled its capacity to 50 GW and diversified its energy mix with wind, solar, and storage assets NRG Energy: Strategic Capacity Doubling & Emerging Market Focus[ 2 ].

Additionally, its $150 million annual investment in smart home solutions—such as thermostats and demand response programs—is expected to contribute 3–5% of total retail revenue by 2028 NRG Energy: Strategic Capacity Doubling & Emerging Market Focus[ 2 ]. These initiatives not only diversify revenue streams but also position NRG as a critical infrastructure provider for a decarbonizing economy.

Valuation Metrics: Undervalued or Overpriced?

NRG's valuation metrics present a nuanced picture. The stock trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 74.86 and a forward P/E of 20.95, significantly higher than the U.S. renewable energy industry's average P/E of 41.4x U.S. Renewable Energy Industry Analysis - Simply Wall St[ 4 ]. Meanwhile, its EV/EBITDA ratio of 18.92 exceeds the sector's 11.1x average Key Valuation Multiples in Renewable Energy Deals[ 5 ]. At first glance, these multiples suggest the stock is overvalued. However, analysts argue that NRG's growth trajectory justifies the premium.

A consensus of 20 analyst estimates, as of September 2025, assigns a 12-month price target of $173.06—7.03% above the current price of $164.36—with a “Strong Buy” rating NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) Stock Valuation, Peer Comparison[ 6 ]. The wide range of targets ($92–$203) reflects diverging views on macroeconomic risks, such as interest rate volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Yet, NRG's 5-year EPS growth forecast of 21.02% and its recent guidance raises (e.g., $100 million midpoint increase in Adjusted Net Income) suggest strong earnings momentum NRG Energy (NYSE:NRG) Stock Valuation, Peer Comparison[ 6 ].

Industry Context and Risks

The broader renewable energy sector has seen valuation normalization since 2020, with EV/EBITDA multiples declining from 18.2x to 11.1x Key Valuation Multiples in Renewable Energy Deals[ 5 ]. This trend reflects higher capital costs and policy shifts, such as the Trump administration's reversal of Biden-era clean energy incentives. However, NRG's diversified portfolio—spanning generation, storage, and grid services—offers resilience against sector-specific headwinds.

Key risks include its debt-to-equity ratio of 4.86, which could constrain flexibility during economic downturns NRG Energy (NRG) Statistics & Valuation - Stock Analysis[ 7 ]. Additionally, the success of its data center contracts and VPP initiatives hinges on execution risks, such as permitting delays or technological bottlenecks.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Bet

NRG Energy's strategic pivot to renewables and energy services positions it to capitalize on the U.S. energy transition's structural tailwinds.

There is a vast farmland here in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), with each farmer specializing in crops they’ve been growing and harvesting for generations. Whether its leafy greens, exotic fruits, sweet corn, green beans, sugarcane or rice, there is one thing all farmers in the EAA share in common — our commitment to being mindful stewards of the land and water.

Last month, the South Florida Water Management District announced EAA farmers this year achieved a 62% annual phosphorus reduction, which is more than double the 25% reduction required under Florida’s 1996 Everglades Forever Act.

EAA farmers are among the most regulated in the country. With the EAA being one of the most fertile farmlands in the United States, farmers make sure to treat the land and water with great care so it stays this way. We want to protect our way of life and preserve family legacies for generations to come.

Since the program began three decades ago, EAA farmers’ clean water efforts have averaged a 57% annual reduction. We accomplish this by implementing best management practices (BMPs) and cutting-edge innovation to promote healthier water and soil.

On our farm in Belle Glade, we have worked to feed our family, local community and customers around the country for over 40 years. We grow a variety of wholesome foods including sweet corn, rice, lettuce and other leafy greens, including parsley and cilantro.

We practice sustainability every day at our farm. We’ve integrated a number of practices, including employing a balanced crop rotation program, which is a foundational piece of the BMP program, along with soil preservation techniques such as sediment control to promote regenerative soil, and regular soil testing to ensure nutritional inputs are appropriate for our crops. To preserve water quality and minimize water use, we use strategies such as ditch bank stabilization, land leveling, and water retention systems to capture and reuse rainfall effectively.

I believe that when food is grown with real dedication, care and a commitment to the land, you can taste the difference.

EAA farmers are proud to celebrate this milestone, demonstrating a 30-year commitment to sustainability, which has resulted in the removal of thousands of metric tons of phosphorus in the water since the program began.

We look forward to extending this commitment to our soil, our water and our land, for many decades to come.

As tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google race to build energy-hungry data centers, utilities are saying that the billions needed for new power plants and grid upgrades could drive up bills for residents and small businesses.

What's happening?

Driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, the number of massive data centers across the country is soaring. These facilities now consume more than 4% of the nation's electricity, with analysts warning that figure could triple to 12% in just three years.

To keep pace, utilities are being asked to spend billions on new power plants and grid upgrades. Those costs are traditionally passed on to everyone, meaning residents and small businesses could see higher bills even if they aren't using more energy, according to a report from The New York Times. In Ohio, households are already paying about $15 more per month because of data centers.

Why are data centers concerning?

Nationally, electricity rates for residents have already jumped more than 30% since 2020, and experts say data center demand could supercharge those increases. A joint study from Carnegie Mellon and North Carolina State projects that average household power bills could rise by another 8% by 2030 — and even more than 25% in states like Virginia, where data centers are proliferating.

Regulators warn that utilities are being pushed into ""extremely new territory,"" with projects being greenlit faster and on a larger scale than ever before. Consumer advocates are worried that homes and small businesses will be stuck paying for Big Tech's massive expansion. ""Our wallets cannot be strained anymore,"" wrote one resident to state regulators, per the Times. ""Make them pay their own bills like we do!""

What's being done to protect everyday consumers?

Some regulators are pushing back. Ohio recently ruled unanimously against a proposal from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that would have shifted more costs onto regular folks, instead requiring data centers to cover a larger share of their own expenses. Similar debates are underway in Virginia and other states where data centers have multiplied.

At the same time, companies like Amazon argue they are investing in renewable power and efficiency, including electric delivery vans and wind and solar farms. Still, those efforts may be overshadowed by the immense energy demand.

For consumers, watchdog groups recommend staying engaged with local authorities and supporting policies that ensure large corporate users pay their fair share. On a personal level, adopting energy-efficiency upgrades at home could help offset rising costs. Even so, the larger battle will depend on whether regulators hold Big Tech accountable for the true cost of its growth.

Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters.
HERCULEAN TASK Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable.
Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan's vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres.
But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".","GOTO, Japan: Close to a small fishing port in southwestern Japan, the slim white turbines of the country's first commercial-scale floating wind farm glimmer offshore, months before a key project in Tokyo's green-energy strategy begins.

Still heavily reliant on imported fossil fuels, Japan has declared offshore wind energy a ""trump card"" in its drive to make renewables its top power source by 2040, and reach carbon neutrality a decade later.

That's despite rising project costs and fears over inadequate infrastructure to produce turbines en masse.

Floating turbines are particularly well suited to Japan as its deep coastal waters make fixing them to seabeds tricky, while the country is also prone to natural disasters.

""Floating structures are relatively stable even in the case of earthquakes or typhoons,"" said Kei Ushigami, head of marine renewable energy for construction company Toda, a key player in the project.

The eight turbines, sitting 5km off the coast of the Goto Islands in waters up to 140m deep, will officially start turning in January.

It's hoped they'll aid the archipelago in reaching ambitious new targets laid out this year that should see wind's contribution to the energy mix soar to between four and eight per cent by 2040, up from around one per cent today.

But it's a long, hard road ahead for resource-scarce Japan - the world's fifth-largest carbon dioxide emitter - to wean itself off fossil fuels.

In 2024, 65 percent of its electricity needs were met by coal and hydrocarbon-powered thermal plants, while just over a quarter came from renewables, according to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies.

HERCULEAN TASK

Costs are also rising sharply, and at the end of August Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi pulled out of three key wind power projects deemed no longer profitable.

Other project operators have asked for better support from the government.

""It is important for the government to address shortcomings in the current bidding system, which failed to anticipate rapid global inflation after bids were awarded,"" said Yoko Mulholland from the think tank E3G.

The streamlining of regulatory processes and easing construction restrictions would ""shorten lead times and also lower capital expenditure"", she told AFP.

Hidenori Yonekura, from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, sees the nascent floating wind energy as a path to eventually lower costs, by installing more turbines in Japan's vast Exclusive Economic Zone of 4.5 million square kilometres.

The task, however, appears Herculean: to meet the 2040 wind target, around 200 15-megawatt turbines a year need to go up.

But ""the infrastructure is not yet in place"", warned Yonekura. ""Japan lacks turbine manufacturers and large production sites.""

FISHERS' LIVELIHOODS

Construction companies also face technical challenges with these still-novel systems: defects discovered in the floating structure of a wind turbine at Goto meant Toda had to make replacements, delaying the project by two years.

Coexistence with local industries, especially fishing, is also crucial.

Toda said it had conducted an environmental assessment and found a pilot project had ""no negative impact on fish"".

Fishermen also receive part of the revenue from electricity sales and some of the property taxes generated by the project, while some have been hired to monitor the construction site with their vessels.

But according to Takuya Eashiro, head of the Fukue fishing cooperative in Goto, the wind project was imposed ""from the top"" and presented as ""a done deal"".

Nevertheless, ""fishermen understand the importance of such a project for Japan"", he said.

The National Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Associations protested to the government after Mitsubishi withdrew, reminding them that fishermen had worked with these projects, hoping for positive economic impacts.

As fishing becomes less viable owing to warming sea temperatures, ""some hope their children or grandchildren will find jobs in wind turbine maintenance"", said Eashiro.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--0i4eQ_EP--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2025/09/21/000_68xh3x3.jpg?itok=N8haSEgM",N,,2025-09-21 10:59:11.574696

Key Takeaway Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger.","A Nuclear Surge Ignites Investor Frenzy

On Friday, shares of Oklo (NYSE:OKLO) and NuScale Power (NYSE:SMR) blasted over 20% higher, electrified by the U.S.-U.K. Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, signed ahead of President Trump’s recent London visit.

This game-changing deal aligns the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with the U.K.’s regulator, reducing SMR licensing timelines from about three to four years to roughly two years. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright — a former fossil fuels executive — called it a “nuclear renaissance” and plans similar pacts with Poland, Romania, and others to power AI data centers and end Russian nuclear material reliance by 2028.

The agreement unlocks billions of dollars for SMR projects, like U.K. data centers in Nottinghamshire. With Oklo skyrocketing 537% year-to-date and NuScale up 160% in 2025, investors are wondering if these nuclear stocks are still a buy, or has the uranium train left the station?

Oklo (OKLO)

Oklo is a Santa Clara startup founded in 2013 by MIT alumni Jacob and Caroline DeWitte that is redefining nuclear power with its Aurora microreactors. These 15 to 50 megawatt electrical (MWe) fast-fission units — that are scalable to 100 MWe — run on recycled nuclear waste, offering meltdown-proof safety, passive cooling, and a 10-year fuel cycle.

Targeting off-grid clients such as data centers, military bases, and remote communities, Oklo sells power via long-term contracts, not reactors, and produces radioisotopes as a bonus. Backed by Sam Altman, Oklo has secured strategic partnerships with companies like Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX) for data center power and is prepping a 2027 debut in Idaho.

The U.S.-U.K. deal easing licensing requirements sparked Friday’s 28.8% surge to $135.23 per share by promising faster Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval — Oklo was denied a combined license for its Aurora microreactor in 2022 — and European pilots. Oklo’s 537% YTD gain reflects AI energy demand, its February Atomic Alchemy acquisition for isotope tech, and Trump’s May executive orders to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050.

Yet, because Oklo is pre-revenue with a $30.7 million cash burn against guidance for $65 million to $80 million in annual cash use, Oklo’s $20 billion market valuation is a bet on execution. Because it is trading on its potential rather than operational performance, it is best-suited for risk-tolerant investors. Dips below $100 per share could yield 50% to 100% upside if global SMR deals materialize, but expect a volatile ride getting there.

NuScale Power (SMR)

NuScale Power leads the SMR race with its VOYGR plants that are 77 MWe modules scalable up to 924 MWe per plant. As the only NRC-certified SMR design since 2022, NuScale’s factory-built approach cuts costs for utilities, industrials, and hyperscalers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google.

NuScale’s compact reactors are just 65 feet tall and use simplified pressurized water systems, reducing construction timelines and risks compared to traditional plants. Its 2025 wins include Romania’s Doicesti plant, where it will help deliver 462 MW of installed capacity, a 6 gigawatt (GW) Tennessee Valley Authority deal, partnering with ENTRA1 to commercialize its SMR technology inside ENTRA1’s power plants, and talks for a Polish project by 2029.

The U.S.-U.K. pact drove Friday’s 22% jump to $46.77 per share, bringing it within 12% of its all-time high of $53.50 per share hit in July. Its 160% YTD surge ties to revenue in Q2 that surged to $8.1 million from $1 million a year ago, DOE’s $400 million SMR funding, and AI hype.

Because NuScale is the only NRC-certified SMR operator and has a global pipeline, it provides the nuclear stock with a wide competitive moat, making SMR a strong buy. At almost $47 per share, it’s undervalued with 30% to 50% upside on international deployments, meaning you haven’t missed out on the opportunity to have your portfolio radiate stellar gains.

Key Takeaway

Oklo and NuScale are riding a nuclear revival, fueled by regulatory breakthroughs and AI’s energy hunger. Supply chain risks and fuel costs linger, but Secretary Wright’s global push signals a trillion-dollar SMR market. These stocks still have room to glow for bold investors.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/OKLO-Reactor.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:32.293276

The Japanese manufacturer will produce two new electric vehicle models in the country. This move aims to reduce costs and avoid the effects of tariffs.

This move takes place in a context of trade tensions. Donald Trump's policies imposed a 25% tax on cars manufactured abroad. Now Toyota is speeding up the production transition within the United States.

Two new electric vehicles will be manufactured in the United States

The stars of this announcement will be the electric versions of the RAV4 and Land Cruiser. Both models are brand benchmarks and will have three rows of seats, reinforcing their profile as family vehicles. The strategy aims to keep the essence of the best-selling SUVs, but with a sustainable focus.

The production of these models will be concentrated at the Georgetown, Kentucky plant. In addition, Toyota is strategically reorganizing its capacity at the Kentucky and Indiana plants. This opens the door to more future announcements about new vehicles manufactured in the United States.

The decision also secures jobs in Kentucky. The factory had lost workload after the next-generation Lexus ES returned to Japan in 2021. With these new models, Toyota strengthens its commitment to local employment and to an increasingly competitive market.

A direct response to tariffs

The strategy is part of a broader move among manufacturers. The Trump administration imposed tariffs with the intention of forcing brands to produce on U.S. soil. General Motors, Honda, and BMW had already announced similar plans to strengthen their domestic manufacturing.

Those who didn't adapt passed the costs on to consumers. In fact, Ford raised prices by two thousand euros on vehicles produced in Mexico. Meanwhile, Volkswagen and Subaru also applied considerable percentage increases to several of their models.

The effect on the market has multiplied. Used car prices remain high after the semiconductor crisis between 2020 and 2023. The shortage of new models reduced the supply of second-hand vehicles and raised repair costs, with an 8.5% (8.5%) increase in September.

Consumers bear the bill

Analysts warn that tariffs will keep pushing prices up. Michael DeLong, from the U.S. Consumers Federation, pointed out that the taxes don't benefit the buyer. According to him, costs are rising in all segments, including cars imported by individuals.

There is no shortage of examples. An Arizona resident had to pay six thousand euros just to re-enter the country with his own car. In addition, insurers project a nationwide increase of at least 8% in premiums for 2025, reaching up to 13% in some states.

In this context, Toyota's strategy is not only industrial but also competitive. The brand avoids price increases on its electric SUVs and strengthens its presence in the United States. The move aims to secure customers who increasingly value cost stability in a volatile market.",https://estoesatleti.es/filesedc/uploads/image/post/2025/07/toyota-coche-estados-unidos_1200_800.webp,N,,2025-09-21 10:59:50.279020

The collaboration establishes ElectricFish as a charge point operator on Emobi’s platform, positioning Emobi as the digital backbone for public chargers and fleet depots. ElectricFish’s technology delivers fast charging without requiring expensive grid upgrades, it said.

Emobi and ElectricFish Partnership Combines Speed, Compatibility

The partnership merges Emobi’s patented JustPlug technology with ElectricFish’s microgrid-scale energy storage and fast charging systems. Together, they address two of the biggest barriers to EV adoption — charging speed and grid infrastructure limitations.

Emobi’s JustPlug technology enables 80% of existing EVs and chargers—lacking native Plug & Charge features—to access seamless automatic charging. It also strengthens security with encryption and certificate authentication.

ElectricFish’s 350Squared system delivers 133% faster charging than traditional hardware while reducing grid upgrade costs by up to 90% through advanced power electronics and battery integration.

Traditional EV charger installations often face delays of up to two years and costs exceeding $100,000 due to required grid upgrades. The Emobi and ElectricFish partnership removes these barriers by enabling grid-independent fast charging. Operators gain interoperability, enhanced security, and the ability to offer Plug & Charge capabilities without costly hardware replacement, the companies said.

Leaders Emphasize the Future of EV Charging

“This partnership exemplifies our commitment to future-proofing EV infrastructure as we expand beyond public charging into fleet charging depots,” said Lin Sun Fa, CEO of Emobi. “ElectricFish’s approach to solving grid constraints complements our JustPlug technology’s ability to eliminate compatibility barriers across both public and fleet use cases.

So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

""There is still time, but the clock is ticking,"" said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

WHAT ARE THESE TAX INCENTIVES?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

WHEN ARE THE CREDITS EXPIRING?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that ""as soon as you hear this message.""

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. ""You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,"" she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

WHAT SHOULD I PRIORITIZE FOR MY HOME?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

""That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,"" she said. ""Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.""

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

""We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn't mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,"" Pierce said.

""Experts estimate that takes 16 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that's quick,"" said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. ""You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it's even possible.""

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

WHAT IF TAX CREDITS EXCEED WHAT I OWE?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects -- think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage -- could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.

But those focused on permitting reform bear similarities to AI bills introduced by Republicans.
Vitali adds there's also little to no activity in the House grappling with any climate or environmental harms directly generated by AI data center development.
The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.","When Pennsylvania state Sen. Katie Muth toured a small data center in her suburban Philadelphia district this May, she was mostly impressed by what she found. It was quiet and impeccably clean–a largely unintrusive presence even in a wealthy enclave where some of the closest neighbors live in million-dollar homes. But in one corner of the facility, Muth found the source of growing concern in the state.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

""The engineer that worked there showed us this cabinet farm that was kind of lightly shaking. It was very warm,"" Muth said. ""And he said it was an AI cabinet farm and that at certain times of the day, this sucker is just revving up.""

The copious amounts of power such AI servers require are already driving up energy bills for consumers in the state. Since her visit, Muth has announced plans to introduce the ""Pennsylvania Ratepayer Protection Act,"" just one of at least a dozen proposed or planned bills in Pennsylvania's legislature addressing the hottest industrial issue in the commonwealth.

Some of the bills aim to further ramp up data center development by modifying permitting and zoning procedures. Other legislation, including a package of bills under the banner of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's ""Lightning Plan,"" seeks to combine permitting reform with policies focused on clean energy and consumer costs.

Whether any of them will find their way through the morass of Pennsylvania's divided government remains to be seen.

Proponents of AI development view the technology's arrival as the dawn of a new industrial era in this resource-rich state, following booms of iron, coal, natural gas and, more recently, e-commerce warehouses. Speaking at a Pennsylvania Senate hearing in August, Merle Madrid, senior manager of public policy for Amazon Web Services, said his company's $20 billion investment in the state would create at least 1,250 new ""high-skilled"" jobs, support thousands of others and provide other benefits to host communities.

""Our investment in the commonwealth isn't just financial, it's also in the people and future of Pennsylvania,"" Madrid said.

Others–such as John Quigley, a former secretary of the state's Department of Environmental Protection and now senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania–view likening AI to major industries of the past as a cautionary tale. The state has a long legacy of unresolved industrial pollution, and some of the economic promises have fallen short.

""Pennsylvania's history is, we roll out the red carpet for every industry, regardless of whether its impacts are known or unknown,"" Quigley said. ""Then we find out later we made a mistake. … I don't see too much indication we're not on the same track.""

Muth is most interested in addressing the state's swiftly rising energy costs, a dynamic playing out across a 13-state territory overseen by electric grid operator PJM Interconnection. Stretching from Chicago to Jersey to eastern North Carolina, it's the nation's largest grid and includes all of Virginia and Pennsylvania, which consulting firm Wood Mackenzie ranks second and third among all states for announced data center development.

On June 1, many Pennsylvanians saw their electricity rates increase between 5 and 12 percent–and some as much as 40 percent–according to the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. And more is on the way. Each year, PJM holds ""capacity auctions"" for energy generation, which influence consumer costs by effectively balancing electricity supply against projected demand. Quigley notes that this summer's auction was a record-setting $16 billion, more than seven times the total from just two years ago.

PJM predicts the latest auction will cause energy bills to rise by another 1.5 to 5 percent next year. While the organization says costs are increasing for several reasons, including electrification and regular economic growth, its independent market monitor cites data centers as the primary and ""unprecedented"" cause, accounting for about $9.3 billion of this year's prices.

Muth's upcoming legislation is focused on yet another factor in costs: transmission. New industrial facilities that use copious amounts of electricity, like data centers, often require new power lines and other energy infrastructure to operate. In Pennsylvania, that's the domain of transmission companies like PECO and PPL, which pass along the costs of building new distribution lines to customers.

Muth said her bill is modeled on existing policies in Oregon that require ""high-load"" customers to fully cover the costs of infrastructure created for their benefit.

""I think the general public, all party affiliations, don't want to pay these increased utility bills. They can't afford them,"" Muth said. ""I can remember my own grandmother saying, 'I don't want to turn on the air conditioner because I don't want my electricity bill to go up.' And I hate to think that people have to make those decisions and sit there and suffer.""

But garnering the support of her colleagues will likely prove difficult. The state's politics are increasingly acrimonious: The Republican-controlled Senate and Democrat-occupied House and governor's office have butted heads, most recently over a state budget that is now more than two months overdue. Some in the state capital of Harrisburg, such as Elizabeth Marx, executive director of the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, doubt there's much room for compromise.

""I do not see the Pennsylvania General Assembly breaking gridlock on any energy issues anytime soon,"" Marx said. ""While there are some common threads of agreement that we need to protect consumers from increased rates as a result of data centers, there is not agreement on the 'how.'""

Still, others say AI-related legislation is important to track, as it shapes the policy landscape in which a future deal may be forged. And some kind of action may become unavoidable as consumer costs–and anger–rises, said Katie Blume, political and legislative director of the nonprofit advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania.

""We need to socialize these ideas with the legislature, with the public, and we need to make sure that people are brought into conversations who are going to be impacted by these things,"" Blume said. ""And I think the Senate Republicans who always say, 'We don't want to do anything on energy right now,' are going to be in between a rock and a hard place before too long.""

Power Plays

On the surface, there does appear to be at least some common ground among Pennsylvania lawmakers on AI data center development: getting more of it.

In Pittsburgh in early July, U.S. Senator Dave McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, convened an Energy and Innovation Summit that drew both President Donald Trump and Shapiro. All three expressed excitement over what McCormick says is more than $90 billion in investments announced by tech companies in the state.

The legislature has previously found its way to a deal in the space. In 2021, a tax bill that included a measure to strengthen an existing tax credit for purchasing servers and other equipment for large data centers in the state passed with wide bipartisan support. The incentive currently costs the state about $43 million in tax revenue a year, and Shapiro's office projects it will eclipse $50 million annually by the end of the decade. But politicians, including Shapiro himself, have cited it as key to growing the industry in the state, with a spokesperson for the governor telling Spotlight PA that it will ""generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax revenue for state and local governments.""

Shapiro's Lightning Plan is a package of six bills that, altogether, seek to create a new ""streamlined"" permitting process for key energy projects, create new tax incentives for diverse energy sources, create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, bolster renewable energy and attempt to address energy costs in rural and low-income communities. Although the package does not directly address the buildout of AI data centers, it focuses on spurring new energy generation needed by the power-hungry sector and is similar to some other bills specifically addressing AI.

Many of the Lightning Plan measures, such as the carbon program, are supported by Democratic rank-and-file members seeking effective climate policy. But those focused on permitting reform bear similarities to AI bills introduced by Republicans. Senate Bill 939, introduced by Republican state Sen. Greg Rothman with at least one Democratic co-sponsor, proposes creating a ""Commonwealth Opportunity Zone"" that would create a fast-track permitting process for data centers, as well as a ""regulatory sandbox"" encouraging deregulation.

""This innovative, collaborative framework will enable industry leaders to work directly with state agencies to identify and remove unnecessary and outdated regulations, thereby streamlining the development process and accelerating innovation,"" Rothman's office, which did not respond to inquiries from Inside Climate News, stated in a press release announcing the proposal.

A Republican colleague in the House, Rep. Jason Ortitay, introduced a bill to create a ""Keystone Artificial Intelligence Authority"" to similarly ""streamline and coordinate"" permitting through a new, centralized process. Other Republicans say they are preparing to introduce measures also designed to accelerate data-center permitting and create new tax incentives, with some bipartisan support.

Asked to comment for this story, Shapiro's office touted a focus on permit reform, noting the governor already established an Office of Transformation and Opportunity ""as a one-stop-shop for businesses looking to grow in the Commonwealth."" In 2024, his administration also launched the PA Permit Fast Track Program, which it calls an innovative permitting system to ""expedite major economic development and infrastructure projects,"" including a data center campus in Northeast Pennsylvania.

""Governor Shapiro is laser-focused on getting stuff done and taking real action to lower Pennsylvanians' energy costs through his commonsense, all-of-the-above energy plan to build more power in the Commonwealth, create a more reliable, affordable energy grid, and position the Commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come,"" his office said in a prepared statement.

Among the points of conflict: Several Harrisburg insiders say Shapiro and Republican Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman are at loggerheads on energy policy over the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program spanning 10 neighboring states. Shapiro's predecessor, Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, joined the program in 2022, but Pennsylvania's participation is tied up in the commonwealth's courts.

Shapiro's administration has defended the initiative in court but has floated PACER–the bill in the Lightning Plan that would create a state-run ""cap-and-invest"" program–as a preferred alternative.

Pittman's office did not respond to requests for comment. But the senator previously told Spotlight PA the pending RGGI case leaves his caucus ""very limited"" in considering energy-related legislation, a dynamic that others say remains the status quo.

A Call From Inside the House

Some of Shapiro's policies also face opposition from members of his own party, particularly RESET, another Lightning Plan bill. The legislation's primary sponsor, state Rep. Mandy Steele, says it would create a ""central cohesive authority"" to approve siting applications for large energy-generating facilities.

Muth said that opposition to the bill from some southeast Pennsylvania Democrats crystallized in June when the House Energy Committee held a hearing on the legislation. A bevy of environmental groups came out against it for fear the new state board could support new fossil fuel infrastructure while local officials objected to losing authority over siting.

The bill has the support of several Democratic committee members, labor organizations and environmental groups. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Nature Conservancy think the board will boost clean energy buildouts.

Muth says she's seen some potential Republican support percolating for the bill, which leads her to believe that deals could be coming, perhaps in next year's budget negotiations, if not in the one still ongoing.

""My fear is we're going to have this dumped into something,"" Muth said. ""It could happen tomorrow.""

Quigley, the energy expert and former DEP secretary, believes that if something does emerge from the legislature, it will likely focus primarily on deregulation and industry incentives, rather than consumer costs or environmental protection. Both the state's powerful natural gas lobby and trade unions support AI development, he notes.

""There's this rush to deregulate, to accommodate this industry that no one is prepared for,"" Quigley said.

State Rep. Greg Vitali, another Southeast Pennsylvania Democrat and chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, is also concerned environmental considerations could be overlooked in the push for more AI and energy to feed it.

He notes that both the cap-and-trade bill PACER, as well as a PRESS bill that would require more renewables to be added to the state's energy mix, have stalled even in the Democratically controlled chamber. The latter bill, he believes, has been held up after fossil fuel lobbyists convinced some House Democrats that a measure diminishing waste coal's status in the energy mix would be harmful.

Vitali adds there's also little to no activity in the House grappling with any climate or environmental harms directly generated by AI data center development. Natural gas may end up powering much of the nation's data-center growth, and many of the tech promises to the contrary are short on details.

""When the governor announces his $20 billion deal with Amazon, you don't hear any discussion of climate impacts. … It just seems to be one of the things people forget about,"" Vitali said. ""I think legislators are discouraged from talking about any issue in terms of climate because it's almost become like a poison pill in anything you want to get through the Senate.""

Quigley says history has shown that ""legislators always play catch-up"" to new industries, and believes that will be the case with AI as well.

""These data centers can potentially use millions of gallons of water a day … and nobody's raised the issue, nobody's planned for it,"" Quigley said, adding that millions of Pennsylvanians rely on groundwater wells for drinking water.

In an email, Amazon Web Services says its company is focused on efficiency and sustainability, with ongoing plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and be ""water positive"" by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses.

""Amazon is continually improving water efficiency, using advanced cloud services, such as internet of things technologies, to analyze real time water use, identify and fix leaks, and gain other efficiencies,"" the company said in its statement. ""Amazon is further improving operational efficiency to reduce cooling water use in many facilities for most of the year, instead by relying on outside air.""

Mind Your Ps and Queues

In the absence of legislative action, policies set by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and PJM could have an outsize effect.

The PUC is a quasi-independent state agency whose directors are appointed to terms by the governor. In April, the commission held a hearing about a potential ""model tariff"" on AI data center development, which Marx said could help ensure ""large load"" customers like data centers pay for any transmission costs they generate. The PUC could also facilitate rate assistance programs requiring companies to help low-income residents afford their energy bills, Marx said.

The release of a model tariff is expected soon: PUC spokesperson Dave Hixson told Inside Climate News that the commission is drafting a proposal with a goal to issue it ""in the near future.""

Quigley adds that PJM is also taking steps to consider new policies, including measures that would require data centers to ""bring their own power"" to the grid instead of eating into existing capacity.

""So there's two positive things,"" Quigley said.

Jackson Morris, director of state power sector policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, notes that, like the Pennsylvania legislature, PJM has also been subject to criticism over gridlock. Its new power generation queue remains backed up and renewable energy projects buried. He thinks something will have to give way to the pressures of the new AI paradigm.

""You've literally got governors running for office talking about PJM capacity, market reforms. Two, three years ago, you never heard a governor say the letters PJM,"" Morris said. ""We're not living in that world anymore.""",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/AI_data_centers_PA.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 10:00:48.044597

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land.
Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple.
Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike.
""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields.","In 2023, world leaders pledged to triple global renewable energy capacity by the end of this decade at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai. Meeting this goal will require an unprecedented buildout of renewable energy projects, both in speed and in scale. And all of those projects are going to require a whole lot of land, presenting serious challenges for land use strategies.

The kind of utility-scale solar and wind farms that will be necessary to meet internationally binding climate goals require huge amounts of undeveloped land. “Utility-scale solar and wind farms require at least ten times as much space per unit of power as coal- or natural gas–fired power plants, including the land used to produce and transport the fossil fuels,” says a 2022 report from global consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Company. “Wind turbines are often placed half a mile apart, while large solar farms span thousands of acres.”

And, while the vast land tracts that these projects are targeting are undeveloped, it doesn’t mean that they are unused or unpopulated. “These developments often intersect with agricultural zones, conservation areas and Indigenous territories,” explains Renewable Energy Magazine in an article released earlier this year. Plus, the rural areas that have the most undeveloped land are often the most resistant to large-scale renewable energy projects, leading to tense political flare-ups and litigious gridlock that can keep projects tied up in court for years.

Finding land-use agreements that allow for mixed-use plots will be essential to achieving the renewable energy buildout we need without compromising agricultural production, rural livelihoods, and food security. Some farmers have rented out their land to solar developers, but this practice can be risky, with grave consequences for the topsoil. Solar farms, if they clear the land of all vegetation, can create prime conditions for erosion, making that land unsuitable for agriculture more or less permanently. “The reality is that it takes thousands of years to create an inch of fertile topsoil,” warns National Geographic, “but it can be destroyed in minutes.”

But marrying solar power and agriculture on the same land at the same time could provide a win-win for both sectors. The practice, called agrivoltaics, is not a new concept, but it hasn’t reached a commercial scale since its conception in the 1980s. Figuring out how to provide solar panels and crops with optimal sunlight on the same land is not so simple. “A pressing question is how AV technology can maximize crop productivity and energy generation while minimizing plant water loss and irrigation needs,” Phys.org wrote in a 2023 report. “That's a lot to ask for on a piece of land.”

But a new pilot project in Denmark seems to have cracked the code. Researchers from Aarhus University have developed a full-scale solar plant that uses vertically mounted solar panels for optimal output for solar energy and crops alike. ""Our measurements show that wheat and grass-clover mixtures grow just as well between vertical solar panels as in open fields. At the same time, the panels produce electricity in a daily pattern that better matches energy demand. It's a win-win,"" Marta Victoria, lead author of the study and Associate Professor at the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering, Aarhus University, told Tech Xplore.

Critically, the solar panels only took up about 10% of the land, allowing for successful metrics from both the agricultural and the photovoltaic sides of the agrivoltaic model. The study, recently published in the scientific journal Energy Nexus, yielded excellent results in full sun as well as with conditions of some shade. ""Even with some shade, the yield per square meter is almost the same. The crops don't seem to mind the presence of solar panels and they like the wind protection that they provide,"" explains Professor Uffe Jørgensen from the Department of Agroecology.

Evans isn’t the only Coloradan participating in Problem Solvers; GOP Rep. Jeff Hurd and Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen are members of the caucus.","The bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus is hoping to have lightning strike twice.

The group, which released a framework for infrastructure that eventually became law under the Biden Administration, has released a new policy plan — this time an approach to permitting reform that they think has a chance of getting through Congress.

“One of the things that we've been trying to get rolling in our group is the generation of two-party solutions on some key areas that we think are going to determine the success or failure of our country over the next decade,” said co-chair Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Pennsylvania. “Energy and permitting reform is at the top of that list.”

Colorado GOP Rep. Gabe Evans co-led the working group that developed the framework with California Rep. Scott Peters.

Evans said they had one goal in mind: to streamline the process to get new energy projects — from fossil fuels to renewables — up and running faster.

“We have to make sure that we can navigate our own regulatory environment to be able to build these things here in the United States with some of the best and most environmentally and socially responsible guidelines, really anywhere on the planet,” said Evans.

The framework includes five key goals, starting with cutting red tape and depoliticizing the permitting process. It also seeks to meet the nation’s fast-growing energy demand, reform NEPA requirements, set clear and enforceable permitting deadlines and strengthen domestic supply chains.

Peters noted that other legislators have been introducing bills aimed at many of these goals, including one from the chair of the House Natural Resources Committee called the SPEED Act, which reforms NEPA. “I think ultimately this probably all comes together as a big package, because everyone wants to make sure they’re covered.”

Evans added that having a framework, as opposed to lawmakers introducing specific bills, allows for “greater flexibility to be able to work with all the different stakeholder groups to make sure that we’re getting that input early, that we’re getting that buy-in earlier on.”

This approach, he added, also helps ensure there is a large coalition to support getting the permitting reform package through Congress, where it will need backing from members in both parties to garner the minimum 60 votes to pass the Senate.

The Problem Solvers Caucus pointed out that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law started out just like this.

“Started as a framework, then became a bill. Got endorsed by the group, and it was ultimately a bipartisan coalition that got it over the finish line,” said Fitzpatrick. “And our country is better for that bill. We hope this can be following in those footsteps.”

The group has an aggressive timeline. The SPEED Act could hit the House floor by the end of the year and the group is hopeful they can get a package together by then. One bill they mentioned for inclusion in the package, and that meets the guidelines of the framework, is a Senate permitting reform bill introduced in the last Congress by Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso and former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin.

Among other things, that bill, the Energy Permitting Reform Act, proposed shortening timelines on litigation for projects, provided two pathways for transmission development and accelerated leasing and permitting decisions for all types of energy projects.

Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.
Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms.
So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.
The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.","Dust storms have always swirled through parts of North America, but they are becoming more unexpected and destructive and landing in places unfamiliar with the danger, scientists warn.

In May 2023, a dust storm stalled over parts of central Illinois, disorienting more than 80 motorists on Interstate 55 who crashed into each other, leaving eight people dead and 37 hospitalized. In March this year, Kansas found itself swallowed in a dusty rush of wind that covered Interstate 70, killing eight people in a 71-car pileup. A few months later, Chicago was engulfed by its first torrent of throat-choking dust since 1985. No one was injured in that May storm but visibility was near zero for hours.

In all these cases, the dustups followed a similar script. Thunderstorm winds churned up soil from plowed-open fields and carried it for a short distance. Dust billowed violently, giving people little warning. Scientists from the region are now reviewing and pursuing research to consider whether the ruptures are the start of a new normal for parts of the Midwest.

Agriculture practices have been slow to adapt or anticipate the risks of climate change and particularly droughts, some studies have shown. Dry-tilled fields, notably before spring plantings, are vulnerable to more intense seasonal winds. Kansas knows from history the wreckage of harsh and relentless gusts. A hundred years ago, parts of the Plains states lived through the disastrous Dust Bowl before agricultural irrigation and adaptations were in place.

Will this generation, across the Midwest, have to reckon with a new dust risk rooted in climate change?

Drivers of Dust

Both 2023 and 2025 storms in Illinois happened early in the growing season. In 2023, the winds swept up dust from open fields, just south of Springfield. As it moved eastward, the wind speed rose to roughly 60 mph. Nearby Interstate 55 was in its path.

Eliot Clay, director of the Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts, lives near Interstate 55. He was worried shortly before the disaster. “I remember a couple days prior noticing how much dust was in the air, like you could see it,” Clay said. “I remember thinking if this wind shifts and it goes from west to east, there is a major interstate right there. And sure enough, all of that happened a couple days later.”

Complex factors caused the Interstate 55 storm, said Jonathan Coppess, director of the Gardner Agriculture Policy Program at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and former administrator of the Farm Service Agency at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A cold spring season coincided with drought, creating a lot of dust in the fields. The planting season started late and high winds descended. Then there was a bit of bad luck.

Coppess and a team of researchers from the University of Illinois, Texas A&M University and Cornell University studied the 2023 incident and described how the dust storm crossed I-55 and collided with a tree line—a defense often planted close to highways to prevent dust storms and blizzards.

But there was only one tree line along this part of the highway and it, unfortunately, was on the wrong side of the road for this storm.

“If the wind had come from the other direction, there would have been no accident simply because that windbreak would have worked,” Coppess said. “The most interesting to me is how that clump of trees, which is designed basically as a windbreak, ended up concentrating dust right in the accident spot.”

Thomas E. Gill and a team of colleagues in Texas have calculated that the economic risk of such storms is rising and that the U.S. could be losing around $154.4 billion annually due to wind erosion and dust, according to a review of data from 2017.

That number, which includes losses in agriculture and renewable energy, health costs, car accidents and other factors, was based on the limited data they could gather. Gill, an environmental scientist at the University of Texas at El Paso, said the real toll is likely higher.

Gill is one of the leaders at the Dust Alliance for North America, an inter-university partnership that aims to promote more dust-related research and its practical application across the United States and other countries. The accident in Illinois isn’t the only recent dust storm that caused blinding loss of visibility and car crashes, Gill said.

Accidents increasingly have been recorded across the Great Plains and the Pacific Northwest.

Growing dust storms aren’t necessarily warning of a repeat of the Depression-era tragedy, he said. “Rather than seeing a large wholesale dust bowl over a lot of the plains like happened in the 1930s, you might see a bunch of mini dust bowls here and there in various different states and regions,” said Gill, who has published several studies on atmospheric dust.

The United States has better soil and water protection efforts than a century ago. But, he said, “there’s no question that climate change is one of the major drivers of dust.”

Drought and Gusts

So how does a dust storm erupt?

Air is constantly filled with soil and sand particles that move around, playing a key role in spreading minerals. Plants in North and South America are partly dependent on the dust carried all the way from the Sahara Desert by Atlantic winds. But droughts and strong winds can complicate dust movements, leading to serious harm.

A dust storm is an occurrence that reduces visibility to less than one kilometer, according to the World Meteorological Organization, a United Nations agency that promotes international cooperation on atmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics. Periodic exposure to dust storms leads to long-term health risks, including cardiovascular disease and lung conditions like asthma.

Last year, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2025 to 2034 as the Decade on Combating Sand and Dust Storms. With this initiative, U.N. officials are trying to raise awareness of dust threats and urge more international cooperation.

Dust formation is a mechanical process. It usually happens in two ways, said Barry Baker, a physical research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Air Resources Laboratory.

Wind can make a large dust particle roll on the ground, forming the particles into larger masses. That formation is called a creep.

The other process is called impaction, where the wind is high enough to raise particles off the ground until they fall to earth with calamity. “Whenever it crashes, it throws a bunch of other particles up in the air,” Baker said, “and that then basically cascades more and more and more.”

The increased unpredictable heavy rains and extreme droughts create potential for more dust events, Baker said. These events happen in spring and fall, when the soil is often barren, but now they have started to “even out” throughout the year, he added. So big dust storms are happening earlier and later in the season than they used to, he said.

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away.”

— Eliot Clay, Association of Illinois Soil & Water Conservation Districts

U.S. farmers have protected their soil with cover crops over the years, notably after the 1930s and in recent decades. But strong spring winds have arrived before planting in the past couple of years, not just confusing drivers on Illinois’ interstate but confounding farmers. The quality of soil is at risk.

“The soil is so good [in Illinois] because it had thousands of years of perennial tall grass prairie on it,” said Clay, who represents the 97 soil and water conservation districts in Illinois. “And that system that existed naturally meant we had root systems that were going deep into the ground.”

“When we see dust storms happen, that is the top soil that has taken thousands of years to build up, literally blowing away,” Clay said.

Altering the Landscape

Anna Gannet Hallar, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, was part of a research team that in 2020 examined space satellite data of expanded farmland within the Midwest/Great Plains region. They explored how climate change and land use has been “altering the landscape, producing increases in windblown dust.”

Hallar said most observed dust increases were significant, linked to land being tilled more often. The Great Plains region faces an increased risk of dust storms and possible desertification, Hallar said.

“We saw doubling [of dust in the air] over 20 years, and we were able to show that that doubling was associated with changes in land use,” Hallar said.

Evan Thaler, a soil health researcher at Oregon State University, said 30 percent of the top-level soil in the Midwest has been lost. “What’s driving the majority of erosion across the landscape is just the mechanical movement of soil by people plowing over and over and over,” Thaler said. “If we’re tilling a lot, it makes the soil susceptible to any type of erosion.”

As the climate crisis accelerates across the planet, it creates conditions for multiyear droughts in many regions, including the United States. Such droughts endanger both plants and soil—which simply doesn’t have enough time to regenerate. Some multiyear droughts turn into megadroughts—among the most severe in centuries.

The U.S. Southwest is currently going through its most intense megadrought in 1,200 years.

Zack Leasor, director of the Missouri Climate Center at the University of Missouri and the state climatologist, said multiyear droughts can lead to much more devastating effects than a one-time event. It takes time for water reservoirs, plants and industry to recover. With a year-after-year drought, they get no break, he explained.

After the Dust Bowl, the Great Plains agriculture industry recovered and relies now on irrigation from underground water sources, Leasor said. That irrigation system helps confront droughts, but the increasing number of megadroughts as climate change worsens will test that adaptation, Leasor warned.

“While groundwater can be kind of a Band-Aid to get you through a drought, it can also turn into a long-term water supply problem,” Leasor said. Groundwater is used up much faster than it can be replenished, he said, and repetitive drought lets less and less moisture from rain reach down into natural underground reservoirs.

While existing irrigation technologies can help, they aren’t going to solve the growing drought problems, Leasor said.

Gill and his research colleagues, meanwhile, found that human casualties from dust storms are roughly on the same level as casualties from hurricanes, thunderstorms or wildfires. Frequently that’s happened in deserts and farm country—places that don’t receive a lot of press coverage.

Wind farms are becoming more common in Indiana. The state already boasts the fourth largest ""farm"" in the U.S. and produces more than 3,500 megawatts of wind energy.

The towering windmills reaching up to the sky produced 10% of all the electricity used in the state in 2023. That's enough to power more than 1 million homes, according to the American Clean Power Association.

With more projects in the works, wind power is likely to continue to grow across the state. And with the increasing presence of the conspicuous energy generators comes some curiosity.

So, for this edition of Scrub Hub, we chose a question from Teresa, who asked: Why are the wind turbines not turning right now?

It’s possible for the blades on wind turbines to reach up to speeds of 200 mph, so it may seem odd when some are spinning very quickly while the blades on others nearby are not moving.

We dug around in some state, federal and industry reports and reached out to academic experts in energy technology to determine why some turbines in a wind farm spin while others remain still.

Short Answer: The turbine is down for maintenance

Wind turbines, like all machines, need both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. In some instances that explains why some are operating but not others.

The basic components of a wind turbine are the visible tower and rotor blades, as well as the gearbox and generator located at the top of the tower.

Scheduled maintenance helps prevent wear and tear from breaking parts and unscheduled maintenance occurs when the turbine experiences any of a number of failures.

Regular preventative maintenance can include periodic equipment inspection, oil and filter changes, calibration and adjustment of various parts, as well as replacing brake pads and seals. General housekeeping and blade cleaning can also temporarily keep a turbine from spinning.

In larger wind farms, several turbines on a circuit can be inoperable and not spinning because they are all down for maintenance, said John Roudebush, program chair of Ivy Tech College’s Energy Technology program.

Long answer: Curtailment, congestion and wind speed

Energy transmission in Indiana is run through the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, commonly known as MISO. The group manages the flow of electricity by balancing demand versus what’s being generated, which means there are times where excess electricity is being produced.

“(Sometimes) we don’t need the power as demand is down or another power plant is selling power to the customers instead,” Roudebush wrote in an email. “Power plants compete on the grid. A coal plant, a natural gas plant, or a wind farm will all bid to sell power during some part of the day and MISO will pick the cheapest bid for the day. Generally, wind is the cheapest but not always.”

John Hall, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo’s Engineering and Applied Sciences, focuses his research on the technical aspects of wind energy. While some wind turbines will operate normally, he said others may be stopped to match production with grid demand.

“Basically, you have the utility company distributing power and buying and selling in real time,” Hall said. “Based on how much they need, wind farms would turn turbines off accordingly.”

The industry calls a wind turbine that is not spinning “parked,” Hall said, and this is done with a braking system that holds the rotor in place. Once energy demand rises, the brake is released and almost immediately the turbine starts delivering electricity to the grid again.

Another obvious answer to why the turbines may not be spinning is that the wind speed is not high enough.

Generally, turbines can generate power with wind speeds as low as 5 mph. If speeds fall below that, there just isn’t enough to turn the sometimes massive blades.

On the other hand, wind that is too fast can cause damage to the turbines, so operators of wind farms will park the rotors until the wind calms down. Turbines generally shut down when wind speeds hit about 55 mph.

“The system is not designed for that, so they shut it down,” Hall said. “That’s OK because we rarely get winds over that speed, and it would not be worthwhile to design for that for the few instances.”

To help improve the efficiency of wind farms, Hall said banking excess power is a huge research area right now.

“There are studies on new battery technology and super capacitors and different ways to get around that issue,” Hall said.

Another solution for storing excess electricity is by making hydrogen, Hall said. Wind farm operators would be able to create hydrogen and store it for use later when the grid demand increases.

While fossil fuel plants may be more responsive to the constantly moving supply and demand for electricity, Hall said the future depends on renewables.

""If folks are concerned about climate and want a better future for the next generation and everything, renewable energy like wind and hydro-electric and tidal power are all really not just sources of energy but vital to perhaps our existence,"" Hall said.

The Nevada Independent is continuing to report on the state’s battery industry.
What Tesla got changed Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan.","Tesla successfully fended off proposed environmental regulations in Nevada late last year that would have applied more stringent rules on its battery production operations, according to records obtained by The Nevada Independent.

As the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) sought to create a new regulatory framework governing an array of hazardous materials, the company pushed back — and quickly got its way.

Tesla, which builds battery packs and energy-storage products at its massive Gigafactory east of Reno, argued that regulations proposed by NDEP staff would threaten Nevada’s leading position in a nascent industry that is crucial to diversifying the state’s economy beyond gaming and tourism. The proposed rules would put Nevada “at a disadvantage when competing with other states to grow the lithium-ion battery recycling industry,” a Tesla executive wrote to NDEP in a late October letter.

The proposals would have required companies including Tesla to obtain more onerous permits (which require ongoing compliance reports and could lead to federally mandated spill cleanups but are generally not required for recycling facilities) for certain operations. It also would have required companies to continue following more stringent federal waste regulations related to the handling of hazardous materials, which include scrap metals or sludges that can be ignitable, corrosive, reactive or toxic.

Two days after Tesla wrote NDEP, the company’s lobbyist sent the same letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office, which four days later participated in a meeting with officials from NDEP, Tesla and Redwood Materials, a Northern Nevada battery recycling company started by a co-founder of Tesla. One day after the meeting, held in the governor’s chief of staff’s office and on Microsoft Teams, an updated version of the regulation was sent by NDEP to participants with everything Tesla had asked for in the letter.

“Thank you very much for actioning the industry feedback so swiftly,” a Tesla official emailed the day after receiving the updated regulation.

A panel of state lawmakers later adopted the new rules without controversy.

The previously unreported series of events, revealed in documents obtained from the governor’s office through a public records request, brings into question the role battery companies should have in developing environmental regulations that are designed to keep workers, the public and the environment safe.

Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Its Nevada lobbyist told The Indy in an email that the company does not comment on media inquiries “as a general rule.”

The governor’s office said in a statement that it “has focused on streamlining regulations and implementing regulations that simultaneously support industry safety standards and pro-business policies,” and that it “regularly works” with industry associations and state agencies to shape regulations.

In an interview with The Indy, NDEP officials said that the governor’s office has no defined role in the regulatory process, but it sometimes is involved.

“Because of the growth of this economic sector, they’re interested in what’s going on,” NDEP Administrator Jennifer Carr said. “The governor’s office did not get involved in our process. … We never feel pressure to do anything from the governor's office.”

State agencies typically oversee the regulatory process, but on rare occasions, the process can involve the governor’s office, according to a former high-ranking state official granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal state regulatory dynamics. However, the source noted it is uncommon for a company to immediately get what it wanted from state officials, and that more back-and-forth could have occurred outside of what the public records revealed.

The governor’s office declined to make Lombardo’s chief of staff or its liaison to NDEP available for an interview, but it did respond to The Indy’s written request for comment.

NDEP received almost 70 comments regarding the proposed regulations, which the agency replied to as part of the normal regulation process. Agency officials told The Indy that it did not intend to make its rules more stringent than federal ones, but realized it had done so after meeting with industry officials.

Similar to many other businesses, Tesla has contracted with a lobbying firm in Nevada (Rowe Law Group) and has also engaged in lobbying efforts in other states, such as when CEO Elon Musk hired a dozen lobbyists in Texas this year to pass legislation advantageous to Tesla and another one of his companies, SpaceX.

Nevada officials across the political spectrum have embraced Tesla and the broader battery industry as a surefire way to expand the state’s tourism-dependent economy. State legislators approved a $1.25 billion tax incentive package for Tesla in 2014 — an unprecedented deal in the Silver State — and in 2023, state officials approved $330 million in additional tax breaks for a corporation valued at more than $1 trillion.

These investments are part of the state’s efforts to create a “lithium loop,” with the goal of encompassing all aspects of the process, from lithium extraction to its processing and eventual recycling.

“Our state has the components to be world leaders in battery development,” Lombardo said last year.

The Nevada Independent is continuing to report on the state’s battery industry. Please fill out this form if you have any information to provide.

What the regulation means

The newly crafted regulation will likely lead to a system where fewer types of hazardous materials in Nevada are designated as waste, meaning there will be fewer requirements for certain companies that deal with hazardous materials.

The regulation was part of a broader effort to create a new framework in Nevada governing “hazardous secondary materials,” which are manufacturing byproducts that are not subject to certain federal waste regulations if they are legitimately recycled and meet other federal criteria. The state must validate that a company is meeting this criteria. .

Corrado DeGasperis, CEO at Comstock Inc., a Northern Nevada-based company that was involved in the battery recycling industry but has since pivoted to solar panel recycling, said under the new framework, companies will be incentivized to recycle their products. Disposing them as waste triggers more government oversight.

“Nevada’s way, way, way better off with these materials being recycled,” DeGasperis said.

In an interview, NDEP Deputy Administrator Jeffrey Kinder said the agency did not intend for the state’s hazardous secondary materials rules to be more stringent than the federal ones. It was only after input from industry officials that the agency recognized its proposed regulation would have been overly restrictive.

“We do sometimes ask for more stringent regulations through our own state process if we think there's a gap in what the federal program does,” he said. “But … that didn't exist. [It] is a fairly robust federal program that's been operating for a number of years in a number of states.”

Six facilities, including Redwood and Tesla, have notified the state they have applied to handle these secondary materials, according to NDEP.

Discarded lithium batteries are typically designated as hazardous waste because of their ignitability and reactivity, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But because the industry is still in its infancy, the recycling chain for lithium ion batteries is still being developed, according to Nevada lithium experts.

Top NDEP officials said, during their tenure, they have never been tasked with drafting regulations for a sector as large and rapidly evolving as the lithium recycling industry.

What Tesla got changed

Tesla objected to permit requirements that it said would have cost millions of dollars across a facility’s lifespan. These permits require ongoing compliance reports, and the EPA is able to issue orders or file lawsuits to these permitted facilities to require cleanups of spills.

These requirements, according to Tesla’s letter last year to state environmental regulators, could lead some lithium recyclers to “be forced to choose between losing ground to competitors in other states” or “ceasing business altogether.” Battery facilities have long eyed Nevada for its business-friendly environment, particularly the lack of state income tax.

Additionally, under the initial regulation, some materials would have still been classified as hazardous waste — and subject to stricter oversight — because the state did not intend to adopt certain federal rules. However, Tesla said in its letter to regulators that the decision to not adopt these rules “effectively advantages select recyclers, while disadvantaging others.”

Under the revised regulations, NDEP will now be solely responsible for validating whether battery facilities are meeting the requirements for legitimate recycling.

The agency has seven employees overseeing all hazardous waste compliance and enforcement for the entire state — not just for the battery factories.

NEW DELHI — Hitting back at Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav for criticising the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, party leader Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said drawing the nation’s attention to an imminent “ecological and humanitarian disaster” is not “negative politics” but an expression of grave concern.

Ramesh said, the minister is simply unable to answer basic questions that Congress has been repeatedly raising on the project, PTI reported.

“The Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav has accused the Indian National Congress of doing what he calls ‘negative politics’ on the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project.

Drawing the nation’s attention to an imminent ecological and humanitarian disaster is NOT ‘negative politics’. It is an expression of grave concern,” Ramesh said on X.

The minister is simply unable to answer basic questions that the INC has been repeatedly raising on the project, he said and asked whether the Great Nicobar Mega Infra Project, which requires the diversion of lakhs of trees, violate the National Forest Policy, 1988 which states that “tropical rain/moist forests, particularly in areas Andaman & Nicobar Islands should be totally safeguarded?”

“Compensatory afforestation is always a poor substitute for old-growth forests but the afforestation planned in this project is farcical.

How can afforestation in distant Haryana, with a completely different ecosystem, be considered a genuine offset for the loss of old-growth rainforest unique to Great Nicobar? Why has the Government of Haryana already freed up 25 per cent of this land for mining instead of reserving it for the afforestation?” Ramesh said.

Why was the National Commission on Scheduled Tribes not consulted before the Nicobar project was approved, he asked.

“Why are the concerns of the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar regarding this project being ignored? Why is the Shompen Policy of the Islands, which explicitly calls for the integrity of the community to be prioritised in all projects, being disregarded?” Ramesh said.

Why does the “Social Impact Assessment” conducted as part of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR) ignore the existence of the Shompen and the Nicobarese, the Congress leader further asked.

“The Forest Rights Act (2006) holds the Shompen as the sole legally empowered authority to protect, preserve, regulate, and manage the tribal reserve.

Why does the Project’s approval process fail to recognize the same?” Ramesh said.

He pointed out that the island harbours endangered species, including leatherback turtles, megapodes, saltwater crocodiles, and rich coral systems. Won’t this project drive these species closer to extinction, he asked.

“Why are critical documents relating to this project, including the reports of the ground-truthing exercise conducted to reclassify the location of the planned transshipment port from CRZ1-A, not being published in the open?” Ramesh said.

Given the island’s history of severe subsidence during the 2004 tsunami and its location in a high-seismic zone, can the sustainability of this project be assured, he further asked.

“Over twenty years ago, a valuable book was published.

It was called ‘Supreme Court on Forest Conservation’ and it was authored by Ritwick Dutta and Bhupender Yadav.

Sadly the first author has had investigative agencies unleashed against him for his environmental activism – but happily the second author has had a much better fate. When will that Bhupender Yadav awake?” he said.

Yadav last Thursday hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in “negative politics”.

Speaking at an event organised by The Public Affairs Forum of India here, Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region.

Yadav said only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar’s forest area will be used for the project.

His remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the Rs 72,000 crore project a “planned misadventure” that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world’s most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by “making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes”.

“The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project’s proposed land area.

The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami.

This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,” Gandhi had said.

She had also argued that the Shompen face an even greater threat as the project denotifies a significant part of their reserve and will bring a large influx of people and tourists to the island.

In response, Yadav recently authored a column in the same newspaper, defending the project as one of strategic, defence and national importance.

He had said the plan is designed to transform Great Nicobar into a major hub of maritime and air connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region, with an international container transhipment terminal, a greenfield international airport, a 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant and a township over 16 sq km.",https://clarionindia.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhatsApp-Image-2025-04-20-at-2.16.10-AM-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-21 06:57:55.232397

The EPA has been through a tough few years recently, with the Trump administration stating that the agency is essentially not needed and even going so far as to suggest closing the agency altogether. Regardless, the public hearings are set to take place on 12 September 2025.

The EPA recently published one direct rule and one proposed rule for the sector

On July 22, the Environmental Protection Agency published a direct final rule (90 FR 34358) and a proposed rule (90 FR 34409) entitled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule.” And the backlash from those new rules, both direct and proposed, has seen several requests for an extension to make comments on the rules.

The original deadline to submit comments was August 21, 2025; however, since then, the EPA has been overwhelmed by several requests to extend that initial deadline, and it appears that they have heard the calls, as they have now stated that an online public hearing will take place to offer people and companies a chance at making their voices heard.

One must commend the EPA for doing its job and fulfilling its purpose. Despite the overwhelming negative relationship with the current administration. The hearing will allow oral statements that are limited to 5 minutes per person, as well as pose initial questions to the statements made by the parties in attendance. Although it will not make any formal statements at the hearing.

The EPA will receive written comments until September 15 on the matter

The EPA has stated that they will accept any and all written comments on the proposed rules right up until the hearing takes place. It provided a 30-day notice of the hearings to the relevant stakeholders, so there is ample time for the parties involved to consider their comments and how to submit them to the agency. Expectations are that the agency will take every comment seriously and submit formal responses once the hearings have concluded.

“The scope of the proposed rule is limited to establishing an additional option for owners or operators of active CCR facilities or inactive CCR facilities with a legacy CCR surface impoundment to comply with the facility evaluation report (FER) Part 1 requirements and to extending compliance deadlines for the remaining CCRMU provisions published in the Federal Register on May 8, 2024.” – Environmental Protection Agency

Whether or not there will be any changes to the direct and proposed rules is yet to be determined. As to how this might affect the downstream sector is anyone’s guess. But that would be speculative at best at the moment. With several major refineries closing their doors, the sector is facing an uncertain future. Once the hearings have been completed, we expect to see formal responses from the EPA as they need time to assess the concerns of all affected by the rule changes.

What might the outcome of the online public hearings be, and how will it affect the rules

The public hearings are designed to offer the relevant stakeholders the chance to voice their concerns as to how the rules might affect their bottom line. While some parts of the world are seeing several companies expanding their downstream projects, this might force the companies in the region to reevaluate their long-term plans. With the United States aiming to revitalize its energy sector, thanks to several executive orders by the President, the impact of the hearings will only be felt after the 15 September date.

TVA and Type One Energy to Build 350 MW Fusion Plant

TVA has issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to Type One Energy regarding the utility’s interest in the potential deployment of Type One Energy’s fusion power plant technology at its former Bull Run Fossil site once it is commercially ready. The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Type One Energy have expanded their cooperative agreement to develop a 350 MWe fusion pilot power plant called “Infinity Two” at TVA’s former Bull Run Fossil Plant near Oak Ridge, TN, targeting deployment by the mid-2030s. The partnership represents the first commercial contracts signed for a utility-scale fusion power project in the US

It will utilize Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology to provide baseload generation capacity. This collaboration positions TVA as the leading U.S. utility in advanced nuclear innovation, addressing growing energy demands from AI and data centers while advancing fusion commercialization timelines.

Infinity Two is a first-generation 350 MWe baseload power plant utilizing Type One Energy’s stellarator fusion technology. According to the press statement by Type One, the stellarator has demonstrated stable, steady-state operation with high efficiency, characteristics which are important for TVA and others in the industry who need to reliably generate on-demand power at competitive prices.

Type One Energy is developing Infinity Two using existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support near-term deployment of the technology.

Final decisions and definitive agreements regarding the funding and construction of Infinity Two, as well as any agreements to purchase the energy output, are subject to TVA Board approval, regulatory review, and alignment with TVA’s least-cost planning processes.

Type One leaders told local news media at the announcement event they hope to start constructing Infinity One, the prototype stellarator, in 2026. The prototype is designed to verify aspects of the design and serve as a training platform.

Type One’s lead scientist told Knox News in March that company won’t need a scientific revelation to move the stellarator design forward. As CEO Chris Mowry put it, “This is not a science project.”

“This is an actual commercial fusion power plant that we are embarking on here.”

The Knoxville News reports that TVA’s role as a partner will include development of machining and fabricating some of the components of the stellarator.

TVA CEO Don Moul said the collaboration between the utility and Type One will be educational.

“We have a lot of learning to do. I think that’s the value of being able to have the stellarator here, having our power services shop provide some of the fabrication capabilities and, quite frankly, having some of our staff here help with the operational input with some of the designers so that we make this practical, but also as forward moving as possible.”

Executives from Type One and TVA made the announcement alongside state and local officials at the former Bull Run Fossil Plant site in Clinton, which TVA retired in 2023.

Proxima Fusion Extends Series A to €200M Total Funding

Proxima Fusion announced an extension to its Series A round with new funding from CDP Venture Capital (Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Group), Italy’s largest venture capital operator, the European Innovation Council Fund (EICF), and Brevan Howard Macro Venture Fund, associated with one of the world’s leading asset managers known for investing in global economic shifts.

The €15 million Series A extension brings the company’s total funding to €200 million ($230M). The EICF equity investment is the latest European public fund to back Proxima, following earlier investments from the DeepTech & Climate Fonds (DTCF) and High–Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF) – both backed by the German Ministry of Economics and Energy – as well as Bayern Kapital, owned by LfA Förderbank Bayern, and the non-profit Max Planck Foundation, which exclusively supports research across the institutes of the Max Planck Society. The new investment from the EICF follows a €2.5 million grant previously awarded to Proxima.

“CDP Venture Capital believes firmly that Europe’s deep tech ecosystem has a key role to play in developing future energy solutions” said Alessandro Scortecci, Chief Investment Officer, Direct Investments at CDP Venture Capital.

Just three months after announcing Europe’s largest-ever fusion round, Proxima has already grown by another 20% to 100 employees and is rapidly converting its new capital into industrial action to anchor its long-term roadmap. With the new capital in the bag, Proxima placed large-scale purchase orders for:

High-temperature superconducting (HTS) tape to secure long-term supply for the mission-critical HTS magnet program;

The manufacturing of structural support plates for its first HTS non-planar magnet, the Stellarator Model Coil (SMC);

Its own in-house cable manufacturing line to accelerate R&D capabilities and produce its first long length SMC cables;

Full size and weight dummy coils and prototype vacuum vessel sections to demonstrate hardware design, manufacturing capability and development of assembly processes for stellarators.

This latest funding will accelerate the company’s engineering progress toward the SMC, which will de-risk major elements of HTS magnet technology for stellarators. Proxima’s ambitious target: bring SMC to life in 2027. In addition, the team is simultaneously completing the design of its net energy gain demo stellarator, Alpha, while evaluating potential building sites across Europe.

About Proxima Fusion

Proxima Fusion spun out of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) in 2023 to build the first generation of fusion power plants using QI-HTS stellarators. Proxima has since assembled a team of scientists and engineers from leading companies and institutions including the IPP, MIT, Harvard, SpaceX, Tesla, and McLaren. The firm is taking a simulation-driven approach to engineering that leverages advanced computing and high-temperature superconductors.

About Kyoto Fusioneering

Kyoto Fusioneering launched the FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) project in November 2024, taking on the role of project leader. FAST represents a private-sector-driven, industry–academia collaboration with the ambitious aim of proving fusion electricity generation within the 2030s in Japan. The initiative brings together leading researchers and companies, both in Japan and worldwide, to tackle the critical engineering challenges of fusion and to accelerate the transition from experimental reactors to practical, commercial-scale energy systems.

FAST’s mission is to prove that a complete fusion power generation system is possible by integrating plasma generation and control through D-T*3 fusion reactions, energy conversion, and fuel systems.

UNITY-1: At the core of this effort is the “UNITY-1” project, which aims to demonstrate how a fusion heat cycle system harnesses and utilizes energy produced by fusion reactions. UNITY-1 has now reached the final stage of validating its power generation technology through a liquid metal loop. The project is on track to achieve a world first: successfully demonstrating power generation technology using a simulated fusion plant*2.

UNITY-2: In addition, the fusion fuel cycle system, which continuously supplies fuel, is undergoing performance testing of individual devices and systems at the company’s new R&D facility, established adjacent to its headquarters in January this year. In 2026, Fusion Fuel Cycles Inc., a joint venture between Kyoto Fusioneering and Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, will begin an integrated demonstration of a fuel cycle system in Canada, under the project “UNITY-2.”

Gyrotron Systems: Kyoto Fusioneering’s plasma heating system—the gyrotron system—has recently been adopted by Tokamak Energy Ltd. in the UK*4, further expanding its footprint in global fusion initiatives.

Oxford Spin-out First Light Fusion Seeks Backing for Inertial Fusion Demonstrator

First Light Fusion believes it can drive down the costs of nuclear fusion but it needs £150m for a demonstration facility.

First Light Fusion (FLF) has outlined plans for an inertial fusion energy test facility, a £150 million project pitched as a faster, cheaper route to commercial fusion power. The University of Oxford spin-out outlined the company’s concept for high-gain fusion, known as fusion via low-power assembly and rapid excitation, or FLARE.

Gain refers to a process where more energy is converted from the fusion reaction than energy delivered to the fuel, and has long been a barrier to commercial fusion. FLF said its modelling shows the FLARE concept could produce an energy gain of up to 1,000, far higher than the current experimental levels achieved.

Founded in 2011, FLF has attracted more than £78 million in backing from a consortium including IP Group, Oxford Science Enterprises, Salica and Host Plus.

And as the UK prepares to invest £2.5bn into a different kind of fusion reactor, FLF urged the government “not to put all its eggs in one basket”.

Professor Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College London, said the FLARE concept combines well-established and extensively studied concepts.

“What makes First Light’s approach different is the way in which these concepts have been combined. In addition, the adaptation of First Light’s proven amplifier technology to cylindrical implosions means that the required fusion conditions can be realised using low voltage pulsed power, significantly reducing the cost of both the driver and the fusion targets.”

FLF said its approach differs from the conventional approach to inertial fusion energy (IFE), which is to compress and heat fuel at the same time to achieve ignition. By contrast, FLF’s approach splits this process into two parts. First, it compresses the fuel in a controlled manner and then uses a separate process to ignite it. This generates a “massive surplus of energy”, FLF said, in a process known as a ‘fast fusion’.

The company said this method has “long been researched”, but that it is “now made practical for the first time” using its technology. FLF claims its approach would underpin the design for future commercial reactors, allowing partners to build the systems using FLF technology as the fuel.

FLF said an experimental gain facility using its technology would cost between $100-$200 million, or just 5% of the $5.3 billion (£3.9bn) NIF in California.

The company said it expects to achieve gains above today’s records by the early 2030s, with the demonstrator facility not required for “several years”.

While the company is not seeking funding from the UK government at this stage, FLF said “any government support would be welcomed”.

With the UK government committing £2.5bn towards the STEP fusion project, which uses a process known as magnetic confinement fusion, FLF said the country should “not put all its eggs in one basket” when it comes to fusion energy.

General Atomics to Build a National Data Ecosystem Aimed at Accelerating Commercial Fusion Power

The multi-institutional project secures four-year DOE funding to unify fusion data and workflows into an accessible nationwide resource

Scientists at General Atomics (GA) announced this month that they will be leading a multi-institutional initiative to create a unified data system for fusion energy research in the United States—called the Fusion Energy Data Ecosystem and Repository (FEDER).

The project will be funded through the U.S. Department of Energy’s Fusion Innovative Research Engine (FIRE) Collaborative, a multimillion-dollar initiative designed to fast-track fusion development, support American innovation and bolster U.S. leadership in the energy sector.

Researchers plan to use FEDER to create a shared, standardized platform that links experimental results, simulation outputs and workflows from national laboratories, universities and private companies, turning today’s disconnected datasets and workflows into a unified community resource that speeds up discovery and brings commercial fusion power closer to reality.

“Fusion research advances fastest when data flows freely and securely rather than remain trapped in isolated silos, proprietary formats, and disconnected analysis tools,” said Dr. Raffi Nazikian, director of Fusion Data Science at General Atomics.

“FEDER will break down barriers between institutions and disciplines, integrating datasets, computational models and research workflows. We will be able to capture new data in FEDER’s living commons and make them available for immediate reuse in the next experiment or simulation.”

GA is joined in the FEDER initiative by a coalition of leading institutions: the San Diego Supercomputer Center at UC San Diego; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Idaho National Laboratory; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Plasma Science and Fusion Center; Hewlett Packard Enterprise; UCLA; and West Virginia University.

ogether, their experts in plasma physics, fusion engineering, materials science and high-performance computing will collaborate with other FIRE Collaboratives and research teams nationwide to build the community-driven platform.

“FEDER is an important step toward turning today’s scattered fusion datasets into a unified resource for realizing the full potential of fusion energy,” said Tom Gibbs, developer relations lead for NVIDIA.

“By making siloed data readily accessible and linking it with resources such as National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource and the DOE Integrated Research Infrastructure, the research community can develop the advanced AI models needed for full-scale digital twins that will support the emerging commercial ecosystem.”

In addition to improving reproducibility, transparency and interdisciplinary collaboration, FEDER will integrate cutting-edge platforms—including the Fusion Data Platform, Open Science Data Federation and the National Data Platform—into a powerful, user-friendly service.

“We already have the building blocks. Now it’s time to connect them,” said Dr. Ilkay Altintas, chief data science officer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

“Within the first year, FEDER will weave these tools together and offer an accessible, scalable service that will grow into a lasting national resource.”

Fact-checkers at Carbon Brief debunked some of the most common myths about solar that can negatively influence public perception and hinder the adoption of renewable energy.

One of the most prominent claims about solar is that it doesn't produce reliable energy since it only generates power when the sun shines, and therefore, reduces grid stability and safety.

While that might be a valid concern if solar were the only form of energy produced, that isn't the case, as solar complements other clean sources of electricity such as wind, nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower.

Moreover, with more battery storage systems being installed both commercially and residentially, they provide backup power during outages and reduce energy costs by storing cheap power for later use at night or during peak hours.

The International Energy Agency estimated that global electricity generated by solar will quadruple by 2030 and surpass coal, gas, nuclear, wind, and hydro to become the world's leading source of energy by 2033, revealing that solar is indeed capable of powering societies on a large scale.

Another popular critique of solar and wind energy is that they're expensive, but according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, more than 90% of renewable energy projects are now cheaper than comparable dirty fuel alternatives.

According to EnergySage, solar is still a great investment for homeowners, even though tax credits are expiring at the end of the year. Prices per watt are at all-time lows, and since systems last at least 30 years, that translates to decades of reduced electric bills and more energy independence.

Using EnergySage's free tools, you can access solar installation estimates and compare quotes, making it a convenient way to go solar while finding a system to suit your budget.

The company's free services, which include a mapping tool that allows users to view the average cost of a system and available tax incentives in their state, can help you secure the best price for rooftop solar panels and even save an average of $10,000 on installations.

By pairing solar energy with other energy-efficient appliances, such as heat pumps, you can further reduce your energy bills. EnergySage also offers a free heat pump quotes comparison tool, allowing you to find the right installer and model for your needs and making it easy to take care of multiple home improvement projects in one place.

Make sure to act fast to take advantage of the 30% federal tax credit for home solar and heat pump installations; they will expire by the end of 2025.

As Carbon Brief explained, misinformation about solar power can be incredibly harmful, and some of ""these narratives are having real-world consequences."" Some online anti-wind and solar groups even encourage local opposition to clean energy projects in rural communities across the U.S.

Armed with the right information, it's much easier for citizens to make informed decisions about home solar and for policymakers to pass laws that will continue promoting safe, affordable energy for all.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-powerimage-recCs8TXbww9RNaNI.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:00:23.059907

Ramesh questioned the minister’s inability to answer basic queries repeatedly raised by the Congress, highlighting potential violations of the National Forest Policy, 1988, which calls for the protection of tropical rainforests, especially in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He also criticised the project’s compensatory afforestation plan, noting that planting trees in Haryana cannot offset the destruction of Great Nicobar’s unique old-growth forests.

The Congress leader further asked why the National Commission on Scheduled Tribes and the Tribal Council of Great Nicobar were not consulted, why the Shompen Policy — which safeguards the tribal community — was being ignored, and why the Social Impact Assessment failed to account for the Shompen and Nicobarese populations.

""The Union Minister of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change Shri Bhupender Yadav has accused the Indian National Congress of doing what he calls 'negative politics' on the Great Nicobar mega infrastructure project. Drawing the nation's attention to an imminent ecological and humanitarian disaster is NOT 'negative politics'. It is an expression of grave concern,"" Ramesh said on X.

Ramesh raised concerns over the project’s impact on endangered species such as leatherback turtles, megapodes, saltwater crocodiles, and the island’s coral ecosystems. He also questioned the sustainability of the project in a high-seismic zone with a history of severe tsunami subsidence. He called for transparency, asking why critical documents, including the ground-truthing exercise reports for the proposed transshipment port, were not publicly available.

Yadav had accused Congress of indulging in “negative politics”, asserting that only 1.78 per cent of Great Nicobar’s forest area would be used for the Rs 72,000 crore project, which he described as essential for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region. He defended the plan as a transformative initiative, featuring an international container transshipment terminal, greenfield airport, 450 MVA gas- and solar-based power plant, and a township spanning 16 sq km.

Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi had earlier described the project as a “planned misadventure”, warning it threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys a unique ecosystem, and risks natural disasters. She highlighted that ancestral villages of the Nicobarese, evacuated after the 2004 tsunami, would face permanent displacement, while the Shompen reserve would be denotified and subjected to large-scale human influx.

Ramesh concluded by urging the government to heed environmental and tribal safeguards, emphasising that ecological integrity and community rights cannot be sidelined in the pursuit of infrastructure and strategic goals.

Editorial | ​Nicobar triangle: on the ₹72,000-crore project on Great Nicobar Island

Mr. Yadav last Thursday (September 18, 2025) hit out at the Congress for opposing the Great Nicobar infrastructure project, accusing it of spreading confusion and indulging in ""negative politics.""

Speaking at an event organised by The Public Affairs Forum of India in New Delhi, Mr. Yadav asserted that the mega project is crucial for national security and strategic connectivity in the Indian Ocean Region. Mr. Yadav said only 1.78% of Great Nicobar's forest area will be used for the project.

His remarks came days after Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson Sonia Gandhi, in an article in The Hindu, termed the ₹72,000 crore project a ""planned misadventure"" that threatens the survival of the Shompen and Nicobarese tribes, destroys one of the world's most unique ecosystems and is highly susceptible to natural disasters.

Confusion over clearances for Great Nicobar project persists

Ms. Gandhi alleged the project was being pushed through by ""making a mockery of all legal and deliberative processes.""

""The ancestral villages of the Nicobarese tribals fall in the project's proposed land area. The Nicobarese were forced to evacuate their villages during the 2004 tsunami. This project will now permanently displace this community, ending its dream of returning to its ancestral villages,"" Ms. Gandhi had said.

The decision to shut down coal mines has emerged as a critical issue shaping the future of energy, economy, and environment globally. As we approach 2025, coal mine closures mark a pivotal reflection of shifting energy paradigms. However, these closures bring not only environmental benefits but also complex economic and social challenges—issues that are particularly significant in regions heavily dependent on mining for their livelihoods and local development.

This comprehensive article explores the multifaceted impacts of coal mine closures in 2025, focusing on economic and social transitions, environmental restoration and reclamation, government and policy strategies, and the vital role of technology-enabled transition—offering actionable, future-oriented insights for communities, regions, and stakeholders.

“Over 200 coal mines worldwide are scheduled for closure by 2025, affecting millions in surrounding communities.”

Why Coal Mine Closure in 2025? Shifting Paradigms Explained

As global urgency to address climate change intensifies, coal—the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel—faces declining demand and increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In 2025, the movement to close coal mines is propelled by several key factors:

Stringent regulations on emissions and air quality driving policy-led transitions.

Rapid advancement and cost-competitiveness of renewable energy systems.

An urgent need for environmental restoration of degraded lands and ecosystems.

Financial firms and national governments divesting from carbon-heavy industries.

Changing expectations of investors and communities towards sustainable development.

Together, these shifting paradigms create both immense challenges and transformative opportunities. Understanding the full scope requires examining the economic, environmental, and social implications of coal mine closure.

Economic Impact of Coal Mine Closure on Communities

Coal mines have historically served as economic pillars in many regions, providing direct employment to tens of thousands of workers—while supporting ancillary industries such as transport, equipment manufacturing, and local businesses. The loss of this economic engine through mine closures can be devastating:

Increased unemployment: Tens of thousands face job loss, with ripple effects across local economies.

Business decline: Ancillary businesses (repair shops, equipment suppliers, restaurants) suffer reduced demand.

Regional GDP impacts: Drops in income, spending, and investment.

Uncertainty and poverty: Communities may witness population decline and deeper poverty levels.

In 2025, these challenges grow more acute, especially in regions and communities heavily dependent on coal mining. Governments and industry stakeholders are thus increasingly focusing on “just transition” frameworks. Such frameworks are aimed at cushioning the social impact of coal mine closure through re-skilling programs, economic diversification, and comprehensive social welfare measures.

Community Livelihoods: From Mining Pillars to Diversification

The future of community livelihoods in a post-coal world depends on the success of diversified transitions. Coal mine closure disrupts not only workers but entire local economies. In response, progressive policy and community strategies are:

Investing in alternative industries: Green energy manufacturing, sustainable agriculture, and eco-friendly tourism offer viable opportunities for new employment.

Supporting re-skilling programs: Training for workers to adapt to new, in-demand sectors.

Developing local entrepreneurship: Initiatives to support small businesses and innovation.

Leveraging satellite solutions for transition monitoring.

For instance, advanced fleet management can help local logistics businesses optimize remaining resources and adapt to changing infrastructure usage after mine closure.

However, the success of such transitions varies widely. Areas lacking infrastructure or investment can struggle to sustain economic recovery and may experience population decline and poverty. Therefore, coordinated interventions at local, national, and international levels remain crucial, ensuring that the costs of transition do not deepen disparities.

The Challenge of Just Transition Frameworks After Coal Mine Closure

“Just transition” refers to policies that prioritize social welfare, equity, and economic opportunity as societies move from coal-based industries toward sustainable alternatives. In 2025, examples of just transition challenges include:

Uneven readiness: Some communities lack access to resources or support, exacerbating disparities.

Intergenerational impacts: Family and cultural ties to coal mining increase the psychological impacts of closure.

Financing gaps: Without adequate investment in education, infrastructure, and new industries, transitions stall.

Long-term planning: Ensuring that short-term welfare programs evolve into sustainable, future-proof solutions.

The ability to create new employment and develop alternative industries hinges not simply on funding, but on proactive policy coordination, community engagement, and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of interventions.

Environmental Restoration & Land Reclamation Following Coal Mine Closure

Coal mining is long associated with widespread environmental degradation: deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution, and habitat destruction. The closure of mines presents a unique opportunity for environmental restoration and land reclamation. In 2025, this opportunity is more urgent—and technologically advanced—than ever.

Key Environmental Implications & Opportunities

Restoring degraded land: Stabilizing and enriching soil using native plant cover and bioengineering.

Improving water quality: Treating mine tailings and contaminated runoff to protect local waterways.

Mitigating carbon emissions: Through carbon sequestration in reclaimed land and new forestry projects.

Rebuilding biodiversity: Reforestation and habitat recreation support wildlife and ecosystem recovery.

Many decommissioned mine sites are now transformed into renewable energy projects, including large-scale solar farms and wind energy installations—turning the liability of former mines into productive assets that directly contribute to regional energy needs.

“Coal mine closures in 2025 could reduce regional CO2 emissions by up to 350 million tons annually.”

Best Practices in Mine Land Reclamation for 2025

Active community involvement: Local input ensures culturally relevant land use and long-term stewardship.

Real-time monitoring: Using satellite-based technologies—like those provided by Farmonaut’s remote sensing platform—to track land healing progress, soil health, and water quality.

Adaptive management: Reclamation plans are iteratively improved based on on-the-ground and satellite data, maximizing ecosystem restoration.

Transparency: Traceability and reporting (powered by modern blockchain technology—see Farmonaut Product Traceability) assure stakeholders of environmental compliance and progress

With these practices, environmental restoration after coal mine closure becomes a vehicle for climate action, sustainable land use, and regional economic regeneration.

Renewable Energy & Repurposing Decommissioned Sites After Coal Mine Closure

With coal mine closure, there is an unprecedented chance to repurpose land and existing infrastructure toward sustainable energy systems and new industries:

Solar and wind energy “upcycling”: Many decommissioned open-cast mines are well suited for large-scale solar or wind power installations.

Eco-industrial development:

Repurposing transport corridors, equipment facilities, and mine housing for green manufacturing, advanced material recycling, or logistics hubs.

Urban renewal and tourism: Converted mines in some regions foster recreational parks, biodiversity conservation areas, and eco-tourism, revitalizing regional socio-economic life.

Continuous environmental monitoring: Tools like Farmonaut’s carbon footprinting solutions allow authorities and companies to measure and optimize project sustainability over time—key for compliance and climate impact verification.

Repurposed infrastructure thus not only restores landscapes after closure, but also helps ensure regions remain future-ready and economically viable.

Policy, Security & Strategy in Coal Mine Closures

The movement toward coal mine closure is inherently political and strategic. Governments and policy-makers face the formidable task of balancing energy security, national interests, social welfare, and climate imperatives. Some of the central issues and challenges include:

Strategic decommissioning: Ensuring mines located near critical infrastructure or defense sites are safely closed without jeopardizing national security.

Coordinated infrastructure transition: Repurposing or safely dismantling transport, equipment handling, and processing infrastructure to minimize risk and maximize future utility.

Dynamic policy frameworks: Adapting to rapid technological, market, and environmental shifts with flexible policies that support effective transitions.

International cooperation: Harmonizing closure approaches across countries and supporting transnational climate targets.

Good opportunities attract talent, which helps businesses expand and create yet more opportunities.","A large, growing, and well-qualified workforce is essential to ongoing economic expansion. Texas has an advantage over many areas in that our population is younger and, hence, has more people in childbearing age ranges. Additionally, the state has long been attracting workers from other parts of the country (and, indeed, the world). A recent report by Lightcast, a global labor market intelligence firm, illustrates just how well Texas is doing.

Lightcast’s Talent Attraction Scorecard ranks states on seven components. The analysis looks at overall job growth over the past five years at an occupational level, then becomes more specific by delving into the numbers in high-earnings categories and blue-collar categories. Growth in the college-educated population and prime-age (25-54) population is considered, as well as people arriving with incomes above $25,000 per year. How an area is performing as a result of competitive advantages rather than overall national trends is also part of the ranking.

Texas had three of the top 10 large (250,000+ residents) metropolitan areas. Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington topped the list by a very large margin. Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos was second, and Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands was sixth. All other metro areas on the list were in Florida (which led Texas slightly on an overall statewide basis). At the other end of the spectrum were the greater Los Angeles (ranked last at 196), New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Boston areas.

A variety of factors influence in-migration. One is a dynamic economy. Texas has been a growth leader for a number of years, generating jobs across a broad spectrum of industries. These opportunities attract skilled workers, and the state’s sustained economic momentum is clearly a factor. Another advantage is the cost of living. It’s no coincidence, for example, that the states where people are attracted have no state income tax. In some of the areas losing talent in greatest numbers, there are not only state income taxes, but also substantial local taxes and particularly hefty levies on high-income individuals. When combined with higher costs for housing and other necessities, the financially rational decision can quickly shift toward Texas, Florida, and other less expensive places to live.

Momentum builds momentum. Good opportunities attract talent, which helps businesses expand and create yet more opportunities. Texas has been dominating major locations and expansions for well over a decade. The state is also attracting workers needed for continued growth. There are daunting challenges going forward, including providing adequate educational opportunities, electric power, water, and other infrastructure to facilitate further expansion, and overcoming perceptions discouraging some knowledge workers from coming to or remaining in the state. For now, however, Texas is well positioned to remain one of the most dynamic economies in the nation.

Louise CullenAgriculture and environment correspondent, BBC News NI

People living near renewable energy projects may get a discount on their electricity bills in future, under a proposal in a new Stormont scheme.

Known as the Renewable Energy Price Guarantee (REPG) scheme, it could also lead to lower electricity bills for all.

The REPG is designed to encourage investment in wind, solar and energy storage projects to help meet the goal of generating 80% of our energy from renewable sources by 2030.

Renewable sector leaders welcomed the announcement but added that ""ambition must now be matched by delivery"".

'Deliver lower costs'

Economy Minister Caoimhe Archibald said the scheme would ""boost renewable generation and deliver lower electricity costs to households than they are paying today"".

She added that it would ensure local communities benefit from the transition to net zero.

The final scheme design, published by the Department for the Economy, acknowledges that the success of the 2030 target ""will depend on the availability of a sufficient pipeline of renewable projects and the development of electricity infrastructure to support additional generation"".

Capacity limits in the electricity grid have led to wind power having to be switched off – known as ""dispatching down"" – to protect infrastructure.

Scheme will 'power economic growth'

The chair of RenewableNI said the announcement would create jobs and attract investment, creating ""stability"" for consumers.

""It is one of, if not the, most directly beneficial actions the executive has taken to power economic growth here, particularly in rural areas,"" said Tamasin Fraser.

""We've seen over the last numbers of years the impact that the war in Russia/Ukraine has had on bills by relying on imported fossil fuels.

""We can harness our own clean, green, indigenous resources and that will help hedge against that volatility.""

She added that reaching the 80% renewable generation target would deliver ""approximately £110 million net benefit annually to the consumer"".

Under the Programme for Government (2024-27), the Northern Ireland Executive has committed to supporting industry to increase renewable generation by another 40%.

The first auction to award generation contracts under the scheme will be held in early 2027.

It will aim to secure from 750 gigawatt hours per year to 1,250Gwh/year of power.

The price for that power will be agreed at the auction.

To fund the scheme, a fixed levy will be added to electricity bills under a new two-way payments' system.

When prices drop below the agreed contract level, renewable energy generators will receive a payment from the electricity companies.

Conversely, when prices rise, excess payments will be collected from the generators, returned to the electricity companies and then passed on to consumers.

Over time, as renewable generation increases and fossil fuel dependence declines, this will result in lower and more stable electricity prices.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3ace/live/75c536d0-9595-11f0-b72b-7959ebab31f0.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 02:58:04.700756

Game-Changing Benefits for Stellantis Brands

The integrated battery system represents a significant advancement in EV technology that could benefit multiple Stellantis brands across North America. Jeep's current 4xe lineup, including the Grand Cherokee 4xe with its 26-mile electric range and Wrangler 4xe offering 21 miles of electric-only driving, could see meaningful improvements with IBIS technology implementation.

A 10% efficiency boost would translate to approximately 2.6 additional miles of electric range for the Grand Cherokee 4xe and over 2 miles for the Wrangler 4xe. While these gains might seem modest, they represent meaningful improvements where every mile of electric range reduces reliance on gasoline. The weight reduction of 88 pounds also improves overall efficiency. Dodge's Charger EVs could also benefit from up to 30 miles of additional range and space savings, while Ram's recently shelved electric pickup truck could have leveraged the faster charging capabilities and reduced complexity.

Too Little, Too Late?

Traditional EVs use separate onboard chargers that convert grid AC power to DC for battery storage, while onboard inverters convert battery DC power to AC for electric motors. By consolidating these functions into the battery pack itself, Stellantis creates opportunities for simplified vehicle assembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and improved reliability. The technology also improves Stellantis' position against Tesla and Ford in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The IBIS technology could prove valuable as Stellantis accelerates its electrification timeline across brands like Dodge, which plans to transition its performance lineup to electric power. The system's ability to provide faster charging and higher efficiency while maintaining smaller packaging requirements addresses two critical consumer concerns about EV adoption.

Find out the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted.” Paul G. Pinsky is the director of the Maryland Energy Administration, to which he was appointed by Gov.","“Turn the lights off” is a common refrain in homes across America. But keeping the lights on is what PJM Interconnection, the regional transmission organization, attempts to do. PJM (standing for Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) is the Mid-Atlantic states’ regional transmission organization. It acts like a traffic cop to facilitate the transfer of electricity across state borders.

Why should this organization and its actions matter? Because the prices of energy are rapidly rising for most of the 65 million people it serves. And, unfortunately, PJM’s role is growing — in the wrong direction. The organization is stifling the development of clean energy, setting the rules for the capacity market, forcing energy prices up and continuing to marginalize the voice of the very states it serves.

PJM serves 13 adjoining states and Washington, D.C., covering over 65 million people. It directs electrons from power plants to end users, like us, who use the electricity necessary for everyday life. Currently, the key stakeholders in the organization are the entrenched power industry insiders, including generators, transmission developers and utilities — and herein lies the rub. Even though PJM was created to organize energy transfers among states, these very same states feel they have little voice in the structure and policy-setting of the operation.

Case in point: PJM has closed the queue to bring new, additional energy onto the grid for the last two and a half years. During this period of limited supply, not surprisingly, energy costs have risen. Not so ironically, much of the energy awaiting approval is solar and battery storage. While fossil fuels make up most of the current PJM mix, the organization declares itself “energy-source neutral.” Its policy? Block new, clean energy and keep the current fossil fuels, major contributors to climate change, running at full blast.

Recently, the governors of nine states, including my own Maryland Governor Wes Moore, wrote to PJM with a complaint: The states being served have little or no voice in it. This leaves the interests of ratepayers — the residents they serve — out in the proverbial cold.

When two board seats recently opened, the states’ governors formally asked for representatives who might be sympathetic to states’ ratepayers, the vast number of whom are working families.

The governors recommended two candidates. One was the outgoing chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), who previously served as chair of Virginia’s Public Service Commission. The second was another former FERC commissioner. Both had been originally nominated for their positions by a U.S. president and subsequently received approval by the U.S. Senate.

The PJM nominating committee rejected both of these outstanding candidates, ignoring the governors’ plea for a voice and, for all intents and purposes, told the governors to go pound sand.

Unfortunately, virtually all of the members of the PJM Members Committee are energy insiders who get to decide who leads them and what their policy should be. So, of the eight members of the committee directed to fill the vacancies, none represented ratepayers. What a surprise!

Sadly, neither of the proposed candidates suggested by the governors to give a voice to consumers appears to have been seriously considered.

As a follow-up, on Aug. 21, 2025, PJM explained that if the governors wanted to pursue any changes to the nominating process, it would require a change in PJM’s Operating Agreement.

And how would states do that? You guessed it: It requires the support of the very same Members Committee that shaped the nominations committee. It appears the process was built to make states chase their tails. Until states have a real voice at PJM, the threat of ever-rising energy prices and distribution costs will continue ravaging families across the 13 states and D.C.

Mark Christie, the outgoing chair of FERC, said it best at a recent national conference. He ended his speech with this exhortation: “The two most important questions in utility regulation are: ‘Who pays?’ and ‘Who profits?’”

Until states have a significant voice at the PJM table, ratepayers will be at the mercy of the companies generating, supplying and distributing this important resource.

While Frederick Douglass was not referring to energy when he discussed power, his posit stands just as appropriate today: “Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it never will. Find out the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted.”

Saturday morning, the Sierra Club, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, local lawmakers, community members and more came together to voice their opposition to the EPA's effort to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. They say it's an issue that will have an impact from the mountains to Commerce City and beyond.

""We're facing lower snowpack in the Mountain West, where, every year, we're seeing a few less days of skiing,"" said Pitkin County Commissioner Jeffrey Woodruff.

""It's our community that has dealt with issues of cancer because they've been forced to drink the water and lead pipes and so many other pollutants,"" said Commerce City Council Member Renee Chacon.

""I am the wife of a firefighter, and since I've been here and with my husband, the number of fires has increased exponentially. And it's not just, 'Oh, it's on a mountain. Oh, it's out and some bushland.' It's in our neighborhoods. It's in our communities. We see the smoke every day. I have a four-year-old who can't go outside and play on certain days because of the wildfire smoke,"" said Danielle Abrams with the Sierra Club.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requires reporting of greenhouse gas data from large greenhouse gas emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers and CO2 injection sites. The EPA says the GHGRP costs companies money they could use to improve environmental controls at their facilities.

In a press release issued by the EPA back on September 12, they said, ""Unlike mandatory information collections under the Clean Air Act, the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is not directly related to a potential regulation. It has no material impact on improving human health and the environment.""

The EPA under the Trump administration also says that if it gets rid of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, it could save American businesses up to $2.4 billion in regulatory costs.

Environmentalists who oppose the measures say that corporate profits should not be made on the backs of America's citizens.

Chacon says if regulations like the GHGRP are repealed, it's people like those in her community who will pay the price because they will see the negative health effects first, like they are now.

""They're paying even higher health costs when it comes to inhalers or even missing school,"" said Chacon.

Abrams is urging all of Colorado to reach out to the EPA through public comment and tell them what they think.

""Standing up and telling your story, that's what we can all do,"" said Abrams.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/21/d7eeaf95-8bcb-4fbe-a71f-1a410dfa1c1c/thumbnail/1200x630/121113ec77d935ae7608b9f7778a79ef/colorado-environmentalists-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program.jpg,N,,2025-09-21 04:00:18.654396

At the heart of this transformation lies a critical question: How can renewable infrastructure balance decarbonization goals with the reliability required to power a modern economy?

Energy's performance in 2025 offers a compelling case study. The company's nuclear fleet achieved a staggering 98.8% capacity factor during the summer of 2025—despite extreme heatwaves and record humidity—demonstrating that nuclear energy remains a cornerstone of grid stability in an era of climate volatilityConstellation's Clean Energy Centers Deliver Near-Perfect Summer Reliability[ 1 ]. This reliability, paired with strategic investments and policy tailwinds, positions Constellation as a bellwether for the future of renewable infrastructure.

Nuclear as the Backbone of Decarbonization

Constellation's summer 2025 results underscore nuclear power's unique value proposition. While solar and wind energy face inherent intermittency, nuclear plants operate at near-constant output, providing baseload power that complements variable renewables. Constellation's 21 reactors generated enough electricity to power 16 million homes during the summer, a feat achieved through $7 billion in decade-long investments to modernize equipment and extend reactor lifespansConstellation's Clean Energy Centers Deliver Near-Perfect Summer Reliability[ 1 ]. This operational excellence is not accidental. The company's focus on plant uprates—such as the 160 MW increase planned for Byron and Braidwood by 2029—and the restart of retired facilities like the Crane Clean Energy Center in Pennsylvania (adding 835 MW) highlight a disciplined approach to scaling capacity without the long lead times of greenfield projectsConstellation Energy Corporation (CEG) Growth and Financial …[ 2 ].

The financial rationale for these investments is robust.

A High-Conviction Play in a Shifting Energy Landscape

For long-term capital allocators, Constellation represents a rare combination of proven operational excellence, strategic foresight, and policy alignment. Its recent acquisition of Calpine—a $2.6 billion deal expected to close by year-end—adds nearly 60 GW of low-emission capacity, including geothermal and gas-fired assets, to diversify its portfolio while maintaining a clean energy focusEarnings call transcript: Constellation Energy’s Q2 2025 …[ 3 ]. This acquisition, coupled with its nuclear-centric strategy, strengthens Constellation's role as a “backbone” for the grid during the transition away from coal.

Critically, Constellation's success hinges on its ability to navigate regulatory and market risks. However, its 98.8% capacity factor in 2025—a record even by its own standards—demonstrates operational resilience that few peers can match.

For investors, this underscores a simple truth: in a world grappling with climate extremes and energy insecurity, reliability is no longer a differentiator—it is a necessity.

Conclusion

Constellation Energy's 2025 performance is more than a corporate milestone—it is a microcosm of the energy transition's next phase. By marrying nuclear reliability with strategic investments, policy advocacy, and partnerships with energy-hungry industries, the company is redefining what clean infrastructure can achieve.

In a conversation with WIBC’s Tony Katz, Braun responded to growing concerns about the cost and environmental impact of large-scale data centers, including a proposed Google facility on the east side of Indianapolis.

“There’s a ton of capital investment and a construction multiplier effect,” Braun said. “But those jobs dissipate once it’s done. After that, it uses a ton of electricity and a decent amount of water to boot.”

He pointed out that in rural counties, where assessed value is often limited, data centers can help expand the tax base. Still, Braun said Indiana isn’t handing out automatic approvals.

“I’m going to measure it based upon what I told you. It’s not a categorical yes or no,” he said. “We want to be open for business, anyone that wants to come here and invest, but if it’s going to have impact, and it’s not along with high-paying jobs, you’ve got to abate many of these out of the gate to where they don’t even get the benefit of local property tax revenue.”

Braun highlighted a new law that requires data centers to pay for 80 percent of the cost of new electricity generation if they haven’t already started construction. He said that’s meant to protect ratepayers from covering the cost of infrastructure needed by energy-hungry facilities.

“That’s where we start,” Braun said. “Then it’s going to be up to the data centers and the utility companies to make the case that it’s going to be neutral in terms of impacting the cost of electricity for everyone else.”

He also weighed in on public frustration over rising utility bills. AES Indiana recently asked for a rate hike, but the state’s consumer counselor pushed back with a recommendation to lower rates instead.

“That rate hike has been too commonplace without taking the other side of the equation into consideration,” Braun said. “It’s mostly to show that you’re not a juggernaut that gets everything you want without discussion.”

Indiana currently generates around 20 gigawatts of electricity, which Braun said is barely enough to keep up with demand. Some data centers, he noted, can consume up to one gigawatt each.

“Demand for electricity was flat as a pancake, and now one of these centers can use up to a gig,” he said. “We’ve got to be careful, especially when it takes four to five years to bring any new generation online.”

Braun also expressed doubts about wind and solar, calling them unreliable and saying grid operators don’t count them as baseload power. Instead, he’s pushing for small modular nuclear reactors and wants to delay shutting down existing fossil fuel plants.

“They check off so many things that make sense in terms of baseload,” Braun said. “That’s going to be there whether the sun’s shining or not, or the wind’s blowing.”

While major cities across the United States embrace “cool roof” standards to combat rising urban temperatures, the Pacific Northwest has yet to implement any policies that could reduce local temperatures, and one woman is trying to change that.

Studies show lighter-colored roofing materials reflect more sunlight compared to dark surfaces, which absorb more heat and contribute to what scientists call an urban heat island.

Katie Kaku is the senior technical director for Global Heat Reductions and is trying to bring awareness to this process and encourage meaningful change in the Pacific Northwest.

“We all know, we’ve all experienced black asphalt on hot summer days and we know it’s hot to the touch. And this is because it’s absorbing the incoming sunlight and rereleasing it as heat,” said Kaku.

Cities can experience as much as 15 degrees hotter than surrounding rural areas due to their built environments, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect.

Katie uses Seattle neighborhoods as an example.

“You can see the temperature differences from neighborhood to neighborhood. A city with lots of trees by the water, such as Ballard or Magnolia, you find that on a hot summer day, if that temperature hits 80 degrees, an area such as Renton or Auburn or Kent within the industrial corridor that has fewer trees and much more black surfaces, those regions can be 11 degrees warmer,” she said.

A “cool roof” can lower the temperature both inside and outside a home, reducing cooling bills for entire communities and cities.

Research from the Environmental Protection Agency shows if “cool roof” standards are implemented, the temperature inside a home can be lowered anywhere from about 2 to 6 degrees.

While many major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, have cool roof standards in place for flat (typically industrial) roofs, Atlanta passed a bold city-wide ordinance in June of 2025 requiring all roofs, both industrial and residential, to comply with these standards.

The city-wide temperature in Atlanta is expected to be lower by 2.4 to 6.3 degrees because of these changes.

As summers get hotter in the Pacific Northwest, Katie would like to see similar standards or guidance from officials.

""To the best of my knowledge, neither Washington nor Oregon have any cool roof ordinances or guidelines in their building code,” she said.

The Cool Roof Rating Council is a nonprofit that aims to bring information related to cool surfaces to critical discussions, and when asked about any cool roof standards in the PNW, a spokesperson shared that:

“The Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard (ESDS), which is the building performance standard that governs affordable housing projects funded through the Washington State Housing Trust Fund program, includes cool roof provisions as part of its heat island reduction credit. This is currently the only standard in the PNW that includes cool roof provisions, though cool roofs are included for heat island mitigation in nation-wide and global voluntary green building programs such as LEED and Green Globes.”

Katie believes the only con to a lighter colored roof would be the aesthetic.

We asked roofing expert Mike Tappert, who owns Upper West Exteriors.

“Black is the most popular I think due to the aesthetic,” said Tappert, adding that if someone wanted to choose a lighter colored roof, “They’re generally all within a couple dollars of each other.”

He said that simply choosing a lighter colored shingle in the northwest would help lower the temperature of your home and community, but an even more powerful “cool roof” shingle has been developed and is sold in warmer climates, which can double those temperature impacts.

“It’s a logical conclusion to come to that if you’re wearing a black t-shirt and you feel warmer versus wearing a nice light white t-shirt in the sun, you’re going to feel a little cooler. It makes sense it would apply to rooftops also which are going to be a huge square footage impact from that heat absorption from the sun,” said Tappert.

Owens Corning, the company that produces the cool roof shingle, could transport to the northwest, there just might be a shipping fee or slight delay for shipping.

Tappert said the only con to using those cool roof shingles in the northwest is that those shingles to not have any built-in algae resistance, which most shingles he sells in Washington have, and that would be the only trade for the cool roof shingles.

However, he said the algae-resistant shingles do have lighter shades that would be beneficial for lower temperatures.

For Kaku, the solution is both homeowners stepping up to choose lighter colors when redoing a roof or building a new home, plus asking city leaders to issue guidance.

""By changing the color choices slightly, we can make meaningful action and address urban heat island effects and reduce temperatures of cities by as much as 2 degrees,"" she said. ""This is a change we can implement right now. Simply by mandating more reflective surfaces, higher albedo building materials, we can make meaningful action right now.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/1187d8ab-58a2-44de-9a61-b3ab04c42e21/20250920T023239/1187d8ab-58a2-44de-9a61-b3ab04c42e21_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 20:59:45.498952
,North Carolina Environment,2025-09-21 00:18:07+00:00,Inside Climate News,This Town Was One of the First in the Nation to Install a Geothermal Network. Now Others ...,"Phil McKenna, Anika Jane Beamer",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20092025/west-union-geothermal-energy-network/,"“It saves us money, and will continue to save us money,” Fate said, emphasizing the financial benefits of the geothermal system.
It is expected to last 80 years or more, based on an independent analysis of the West Union network conducted in 2021.
The grants covered the majority of the streetscape project and the entire cost of the $2.2 million geothermal system.
In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, deep, hot-rock geothermal projects that generate steam for electricity production are also seeing increased interest.
“It was years ahead of its time,” said Larry Leliefeld, former president of the Iowa Geothermal Association, an industry group, and the current service provider for the West Union geothermal system.","WEST UNION, Iowa—From the billboard on the edge of town to the limestone monument on Vine Street, the signs are hard to miss: “West Union, Deeply Connected.” It’s a motto that could apply to many tight-knit farm towns across the Midwest where families date back generations.

But in this town of 2,500, the words have additional meaning.

Buried beneath the front lawn of the county courthouse and town square are 132 boreholes, each 300 feet deep. Pipes connected to the bores run below the surrounding blocks, providing downtown businesses with year-round geothermal energy. The high-efficiency, fossil-fuel-free heating and cooling system owned by the town was one of the first municipal thermal networks in the country when it began operating in 2014.

For Steve Fate, the president of West Union District Energy, which oversees the system, its appeal is simple.

“It saves us money, and will continue to save us money,” Fate said, emphasizing the financial benefits of the geothermal system.

In 2023, the U.S. Department of Energy highlighted West Union as having one of the highest-performing geothermal networks among a small but growing number of similar systems in operation nationwide.

“It’s sort of a celebrity among thermal energy networks because it was constructed very early,” said Jessica Silber-Byrne, the thermal energy networks research and communications manager for the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a nonprofit organization working to eliminate the use of fossil fuels in buildings.

The library, county courthouse, a law office, two banks, an insurance company and a shoe store are among the twelve buildings connected to the geothermal system. Each user is part of the energy district, the group that oversees its operation.

The system has underground boreholes that serve as a thermal equalizer. A mixture of water and glycol circulates through pipes in each hole, where underground temperatures remain at approximately 50°Fahrenheit year round. As the water travels through the vertical bores, it is warmed or cooled by the surrounding rock and sediment until it stabilizes at 50 degrees, a temperature well-suited for cooling on hot summer days and a great starting point for heating buildings in the winter months.

A loop of horizontal pipe running beneath six blocks of West Union’s downtown then circulates the ground-temperature water to buildings connected to the system. Heat pumps in each building use compressors and fans to further warm or cool the buildings, depending on the time of year. These water-source heat pumps work the same way as air-source heat pumps that draw on outdoor air for heating and cooling, but are more efficient.

The high-density polyethylene pipe used in the bores and distribution loop is the same type of pipe used by water, sewer and gas utilities. It is expected to last 80 years or more, based on an independent analysis of the West Union network conducted in 2021. The heat pumps located in each building have a life expectancy of up to 24 years according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

In community spaces like the library, the heating and cooling is a public service, Fate said.

“It’s going to be warm today and humid, and we’re going to have community members just coming in here for the day,” said Fate, who is also the president of the West Union Community Library Board of Trustees, during a visit in late June when temperatures would reach 89° Fahrenheit outside. “On our winter days, when it’s 20 below zero, we have people that come in, off and on all day long, because there’s a warm spot to be.”

Perfect Timing

Geothermal heating and cooling is just one of several sustainability projects that West Union completed in the early 2010s as part of a revitalization project that included a complete reconstruction of its downtown streets. Other initiatives included replacing the existing asphalt with porous pavement that lets water seep into the ground and bioswales or rain gardens that slow and filter stormwater runoff. The city worked closely with the Iowa Economic Development Authority, which was looking to fund sustainable pilot projects in towns across the state. The state agency brought outside experts to West Union to discuss options with residents.

“We just basically brainstormed ideas—even if they were off the wall and seemed ridiculous,” said Jon Biederman, a civil engineer who was part of the town’s redevelopment planning team. “Some of those were taken off the table right away, but one that kind of hung on was geothermal.”

Biederman and others in town were familiar with small-scale geothermal energy. Some had ground-source heat pumps connected to one or two boreholes that provided heating and cooling for their homes. Another small-scale system, completed in 2007, provided heating and cooling for the high school’s performing arts center.

During the brainstorming sessions, someone mentioned a much larger thermal energy network in Holland, Michigan, that used waste heat from a nearby power plant to fuel a snowmelt system for streets and sidewalks across much of the city’s downtown.

West Union didn’t have a power plant and the waste heat that comes with it, but its residents decided to pursue geothermal on a similar scale to provide heating and cooling to the town’s business district. The decision was made easier in part by plans to rip up and replace most of the streets downtown. With the ground already exposed, it would be less costly and disruptive to bury water pipes connecting the borefield to nearby buildings.

The town was able to secure state and federal grants driven by stimulus funding following the Great Recession of the late 2000s. The grants covered the majority of the streetscape project and the entire cost of the $2.2 million geothermal system.

“The timing was just right for making the geothermal happen,” Biederman said. “I don’t know that it would have ever happened before that, or probably since. It was just absolutely perfect for timing.”

For the buildings connected to the system, the savings are significant.

Biederman estimated that his engineering firm’s office building saves a few hundred dollars a month with geothermal energy compared to what they would otherwise pay today if they kept their prior heating and cooling systems.

Fate, the library board president, calculated that the building’s costs for heating and cooling have decreased by 25 percent per square foot since the geothermal system was first installed.

Pat Dillon, a local attorney who connected his West Union office building to the town’s geothermal network several years ago, saw his winter heating bill drop nearly in half from $350 to $180 per month.

“It provides consistent, nice heat in the wintertime, and it’s cool in the summertime,” Dillon said. “It’s meeting all of our objectives.”

Learning Curve

As one of the first communities in the country to own and operate such a system, there were challenges early on.

“There weren’t good examples to fall back on, like ‘How do we bill everybody? What does that look like?’” said Robin Bostrom, the former head of the West Union Chamber of Commerce’s Main Street program, an economic revitalization and historic preservation initiative. “They had to kind of wade through that and figure it out.”

Users of the network formed their own limited liability corporation and hired a geothermal service provider to monitor and maintain the system. Initially, costs were high, and the savings from switching to geothermal were minimal. However, a new service provider hired in 2021 provided the same services at a fraction of the cost. The change has allowed the user group to reduce the amount they pay for thermal energy from $14 per ton of heating and cooling capacity in 2021 to $9 per ton today.

When the project was first completed, it was anticipated that it would be a model for the nation. In the early years, the town received a lot of calls about the streetscape and its permeable pavers, but there was little interest in the geothermal system, Biederman said.

That’s beginning to change.

“We used to get a call every once in a while. Now it’s really consistent,” Fate said, noting a group recently visited from Vermont.

Hot water from thermal springs has been used in district heating systems in the U.S. for 150 years, but the West Union network was the first ambient temperature system owned by a municipality, Silber-Byrne of the Building Decarbonization Coalition said.

There are now dozens of neighborhood-scale networks and district energy systems that tap geothermal energy for heating and cooling in operation in the United States, research from the organization indicates. Dozens of additional systems are currently under development.

In addition to geothermal heating and cooling, deep, hot-rock geothermal projects that generate steam for electricity production are also seeing increased interest. New, enhanced geothermal systems that draw on hydraulic fracturing techniques developed by the oil and gas industry and other advanced drilling methods are quickly expanding geothermal energy’s potential.

Silber-Byrne said legislation that allows, or in some cases requires, utilities to install geothermal systems is partly responsible for the uptick in the heating and cooling networks. Twelve states, including those on the West Coast, Midwest, Northeast as well as Colorado and Texas, have passed laws related to geothermal heating and cooling in recent years, according to the organization.

Tax incentives introduced during the Biden administration and largely preserved in the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act are also driving interest in the networks, Silber-Byrne said.

Interest from utilities and communities in using geothermal energy instead of gas as a means to meet their climate goals and protect against natural gas price spikes during periods of peak demand is also spurring new projects.

The biggest challenges to adoption remain unfamiliarity with the systems and their high upfront cost, Silber-Byrne said. While the West Union system was financed entirely by federal grants, some in the community were initially opposed to, and spoke out against, a largely unproven system.

“Either they didn’t have the information they needed, or they were afraid, or we didn’t communicate well enough from the start,” said Dick Woodard, a retired insurance agent who has owned two buildings connected to the system.

“It was years ahead of its time,” said Larry Leliefeld, former president of the Iowa Geothermal Association, an industry group, and the current service provider for the West Union geothermal system. “What it lacked was bringing [people] along and helping them understand it.”

Now, as the West Union geothermal network enters its second decade of operation and its user rates decrease while gas and electric rates climb, more local businesses are considering connecting their buildings to the existing network, Fate said.

The local elementary school in West Union recently installed its own geothermal system.

“It’s kind of like church,” Woodard said. “If you want to change the hymns, then you are going to have somebody squawking about it. That’s the way it was here. You get past it.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Iowa-Geothermal_Deeply-Connected1_McKennaJPG-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 21:59:34.279504

Its ability to generate electricity without emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels makes it a key player against climate change. However, behind each wind turbine lies a complex engineering work that seeks to balance efficiency, stability, and sustainability.

For decades, the three-blade model dominated the industry by offering an adequate compromise between aerodynamics, mechanical resistance, and reliability. Each additional blade provides less performance, and adding more than three generates overweight and wind resistance, reducing efficiency. That is why manufacturers have opted for the triad as a worldwide standard.

From a mechanical point of view, three blades allow for distributing loads evenly, reducing vibrations, and extending the lifespan of the equipment. Wind turbines also have Yaw brakes, systems that orient the rotor towards the wind and protect it from extreme gusts, providing an extra layer of safety.

On the other hand, designs with one or two blades historically faced stability and durability issues, requiring additional parts that increased costs and complicated manufacturing. However, recent innovation is challenging this trend and opening up new possibilities to diversify turbine models.

Wind energy.

The challenge of two blades: innovation and efficiency

The company Envision Energy surprised the sector by presenting a two-blade (2B) wind turbine that has managed to overcome traditional obstacles. With over 500 days of stable operation, it achieved levels of availability and operating hours comparable to three-blade models.

This advancement is due to a modular and lightweight design that reduces structural mass and simplifies assembly logistics. It also integrates active controls, lightweight materials such as carbon fiber shafts, and advanced technology to ensure dynamic stability. Thus, the vibration and wear issues that previously limited bi-blade turbines seem to be a thing of the past.

The two-blade model offers clear economic advantages. By reducing the rotor’s weight by 15–20%, manufacturing and transportation costs decrease. It is even possible to mount the rotor and the nacelle together, simplifying operations in remote areas. Although its aerodynamic efficiency may be up to 5% lower, the cost-benefit balance makes it attractive for projects in complex environments.

In emerging markets, where logistical conditions hinder the installation of conventional turbines, this design can make a difference. Its adaptability makes it a strategic option to accelerate the expansion of wind energy in isolated regions and support global commitments to decarbonization.

The environmental benefits of wind energy

Beyond technological innovation, the true value of wind energy lies in its environmental impact. By generating electricity from the wind, it avoids the burning of fossil fuels responsible for greenhouse gas emissions. Each operational wind turbine can offset thousands of tons of CO₂ throughout its lifespan.

Another key benefit is the reduction of air pollution. Unlike thermal plants, wind energy does not produce smoke, particles, or toxic waste, contributing to improving the quality of life in nearby communities. Moreover, as a renewable and inexhaustible source, it offers energy security in the long term.

The installation of wind farms also promotes local development, creating jobs and fostering more sustainable regional economies. In combination with other clean energies, wind power emerges as one of the most effective solutions to mitigate climate change and build a more just and balanced energy future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/09/turbina.webp,N,,2025-09-20 22:59:34.512649

These banks are designed to empower local communities by providing them with the tools and resources necessary to harness renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass. By establishing a decentralized energy system, CBREBs not only promote sustainability but also enhance energy security and economic resilience within communities.

This innovative model encourages local participation, fosters collaboration, and ultimately leads to a more equitable energy landscape. The concept of CBREBs is rooted in the belief that communities should have control over their energy resources. By engaging local stakeholders in the planning and implementation processes, these banks can tailor solutions to meet the specific needs of their communities.

This localized approach not only increases the likelihood of project success but also builds a sense of ownership among community members. As a result, CBREBs can serve as a catalyst for broader social and economic development, paving the way for a sustainable future.

Overview of the Current Energy Landscape

The current energy landscape is characterized by a growing demand for clean and sustainable energy sources. As climate change continues to pose significant threats to our planet, there is an urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy alternatives. However, many communities, particularly those in rural or low-income areas, face barriers to accessing these resources.

High upfront costs, lack of infrastructure, and limited technical expertise often hinder their ability to adopt renewable energy solutions. Moreover, traditional energy systems are often centralized, leaving many communities vulnerable to fluctuations in energy prices and supply disruptions. This reliance on external sources can exacerbate existing inequalities and limit opportunities for local economic development.

In contrast, CBREBs offer a decentralized model that empowers communities to generate their own energy, reducing dependence on external providers and fostering self-sufficiency. By leveraging local resources and knowledge, these banks can create a more resilient energy system that benefits all community members.

Objectives and Goals of the Grant Proposal

The primary objective of this grant proposal is to establish Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks in targeted communities to promote sustainable energy practices and enhance local resilience. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following goals: 1. Increase access to renewable energy sources for underserved communities by developing localized energy production systems.

2.

Foster community engagement and participation in the planning and implementation of renewable energy projects.

3. Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for community members to develop technical skills related to renewable energy technologies.

4. Promote economic development by creating green jobs and stimulating local economies through the establishment of CBREBs.

By focusing on these objectives, we aim to create a sustainable energy model that not only addresses immediate energy needs but also contributes to long-term community development.

Implementation Plan for Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks

The implementation plan for establishing Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks will involve several key phases. First, we will conduct a comprehensive needs assessment in the target communities to identify specific energy challenges and opportunities. This assessment will involve engaging with local stakeholders, including community members, local government officials, and potential partners, to gather input and build support for the project.

Once the needs assessment is complete, we will develop a tailored project plan that outlines the specific renewable energy technologies to be implemented, such as solar panels or wind turbines. We will also establish partnerships with local organizations and experts to provide technical assistance and training throughout the project lifecycle. Community workshops will be organized to educate residents about renewable energy options and encourage their active participation in the project.

The next phase will involve securing funding and resources for the project implementation. This may include applying for grants, seeking donations from local businesses, or exploring crowdfunding options. Once funding is secured, we will begin the installation of renewable energy systems in collaboration with community members.

Throughout this process, we will prioritize transparency and communication to ensure that all stakeholders are informed and engaged.

Budget and Funding Requirements

To successfully implement Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks, a detailed budget will be developed outlining all anticipated costs associated with the project. This budget will include expenses related to equipment procurement, installation, training programs, community engagement activities, and ongoing maintenance of renewable energy systems. We estimate that the total budget for establishing CBREBs in our target communities will be approximately $500,000.

This figure includes costs for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries for energy storage, training materials, and personnel expenses for project coordinators and trainers. To secure funding for this initiative, we will pursue various avenues such as government grants, private foundations focused on renewable energy or community development, and partnerships with local businesses willing to invest in sustainable initiatives. In addition to external funding sources, we will explore opportunities for community contributions through volunteer labor or small financial investments from residents who wish to participate in the project.

By fostering a sense of ownership among community members, we can enhance the sustainability of the CBREBs while also building local capacity.

Expected Impact and Benefits of the Project

The establishment of Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks is expected to yield significant positive impacts on both the environment and the local economy. By increasing access to renewable energy sources, we anticipate a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a decrease in reliance on fossil fuels within the target communities. This shift towards cleaner energy will contribute to global efforts to combat climate change while also improving air quality and public health.

Economically, CBREBs have the potential to create green jobs in areas such as installation, maintenance, and operation of renewable energy systems. By providing training opportunities for community members, we can equip them with valuable skills that enhance their employability and contribute to local economic growth. Additionally, by generating their own energy, communities can reduce their utility costs and redirect those savings towards other essential services or initiatives.

Socially, the project aims to foster greater community cohesion by encouraging collaboration among residents and local organizations. As community members work together towards a common goal of sustainable energy production, they will build stronger relationships and develop a sense of pride in their collective achievements. Ultimately, CBREBs can serve as a model for other communities seeking to adopt similar approaches to renewable energy.

Evaluation and Monitoring Plan

To ensure the success of Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks, a robust evaluation and monitoring plan will be implemented throughout the project lifecycle. This plan will include both qualitative and quantitative measures to assess progress towards our objectives and goals. We will establish key performance indicators (KPIs) related to energy production levels, community engagement rates, job creation figures, and participant satisfaction with training programs.

Regular data collection will be conducted through surveys, interviews, and focus groups with community members to gather feedback on their experiences with the project. Additionally, we will conduct periodic assessments of the renewable energy systems’ performance to ensure they are operating efficiently and meeting community needs. This ongoing monitoring will allow us to identify any challenges or areas for improvement promptly.

By maintaining transparency in our evaluation process, we can build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate the impact of our efforts.

Conclusion and Next Steps

In conclusion, Community-Based Renewable Energy Banks present an innovative solution to address the pressing energy needs of underserved communities while promoting sustainability and economic development. By empowering local residents to take control of their energy resources, we can create a more resilient and equitable energy landscape. As we move forward with this grant proposal, our next steps will involve finalizing partnerships with local organizations, conducting needs assessments in target communities, and developing a detailed project timeline.

We are committed to engaging community members throughout this process to ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are prioritized. With your support, we can turn this vision into reality and pave the way for a brighter future powered by clean, renewable energy for all.

According to Iraqi media cited by Al Jazeera, the facility—set to open on Sunday—will be the country’s largest solar power plant and is expected to eventually produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity at peak capacity.

The plant is located on approximately 4,000 dunams (1,000 acres or 400 hectares) in the al-Hur desert region of Karbala, southwest of Baghdad. The site features tens of thousands of solar panels arranged in systematic rows.

Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of the national solar energy team in the Iraqi prime minister’s office, said additional projects are already in the pipeline. A second solar plant under construction in Babil province is expected to generate 225 megawatts, while a much larger 1,000-megawatt project is planned for the southern province of Basra.

“These initiatives are part of a broader vision to meet a portion of Iraq’s energy needs through large-scale solar power, easing the strain on the national grid while also reducing harmful gas emissions,” Al Jazeera quoted officials as saying.

Deputy Minister of Electricity Adel Karim stated that Iraq currently has solar energy projects with a combined capacity of 12,500 megawatts in various stages of development—from implementation and approval to negotiation. Excluding the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, these projects could potentially supply up to 20 percent of Iraq’s total electricity demand, he added.

Despite its abundant oil and gas reserves, Iraq has faced persistent electricity shortages for decades, driven by years of conflict, widespread corruption, and poor infrastructure management. This summer, national power consumption surged to nearly 55,000 megawatts, while temperatures in parts of the country exceeded 50 degrees Celsius (122°F), Al Jazeera reported.

Big Tech is scouting for sites in these states amid rising interest to build data centers there to take advantage of the nearby gas supply and friendlier regulatory environment, Hansen said at the BNEF summit.

So far this decade, gas infrastructure development has been shunned due to opposition by U.S. states to host more pipelines and the Biden Administration’s pivot to supporting renewable energy and telling oil and gas companies they are things of the past.

But with the Trump Administration strongly backing American energy dominance, increased oil and gas production, and eased regulatory burdens for project approvals, new infrastructure – pipeline and power plants – could come online to help meet rising electricity demand.

Analysts are also betting on natural gas to help feed America’s AI boom.

Onshoring of manufacturing activity and AI-related data centers are driving an increase in U.S. electricity consumption, Goldman Sachs said in a report earlier this year.

U.S. electrical power demand is expected to rise by 2.4% each year through 2030, with AI-related demand accounting for about two-thirds of the incremental power demand in the country, the investment bank said.

More than $700 billion of grid investment is expected in the country through 2030, as the U.S. infrastructure needs to be updated to accommodate the unprecedented growth of electricity demand, according to Goldman Sachs.

Natural gas is best positioned to capture most of the growth, according to the investment bank.

“Natural gas will benefit significantly from the rising electricity demand and the requirement for 24/7 uninterrupted supply. It is most flexible among all energy sources and an abundant domestic resource,” Goldman Sachs said.

The world’s biggest economy will need all energy sources to ensure power demand is met. Natural gas is the biggest near-term winner of AI advancements, but renewables will also play a key role in powering the data centers of next-generation computing, analysts say.

Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.
Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.

Donald Trump’s justice department has asked a judge to shut down a Vermont law which holds major polluters financially responsible for climate damages.

In a brief filed on Monday in a federal court in Burlington, the administration said the policy was “unlawful on its face” and pushed the court to “end Vermont’s lawless experiment.”

“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion.

Passed in 2024, the Vermont policy — known as the Climate Superfund Act — requires major polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, which have warmed the planet and increased the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as the floods which wreaked $1 billion in damage on the state last year. New York passed a similar measure in December.

“This law is about holding Big Oil accountable for a portion of the damage it has already brought to Vermont’s farms, businesses, homeowners and communities,” said Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, one of the organizations that helped to pass Vermont’s climate superfund law. “Vermont is well within its rights to protect its people in this way.”

The filing comes four months after the Department of Justice and Environmental Protection Agency sued Vermont and New York over the laws. In August, the state and two nonprofits who were granted intervenor status, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said her organization would “continue to defend the state’s climate superfund law meant to protect the wallets of Vermont’s families and businesses.

“Let’s be clear: This law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions, punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” she said. “This is Vermont using its legal right to raise revenue and protect the health, safety, and well-being of its residents from the ruinous, inescapable consequences of climate change.”

The motion is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to quash climate accountability efforts and environmental regulations. In an April executive order, Trump instructed the justice department to “stop the enforcement” of climate superfund policies.

In July, the administration proposed undoing the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which says planet-warming emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act – the most audacious of more than 150 environmental rollbacks launched since Trump retook office in January.

Jamie Henn, director of the anti-fossil fuel nonprofit Fossil Free Media, which backs the superfund laws, said Trump’s assault would not deter efforts to bring about financial accountability for global warming. Legislators in at least a dozen states are looking to introduce or reintroduce climate superfund bills in 2026, he said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/VermontFlooding.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-20 20:01:33.469502

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.
In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4mn worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.","A Texas refinery that supplies green fuel to US airlines has been purchasing animal fat from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest, according to a Reuters review of government tracking data, interviews and eyewitness accounts.

Louisiana-based Diamond Green Diesel, a joint-venture between biofuels producer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy, has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into a refinery in Port Arthur, Texas that turns cattle fat — called tallow — into a cleaner alternative to petroleum-based jet fuel and diesel.

Diamond Green Diesel is a major player in the US sustainable fuels market. It has collected over $3bn in US tax credits for producing biofuels since 2022, according to filings.

But interviews and documents show at least two Brazilian factories that supplied Diamond Green Diesel with tens of thousands of tons of cattle fat since 2023 are sourcing some of it from slaughterhouses that have bought animals from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon rainforest.

Carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines, which struck deals with Valero to use the “green” jet fuel, can claim credit for lowering their emissions because Diamond Green Diesel’s plant is certified under a United Nations agreement curbing the impact of aviation on the climate called CORSIA.

The global market for sustainable jet fuel is small, about $2.9bn in 2025 according to analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group, compared to the $239bn global market for conventional aviation fuel. But government incentives are expected to help the market grow exponentially, pumping more resources into the Brazilian cattle industry, the leading driver of the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

Pedro Piris-Cabezas, an economist at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said any additional demand “could result in the expansion of herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation.”

It could also violate Brazilian law. “Companies that profit from raw materials originating from a supply chain that involves deforestation, are also responsible for these illegalities,” said Ricardo Negrini, a Brazilian federal prosecutor who has opened a number of government investigations into the cattle industry.

Diamond Green Diesel, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, Southwest and JetBlue did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including detailed questions about the Brazilian tallow supply chain.

To track the tallow trade from illegally deforested ranches in the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, Reuters partnered with the nonprofit investigative outlet Reporter Brasil, which helped review court documents that link slaughterhouses to the tallow plants, corporate filings, trade data, and government cattle tracking records.

Reuters also interviewed over a dozen people involved in each step of the beef tallow supply chain, including traders, truck drivers, prosecutors, auditors and regulators.

Diamond Green Diesel sources tallow from multiple countries, and Reuters was unable to determine how much of it came from ranches in illegally-cleared land in the Amazon.

In 2022 Darling Ingredients CEO Randall Stuewe announced the $557mn acquisition of several plants in Brazil, including four in the Amazon region, that would supply “waste fats to be used in the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” according to a statement issued at the time.

Reuters found one of those rendering plants in Para state, called Araguaia, sourced cattle fat from at least five meatpackers that failed a May 2025 audit conducted by federal prosecutors for slaughtering 20,000 cattle from illegally deforested areas.

In 2023, Araguaia exported $4.4mn worth of beef tallow from the Amazon to Diamond Green Diesel, according to trade data from Import Genius.

In June, a Reuters journalist saw a truck with an Araguaia logo inside the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse, which failed an audit for buying cattle from farms on illegally deforested land.

The driver of the truck, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters he had been picking up carcasses at the Sao Francisco slaughterhouse and delivering them to the Araguaia plant for two years. Two other drivers and two Sao Francisco employees confirmed the slaughterhouse was an Araguaia supplier.

Sao Francisco didn’t confirm or deny that it is a supplier of the Araguaia plant. It said it has been cooperating with federal prosecutors since 2018 and that it hired an outside firm to monitor its supply chain.

Sao Francisco sources some of its cattle indirectly from Vale do Paraiso, a farm that had been blocked from grazing cattle since 2006 because 15 square miles of trees had been illegally razed, according to Brazil’s environmental protection agency, Ibama. Cattle tracking data shows that the cattle was moved from Vale do Paraiso to a farm with a clean record before it reached the slaughterhouse.

The agency unblocked Vale do Paraiso last year because a court determined that the statute of limitations had expired, but its owner Antonio Lucena Barros still owes over $3mn in fines for the deforestation there, according to government documents.

Barros’ lawyer Calebe Rocha said in a statement that his client is fighting the fines in court and has been granted an injunction that suspends the payment of the fine. He also said that no animals were sold from the part of Vale do Paraiso that Ibama had blocked due to deforestation.

Another plant owned by Darling Ingredients sourced fat from a slaughterhouse that confirmed to Reuters that it bought hundreds of cattle in 2022 and 2023 from rancher Bruno Heller, who Brazil’s Federal Police has described as possibly the Amazon’s biggest deforester in a 2023 investigation.

In a statement, Heller’s lawyer Vinicius Segatto said Brazil’s environmental law is “excessively rigorous” and that the criminal case against his client is ongoing.

Airlines have been under pressure to buy more green jet fuel, which is now produced in tiny quantities, to meet industry targets of net-zero emissions by 2050.

Supporters of the use of tallow as a biofuel assert that demand for it alone is unlikely to push ranchers to clear rainforest to grow their pastures because of its economic value — less than 3% of what slaughterhouses get for each animal.

’ imports from Brazil were certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond’s plant for CORSIA.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land that was deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond’s supply chain because it considers tallow a “byproduct” of the beef industry under CORSIA.

Three experts who helped design CORSIA told Reuters that the program allows producers to omit the score for carbon emissions and deforestation of the Amazon rainforest because it assumes demand for tallow is unlikely to push ranchers to grow their herds.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation declined to comment when asked about whether it viewed deforestation in the tallow supply chain as a violation of its sustainability standards.

However, the agency said it is “constantly monitoring the compliance” of third-parties responsible for certifying sustainable aviation fuel producers and welcomes information on “any potential deviations” for further evaluation. — Reuters",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/20/359481.JPG,N,,2025-09-20 19:00:53.059269

Game-Changing Benefits for Stellantis Brands

The integrated battery system represents a significant advancement in EV technology that could benefit multiple Stellantis brands across North America. Jeep's current 4xe lineup, including the Grand Cherokee 4xe with its 26-mile electric range and Wrangler 4xe offering 21 miles of electric-only driving, could see meaningful improvements with IBIS technology implementation.

A 10% efficiency boost would translate to approximately 2.6 additional miles of electric range for the Grand Cherokee 4xe and over 2 miles for the Wrangler 4xe. While these gains might seem modest, they represent meaningful improvements where every mile of electric range reduces reliance on gasoline. The weight reduction of 88 pounds also improves overall efficiency. Dodge's Charger EVs could also benefit from up to 30 miles of additional range and space savings, while Ram's recently shelved electric pickup truck could have leveraged the faster charging capabilities and reduced complexity.

Too Little, Too Late?

Traditional EVs use separate onboard chargers that convert grid AC power to DC for battery storage, while onboard inverters convert battery DC power to AC for electric motors. By consolidating these functions into the battery pack itself, Stellantis creates opportunities for simplified vehicle assembly, reduced manufacturing costs, and improved reliability. The technology also improves Stellantis' position against Tesla and Ford in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The IBIS technology could prove valuable as Stellantis accelerates its electrification timeline across brands like Dodge, which plans to transition its performance lineup to electric power. The system's ability to provide faster charging and higher efficiency while maintaining smaller packaging requirements addresses two critical consumer concerns about EV adoption. Stellantis says the technology should see production before 2030, but really, it can’t come soon enough.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/autoblog_arena_articles_145/ca6b1986e2fcd5473ee29a8863c258a9,N,,2025-09-21 09:59:48.294206

SENATE

Reviewing Nominees Slate

The Senate on Sept. 15, by a 51-44 vote, passed a resolution (S. Res. 377), sponsored by Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), for the en bloc consideration of a set of 48 nominees for executive branch positions, including several ambassadorships and an array of senior roles in the military and other federal agencies. Thune said en bloc consideration was necessary because Democratic senators had, unprecedentedly, refused to confirm any of the president’s nominees by unanimous consent or voice vote, and the resulting need to invoke cloture and have recorded votes on each nominee “ties up the Senate floor, preventing us from considering important legislation.”

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) voted no

Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) voted no

Federal Reserve Board

The Senate on Sept. 15, by a 48-47 vote, confirmed the nomination of Stephen Miran to be a member of the board of the Federal Reserve banking system for a term ending in early 2026. In March, Miran became chairman of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers. He was a policy advisor at the Treasury Department during the first Trump administration, then a strategist at a private investment firm and fellow at the Manhattan Institute. An opponent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said confirming Miran would allow President Trump “to succeed in this next phase of his very public, very obvious, months-long campaign to stack the Fed with loyalists who will prioritize Trump’s personal whims over America’s long-term economic health.”

Indiana Power Plant Emissions

The Senate on Sept. 16, by a 51-47 vote, rejected a motion to consider a resolution (S.J. Res. 60), sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), that would have nullified and voided an Environmental Protection Agency rule issued in May that increased allowed levels of nitrogen oxide emissions from Indiana power plants during the summer months. Whitehouse said the rule, by clearing the way for coal-fired power plants to remain in operation, would endanger public health by increasing levels of smog, which “causes lung disease, it causes cardiovascular problems, and it even causes reproductive issues.” A resolution opponent, Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), called the rule “merely a housekeeping correction that lines up the state limit with active generation so unrealistic, retroactive costs aren’t forced on power plants and ultimately the ratepayer.”

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people's lives.

“I don't see them as movements. I don't see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,"" said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone's headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women's March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that's the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her six-year-old daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,"" it read.

“It's all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don't have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we're not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

President Biden's administration promised a transformative infrastructure push, including a sprawling network of fast-charging stations to blanket the nation. Yet, as of mid-2025, that vision remains more mirage than reality. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allocated $7.5 billion for EV chargers, aiming for 500,000 stations by 2030. THAT, never happened, Man, was THAT a fail of EPIC proportion!

Compounding the frustration is the charging experience itself: a touch-and-go ordeal that turns road trips into endurance tests. Imagine pulling into a station after hours of white-knuckled range monitoring, only to find half the stalls occupied by gas-guzzlers or malfunctioning units spitting error codes. Surveys from AAA in 2024 revealed 60% of EV owners report anxiety over charging reliability, with downtime averaging 20% during peak times. It's not just inconvenient; it's a buzzkill for the eco-warrior fantasy.

Then there's the lineup of EVs themselves. Where's the sizzle? Tesla's Cybertruck and Rivian's R1T were supposed to ignite lust, but high prices—often north of $80,000—keep them niche and in our opinion, neither is a MUST-HAVE.

Mainstream models like the Chevy Bolt refresh or Ford Mustang Mach-E updates feel iterative, not revolutionary. Consumer Reports' 2025 EV satisfaction index shows a dip: Only 45% of buyers cite ""excitement"" as a factor, down from 62% in 2022. Without jaw-dropping designs or must-have features—like affordable sub-$30,000 options or seamless autonomy—EVs risk blending into the beige sedan crowd. Sales reflect this: EV market share stalled at 7.6% in Q2 2025, per Cox Automotive, as hybrids steal the spotlight.

So, how does the EV shake off this 'meh' funk?

Innovation is the spark. Automakers need to deliver crave-worthy rides: But NONE are coming that we can see to turn this around.

Until, they figure it out which we don’t think they will, we’re all stuck idling and Tesla is running further and further away.

By investing in widespread adoption of distributed energy now, North Carolina can build a stronger, more dependable energy system that is flexible in a crisis and able to help avert prolonged outages.
And because distributed energy sources are decentralized, they can be scaled to meet the unique needs of North Carolina, from mountain towns in the west to coastal cities in the east.
Hurricane Helene was a wake-up call for communities that assumed that their distance from the coast protected them from hurricanes.
After Hurricane Helene, this microgrid supplied power to Hot Springs for six days before the main grid was restored.","In Mills River, community members recently came together for AMPlify Appalachia to celebrate — with live music and craft beer — their energy and resilience since Hurricane Helene swept through North Carolina nearly a year ago.

After the hurricane caused 108 deaths and more than $60 billion in damage, AMPlify Appalachia offered people a space where they could process a year filled with heartbreak and uncertainty. It also highlighted a growing community that is committed not only to recovery but also to building a more resilient future.

In the wake of Hurricane Helene, creation of reliable energy systems was both an urgent necessity and long-term challenge. In the immediate aftermath of the storm, distributed energy resources (DERs) proved vital in delivering lifesaving power to remote, storm-ravaged areas in the western mountains of North Carolina, where downed lines were difficult to access and repair. Thanks to organizations such as the Footprint Project, a solar microgrid at a fire station was used to run refrigerators, freezers, and communications; an atmospheric water generator was set up to keep relief teams hydrated without relying on single-use bottled water; and portable power stations were established to help residents in need of emergency medical care.

Distributed energy, which can generate, store, and deliver electricity independently from the main grid, is a highly effective way to keep electricity flowing and mitigate the risk of outages. DERs, which include battery storage, solar panels, electric vehicles, and smart thermostats, allow households, schools, hospitals, and communities to produce and store their own energy without relying solely on distant power plants. These consumer- and community-based energy resources ease strain on the central grid and can operate when storms knock the grid out.

Today, more than 60 operational DER projects support communities across Western North Carolina, proving that these weren’t one-time fixes — they are the building blocks of long-term resilience. But there is more to do. By investing in widespread adoption of distributed energy now, North Carolina can build a stronger, more dependable energy system that is flexible in a crisis and able to help avert prolonged outages. And because distributed energy sources are decentralized, they can be scaled to meet the unique needs of North Carolina, from mountain towns in the west to coastal cities in the east.

Hurricane Helene was a wake-up call for communities that assumed that their distance from the coast protected them from hurricanes. It was also a sobering sign of what’s to come.

Extreme weather events like Helene are expected to become more frequent and more destructive. Just weeks ago, the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal caused flash flooding that closed Interstate 40, damaged homes and businesses, killed six people, and prompted numerous water rescues.

At the same time, energy demand in North Carolina is rapidly growing, not only among individuals and households but also from data centers and other commercial users. Our electricity grid is at risk of being overwhelmed. According to consulting firm ICF International, electricity demand in the United States is projected to grow 25% by 2030 —the fastest rate in over 70 years.

Because the grid is not built for this double threat, we can expect more disruptions, longer blackouts, and higher monthly energy costs for the average North Carolina resident. But fortunately, the Tar Heel State has been planning for a future with new, reliable, affordable energy options. For example, Duke Energy’s microgrid in the mountain town of Hot Springs offers a model for resilience that is similar to the work done through the Footprint Project. In 2023, Duke installed a solar and battery storage microgrid at the utility’s substation to serve as backup power for the town. After Hurricane Helene, this microgrid supplied power to Hot Springs for six days before the main grid was restored.

State officials, utilities, and local leaders have an opportunity — and a responsibility — to prioritize policies and programs that create a more reliable and affordable electric system through the use of distributed energy as they plan for North Carolina’s energy future.

The road to recovery in Western North Carolina is long, but with tools such as solar and battery storage, this region is leading the way, not just in rebuilding, but in redefining what resilience looks like.

Ohio’s politicians also fail to protect Ohioans as they continue to ignore the documented health and environmental effects from fracking.
Citizens question the ability of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to protect drinking water from toxic brine injected into Class II wells.
Now Ohio communities are being targeted for data centers, which will be powered by fracked gas.
My environmental engineering professor put it this way, “You can’t live in a toilet and expect to be healthy.” Dr. Randi Pokladnik Tappan Lake","This summer I turned 70, and in doing so I outlived both my parents. My mom and dad didn't drink or smoke but both died from cancer before their 70th birthdays. When I asked their oncologist in Pittsburgh why they might have contracted cancer, his reply was, “They grew up in the Ohio River Valley when air and water pollution were unregulated.”

During the 1940s, the Ohio River was used as an industrial sewer and smoke blanketed the Ohio River Valley; at times even blocking out the sun.

President Nixon recognized the need to address these issues, saying we should “make peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, land, and water.” He signed into law several environmental regulations, including: the National Environmental Policy Act, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1970, the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the creation of the Legacy of Parks program. The life-saving policies of Nixon’s administration are being eroded away by an administration that denies science and scientific studies.

On March 12, Trump’s head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin, announced the “most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.” Thirty-one acts of legislation that were created to protect human health and the environment are now being abolished in favor of industry profits. One of the rollbacks includes the 2009 Endangerment Finding which states that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act and that these gases pose a significant danger to human health.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding is backed by an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence. Last week, Trump’s EPA announced it will no longer require polluting industries to report their air emissions and is tossing out PFAS limits that protect drinking water.

Ohio’s politicians also fail to protect Ohioans as they continue to ignore the documented health and environmental effects from fracking. Citizens question the ability of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to protect drinking water from toxic brine injected into Class II wells. Now Ohio communities are being targeted for data centers, which will be powered by fracked gas. This means more destruction of ecosystems and communities in SE Ohio, as well as the communities that will host these enormous water-hogging, energy-hogging data centers.

Our home is located less than a mile from a fracking operation. We spent the better part of the summer listening to the sound of drilling and fracking; the sounds of nature were obliterated. Additionally, roads surrounding the well pad saw a steady barrage of sand, water and toxic radioactive brine trucks.

Governor DeWine is fooling himself if he thinks fracking state parks won't affect tourism or the health of local communities; it has and will continue to do so.

What's happening?

Cox Automotive exclusively shared data with Reuters that revealed Tesla's U.S. market share has dipped to its lowest level in nearly eight years at 38% — a far cry from the 80% share it once held.

This is the first time Tesla's share has fallen below 40% since 2017, when the Model 3 became its first mass-market car and inspired a greater number of consumers to switch to EVs.

""I know they're positioning themselves as a robotics, AI company. But when you're a car company, when you don't have new products, your share will start to decline,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox's director of industry insights, told Reuters.

Why is this important?

While CEO Elon Musk has remained bullish on his robotics and AI aspirations, Tesla's talent exodus and Musk's history of overpromising and underdelivering have spooked investors.

Musk's political involvement also caused a segment of consumers to associate Tesla with Musk's personal views rather than the EVs, contributing to declining sales numbers. Other EV makers had already been attracting buyers away from Tesla, but they have also benefited from this upheaval, leaving Tesla with a smaller piece of the pie.

What does this mean for the EV market?

Even though Tesla — whose name is synonymous with EVs — is facing reputational challenges, Cox's data showed that new EV sales leaped 24% month over month in July, per Reuters. The following month, as Tesla's growth lagged at 3.1%, the EV market grew by 14%.

Hyundai, Honda, Kia, and Toyota were key automakers turning up the heat on Tesla, offering more robust incentives to consumers scrambling to purchase EVs before October.

In addition to helping make cities healthier because they don't release tailpipe pollution, EVs offer long-term savings on energy and maintenance. This makes EVs attractive to consumers, regardless of their opinion about the brand largely responsible for making them mainstream.

""These legacy manufacturers are all benefiting from this sense of urgency, and they're able to have attractive offerings for their vehicles — and it's working,"" Streaty told Reuters. ""I think we're going to continue to see this momentum through September.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dQJTw_c67AFLnTLG.ty96w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/ea12ac23bcbdb9d2a60ef360fd2ba287,N,,2025-09-20 18:00:39.606972

The project, the largest of its kind in China, was put into full operation in the city of Hami on Thursday.

A 100-megawatt molten salt solar thermal section of the project has adopted advanced Linear Fresnel technology — one of the most advanced solar thermal power generation methods, using the principles of light reflection and refraction to convert solar thermal energy into electricity. It can generate 148 million kilowatt-hours of clean power annually, which will reduce carbon emissions by 1.3 million tonnes.

“Through this technology, molten salt acts like a super ‘power bank,’ storing heat collected from 260,000 mirrors under the sun during the day and generating power at night, enabling continuous electricity generation and lowering costs,” said Huang Longfei, a deputy manager of the project’s solar thermal section.

Xinjiang, the largest provincial-level administrative region in China, has abundant solar and wind resources.

As China has been striving to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, an increasing number of Chinese companies are developing clean energy in Xinjiang, driving the region’s green development, bringing employment and contributing to the country’s dual-carbon goals.

According to a white paper issued last year, clean energy accounted for 26.4 percent of China’s total energy use in 2023 — up from 15.5 percent in 2013 — and the share of coal in its energy consumption has dropped by 12.1 percentage points over the past decade.

Electricity generated from clean energy has accounted for more than half of the increase in the country’s total electricity consumption over the past decade, demonstrating the growing share green energy has in its energy mix.

Eyeing the potential for the wind power industry in the region, wind turbine manufacturer Yuexin Green Energy Group has invested 4 billion yuan (about 562 million U.S. dollars) to build an assembly line and a blade production base in Xinjiang’s Turpan City.

According to the group’s general manager Qiu Yong, the city’s central location within Xinjiang’s major wind power zones helps cut transport costs.

Qiu also highlighted the company’s strategic focus on Central Asian markets. “We received an order for 200 wind turbines from Kazakhstan soon after construction of the blade production base began last year,” he said, adding that the two facilities have opened some 2,000 jobs.

After graduating from university, local resident Maraba Mahmut works as an administrative specialist for the company, earning about 6,000 yuan a month.

“With the job near my home, I can take care of my family,” said the 27-year-old.

Qiu noted that the company has also attracted upstream and downstream firms to invest in Turpan, which will help complete the industrial chain for wind turbine manufacturing in the city.

But big changes are coming for EV drivers, and anyone thinking about buying one, starting at the end of September. Starting October 1, EV owners in Arizona will lose access to the HOV lane, along with the federal $7,500 tax credit that helped many buyers afford their first electric car.

Plugging in has become commonplace. Electric vehicles, or EVs, now come in all shapes and sizes and are produced by nearly every major automaker.

Peter Culin bought his first EV 14 years ago, motivated by environmental concerns.

“The future of our planet depends on a lot of things. But if we can do anything possible to help improve the conditions, improve air quality, it’s better for everybody,” Culin said.

The “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed earlier this summer, ended the long-standing tax incentive. Republican lawmakers argued the credit primarily benefited wealthy Americans and did little to reduce emissions, while the majority of U.S. electricity is still generated from fossil fuels.

Despite the loss of the federal tax break, local utilities like SRP are continuing their EV customer charging incentives.

“EVs have zero tailpipe emissions, so they are more environmentally friendly that way, more sustainable,” said Jason Smith of Salt River Project.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people’s lives.

“I don’t see them as movements. I don’t see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,” said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone’s headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women’s March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that’s the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her young daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,” it read.

“It’s all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don’t have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we’re not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

Situated in Athens, in the eastern Mediterranean, Piraeus is a pivotal hub on the trade route linking Europe, Africa and Asia.COSCO, one of China’s biggest port and shipping groups, holds a 67% stake in the Piraeus Port Authority company.Some Chinese investors are concerned Washington may want to target COSCO’s operations in Greece, a source close to Chinese investors involved in Greek shipping said.COSCO and the Greek government did not respond to requests for comment. Greek officials have told Reuters previously that they have not been informed about any plans to change control of Piraeus.Washington already has COSCO in its sights.The Department of Defense added state-owned COSCO to its blacklist of companies with links to the Chinese military in January. While the designation does not involve immediate bans on US companies doing business with those listed, it can act as a signal that further action is being considered.“The United States intends to attack China’s international influence by exaggerating the ‘China threat theory’ and use this as an excuse to force allies to take sides in supply chain arrangements,” the Development Research Center of the State Council, an official think-tank of China’s governing cabinet, said in a paper published last month.The US administration has unveiled measures to increase America’s thin commercial maritime presence around the world, including by encouraging domestic shipbuilding, is looking to expand access to US-controlled shipping registries, and is also reviewing global maritime chokepoints for shipping risks.China owns or leases an extensive network of ports through companies including COSCO and other state-controlled enterprises such as China Merchants and SIPG in Shanghai.According to a report published last year by the Council of Foreign Relations, a US think-tank, China had investments in 129 port projects worldwide through various companies, as of August 2024.China’s shipbuilding industry is also estimated to be 230 times larger than US shipyard capacity, meaning it could take decades to catch up, according to US Navy estimates.The US maritime push has contributed to tensions with Beijing, which sees port and shipping assets as integral to its Belt and Road initiative, at a time when the two superpowers are already at loggerheads over trade and tariffs.Mediterranean Gateway under reviewIn March, the US Federal Maritime Commission launched a review of seven maritime chokepoints. It said it wanted to identify regulations, policies or practices “that create unfavourable shipping conditions”.The Strait of Gibraltar, which separates Spain from Africa at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea, was one such waterway the review is examining.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has sought to deepen trade ties with China and this has raised concerns in Washington over Beijing’s access to its ports, two of the sources said.“We are not aware of any alleged concerns or approaches by third parties on this matter and therefore it is not appropriate for us to comment,” a Spanish foreign ministry spokesperson said when asked for comment about Chinese port investments.COSCO has concessions to operate container terminals in Valencia and Bilbao, a Spanish Port Authority spokesperson said.Trump has taken numerous steps since returning to the White House to boost US influence over the seas.He signed an executive order in April to revive shipbuilding capacity to expand the fleet of US-controlled vessels.His administration is examining a proposal to establish a shipping registry in the US Virgin Islands that could attract vessels to a US-controlled flag without having to meet the stricter standards of the domestic US registry.The US is poised to start hitting Chinese-built or Chinese-flagged vessels with fees for calling at US ports.And Trump has also flagged seizing the semi-autonomous Danish territory of Greenland as an objective, due to its proximity to the Arctic and key shipping lanes.Together, this all adds up to the most ambitious effort by the US to improve its position in global shipping since President Richard Nixon, who tried to bolster domestic shipbuilding, the commercial ship registry, and US sea power, the sources familiar with the plans said.“The US in the short to medium term is likely to continue its efforts to counter Chinese influence in the key port areas by building alliances and partnerships to counter Chinese power and economic growth,” said Poole-Robb at KCS.Caribbean shipping concernsThe United States has expressed concern too about Chinese investment in Jamaica’s Kingston terminal, a key maritime transhipment hub in the Caribbean due to its location and deep-water port facilities, according to the three sources.China Merchants has a stake in the company operating Kingston’s container terminal together with France’s CMA CGM. Chinese metals group JISCO bought the Alpart alumina refinery in St Elizabeth west of the capital in 2016 and owns nearby Port Kaiser.A June analysis by the Center for Strategic & International Studies think-tank said China’s presence in Kingston posed the greatest security risk to the United States out of all Beijing’s port projects in Latin America and the Caribbean.On a visit to Kingston in March, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, described China’s strategy as being characterised by “predatory practices”, using government-subsidised companies to “underbid everybody” and acquire assets.The presence of equipment from untrusted suppliers in critical infrastructure throughout the world, including ports, increases the risk to US national security, a State Department spokesperson said when asked about Rubio’s comments.A spokesperson for Jamaica’s ministry for foreign affairs and foreign trade said it had no knowledge of any US communication or request about reducing China’s maritime influence in the Caribbean nation.There was already some pushback against Chinese investment in the region during the first Trump administration.“I suspect that there’s going to be increasing pressure from the US for us to back off from any increasing engagement with China,” said former Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding, who helped bring Chinese investments into the Caribbean country.In the United States, meanwhile, COSCO has investments with local partners in container terminals at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about COSCO’s US investments.In Australia, US private equity firm Cerberus, which was founded by US Deputy Secretary of Defence Stephen Feinberg, has shown interest in buying the lease for Darwin Port, a senior executive of the port’s Chinese operator Landbridge said in May.Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to return the strategic northern port to local ownership and reiterated during a visit to China in July that the government’s position was very clear about wanting Australian ownership.Albanese’s office referred Reuters to his previous comments.Feinberg has not been involved in any discussions or decisions regarding any acquisitions his former company may be interested in, a US defence official said when asked for comment.Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been scrutinising China’s port ownership since the end of president Joe Biden’s term, a US port official familiar with the matter said.Speaking in February, Carlos Gimenez, chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, said: “America cannot, and will not, stand idly by while Communist China continues to undermine our interests at maritime ports.” — Reuters",https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2025/09/20/359481.JPG,N,,2025-09-21 01:57:52.508197

A new report from the nonprofit Rewiring America suggests home energy upgrades like solar power, batteries and heat pumps can offset the electricity demand from data centers.

The report cites data from the firm Aterio that the grid will need 93 gigawatts of additional power by 2029 for data centers that are announced or currently under construction. That’s about as much power as the state of California. Researchers at Rewiring America, which advocates for renewable energy and electrifying transportation and home appliances, estimate that installing rooftop solar, at-home batteries and upgrading electric heating and air conditioning could yield enough electricity gains to meet 100% of the data center demand.

The nonprofit has spent $500,000 on lobbying firms so far in 2025, according to OpenSecrets.

Cora Wyent, head of research and data science at Rewiring America, told Straight Arrow News the present moment is a “crossroads in the energy transition,” adding that “we have a choice to make about how we meet that increase in electricity demand.”

Across America, utility companies are asking state regulators to approve rate increases. Many are also making plans to build new gas power plants to meet demand from data centers. Instead of relying on new power plants, Wyent said she hopes to spark a conversation about investing in households as essential energy infrastructure, which could save consumers money. Some analysts, however, expressed doubts that home energy upgrades can make a difference against data center demand.

How did Rewiring America conduct its analysis?

Rewiring America built its findings on a state-by-state analysis of residential electricity demand and grid capacity. The organization examined the peak electricity demand on the grid and calculated how household upgrades could reduce that load.

The researchers then modeled three types of high-efficiency heat pump installations: upgrading electric resistance heating, replacing central air conditioning and converting electric resistance water heaters to heat pump water heaters. For each state, they determined which upgrade would deliver the most grid capacity and used that as their heat pump solution.

For solar and storage, the analysis modeled adding a five-kilowatt solar system to every American home with a suitable roof — about 81% of single-family homes nationally — and paired it with a home battery roughly the size of a Tesla Powerwall. The report calculated how much these installations could reduce stress on the grid during peak demand by generating and storing electricity during off-peak hours, then discharging it when demand surges.

“There’s a solution to the capacity needs that data centers have on the grid that can be widely beneficial to households across the country,” Wyent said.

‘No way you can do it fast enough’

Although experts agree that there are benefits to energy efficiency upgrades and distributed resources like batteries and rooftop solar, the report’s conclusion that these upgrades can meet data center demand has been met with skepticism.

“It seems like you’re swimming against a really big current,” Doug Sheridan, a veteran of the pipeline industry and managing director of EnergyPoint Research. “There’s no way you can do it fast enough,” Sheridan told SAN, expressing doubts over how fast home batteries and solar can be installed.

Sheridan also pointed out that many of the policies Rewiring America supports, such as drivers switching to electric vehicles and converting gas furnaces to heat pumps, will also drive up demand for electricity.

Justin Kirkpatrick, an environmental economist and professor at Michigan State University, said solar combined with sufficient battery storage is among the most cost-effective ways to power new data centers. But for that purpose, he said it’s more efficient to build solar and storage in a centralized fashion.

“Is it more efficient to put eight solar panels on 100 houses or put 800 solar panels in the field next to the data center, right by the battery?” Kirkpatrick told SAN.

However, Kirkpatrick does think households can play a role in reducing peak load on the grid through demand response programs. These are utility-run programs where customers can get money back on their electrical bill by voluntarily reducing their electricity consumption during peak demand.

“Every household has a price for reducing their demand,” Kirkpatrick said. “That is an area where households have a role.”

How would energy upgrades be financed?

Big Tech is already making major investments in power generation. Wyent said the tech industry could pay for energy infrastructure that also directly benefits homeowners. Under this model, data center developers would cover about 50% of heat pump costs or 30% of solar and battery installations, with homeowners paying the remainder.

Some utility companies are charging higher rates to large customers such as data centers. As an alternate model, Wyent said the utilities could offer a portion of new revenues toward incentives for household upgrades rather than utility-scale projects.

The report comes as federal tax credits for home energy efficiency and rooftop solar are set to expire at the end of this year, while grid-scale renewable projects retain longer-term incentives.

“We think that one potential source of funding is from hyperscalers and utilities looking for capacity on the grid,” Wyent said.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2150184875_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 17:00:53.887820

Europe and Asia Are Key Markets

The Netherlands was the second-largest buyer, taking in 387 million barrels (9.9%), while other major European buyers included the UK, Spain, and France. These exports often serve as inputs for refining hubs or redistribution across the continent.

Meanwhile, Asian countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, and India also ranked highly—each importing over 150 million barrels.

Broad Global Reach

While the top 10 countries accounted for a majority of exports, U.S. oil reached almost 150 countries. Even smaller nations like Togo, Belize, and Latvia made the list.

Why Does the U.S. Export Oil While Still Importing It?

At first glance, it may seem contradictory for the U.S. to export over half of its oil production while continuing to import oil, especially from Canada. But this is a result of differences in crude oil types, refinery configurations, and global market dynamics.

Most U.S. oil production is light, sweet crude, while many American refineries were built to handle heavier, sour grades. Additionally, some U.S. refineries are located closer to foreign markets than to domestic demand centers. As a result, oil flows both in and out of the country to optimize refining efficiency, logistics, and economic returns.

In total, 55% of U.S. oil production was exported.

Historical Precedents: Lessons from WWII Mobilization

The U.S. industrial mobilization during World War II offers a blueprint for understanding the long-term economic benefits of strategic industrial policy. Government-led construction of war production plants in the 1940s spurred a 30% increase in manufacturing employment and a 10% rise in wages in treated regions, with lasting effects on population growth and median family earnings US economic policy in WW2 shaped regional development | VoxDev[ 2 ]. These plants, often staffed by unskilled workers, not only fueled wartime success but also catalyzed regional development. For example, counties with war production facilities saw a 20% higher population growth and a 7–8% increase in median earnings by the postwar decades US economic policy in WW2 shaped regional development | VoxDev[ 2 ]. This historical precedent underscores how targeted industrial investment can create durable economic value—a lesson echoed in today's CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

Modern Policy Tailwinds: CHIPS, IRA, and Reshoring Incentives

The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the IRA are reshaping U.S. manufacturing through a combination of tax credits, grants, and regulatory incentives. The CHIPS Act alone has spurred over $30 billion in private-sector investments across 23 projects, projected to create 115,000 jobs and position the U.S. to produce 30% of the world's leading-edge chips by 2032 Two Years Later: Funding from CHIPS and Science Act Creating Quality Jobs, Growing Local Economies[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the IRA has catalyzed a 305% surge in manufacturing investment since 2022, with $89 billion in new projects announced, including $133 billion in clean energy and electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing How the Inflation Reduction Act sparked a clean energy boom[ 4 ]. These policies are not merely stimulative but transformative, embedding conditions such as workforce development and domestic sourcing to align industrial growth with national security and sustainability goals.

Conclusion: A New Industrial Era

The confluence of historical precedents and modern policy innovation is redefining U.S. manufacturing. Just as WWII mobilization laid the groundwork for postwar prosperity, today's industrial policies are fostering a resilient, technology-driven industrial base. For investors, the key lies in aligning with sectors that combine policy support, technological adoption, and long-term demand—such as semiconductors, automation, and clean energy. While challenges remain, the strategic opportunities are clear: a reshored, digitized, and decarbonized manufacturing sector poised for decades of growth.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758366353420.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-20 18:00:44.294338

Now, a congressman from Illinois is pushing back.

""The reason why electricity prices are going up is because that clean energy is not being allowed to come online, not that it exists,"" said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi.

Krishnamoorthi stating that are ""driving up energy bills for Illinoisans"" and asked for more support with clean energy, not less.

""It doesn't make any sense to remove electricity or the supply of electricity from the grid. That is just a dumb policy. We need as much supply as possible to drive down prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

He said that energy demand is rising due to overall usage going up, and also because of data centers being built.

But, he said with Trump's insistence on stopping wind and solar energy projects, supply for that energy is not able to keep up.

And, Illinois families will bear the consequences, possibly seeing their energy bills go up by an average of $180 per year.

He also said this will impact the local economy by causing 20,000 to 30,000 people who work for wind/solar projects to lose their jobs.

""Think about your neighbors who are working on these projects...I can't tell you how many good paying union jobs, for instance, are related to the construction of these projects,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""The loss of those jobs also hurt our local economy. So, in so many ways, he's [Trump] making the affordability crisis worse right now.""

Krishnamoorthi said that by staying in the wind/solar market, it could help the U.S. stay ahead in the global market.

""If we don't do these projects, we seed leadership to the Chinese Communist Party, which is trying to eat our lunch. They are trying to own the entire market for renewables around the world,"" said Krishnamoorthi. ""Now, we actually have a fighting chance of defeating them in this competition for renewables around the world because we're starting to develop our own technology. New indigenous supply chains are growing and emerging in the U.S., but they're unfortunately getting knee capped by the Trump administration's approach, which doesn't make any sense in the world.""

Trump has changed and lessened with the which Krishnamoorthi argues doesn't make sense, since fossil fuels also rely on help from the government.

""What I can say is that there are subsidies for fossil fuels that also exist that deprive the federal government of important revenues, because those interests are very powerful. So, let's just be honest about what is the true cost of fossil fuel exploration...if fossil fuel interests or anybody else, is allowed to successfully remove these tax credits, they may profit, but it's going to be at our expense,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

But he wants to be clear his stance is overall more energy on the grid.

""You don't have to be against having a home that's powered by natural gas or driving a car that uses gasoline to also be in favor of wind and solar and other types of energy coming online. If you have more of everything, then we have lower prices,"" said Krishnamoorthi.

Beyer, a respected industry figure and independent director since September 2023, stepped down on September 18, 2025, to assume the role of Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management at the U.S. Department of the Interior. Her departure, while framed as a loss of regulatory expertise, raises questions about PTEN's future direction and market perception.

Strategic Realignment: Filling a Regulatory Vacuum?

Beyer's tenure on PTEN's board was marked by her influence on energy policy and workforce development, as highlighted by CEO Andy Hendricks in a company statementPatterson-UTI Energy Congratulates Leslie Beyer following her confirmation as Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management[ 1 ]. Her new federal role, which oversees mineral leasing and environmental compliance, positions her to shape policies directly impacting PTEN's operations in oil and gas drilling. This creates a potential regulatory “feedback loop,” where Beyer's federal decisions could indirectly affect PTEN's access to permits or operational frameworks.

However,

Yet, the energy sector's regulatory uncertainty—exacerbated by shifting federal priorities—could pressure PTEN to appoint a successor with comparable policy acumen.

So obviously, the conversation today was Texas Tech vs Utah.","Transcript

John: Hello and welcome to The Daily Utah Chronicle podcast “The Home Stretch: Sports Edition.” My name is John Leone, sports editor of The Daily Utah Chronicle. I’m here with my assistant editor, Collyn Cowles, and we’re going to be previewing the Utah-Texas Tech matchup. This is probably the biggest home game, if not game in general, Utah’s had in 2+ seasons, and we’re excited to cover it. Collyn, what are your thoughts?

Collyn: Yeah, so Texas Tech is coming to town. They’re ranked 17th in the nation, and Utah is currently ranked 16th in the nation. We got the the honor of getting Big Noon Kickoff. So we’ll get the likes of Urban Meyer and Dave Portnoy and all those other guys being being on campus tomorrow. It’ll be big for the school. The last event that happened like that was College Game Day a few years ago. It should be just the fact this is there for their first conference game of the season. For both teams, it just should just kind of set the standpoint of what either of these two teams are going to do for the rest of the year. If you don’t know anything about those odds, that just pretty much tells you these two teams are the Big 12 powerhouses. Like last season, we didn’t see Arizona State get into that powerhouse spot until like the last few weeks of the season. So the fact that we have the top two teams facing off against each other in week four. It’s pretty cool — on a side note, what’s your approach to this game? It’s like you said, it’s one of the biggest games that the U has had in a few seasons. So what’s your approach on it?

John: This has potential to be the Big 12 Game of the Year, and it’s fortunate that we’re getting it this early, because it comes at a time where there aren’t a ton of marquee games going on this week. I mean, there’s Florida-Miami, which is a good one. There’s Illinois-Indiana, another good one. But none are quite getting the attention of this Utah-Texas Tech game. And I think one reason for that is obviously both teams are 3-0, Utah’s ranked 16th, Texas Tech 17th, and we don’t entirely know how good these teams are. They then went on to play Kent State and beat them 62-14 in a game which they were ahead 48-0 at halftime. And then last week, they played Oregon State in another home game and beat them 45-14 and they were up 28-0 at halftime. So in first times alone, Texas Tech is outscoring their opponents 123-0 in three games, which seems rather unbelievable. And while you consider the strength of schedule and see okay, well, they’ve played Pine Bluff, Kent State and Oregon State … it’s still impressive what they’ve been doing offensively. Pine Bluff and Kent State are 1-2 each, Oregon State’s 0-3. And so this will be the first time we really get to see Texas Tech’s offense operate against some sort of a defense with a pulse, if you will.

Collyn: Yeah, 100% and I think this game is going to test both quarterbacks. All the quarterbacks and seeing who can do more. Obviously, on paper, Texas Tech is known for their defensive line. They have the No. 3 D-line in the country. And for Utah, on paper, our best asset is our O-line. So we, we have the No. 2 best O-line in the country. So this for being week three, and getting the top O-line and the top D-line in the country, being able to go off and showcase affect, like, the college game itself? Like, yes, our fans are going to show up. We are going to be rowdy. We have Sorority Row right outside the stadium. It’s going to be packed. But if this was a 5:00 game instead of a noon game, I think it would be totally different. What do you think on that?

John: Absolutely, I think, I mean, like you said, Utah’s fans will always show up. They have always shown up. And I think there’s something about playing that early in the morning, your fans are never going to be quite as rowdy, quite as loud at 10 a.m. as they would be, say, at 8 p.m., or maybe not even 8 p.m. — 6 p.m. But I still think it’ll be a tough road environment for Tech. Behren Morton obviously struggles on the road. If you take a look at his splits, he does not perform under pressure. I guess his home passing grade is an 80.4, which is great. They’ve played all three games at home this year, and clearly he’s lived up to that with those stats that you mentioned. But his away passing grade takes a huge dip, drops from 80.4 down to 59.0. In an interview with NaQuari Rogers, he was asked kind of about the playbooks, and if they’ve really shown much of what they have buried deep in the books for when they need it most. And obviously he’s on the offensive side of the ball, so he probably can’t speak for the defense as much as the offense, but he said they’ve shown pretty much nothing. So they’ve been saving up all these plays and they’re going to pull out all the stops they can to beat Texas Tech.

Collyn: Yeah, 100% and what I’ve what I’ve been noticing this last week with all of these sports shows that have come out and been talking about this game, that’s all I’ve been seeing. Good college football, game day, Big Noon Kickoff, all the Barstool guys. Everyone is talking about this game. And my concern is, yes, you look on paper and it’s O-line versus D-line. But I don’t like how the media is dissing our defense. I don’t like how the media is dissing our defense. We have a guy, one of our cornerbacks, who’s [got] two interceptions, one of them being a pick six, almost having three interceptions. We have another one of our D-line. John Daly has five sacks on the year for 13 solo sacks. So yes, it’s O-line versus D-line, but I think Morton is going to get pressured a lot, because of just who they’ve played and the amount of physicality we’re going to show him right off this start. It’s not like it’s we’re just going to rely on our old line to get to lead us through, or we’re going to rely on Devon [Dampier]. I think our defense is going to come up huge in this game.

John: Yeah, I totally agree. I think when you take a look at quarterbacks, opposing quarterbacks who make their first start at Rice-Eccles Stadium — not that this is Morton’s first start, but it’ll be his first game playing at Rice-Eccles — when you take a look at those stats, you’ve got guys like Jayden Daniels and Jared Goff and some serious NFL quarterbacks that are making their name in the NFL, who came to Rice-Eccles Stadium as college quarterbacks and totally got rocked. I remember Jared Goff threw five interceptions. Jayden Daniels had … it was below 20 yards of total offensive production, passing and rushing when he played here [for] Arizona State. And Morgan Scalley knows how to dial it up against quarterbacks and make them feel uneasy. To your point, the defense have looked great so far, but it’s kind of the same deal with Texas Tech. We can’t really tell how good Utah is until they play this game. Obviously they had that road win at UCLA which looked amazing at the time, but you’ve seen how UCLA has [taken a] nosedive … they fired their coach, and they’re just spiraling. And then [the Utes] won against Cal Poly — who, FCS opponent, hard to say. And then that Wyoming game, which we’ll get into a little bit, but [there were] some highs and some lows from that game. Wyoming’s no slouch. They’re a solid team, and I think they’re going to do some good things this year, but same deal as Texas Tech: Utah has more road experience, but that’s irrelevant in this game as Texas Tech will be coming to Utah. But the defense has been great. Utah opponents are averaging just over eight points per game, keeping them in the single digits. Like you mentioned, John Henry Daley: five sacks, 13 solo tackles. He’s just wreaking havoc back there. I think Logan Fano is going to be back on his other side at the end, which will be a big addition to this defense … he was out against Cal Poly, and then played limited against Wyoming, but he should be back in full force. I think the main question for Utah is the secondary. You mentioned Jackson Bennee, he’s been great. Couple interceptions. I think the corners on the outside have struggled the most of any unit on defense thus far. Elijah Davis has primarily played as the corner one, and he hasn’t exactly shown a lot to give us confidence ahead of this air raid — not “air raid,” but pass heavy-style offense from Texas Tech.

Collyn: Yeah. They’re 100% going to be throwing the ball to Coy Eakin as much as they can. This kid’s got 11 receptions for 230 yards. So yeah, they’re going to be throwing it to him a lot. What I do like is the way our offense has been running this year, with a lot of RPO, run-heavy. In Wyoming, we saw a lot of pressure on Devon — and that would be my biggest takeaway from this, is just kind of protecting that pocket, protecting him, making sure he’s got enough time. With New Mexico, his O-line was atrocious and he’d only been sacked a handful of times. So I think he’s in good hands in this game, I think the fans are going to back this team and we’re going to come out hot. The only takeaway I saw from Wyoming was the amount of pressure on him. But Wyoming has really good defense. They’re very defensive-heavy, there’s only been one year that people remember them having a good offense, we all know that year … That’d be my biggest thing, just protecting him and making sure he’s got that pocket presence. Because if he’s getting pressured a lot and he has to scramble and he has to dish it out to Wayshawn [Parker], then we can’t afford to lose those 4 or 5 yards every time he gets pressured.

John: Yeah, I agree. I think, like you mentioned, his O-line at New Mexico was abysmal. They had a bottom five pass blocking grade as a unit, and Dampier somehow managed to only get sacked four times on the season, which, in 13 games is insane. He’s been sacked twice this year, which it doesn’t feel like he has at all. I think one of those sacks against Wyoming was … it wasn’t really a sack, it was more just Dampier running around and ended up getting tackled just behind the line of scrimmage. But Dampier is as good as anyone in the country at improvising. And his pocket presence is truly one of a kind. I think Texas Tech is coming into this game thinking “Oh yeah, we’ll be able to get to him, bring him down …” Getting to Dampier is one thing; bringing him down is another. And that dude is shifty. He’s been compared to Kyler Murray and some of those other guys that have really high end, short, short field quickness, where they can just make cuts and adjustments on the fly. Look for that. Dampier is … like you mentioned, his passing game has taken a big step forward. And we’ll keep harping on it: no competition — not no competition, but sparse competition thus far. His 73% completion percentage, seven touchdowns, zero picks, is already such an improvement. Last year at New Mexico, he was barely above 50% completion percentage, and he threw 12 picks and 12 interceptions. So that ratio wasn’t good … I mean, Morton already has 11 touchdowns in one pick, in three games. Dampier had 12 and 12 all last year. But this year, he’s got seven and zero. So you can see that he’s made it a priority to take care of the ball. And one guy that’s helped him with this is Ryan Davis, his former teammate. Davis is a receiver, obviously transferred in with [offensive coordinator Jason] Beck and Dampier from New Mexico. He had 10 receptions versus Wyoming last week, and really has kind of solidified himself as the go-to guy for Dampier in the past game. Jason Beck has spread the wealth across the offense very heavily throughout the first three games. I mean, he’s throwing tight ends out there at Wildcat. Former quarterbacks at Wildcat … you know, you got Nate Johnson, Hunter Andrews, NaQuari Rogers, Wayshawn Parker, all these guys catching snaps, and that doesn’t even include the main guy, Dampier. So, I mean, Jason Beck is getting creative at OC.

Collyn: Yeah. This game is — it’s, to your comment earlier, we’re going to pull all the tricks out of the book this week. Those three games, I’d say you saw a lot of our offense against UCLA, a lot of big plays. But, the Cal Poly, Wyoming games, those were more focusing on getting first downs and getting to our designated spots, kind of perfecting those 5-10 yard plays. But if you look at Texas Tech’s side, I would recommend you take our first three games and their first three games. I mean, we have UCLA, Cal Poly and Wyoming … and compared to Pine Bluff, Oregon State and Kent — I mean, they shouldn’t even have gotten scored on in any three of those games.

John: And they haven’t even played on the road yet.

Collyn: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We’re almost a month into the season. In 10 days, it’ll be their month mark. So yeah, this is going to be a tough matchup for them. I wanted to bring up the amount of money that Texas Tech has spent. They have spent over $25 million on this roster. And a culprit to that was giving a lot of their money to their star transfer from USC, Quinten Joyner, and before the season even started, he had jacked up his knee and he’s out for the year. So, what’s your take on the college football aspect and being able to see a team like Texas Tech spend the most amount of money this year on their roster, but not even be able to get their full resource out of that, with Quinten Joyner being out all year?

John: Yeah. I mean, obviously never, never want to wish an injury on anyone, that sucks for Joyner. He came in, obviously out of USC, [and] was a terrific running back. People were surprised he went to Tech, but, you know, he undoubtedly got a bag to do it. So yeah, he’s out for the year, but another place that Texas Tech spent a ton of their money on is their defensive line, and it looks like that’s paying off for them so far. But to your question about the contracts and teams being able to spend: I’ve seen numbers in the [NIL] ballpark of $25 million to even $55 million, which is just a crazy number to be thrown out there for college football. But you know, Texas Tech’s taking advantage of it, and credit to them for going after it. I know they have a former player … I don’t know his name off the top of my head, but he’s sold two oil companies, and his main goal is to make Texas Tech good again. So obviously, with the new rules into place, they won’t be able to spend this much in the future. But for now, it’s entertaining. We can say that.

Collyn: Yeah, the gentleman you’re talking of is Cody Campbell, yes. So yeah, he’s like some oil guru, and he donated over $55 million to Texas Tech’s NIL fund [sic — see editor’s note] So, yeah, and that’s not just to football. I think fans see that and they think, “Oh, that’s just for football.” No, that’s for the entirety of their athletics program. That’s scholarships across all sports: women’s, soccer, volleyball, hockey, whatever it may be, basketball. And then, you know, majority of it goes to football, majority of it goes to those training facilities and and travel expenses and all the fun stuff that fans really don’t see, right? But I mean, even to Utah’s side, we’ve spent roughly around $15 million, if anyone were wondering. And I don’t know, I like the way our team is looking, without having that headline of where we have a guy giving us $50 million … you know? I would rather the grit, instead of having money talk.

John: Totally. Built, not bought, as they like to say. Yeah, big game here. Collyn, what’s your prediction?

Collyn: Um, honestly, I think we’ll know the way this game is going to go by halftime. I don’t think I’ve seen a lot of pundits talk about this game going to the wire, this game going to the last few seconds. I don’t think it’s going to happen. I think it’s going to be an easy win for Utah. Few touchdowns. It’s going to be a little low-scoring. I have them winning 24-10. I think we’re gonna hold Texas Tech, force the run, show up on the D-line, protect Devon, and we have to convert on field goals. We did not talk about that today, but we have to convert our field goals. If we get an attempt from 30 yards out, we have to convert on these. Every point counts, and I think we’ll know who’s going to win by halftime.

John: I like that. I more or less agree. I think Utah has historically been a second half team. But the way I see it, there are three keys to victory for Utah. I think number one is, believe it or not, establishing a run game. This Texas Tech defensive line has been stout against the run so far, and I think Utah is averaging over 200 rushing yards per game. It’s something crazy. I have the number here: they are averaging 260 rush yards per game, which is crazy, more than Texas Tech, and I’m sure it’s up there in the country, in terms of the highest. Establish the run game; that’ll help you be able to control key number two, which is managing the clock. I think Utah loves to go on those long, extended drives, give their defense a break. They’ve had two drives of 20 plays and 19 plays, just in three games alone. So if they can get some drives like that, go in and just kind of demoralize Texas Tech’s defense, I think that’ll be huge. And manage the clock, keep their offense off the field. And then key number three I had was defense. Defend the pass with pressure and coverage. You’re going to have to have an element of both of those in this game. I think pressure is something that, like I said, Scalley is going to be dialing up, and he’s going to do everything in his power to make Morton uncomfortable. And with Morton kind of putting the ball up for grabs more or less when he’s under pressure, if Utah can come down with a couple interceptions or force a fumble, that’ll be huge, because I think the offenses will look good in this game, if I had to guess. Overall, I think Utah’s able to do these things. It may not look pretty at times, but my prediction is Utah-35, Texas Tech-20. As always, go Utes, and it’s gonna be a fun one. So get there early, get loud. It’s gonna be intense.

Collyn: Yeah, 100%. And to close out this episode, we’ll just kind of give a basic rundown for fans of what to expect for this week, for events happening on campus that students can attend. So obviously, the conversation today was Texas Tech vs Utah. Kickoff is at 10 a.m. on Saturday, tomorrow. Fans can show up for the Big Noon Kickoff at 4 a.m., so the students can start showing up to the public queue area at 4 a.m., fans can enter the set area at 5:30 a.m. There’s going to be food, music prizes and all kinds of different contests that fans can enter themselves into, which also starts at 5:30 a.m. The Barstool show starts at 7 a.m. The annual Ute walk is 7:45 a.m. and then the Big Noon Kickoff show starts at 8 a.m. So if you’re looking to show up, it is recommended to be there early. They’re giving out — first 500 people to get there get shirts, free food, gift cards … all kinds of different stuff they’re giving out to fans. So show up to that early. Be there. Be loud. On another note, for athletics this week, women’s soccer will be traveling down to Texas to face TCU, Texas Christian University, tonight at 6 p.m. TCU is ranked 14th in the nation with a 6-1-0 record. They look very hot. They are very strong. And I think this game is going to determine our women’s soccer program and just kind of put our season in line. It’s the first Big 12 game for the season for the ladies, and the team is led by Kelly Bullock. She has three goals on the year, and she’s just been lights out. So show up! Watch your Utes. Let’s go to these games. The ladies will be back home for the second game of the Big 12 conference against Cincinnati on Sept. 24. And then another sport in fall athletics is women’s volleyball. This week, we are in California and San Luis Obispo. We have a set against Cal Poly today and then one against Vincent St. Mary’s tomorrow. So for athletics this week, just make sure we’re staying aware of our fellow students and showing up for our athletes, and 100% be there for Texas Tech. Show up. Show why the MUSS is the MUSS, and go Utes!

John: Yes, sir, go Utes. This has been our second episode of The Home Stretch this year. Collyn, thank you for coming on. We’re excited to bring you guys more previews, more recaps of football, soccer, volleyball, whatever sports are going on. So, again this is The Home Stretch, presented by The Daily Utah Chronicle.

It can now draw down $100 million from Generate Capital, a leading infrastructure investment firm.
“We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing.
About Soluna Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: SLNH) Soluna is on a mission to make renewable energy a global superpower, using computing as a catalyst.

It can now draw down $100 million from Generate Capital, a leading infrastructure investment firm.

John Belizaire, CEO of Soluna, said an initial $12.6 million draw will fund refinancing and construction of active data center projects, with additional capital support for Soluna’s one gigawatt and expanding pipeline.

“We believe this deal with Generate primes Soluna for scale,” Belizaire said. “We’re not just growing our current projects, we’re building new ones wherever wasted renewable energy can be converted into valuable high performance computing.

Belizaire said the deal with Generate reflects a different kind of infrastructure financing, one focused on capital efficiency, modular growth, and disciplined execution.

“We’ve known the Generate team for quite some time before partnering; they understand our business, our team, and our industry well, making them so much more than just investors. We see them as strategic partners going forward,” Belizaire said.

Generate was represented by Vinson & Elkins LLP. Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, O’Melveny & Myers LLP, and Lowenstein Sandler LLP represented Soluna.

Project Kati is Soluna’s largest renewable computing site yet. “One hundred and sixty six MW of clean, high-performance computing is on its way to Willacy County,” the company said. “It will deliver 83 MW of clean Bitcoin hosting capacity by early 2026, with Galaxy as the first customer. It will expand to 166 MW in two phases, supporting both Bitcoin hosting and AI/HPC workloads. And it will bring jobs, investment, and long-term economic benefits to Willacy County.”

Soluna is a digital infrastructure company that builds modular data centers that transform curtailed or underutilized renewable energy into compute power for energy-intensive, batchable applications such as Bitcoin mining and AI. By colocating with clean energy producers, Soluna supports a cleaner grid while delivering cost-effective, sustainable infrastructure to enterprises.

Generate has invested over $2.4 billion across sustainable infrastructure credit since inception, making the partnership with Soluna a natural fit. Generate’s institutional experience and capabilities as an asset owner and operator enable it to deliver differentiated value, enabling the partnership to go beyond dollars invested to strategic collaboration.

""Soluna's vision for turning underutilized renewable energy into scalable computing power aligns with our belief in infrastructure that solves real-world challenges,"" said Ryan Miller, principal at Generate Capital. ""We're excited to support their growth through a flexible credit solution and continue our leadership at the nexus of digital and energy infrastructure.”

Belizaire said the new financing package from Generate follows over $30 million in funding raised earlier in 2025 from Galaxy Digital, Spring Lane Capital, and a recent public offering. He said the new agreement adds further momentum to Soluna’s execution roadmap, as the recent addition of 150 MW Projects Gladys and 100 MW Fei pushes the company past one gigawatt of renewable computing capacity.

Belizaire said this milestone builds on the recent 48 MW expansion underway at Project Dorothy 2 and the start of construction of Project Kati 1. He said Soluna intends to expand its computing offerings beyond Bitcoin mining to include AI workloads, reflecting the growing demand for green computing across various industries.

""Soluna's vision for turning underutilized renewable energy into scalable computing power aligns with our belief in infrastructure that solves real-world challenges,"" said Ryan Miller, principal at Generate Capital. ""We're excited to support their growth through a flexible credit solution and continue our leadership at the nexus of digital and energy infrastructure.”

Belizaire said recent expansions of partnerships with Blockware, Compass Mining, Galaxy Digital, and other Hyperscale miners further underscore the company’s growing traction and operational maturity.

Among the highlights of the scalable financing, he said, are:

A credit facility of up to $100 million to be used for refinancing and construction of Soluna’s data center projects.

An initial $12.6 million draw will be used to refinance Dorothy 1A and Dorothy 2. This unlocks equity capital for Soluna and Spring Lane.

A delayed draw facility of $22.9 million will include continued funding for the Dorothy 2 project and support for the Project Kati 1 data center.

An additional uncommitted $64.5 million accordion facility would support Soluna’s growing renewable-powered pipeline and fund AI-related long-lead equipment procurement.

Credit facilities and security are limited to a portfolio of projects financed by Soluna and Spring Lane Capital, are limited recourse, and do not have parent company guarantees.

Generate received warrants for the right to purchase 4 million shares of Soluna common stock anda board observer right.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week.
2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules.
“The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.
Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.","NEW YORK (AP) — Thousands of activists marched down Park Avenue and turned down Billionaires’ Row toward Trump Tower in New York Saturday to “Make Billionaires Pay,” calling for climate justice, democracy, free speech, gender equality, a stop to the Trump’s immigration crackdown and a ceasefire in Gaza.

Their signs and reasons for taking to the streets were diverse, but many said the march highlighted a common theme behind the issues they stood for: that a small, elite class of the wealthy and powerful consistently prioritized profits over people’s lives.

“I don’t see them as movements. I don’t see them as organizations. I just see humanity. We are all on this Earth. This is our mother,” said Mahaishuwea, whose name means Eagle Woman in the language of the Hidatsa tribe, which is based in North Dakota.

As marchers gathered, she spoke about her personal experiences growing up on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation, where she survived cancer. Standing in front of investment management company Blackstone’s headquarters, she connected the violent history of colonization and resource extraction on Indigenous lands to the present-day greed of the powerful. “They have a sickness,” she said.

Demonstrations have been planned around the world this week ahead of the United Nations General Assembly and New York Climate Week. Despite years of international conferences, negotiations and treaties, countries have continued to increase their emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, fueling more frequent and intense extreme weather events. 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the Trump administration has been working to roll back foundational environmental rules. This has freed the way for oil and coal industries to pollute more while presenting more roadblocks to wind and solar energy development.

Tamika Middleton, managing director of the Women’s March, said that although it sometimes can be challenging to bring together people who are passionate about different causes, this year the intersections between them felt clearer. “The climate crisis, economic fights and immigrant fights are all really one big fight,” she said.

The crowd stretched for over four city blocks and passed by luxury stores like Louis Vuitton, Bergdorf Goodman and Tiffany & Co. Some carried enormous papier-mache puppets of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Several grabbed the edges of a 160-foot “climate polluters bill” calling out the economic damages wrought by extreme weather events made worse by the carbon emissions of major polluting companies.

Others dressed as the Statue of Liberty, rang cowbells and waved flags with the Star Wars character Princess Leia or homemade signs inked in sharpie and paint. One simply read: “Free Kimmel.”

Tatiana Cruz was one of the people holding up the puppet of Elon Musk. “Eat the rich, that’s the main message,” she said, smiling. But she also explained that this was her first year actively protesting more after two of her friends were deported after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since then, she has gotten more involved in movements for migrant rights, Palestinian liberation and fighting climate change.

“The monster up top is similar in a lot of different scenarios,” she said.

Julia Donahue-Wait had come out from the South Bronx with a group of families who had started organizing together and also described the many causes present at the march as interconnected. Her young daughter Eurydice has grown up on picket lines and helped with the poster painting. Behind her, another protester held a sign: “Our work is love,” it read.

“It’s all people without power taking it back,” Donahue-Wait said. “What we say to the kids is, we have safety and we need to stand up for people who don’t have safety.”

Mahaishuwea said although many people are scared, she thought it was important to show up.

Her 12-year-old daughter is back at home. But she wants to teach future generations how to speak up, and “to show people we’re not afraid,” she said.

At the end of the march, protesters held a five-minute moment of silence during which they sat in front of the Trump International Hotel and Tower.

From the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Northwest, ports are being reimagined as hubs for offshore wind, hydrogen production, and electrified logistics. This transformation is not merely environmental—it is economic. According to a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), expanding port capacity by one ship can generate returns exceeding costs at 15 out of 51 U.S. ports, with Gulf Coast facilities leading the pack due to their strategic role in global tradeMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. For investors, the question is no longer if to act, but how to capitalize on this momentum.

Case Studies in Port Electrification and Energy Innovation

The Port of Long Beach's microgrid deployment project exemplifies the potential of port electrification. By integrating resilient energy infrastructure, the port has reduced fossil fuel dependence while enhancing air quality for surrounding communitiesMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. Similarly, the Georgia Ports Authority's adoption of electrified ERTG cranes has set a benchmark for efficiency, demonstrating how ports can adapt to new operational demands without sacrificing throughputMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ]. These projects align with Arup's assertion that ports are becoming “key enablers of the energy transition,” supporting offshore wind deployment and sustainable fuel tradeWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

On the Gulf Coast, ExxonMobil's $21 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and carbon capture network underscore the region's dual focus on traditional and emerging energy systemsClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. Meanwhile, the Port of Houston's $105 million investment in electric cargo-handling equipment and shore power infrastructure—funded by the EPA's Clean Ports Program—highlights the federal government's role in accelerating decarbonizationClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. Such initiatives are not isolated; they reflect a broader trend of ports leveraging public-private partnerships to reposition underused assets.

Financial Returns and Yield Projections

The economic case for port redevelopment is compelling. A 2025 study by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) notes that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) has boosted annual port funding to $450 million, enabling upgrades that accommodate larger vessels and enhance multimodal connectivityUS Port Infrastructure[ 5 ]. These investments directly correlate with improved operational efficiency: the NBER found that expanding port capacity by one ship increases trade by 42% and reduces congestion by 4% at the host portMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ].

Renewable energy integration further amplifies returns. Research from the National Renewable Energy

(NREL) reveals that hybrid renewable systems—combining solar, marine energy, and storage—can cover 60% of a port's energy demand with payback periods under six yearsReturns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. For instance, the Port of Anacortes' $65 million EPA grant for microgrid development, supported by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), illustrates how electrification can unlock new revenue streams through grid services and energy salesMicrogrids Help Electrify Ports, Increase Reliability[ 1 ].

Challenges and Opportunities

Despite this optimism, challenges persist. Texas' renewable energy pipeline faced setbacks in 2025, with 9 gigawatts of projects canceled due to tariffs on solar panels and policy uncertaintyClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. However, grid reliability has paradoxically improved, with ERCOT reporting reduced summer emergency risks thanks to solar and battery storage deploymentsClean energy uncertainty rattles Texas project pipeline[ 3 ]. This duality—volatility in project pipelines versus tangible grid benefits—highlights the need for diversified strategies.

Louisiana and other Gulf Coast states offer a counterpoint. By redeveloping underutilized ports for non-freight activities—such as commercial fishing, recreation, and mixed-use development—ports like Seattle have generated $1.4 billion in economic outputReturns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. The Gulf Coast's $25 billion energy transition investments in 2025, including clean hydrogen and carbon capture, position the region to replicate this successWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

Long-Term Outlook and Investment Strategy

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects renewables will surpass natural gas as the primary electricity source by the mid-2030s, growing from 3.41 quadrillion BTUs (Quads) in 2024 to 14.8 Quads by 2050Returns to Port Infrastructure Investments | NBER[ 4 ]. For ports, this means infrastructure tailored to renewable energy—such as offshore wind staging areas and hydrogen export terminals—will become critical. The LSU Center for Energy Studies' 2025 Gulf Coast Energy Outlook reinforces this, noting the region's leadership in lower-emission energy productionWhy ports have a future as green energy hubs - Arup[ 2 ].

Investors should prioritize ports with:

1. Strategic Location: Proximity to offshore wind farms or hydrogen production clusters.

2. Policy Support: Access to federal grants (e.g., EPA's Clean Ports Program) and state incentives.

3. Diversified Revenue Streams: Non-freight activities that buffer against trade volatility.

Conclusion

The redevelopment of underutilized port assets is no longer a niche opportunity—it is a cornerstone of the U.S. energy transition. With Gulf Coast ports leading the charge, investors who act now can secure long-term yields through electrification, renewable integration, and infrastructure modernization.

Absolutely: Opinion,Katie Coyne,,,,,https://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/2025/09/19/nj-energy-strategy-could-drive-a-generation-out-opinion/86179624007/,"New Jersey imports around 35% of its electricity, thanks to delayed clean energy projects, such as offshore wind, and the closure of reliable energy plants.
But instead of expanding or reopening our reliable energy capacity or updating failing long-term plans, the 2019 New Jersey Energy Master Plan, or EMP, is stagnant.
And it will not just be the billion-dollar companies that are affected by New Jersey’s energy policy uncertainty.
Clean energy goals matter, but so do the people and employers trying to stay in New Jersey.
Right now, New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan is an obstacle to both.","New Jersey's Energy Master Plan aims for 100% clean electricity by 2035; however, the commendable goals within this plan may have the unintended consequence of making New Jersey even more unaffordable for the next generation. The impact doesn’t stop at higher utility bills. Facing rising energy costs, unreliable capacity and policy inconsistencies, New Jersey businesses are pulling back — reducing head count and slowing growth resulting in fewer local jobs for the next generation.

At the start of June 2025, New Jersey households experienced an increase in electricity rates of 17–20%, resulting in average monthly bills of approximately $183, which is about 30% above the national average. For an average resident, that’s another $20 to $28 every month, without any corresponding increase in income.

Ask yourself: Do you know anyone whose salary rose 20% this year?

We’re being told to electrify everything — our cars, our homes — but at the same time, we’re facing record-high costs and a grid clearly under strain. And with salaries not keeping pace, those expectations are especially unrealistic for those of us who are just starting out.

For young people trying to live and work in New Jersey, these energy mandates are structural barriers to building a life here in our home state. With student loans, rising rents and wages that don’t keep up, unpredictable energy bills are one more reason my generation often looks to other states for employment.

New Jersey imports around 35% of its electricity, thanks to delayed clean energy projects, such as offshore wind, and the closure of reliable energy plants. Meanwhile, PJM, New Jersey’s regional grid operator, forecasts an additional 39% increase in electricity demand by 2039, driven by the adoption of electric vehicles, home electrification, and the expansion of data infrastructure. My generation is expected to lead this electrification effort, without the infrastructure to support the shift.

The new energy demand levels will require a stable foundation of supply. But instead of expanding or reopening our reliable energy capacity or updating failing long-term plans, the 2019 New Jersey Energy Master Plan, or EMP, is stagnant. The EMP was due for a significant update in 2024, but it has been delayed without a final release date. Meanwhile, rules on emissions, EV sales, building electrification, and energy sources are advancing without formal modeling of their cost. This leaves many of us unsure whether the choices we’re pushed to make today will be even supported or relevant tomorrow.

In June, Amazon announced a $20 billion investment in two data center campuses in Pennsylvania, not New Jersey, despite both being in the same grid region. One site is co-located with a nuclear power plant, offering direct access to steady, affordable baseload power. Pennsylvania paired that with corporate tax reductions and a more transparent energy policy. The result? Thousands of jobs and billions in investment, just across the river. For young professionals, many are seeking to build careers in fast-growing industries such as AI or cloud services, making these lost opportunities increasingly difficult to ignore. As a result, Gen-Z workers will need to look outside of New Jersey to find them.

And it will not just be the billion-dollar companies that are affected by New Jersey’s energy policy uncertainty. Higher utility costs leave less room for hiring, investment, or wage growth for small businesses as well. A local salon, grocery store or restaurant can’t absorb a 20% jump in power costs without raising prices or cutting staff.

Clean energy goals matter, but so do the people and employers trying to stay in New Jersey. The state should pause the implementation of new mandates until the EMP is released and backed by transparent cost models. We need more certainty, not more pressure, especially for those just starting out.

For many of my generation, the decision to stay or leave will hinge on New Jersey’s job market and affordability. Right now, New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan is an obstacle to both.

“I very much want to engage in negotiations on an all-of-the-above permitting reform.
“If we work together on bipartisan permitting reform with the understanding that it includes clean energy, we pass it through Congress, and then the administration does it all except for the clean energy part, then we will look like a bunch of suckers,” Magaziner added.
As discussions continue, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats, also unveiled a possible framework for permitting reform.
HOUSE GOP INVOKES RENEWABLE ENERGY TO WIN DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR PERMITTING REFORM Their recommendations align closely with permitting reform legislation already introduced in the House by streamlining NEPA reviews, restricting judicial review, and prioritizing digitization.","Several Democrats have expressed interest in supporting these proposed reforms, as both sides of the aisle agree that environmental rules have made it too difficult to build in the United States. While Democrats generally do not share Republicans’ ambition of unlocking new fossil fuel production, they do wish to accelerate the permitting process for clean energy and traditional infrastructure projects in their districts. Some have even co-sponsored legislation introduced by their Republican colleagues.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) signed on to the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act introduced by House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman (R-AR) at the end of July.

This bill would overhaul and simplify the NEPA, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental effects of major actions and decisions relevant to their departments. It would also limit legal challenges to projects under the existing law.

In an apparent effort to bring more Democrats on board, the bill includes language that is agnostic toward energy sources and infrastructure projects — meaning accelerated reviews would apply to wind, solar, and fossil fuels.

Not all lawmakers, however, are convinced that language is enough to ensure renewables will see the benefits.

Rep. Seth Magaziner (D-RI), who has said he wants to reach a “yes” on bipartisan legislation, told the Washington Examiner that he is doubtful the White House would enforce accelerated permitting for renewables, given Trump’s recent crackdown on offshore wind.

“I very much want to engage in negotiations on an all-of-the-above permitting reform. But if the administration is just going to block clean energy projects that have their approvals from going forward, then how could we on our side assume that they are going to be negotiating in good faith?” Magaziner said, referring to the stop-work order issued for the Revolution Wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is roughly 80% complete.

“If we work together on bipartisan permitting reform with the understanding that it includes clean energy, we pass it through Congress, and then the administration does it all except for the clean energy part, then we will look like a bunch of suckers,” Magaziner added. “And we’re not, we’re not going to go for that. So we’re going to need to see some action from the administration that shows that we’re actually committed to an all-of-the-above energy strategy.”

Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA), who has also co-sponsored legislation focused on modernizing the permitting process, agreed, telling the Washington Examiner that he did not believe they could achieve Democratic consensus without assurance from the White House.

Peters pointed to changes made by the Trump administration that have made it more difficult to permit and approve a renewable energy project, such as requiring Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally sign off on proposals located on federal lands.

He described these obstacles as “anti-business” and said that ideologically driven policy will hurt the U.S.’s ability to secure enough power needed to beat China in the race for artificial intelligence.

While Republicans may have to cede to Democrats’ demands for accelerated permits for renewables, Peters said Democrats will have to do the same for natural gas to secure enough demand and lower energy prices for consumers.

Members on the right side of the aisle appear more optimistic about coming to a bipartisan agreement in the coming weeks and months.

“A lot of Democrats can come to the table, particularly when they understand that at the end of the day, we all actually want the same things,” Rep. Nick Begich (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner. “The regulations that have stymied traditional energy production in the United States are the same regulations that are stymying renewable energy production in the United States.”

Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s subcommittee on energy, said a final permitting bill will not necessarily be Republican or Democratic, given the widespread desire to build things faster.

He pointed to the Energy and Commerce Committee’s track record for advancing bipartisan bills, noting that the panel has put out more than any other in the House.

Latta told the Washington Examiner he is working on different pieces of legislation with Democrats right now, looking for bipartisan amendments to ensure they have the votes to advance a bill to the floor.

As discussions continue, the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of centrist Republicans and Democrats, also unveiled a possible framework for permitting reform.

HOUSE GOP INVOKES RENEWABLE ENERGY TO WIN DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR PERMITTING REFORM

Their recommendations align closely with permitting reform legislation already introduced in the House by streamlining NEPA reviews, restricting judicial review, and prioritizing digitization. It also aims to bolster the buildout of grid infrastructure to support new generation.

“Right now it takes years, even decades, for new green energy and other projects to get connected to the grid and start generating energy to meet demand,” Caucus co-Chairman Tom Suozzi (D-NY) said. “We need commonsense, bipartisan solutions to cut red tape, bring projects online faster, and make energy more affordable for American families.

They represent a balancing act in managing the transition from fossil fuels to green energy amid the challenge of climate change, while keeping energy costs manageable for consumers.
Newsom said legislation will bring down electricity costs for Californians by providing up to $60 billion in electricity bill refunds through an expanded California Climate Credit.
The legislation also aims to make energy more affordable by accelerating critical clean energy projects and expanding regional energy markets to improve grid reliability.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a sweeping package of bills on Friday charting the state's continuing transition to green energy, which includes an extension of the state's landmark cap-and-trade program.

The slate of six bills seeks to address energy affordability, the stabilization of petroleum markets, and reducing air pollution as part of California's acceleration toward a green job-generating economy. A statement from the Governor's Office said California's action comes as the Trump administration continues ""to gut decades-old, bipartisan American clean air protections and derail critical climate progress.""

The bills, which Newsom signed at the Morrison Planetarium at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco on Friday, were approved with bipartisan support in an extended session of the California legislature last weekend. They represent a balancing act in managing the transition from fossil fuels to green energy amid the challenge of climate change, while keeping energy costs manageable for consumers.

""After months of hard work with the Legislature, we have agreed to historic reforms that will save money on your electric bills, stabilize gas supply, and slash toxic air pollution — all while fast-tracking California's transition to a clean, green job-creating economy,"" Newsom said in a prepared statement.

Newsom said legislation will bring down electricity costs for Californians by providing up to $60 billion in electricity bill refunds through an expanded California Climate Credit. The legislation also aims to make energy more affordable by accelerating critical clean energy projects and expanding regional energy markets to improve grid reliability.

California has positioned itself as leading the nation on the transition to green energy, but has also faced headwinds from the petroleum industry, the federal government, and the costs associated with the transition. After the state enacted a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, the Trump administration blocked it, prompting a lawsuit by the state. High gas prices and the move by petroleum companies to close refineries in the state have threatened to send prices even higher.

One bill eases regulations on oil production in Kern County in a change the Governor's Office calls ""targeted, locally-led, environmentally responsible"" to boost the state's fuel supply while protecting the ongoing transition away from fossil fuels. The signing of SB 237 brought rare praise from the Western States Petroleum Association, which historically has strongly opposed the state's aggressive climate policies.

""Governor Newsom's leadership on SB 237 was foundational for the renewed partnership with the oil and gas industry,"" the WSPA said in a prepared statement. ""We look forward to continuing our relationship focused on realistic policies that balance environmental and economic goals to ensure California and the Western States have access to the affordable fuels they need.""

Another bill extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045. The program puts a cap on emissions from large polluters that gets lowered over time. Companies can then sell credits for polluting less to other companies, allowing them to reduce emissions while providing flexibility in how the limits are met.

The program is now known as ""cap-and-invest"" to highlight that the money raised is reinvested back into the state to fund projects on climate, housing, and transportation, including the state's high-speed rail project. The state's high-speed rail authority will receive $1 billion annually from the cap-and-invest program in a deal finalized just before the legislature's scheduled adjournment last week.

""Public transportation delivers for the environment and economy by providing Californians with travel options that reduce emissions, relieve congestion, cut household expenses, and sustain middle class jobs,"" said California Transit Association executive director Michael Pimentel in a prepared statement. ""By reauthorizing the Cap-and-Invest program and preserving the state's climate investments in building and operating our public transit systems, these bills will ensure that communities across the state experience the benefits of California's nation leading environmental policies.""

The package also updates California's Wildfire Fund, the $21 billion insurance pool that helps utilities cover wildfire liabilities and avoid bankruptcy. It adds another $18 billion — financed jointly by utility shareholders and ratepayers — while requiring utilities to put in billions more of shareholder money to harden and modernize their equipment.

Some analysts and environmental groups say that Newsom and the state legislature have not yet found the right balance between the state's climate goals and the continued reliance on fossil fuels.

Asha Sharma, state policy manager with the Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, told KQED that the legislation doesn't address pollution for Californians who live near refineries.

""We have a real responsibility to ensure that the fourth largest economy in the world, a progressive leader on climate, is really committed to not only climate policies, but ensuring that they're deployed equitably,"" Sharma told KQED.

Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog went further, calling the claims made by the Governor's Office ""a sham.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/19/a18ebee9-9deb-451c-b71b-513949fb8588/thumbnail/1200x630/d9d876b50d0db18f8e7da8398ff791e1/screenshot-2025-09-19-142210.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:14.404285

In this evolving landscape, strategic partnerships and robust risk mitigation frameworks are becoming critical for scaling renewable energy projects. A recent collaboration between Jera Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Energy exemplifies how such alliances can optimize portfolios, enhance grid reliability, and navigate the complexities of transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.

Strategic Realignment: From Fossil Assets to Renewable Opportunities

On September 15, 2025, Jera Americas completed the transfer of its equity interests in three gas-fired power plants—Tenaska Virginia Generating Station (940 MW), Tenaska Kiamichi Generating Station (1,220 MW), and Tenaska Gateway Generating Station (845 MW)—to Tenaska and Tyr Energy. This $3,005 MW capacity transfer aligns with Jera Americas' broader strategy to divest from carbon-intensive assets and reinvest in renewable energy opportunitiesJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer in U.S. Power Generation Projects[ 1 ]. For Tenaska and Tyr, the acquisition expands their operational footprint in key U.S. power markets (PJM, SPP, ERCOT), where grid reliability remains a pressing concernJERA Americas completes exit from three U.S. power plants as Tenaska and Tyr expand their ownership stakes[ 2 ].

This transaction reflects a broader trend: foreign energy firms are increasingly reallocating capital from aging thermal assets to zero-emission technologies. Jera Americas, for instance, has already begun scaling its renewable portfolio through JERA Nex, its dedicated clean energy subsidiary. In 2024, JERA Nex acquired the 300 MW Oxbow Solar Farm in Louisiana and the 95 MW Happy Solar Farm in Arkansas, both of which supply renewable energy to corporate clients and municipal utilitiesProjects - JERA Nex[ 3 ]. These projects underscore Jera's commitment to diversifying its energy mix while leveraging partnerships to mitigate risks associated with regulatory shifts and market volatility.

Risk Mitigation Through Collaborative Structures

Renewable energy projects inherently face political, economic, and technical risks. However, the Jera-Tenaska-Tyr partnership demonstrates how joint ventures and shared ownership models can mitigate these challenges. By transferring high-quality gas-fired assets to Tenaska and Tyr, Jera Americas reduces its exposure to regulatory penalties tied to carbon emissions while securing stable returns from its renewable investmentsRisk management in renewable energy projects[ 4 ]. Meanwhile, Tenaska and Tyr gain access to dispatchable thermal capacity, which complements their growing renewable portfolios and ensures grid stability during periods of low solar/wind outputJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Complete Joint Share Transfer[ 5 ].

General risk management principles further reinforce this model. For example, political risks—such as policy reversals or permitting delays—are mitigated through diversified ownership structures and long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs). Economic risks, including fluctuating energy prices, are addressed via joint ventures that spread capital costs and revenue streams across partners. Technical risks, such as equipment failures, are managed through performance guarantees and warranties, as seen in JERA Nex's solar projectsJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer[ 6 ].

The Path Forward: Hydrogen, Offshore Wind, and Grid Resilience

Looking ahead, Jera Americas has signaled its intent to pivot toward hydrogen and offshore wind, sectors poised for exponential growth. The company's experience in LNG infrastructure and international energy markets positions it to lead in green hydrogen production and export, particularly in North America's Gulf Coast regionJERA Americas, Tenaska, and Tyr Jointly Announce Share Transfer in U.S. Power Generation Projects[ 7 ]. Similarly, Tenaska and Tyr's expanded thermal assets could serve as backup power for intermittent renewables, ensuring a balanced grid as the U.S. transitions to a low-carbon future.

However, success will depend on continued collaboration. For instance, joint ventures between Jera Nex and Tenaska could accelerate offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico, while Tyr's expertise in asset management could streamline solar-battery storage integration. Such partnerships not only reduce individual firm risks but also create economies of scale, driving down costs for investors and consumers alike.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Sustainable Investment

The Jera Americas-Tenaska-Tyr collaboration offers a blueprint for sustainable energy investment in North America. By strategically reallocating capital, leveraging joint ventures, and prioritizing grid resilience, these firms are navigating the dual challenges of decarbonization and energy security. For investors, the lesson is clear: partnerships that balance short-term reliability with long-term sustainability will define the next decade of renewable energy development.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1758346210545.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-20 20:02:29.647419

Trump administration’s energy policies are jeopardizing the creation of new jobs in the wind, solar, and other alternative energy sectors, a report by a transition outlet has warned.

According to E2, jobs in energy transition industries grew much faster than jobs in the conventional energy sectors in the past few years, but now the trend is reversing, with the outlet saying that “recent policy actions by Congress and the Trump administration have already resulted in major job losses in the industry, with more expected to come.”

The report said that last year, new jobs in the transition space came close to 100,000, bringing the total to 3.56 million. However, this was already a slowdown from 2023 despite pro-transition policies pursued by the Biden administration.

E2 blamed the slowdown on “policy uncertainty and an overall slowing of job and economic growth.” Even so, the group said that more than 80% of all new energy jobs last year in the United States were in alternative energy sectors.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director, said.

“Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Since President Trump took office, almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled, according to U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy.

As the new administration slashed subsidies and regulatory support for wind and solar, companies involved in these industries have canceled projects worth a total $18.6 billion.

The radical change in federal government attitudes towards the wind and solar industries has already shaken them, causing bankruptcies and stock price slumps.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career?
It is not.’ Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction?
The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance.
When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change.","In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

‘I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework.’

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

up

at the world.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-climate-Leaders-04/21mag-climate-Leaders-04-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:25.357118

“High UK electricity costs are likely to remain a structural drag, as data-center developers increasingly gravitate toward regions with lower power prices and abundant renewable resources.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI are among the US firms that have in recent days pledged to invest £31 billion ($41.8 billion) into artificial intelligence projects in Britain, but industry experts say the commitment could be undermined by the UK’s aging power grid and some of the world’s highest electricity prices.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has promised to fast-track planning approval for data centers and ease access to the power grid. But AI is notoriously energy-hungry and companies could look elsewhere if the government can’t meet its commitments.

“The UK is simply unfit for datacenter development, with some of the world’s highest electricity prices, an ill-suited planning system and a systemic failure of governance,” said Joshua Leahy, chief technology officer at XTX Markets.

Earlier this year, XTX Markets, the quant trading firm backed by billionaire Alex Gerko, announced it would spend more than €1 billion building five data centers in Finland, where power is cheaper, to underpin its growing use of machine learning.

The US-UK initiative is a spin off from President Donald Trump’s visit to the UK this week.

Getting these plans off the page and onto the ground is going to be tough. New infrastructure in the UK from hospitals to manufacturing is already facing challenges from an aging, strained grid. As things stand, it can take at least five years to get a new connection, according to Savills Plc, a real estate firm working with developers to identify which sites are suitable for data centers.

In the US, the AI boom is spurring the biggest surge in power demand in decades, leading to soaring utility bills. The largest grid, stretching from Virginia to Illinois and home to the biggest concentration of AI data centers in the world, mostly uses natural gas, nuclear reactors and coal rather than clean energy.

In the UK, the same power mix isn’t going to work. The government’s central energy policy envisages having a clean grid by 2030 while lowering bills by £300. On top of that, if the planned “AI growth zones” come to fruition, they would create a huge surge in electricity demand.

Looking at the US experience, it’s increasingly difficult to see how Britain can manage to achieve all of these things.

The UK is making progress toward its 2030 goal, getting a record 50% of its electricity supply from renewables last year, according to government data. Even with renewable power being added at a record pace, demand from data centers could grow 40% by 2030 which would quickly soak up the extra supplies, according to analysis firm ICIS.

The UK has high electricity costs because of the role gas-fired power plants play in setting prices. The most expensive megawatt needed to meet demand sets the price for everyone in the market. That means that even if the wind is blowing and the sun shining, a small amount of expensive gas on the grid can drive up the cost. In other parts of Europe, like France, cheaper sources like nuclear energy keeps prices lower.

To be sure, the tech industry is often willing to pay up for power. People in the power sector talk about the AI premium - referring to the higher cost the industry is willing to absorb to get the supply they need. Last year, Microsoft to agreed to steep prices to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in New York.

But the extra demand could push up prices for everyone, a politically fraught prospect in a country where utility bills are front of mind for inflation-scarred voters.

A large-scale 100-megawatt facility can use as much electricity as 260,000 homes, according to Aurora Energy Research Ltd. Without parallel investment in renewables, higher demand could push baseload power prices up 9% by 2040.

“Our overriding priority is being where our customers are, with the strongest connectivity and lowest latency,” said Seamus Dunne, managing director for UK and Ireland at Digital Realty. The firm operates one of the biggest fleets in London with 13 data centers. “That’s why we continue to invest in London and other major metro areas even when power prices are high.”

Countries like France where power prices are cheaper are more attractive than Britain and that will start to take effect by 2030, according to ICIS.

“The price differential is currently the main distinction between the French and UK markets in terms of data-center attractiveness,” said Luca Urbanucci, analyst at ICIS. “High UK electricity costs are likely to remain a structural drag, as data-center developers increasingly gravitate toward regions with lower power prices and abundant renewable resources.”

The Georgia factory is not just a manufacturing site—it is a statement of intent in a sector where scale and resilience are paramount.","The electric vehicle (EV) industry is at a pivotal inflection point, with companies racing to balance innovation, scalability, and supply chain resilience.

(RIVN) has taken a bold step forward with the groundbreaking of its $5 billion Georgia factory, a project that could redefine its trajectory in the mass-market EV landscape. This analysis evaluates Rivian's strategic momentum through the lens of supply chain resilience and production scalability, drawing on recent developments and partnerships to assess its long-term viability.

Supply Chain Resilience: Localization and Strategic Partnerships

Rivian's Georgia factory is not merely a production hub but a cornerstone of its strategy to insulate itself from global supply chain vulnerabilities. The company has secured a $6.6 billion federal loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and a $1.5 billion state incentive package from Georgia, contingent on creating 7,500 direct jobs and 8,000 indirect jobs by 2030 Rivian breaks ground on $5B Georgia factory ahead of construction in 2026[ 1 ]. These incentives are tied to Rivian's commitment to localize its supply chain, a critical move in an era of rising tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty.

A key component of this strategy is Rivian's partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES) to produce 4695 cylindrical battery cells at a new Arizona facility. These cells, set to power the R2 and R3 models, offer six times the capacity of the 2170 cells currently in use, enhancing energy density and safety 2026 Rivian R2 Will Get New LG Cells With 'Six …[ 2 ]. This collaboration aligns with the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) requirements for domestic battery production, reducing Rivian's reliance on overseas suppliers while qualifying for federal tax credits Rivian R2 will get Arizona-made batteries from LG[ 3 ].

Moreover,

has proactively stockpiled lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells from Gotion High-Tech in China and Samsung SDI in South Korea, ensuring short-term stability amid tariff risks Rivian’s Strategic Battery Stockpile: A Smart Move Against Tariff Challenges[ 4 ]. This dual approach—short-term stockpiling and long-term localization—demonstrates a nuanced understanding of supply chain dynamics. By co-locating suppliers near its Georgia plant, Rivian aims to reduce logistics costs and lead times, a strategy echoed by traditional automakers like and in their Southeastern U.S. operations Rivian Georgia Plant: EV Supply Chain Investment Opportunity[ 5 ].

Production Scalability: From Ambition to Execution

The Georgia factory's two-phase design, targeting 400,000 annual vehicles by 2028, represents a quantum leap for Rivian. Currently, the company produces 15,000 units annually at its Illinois plant, a scale insufficient to compete with Tesla's 4 million vehicles or Ford's 2.5 million It's 'Do or Die' for Electric Vehicle Maker Rivian as It Breaks Ground on a $5 Billion Plant[ 6 ]. The Georgia facility's phased approach—200,000 units per phase—allows for incremental capacity expansion while mitigating financial risk.

This scalability is further bolstered by Rivian's investment in workforce development. The company has partnered with Georgia's technical colleges and universities to create apprenticeship programs, ensuring a pipeline of skilled labor for advanced manufacturing Rivian | Georgia Department of Economic Development[ 7 ]. Such initiatives not only address immediate labor needs but also strengthen the regional ecosystem, a factor that could attract additional suppliers and investors.

However, scalability hinges on Rivian's ability to execute its timeline. Delays in construction or production could exacerbate cash flow pressures, particularly as the company burns through $1 billion annually in operating costs Rivian Breaks Ground on $5B EV Plant in Georgia[ 8 ]. The Georgia plant's proximity to I-20 and major ports, however, provides a logistical edge, enabling efficient distribution to the Eastern U.S. and export markets Rivian Holds Kickoff Ceremony for Georgia Plant, Accelerating American Manufacturing Growth[ 9 ].

Challenges and Mitigants: Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Rivian's path is not without obstacles. The U.S. EV market is maturing, with slowing sales growth and the expiration of federal tax credits At a truly awful time to build an electric vehicle[ 10 ]. Competitors like

and Ford are also scaling production, with Tesla's Texas and Berlin Gigafactories targeting 500,000 units annually by 2025. Rivian's differentiation lies in its focus on premium utility vehicles (R1T/R1S) and its upcoming R2 and R3 models, which aim to capture the mass market with lower price points Rivian breaks ground on $5 billion Georgia electric vehicle plant[ 11 ].

Environmental concerns from local residents—particularly regarding the Georgia plant's impact on farmland—could also delay permits or spark regulatory scrutiny Rivian Breaks Ground on $5B EV Factory in Georgia, Boosting Jobs and Production[ 12 ]. Rivian's emphasis on sustainability, including renewable energy integration and modern construction techniques, will be critical in addressing these concerns and maintaining its ESG credentials Tracking Success] Rivian’s Supply Chain – How a Startup Competes in the EV Market[ 13 ].

Investment Outlook: Balancing Risks and Rewards

For investors, Rivian's Georgia factory represents both a high-stakes gamble and a potential catalyst for long-term value creation. The project's success depends on three pillars:

1. Supply Chain Localization: Continued progress with LGES and domestic battery producers will reduce exposure to global disruptions.

2. Production Timelines: Meeting 2028 production targets is essential to achieving economies of scale and profitability.

3. Market Differentiation: The R2 and R3 models must resonate with price-sensitive consumers in a crowded EV segment.

While risks remain, Rivian's strategic alignment with the IRA, its vertically integrated approach, and its geographic advantages position it to capture a meaningful share of the EV market.

When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change.
What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change?
About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not.
Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change?","Finland has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world. At the same time, you’re still consuming large quantities of oil, gas and even coal. What has the energy transition looked like for you? Today we produce more than 95 percent of our electricity carbon-neutral. We are going to change our whole society to use clean energy and get rid of fossils and to be carbon neutral. And we can do it. Our companies are committed. And our people, the whole of society, is committed to these targets.

What do you think when you see the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Agreement, penalizing renewable-energy production and doubling down on fossil fuels? We are looking very carefully at what is happening in the U.S. The withdrawal from Paris was a setback for global climate efforts, particularly in climate finance. For example, the American data economy is investing billions in data centers in Finland because of clean energy. I’m a bit worried about how U.S. policy affects the companies from the U.S. and their investment plans. But it is important to note that many private-sector companies have continued to advance climate action. And we have seen that China’s role in climate policy has become even more crucial. And the E.U. must work even harder. Climate and economy go hand in hand. We in Finland know this.

‘We are going to change our whole society.’

Is China becoming a more powerful partner to Finland with the retreat of the U.S. on clean energy? With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies, because we have to be autonomous in clean-energy production. China is investing a lot, and China is very good on that. That’s why we have to invest also in the West.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate international climate action has ultimately been effective? I’m concerned at this moment, because we have so many troubles around the world. We have wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, in Africa. But at the same time, climate change is moving forward. And we have to act. I have seen that international cooperation is possible. When I worked as a minister of finance seven years ago, I was co-founder of the Coalition of Finance Ministers Against Climate Change. Today there are 100 countries on board. And the solution was carbon pricing. I think that is a good example — that if you have practical and good ideas, you can find the power between countries and coalitions.

‘With China, we have to be careful. We have to get rid of dangerous dependencies.’

When you talk to leaders from the developing world, they really believe that developed countries, including Finland, should pay for climate-related damage in their countries. What’s your response to this? It is understandable, of course, and it’s clear that we have to support developing countries that are facing the effects of climate change first. It’s daily life in their countries.

You’ve been working on this issue for many years now. What was the moment when you felt the most personal disillusionment about the politics around climate change? About five to 10 years ago, there was a debate in my own country over whether climate change is true or not. And because I believe it is, and I’m deeply worried about our world and our planet, that debate was frustrating. But we won. Today we have new technologies. We can change our behavior without cutting our welfare. We just have to believe that it’s possible, and we have to continue our work.

How is climate change affecting the Marshall Islands? We will be submerged by 2050 if the world doesn’t do its part. We have a population of around 37,000. Ten years ago, we had closer to 50,000.

And what is driving that migration? One reason is that when we have regular inundations, some people, rather than rebuilding their homes, decide to go away and settle in the U.S. Sea-level rise is becoming scary for many of us.

Do you think your citizens make a direct connection between things like rising seas, airborne diseases and climate change? Yes, this conversation has been ongoing for many years. We have climate change in our curriculum. So our kids are growing up understanding the issues. People know that big emitters — the rich countries — are causing this, that we have no contribution to the greenhouse-gas emissions that are destroying the world and our livelihood. Our people are not complacent, but they have accepted the fact that big inequities exist and powerful countries get away with unacceptable behaviors. We are used to that mentality and attitude, since we have lived with the impact of the U.S. nuclear-testing program on our islands for 70 years.

What do you think developed nations owe countries like the Marshall Islands? The plan for elevating only two of our communities is projected to cost us billions. It’s a lot of money. I wish that the big emitters could step up and put money into that, because that could really help.

Do you feel differently about what international collaboration on climate change can accomplish now than you did at the beginning of your career? I have a positive outlook, despite everything that is happening. I think the fact that we are sitting at the table now — before, you know, it wasn’t as easy to be part of the discussions. The small-island developing states have been able to organize themselves and to be heard.

What has participating in those discussions been like for you? This is the 10th year of the Paris Agreement, and we’ve been hearing the same excuses from big emitters. You know, they’re very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.

What impact does the U.S. withdrawal from Paris have on the world’s ability to take action on this issue? It’s unfortunate that the U.S. has decided to step out of Paris. But there are those who rally together, because there are no other options for them. And so I think people are coming together stronger than before because you cannot rely on the U.S. in this respect. Something positive is happening, even though it’s not at the level that the Marshall Islands and other small developing countries have been advocating.

‘Big emitters are very comfortable, and they don’t want to move from their comfort level.’

What specific steps are you taking in the Marshall Islands to combat the effects of climate change? The warming of the ocean is killing our corals, which are building blocks of atoll nations. We are currently doing research to determine species of corals that can survive the warming ocean. Big emitters could provide research. Even though we are not contributing to emission levels, we are doing what we can to decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. We are building a fleet of ships that use wind and solar power to replace our fossil-fuel-run shipping fleet.

Do you think your country will survive? As the leader of the Marshall Islands, I cannot take the view that we cannot survive. One important thing we’ve done is register our boundaries with the United Nations, making sure that the world recognizes our boundaries, regardless of whether we’re underwater or above water. So in that respect, the country will survive.

What are some of the changes your people have had to make to their daily lives as you navigate all this? Seven years ago, Majuro had no sea walls. Now we build sea walls to protect homes and schools. I mean, we used to be able to just walk into the lagoon. Now you have to go over sea walls to get to the lagoon side or to the ocean side. The landscape is different. I’ll share a poem that was put together by my daughter, Kathy Jetn̄il-Kijiner. It’s a reflection on how people are feeling about what’s happening.

My cousin

had a nightmare

that we kept

building seawalls

higher and

higher

all around

our island

up to

the sky

until suddenly

we were

at the bottom

of a wishing well

looking

at the world.

In Australia, climate has historically been a divisive issue. You seem to have gotten past the partisanship somewhat. How have you done that? I wouldn’t say there is a consensus here now. There are attempts by some in our opposition who are currently trying to remove, for example, the support for net zero by 2050. We have a green political party that would say net zero by 2035. Now, if you do that, you’re not going to achieve it; you’re going to threaten energy security, and therefore you’ll lose community support. If you just say, “Yeah, 100 percent renewable by tomorrow,” then you will lose support. You’ve got to take people with you on the journey. Our predecessors had 22 different energy policies and didn’t land one.

I try to speak about climate change as a challenge, but also an opportunity. To speak about the cost of inaction through the disasters that we’re seeing, but also the benefit in embracing the transition to clean energy. We are in a position where we’re trying to shift the agenda from one of “Why are you spending money on this?” to the return that comes from acting. One of the things that is said by climate skeptics in Australia is, “Oh, well, we’re only a couple of percent of the world’s emissions, so anything we do doesn’t matter.” That’s where the argument about economic benefit from action as opposed to inaction needs to be made.

Do you believe that the framework for international collaboration is actually effective? The challenge that the globe faces on this and so many other areas is the tension between international action and national sovereignty. I don’t think there’s a shortcut around the U.N. framework. As much as it is not ideal, I don’t see that there’s another option. What we’ve seen is a rise of nationalism and individualism from many countries. But it is also in the interest of nations and states for there to be good global outcomes. No country will be immune from action if we see an ongoing rise in levels of climate change, which means more climate refugees, which means other international changes as well. And these things are linked with national security, too.

You’re a big importer of Chinese-made solar panels. How do you see China right now? Is it a threat to a country like Australia, or is it a benefit because they are making so many of these technologies cheap and affordable? Well, it is a source of some regret. I think that there’s not a solar panel in the world that doesn’t have intellectual property that was created in Australia. Now, part of my argument is that we missed out on the commercial benefit. Just literally today, my minister and I were in South Australia announcing a nearly sixfold increase in manufacturing of solar panels at one of our plants there. China was smart to ramp up its investment in manufacturing, as it has been dominating critical minerals. What that could be is a lesson for countries so that, if there is potential trade disruption, there is less risk if other parts of the globe are also manufacturing.

This is something we’re going through here, where the Trump administration is penalizing the development of renewable energy and promoting fossil fuels. What is your response to what the U.S. is doing? We’re really focused on working in the Pacific in particular. We have a climate-change structure fund that is supporting the lowering of emissions in our own region. I think we don’t get into what other countries are doing, including the United States. That’s a matter for them as a sovereign nation. What it potentially does is open up opportunities in other parts. The countries that will succeed economically, in my view, are countries that continue to move forward.

When you see the U.S. retreat from engagement in climate issues, what does that mean for Guyana? The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement is a major blow. We can’t debate that. The U.S. is not only a major emitter of greenhouse gases, but it wields tremendous influence in global affairs. The climate crisis is an existential crisis for many of us. We simply cannot afford to fold our hands and do nothing. We’re working closely with our neighbors, especially Brazil and Suriname, on forest biodiversity and resilience. With the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, then predictability on financing becomes an issue. It opens up a floodgate for others to also be unpredictable in the policy-making environment. Everything that surrounds climate change, commitment and policy requires global consensus, basically.

Is the global community actually making the financing available so that nations like Guyana can undergo the energy transition? Absolutely not. It’s ridiculous sometimes to listen to the pledges, because none of the pledges is actualized. When you ask the developing world to adopt measures to limit the impact of whatever we are doing on climate, you’re asking us to transition when we have major issues on energy equality, energy poverty, energy access. And then to complicate issues, these very countries are asked to function in a digital world, so they are already suffering from immense poverty because they were never able to adapt to the Industrial Revolution. Now they are moving into the digital revolution with A.I. that they will never be able to catch up with. And at the same time, basic things like clean water, access to electricity — major segments of the population don’t have this. This is something that has severely impacted the quality and equity of global policy-making. And there is no clear path and no clear plan as to how we are going to address these issues.

I heard implicitly in what you just said that climate change is the ultimate long-term problem in a world that is so often consumed with these short-term crises. I would put it even better: It’s a sacrificial lamb. Climate change is a sacrificial lamb that is always postponed. If you look at the last five years, we have not accelerated momentum. We have really stagnated. We are not implementing what we commit ourselves to do globally.

One thing that has not stagnated is temperature rise. What will this mean for the people of Guyana? If we did not have the type of revenue stream that we have now, it would have meant debt. It would have meant destruction. It would have meant our economy just falling apart. Guyana is a new oil producer, but we are using the resource to finance our energy transition, to build resilient infrastructure, to support the region that we are in, to invest in livelihood options that will keep our forest standing, which stores many gigatons of carbon. We’re investing in solar farms, hydro, natural gas, wind and biomass, all aimed at transitioning to a low-emission energy grid. We are building off-grid systems, solar farms, wind farms for the hinterland community, where the Indigenous people live.

‘Climate change is a sacrificial lamb.’

You talk about how, for Guyana, the answer to coping with a hotter world is in fact being funded by the production of more fuels that are causing that warming. That of course is sort of the conundrum in a nutshell, right? I don’t see it as a problem. Your question in the context of Guyana is quite different from your question in the Middle East, or your question in one of the industrial countries. For us, it’s quite different.

How do you see a way out? We have this standing forest that has been there for all our lives, which the world does not see a value in. It’s easy. If the world says, “We’re going to pay a fair-market rate for the forests that have ecological and biodiversity sources that also have a price,” then it will allow countries like ours that are forested to then use the revenue from that to protect our land, to invest in health, to invest in education, human development and infrastructure, to remain competitive and to build a strong and resilient economy. So the moral question is: Who can produce what the world needs in the least environmentally damaging way? Because let’s be clear on this too. We can’t be naïve. The world will need fossil fuel a long time into the future.

How is climate change affecting Kenya? Just in the last 10 years, we have experienced three very serious droughts. In one, we lost close to two and a half million heads of livestock. We incurred costs upward of $1.5 billion on the loss of livestock alone. We lost many lives because of floods that followed. Between 5 and 10 percent of our economy is washed away every time we have a drought or flood. Climate change is not a myth. It is not a story. It is not far-fetched. It is a lived reality every day.

There has been real pushback within Kenya on the degree to which you are focused on international issues around climate rather than domestic issues. There have been protests. You’ve been criticized for police crackdowns. I see protests happen in many other countries. I see demonstrations in America. I see demonstrations in France and Europe. The reason that maybe you don’t see as much protesting in the rest of our continent is largely because not many countries are as democratic as Kenya. There is always a balance between the right to protest and the degeneration of protest into riots, destruction of property and life. And the police have a very delicate job. I don’t envy their position. But this is part of the growing of a nation.

But talking to your countrymen, how do you explain your focus on something that can seem very abstract to people who are still just struggling to get by day to day? Climate change is not just a global issue. It is a very domestic matter as well. Droughts made millions of Kenyans go hungry. Floods just in the city of Nairobi killed over 30 people. Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.

Do you feel like the effort to coordinate global climate action has been effective? In the last three years, ever since we came together as a continent and pushed one continental position, what looked impossible is now beginning to be a reality. We just came back from a meeting of the U.N. where we were discussing development and financing. And it is generally acceptable now that countries like Kenya should be considered for financing. There was a time when we said this and it looked like a joke.

How exactly have things changed in those conversations? I think there is now a realization that we need debt relief, debt restructuring, because many countries, including Kenya, spend a lot of resources on managing the effects of climate change. And we’ve had, many times, to reorganize our resources because, when it comes to emissions, we are paying for a crime that others committed.

‘Nobody can persuasively tell any Kenyan that climate change is abstract. It is not.’

Does international collaboration on climate change work if the United States is rowing in the opposite direction? My brother, no situation is permanent. We may have a difficult situation now, but I believe that no one country can solve the problem of climate change alone. No one region, however powerful, however mighty. Solving this requires the participation, the collaboration, of everybody. And so I am very confident that the position of the United States, of China, of Europe, of Africa must come together at some point. We may disagree for a moment, we may disagree for a while, but reality is going to beat us into an agreement, because we have no option. The effects of climate change are in every continent. The only difference is that developed countries can cushion themselves. If the people in our continent cannot find life bearable in this continent, no amount of building borders and erecting roadblocks will block people from moving around the globe.

What’s your response when you see President Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, essentially saying that he doesn’t believe climate change is an urgent threat? I have come across many leaders, and I don’t think President Trump is alone. But that does not remove the reality of what climate change is. The science is stubborn. The reality and facts are clear. Governments will come and go, leaders will move on, but the situation will be here. The reality will be staring at us.

How is Bangladesh experiencing climate change right now? We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves. But not only is our land sinking into the ocean; the water system brings saline water into the land because of the tide. And salinity eats up our cultivable land. So sum total is our land is getting squeezed. It’s not a very happy situation. It’s not going to change unless global warming changes. And then besides the sea level rising, our atmosphere is getting crazy. Our weather pattern is changing. Half of the population is under the age of 26. It’s a very young population. So they need a space to grow up and learn how to survive on this planet.

How much do you think international efforts to collaborate on climate action have succeeded or failed? We try to solve everything by pouring money into it. That’s not the solution. I’m saying I have to change myself. That’s how the world will change. I’m not undermining the importance of the COP [U.N. climate conference], because this is where everybody gets together and worries together. But the solution has to be something which is not just the government giving instruction. Government is not the solution. It’s the people who live on this planet who are the solution.

Bangladesh is a country that has almost no renewable-energy production at scale right now. You’ve talked about a zero-carbon-emissions world. How does a country like Bangladesh get there from where it is now? It’s not our fault. We try every way. Bangladesh doesn’t have its own source of hydropower. It’s a flat land, so we don’t have much except for solar. We have tremendous sources of hydropower up in the north, in Nepal, in Bhutan, and they are willing to supply this to Bangladesh. But for a time, we could not have the transmission line over India. So we got stuck. This is something that needs a decision which is beyond the control of Bangladesh.

‘We have to make use of every little space we’ve got in order to feed ourselves.’

Beyond India, what does the rest of the strategic landscape look like when it comes to energy issues? Is China potentially a partner for you as the U.S. pulls back? Well, you can imagine what the answer is, but being in the government, I cannot go on talking about other countries, what they should do and so on. It creates a problem for the government.

When you see the moves that the Trump administration has taken to reduce support for renewables, to prioritize fossil fuels, to cut federal funding for disaster response, what do you say? I just do the same thing I do for everybody. I’ll go to him and explain how I feel so bad that we are not taking the right kind of steps. And it can be done without hurting anybody. You have a choice, whether you take the path of self-destruction or you take the path of continuation and a decent life for all of us together. And not let the island people sink into the ocean. Not let Bangladesh be affected by sea level rising.

What do you think the developed countries that have historically been responsible for most global emissions owe a country like Bangladesh? All I can do is explain to them: “Look, this is our home. You start a fire in your part of the home, you suffer. But you do something to start a fire in my part of the house — this is not a fair thing to do. You are destroying the whole home. Our life depends on what you do.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/21/magazine/21mag-climate-Leaders-07/21mag-climate-Leaders-07-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-20 13:02:44.007066

The $110 million new investment will help create a new production line in Mississippi for ABB’s Emax3 circuit breakers.
Earlier this year, ABB announced $120 million investment for new manufacturing sites in Selmer, Tennessee and Senatobia, Mississippi.

The latest manufacturing investment follows ABB’s $170 million commitment to its U.S. facilities two years ago. Those include projects around motor drives in Wisconsin and manufacturing, robotics and other services in New Mexico, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.

This month’s investment expansion could create nearly 200 new jobs in products serving growth industries such as data centers and the power grid. The International Energy Agency and other forecasters such as Goldman Sachs are forecasting a tremendous demand growth due to artificial intelligence and cloud-based computing, as well as industrial and transportation electrification.

The $110 million new investment will help create a new production line in Mississippi for ABB’s Emax3 circuit breakers. The capital will also be spent to double the footprint of ABB’s power quality and protection equipment manufacturing in Richmond, Virginia, which is opening later this year.

“This $110 million investment in the US is part of our long-term strategy to support future growth in our biggest global market,” said Morten Wierod, ABB CEO, in a statement. “Demand is being driven by key trends, from the surging power needs of AI in data centers, to grid modernization and customers improving energy efficiency and uptime to reduce their costs. Our investments will ensure we can meet growing demand from customers across North America in line with our local-for-local strategy.”

ABB will invest $30 million of its capital to expand three new production lines in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, where the company manufactures smart circuit breakers and switching devices. That expansion will bring 90 new skilled labor jobs by the end of 2026, according to the company.

ABB also is increasing capacity for advanced low- and medium-voltage grid components at its plant in Pinetops, North Carolina, which is going to open next year also.

Earlier this year, ABB announced $120 million investment for new manufacturing sites in Selmer, Tennessee and Senatobia, Mississippi. These are both plants to produce electrical distribution and circuit breakers to market beginning in 2026.

“Demand is increasing steadily for advanced electrification technologies, driven by growth in key sectors including data centers and utilities,” Wierod at the time of the March 2025 announcement. “Our new facilities in Selmer and Senatobia will keep our U.S. customers at the cutting edge of the energy transition and help them meet their performance, productivity and energy efficiency goals.”

Including the past three years, ABB has committed more than $500 million of new investment in its U.S. manufacturing operations. U.S. revenues for the company total nearly $9 billion annually, while the workforce is close to 17,000 people across those facilities.

At last week's RE+ energy conference--where more than 40,000 industry insiders gathered in Las Vegas to talk about the energy transition, enthusiasm and optimism were high for electrification and decarbonization despite recent political headwinds against renewables.

“Technology wins,” said Brian Nelson, renewable segment leader at Swiss-based energy technology giant ABB. “Technology will continue to push the evolution of renewable energy further and further.”

On a purely company level, Nelson highlighted the rise of new 2,000-volt capacity for solar energy collection, pushing module capabilities higher and energy denser than ever.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/09/68ced142de78c994b6d34145-abb_manufacturing_photo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-09-20 13:02:52.497396

After cutting the US wind and solar industries off at the knees all year long, the Trump administration has finally woken up to the fact that wind and solar are the only abundant, accessible domestic energy resources that can meet the nation’s surging demand for electricity ASAP, STAT, on the double, economically, safely, and at scale, too. At least, that’s what one may think upon a cursory reading of the Energy Department’s new “Speed to Power” plan. It is tailor made to vault renewable energy back to priority status in federal energy policy — or not, as the case may be.

More Renewable Energy, Pleeeeese!

Actually, “Speed to Power” is more of a plea than a plan. In a September 18 announcement, the Energy Department let everybody know that it has issued a formal Request for Information, desperately seeking any and all ideas from the private sector on how to “accelerate the speed of large-scale grid infrastructure project development for both transmission and generation.”

The Energy Department sure sounds anxious enough to try anything. In the announcement, the agency admitted that “the current rate of project development is inadequate to support the country’s rapidly expanding manufacturing needs and the reindustrialization of the U.S. economy.”

“The Speed to Power initiative will help ensure the United States has the power needed to win the global artificial intelligence (AI) race while continuing to meet growing demand for affordable, reliable and secure energy,” the Energy Department added, which is a sideways way of indicating that US President Donald Trump’s new fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” plan has already fallen on its face.

In fact, the pitch for Speed to Power slots neatly into the renewable energy picture. The US wind and solar industries (especially solar) have spent the better part of the early 2000’s demonstrating that they can deliver kilowatts on the megascale faster, and more economically, than any other energy resource on the market today.

Restarting the Renewable Energy Engine, Or Not

The US renewable energy track record is even more impressive considering that the nation’s rich offshore wind resources have barely been tapped as yet, having hit the doldrums all through the Obama administration and the first Trump administration, too.

Former President Joe Biden finally wrangled the offshore industry into speed mode with a near-term goal of 30 gigawatts. By the time US President Donald Trump took office, a long list of Biden-era offshore wind projects was already through the review stage and on the way to construction. In fact, some were deep into construction when Trump pulled the plug.

If the Energy Department is really that desperate to make Speed to Power happen, perhaps Energy Secretary Wright could find a tactful way to suggest that US President Donald Trump’s fossil-friendly “American Energy Dominance” needs a bit of a tweak, particularly in regards to the US offshore wind industry.

For example, one need look no farther than the Revolution Wind project, a 704-megawatt offshore wind farm located off the coast of Rhode Island. The work was 80% complete as of last August, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered the work to stop.

That’s peanuts compared to the 2.4-gigawatt SouthCoast Wind project in Massachusetts, which was greenlighted for construction until Burgum pulled the plug last Friday.

And, that’s the problem. Instead of collaborating with other federal agencies on significant domestic energy initiatives, the Energy Department is only seeking projects within its funding wheelhouse. The Speed to Power RFI covers “near-term investment opportunities, project readiness, load growth expectations, and infrastructure constraints that DOE can address,” the Energy Department explains (emphasis added).

The Energy Department’s authority over US energy policy is rooted in the nuclear industry of World War II, so it’s no surprise to see a focus on nuclear power in the RFI. Besides, even if Energy Secretary Wright wanted to address constraints on the offshore wind industry, first he would have to ask Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to restart the federal offshore lease program upon which the entire offshore industry depends, and stop issuing stop-work orders on projects already in the pipeline. Wright will also have to tell Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to stop re-reviewing offshore wind permits that were already reviewed and approved.

In addition, Wright will have to get Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to reverse his reversal of a federal grant program aimed at upgrading 12 seaports around the nation to serve as offshore wind industry hubs, and he will have to convince US Attorney General Pam Bondi to reverse her reversal of prior offshore wind approvals, too.

Renewable Energy And The Reliability Canard

If you’re thinking that Speed to Power will fall just as flat as American Energy Dominance, drop a note in the comment thread. Meanwhile, in an exquisite coincidence of timing, the Energy Department issued its plea for more power generation just three days before renewable energy advocates from all over the world descend upon the US for New York Climate Week 2025.

CleanTechnica will be in and around New York all week, and we’re particularly interested to know what representatives from the global wind and solar industries make of Speed to Power, particularly in regards to another stipulation coughed up by the Energy Department in the new initiative.

In addition to seeking input on projects only within the Energy Department’s funding authority, Speed to Power relies on the same outdated “reliability” canard that shuts the door on wind and solar. In the September 18 announcement, Secretary Wright emphasized that the hunt is on for any and all “affordable, reliable and secure sources.”

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we’re leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race,” he repeated.

In case anyone didn’t get the message, the Energy Department cited its lopsided new grid report, in which it warned that that “blackouts could increase by 100 times by 2030 if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity.”

Sure, Let’s Save All Those Coal Jobs

So, where does that leave the Energy Department? With not much, that’s for sure. The agency has fallen back on expensive, wasteful emergency measures such as pulling the mothballed Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan out of mothballs.

The Energy Department has also pulled the emergency cord to force a lumbering, antiquated coal power plant in Michigan to remain open past its scheduled retirement date. That’s not a plan, that’s a sop to the US coal industry, which is still clinging to the hope that Trump will finally make good on his promise to save coal jobs.

“Coal prices are far less volatile than those of natural gas,” the coal industry organization America’s Power notes weakly, but that won’t help. Natural gas has been pushing coal out of the US power generation picture since the early 2000’s, and it will continue pushing with or without an assist from renewable energy resources.

Last week, for example, the Ohio-based power engineering firm Babcock & Wilcox joined with the investment fund Denham Capital to announce a new partnership aimed at leveraging existing transmission infrastructure in the US and Europe to convert coal power plants to gas. “Through the partnership, substantial investments will be made to convert coal-fired power plants to cleaner natural gas solutions, which represent a crucial bridge for the clean energy transition,” the partners explained.

In terms of the renewable energy transition, that “bridge” pitch is worth debunking, but the point is that coal’s place in the power generation profile is shrinking no matter what lifeline the Trump administration tosses into the seas.

Renewable Energy Gets The Last Laugh, Eventually

Oh the irony, it burns. Trump’s own insistence on a Federal Reserve rate cut could give renewable energy investing the edge over coal and gas, too, according to some analyses. For that matter, Trump’s carefully articulated American Energy Dominance plan contains the seeds of coal’s destruction. In addition to throwing a protective blanket over the US nuclear industry, the plan includes multiple renewable energy resources, including hydropower, geothermal, and biomass along with marine energy.

All of these renewable resources face cost and timeline obstacles under the current state of technology, but none of them are going away. Neither is the wind or the sunshine, for that matter. They will all be sticking around long after Trump leaves office on January 20, 2029, as scheduled — peacefully, one hopes, this time.

That was the message from executives, investors and industry leaders at BloombergNEF’s Barrel of Tomorrow in the Age of AI Summit in Houston on Thursday.

The meeting took place against the backdrop of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which preserved incentives for some sectors while clawing them back for others. Meanwhile, the nation’s shakeup of clean energy policy has prompted some companies to look for opportunity elsewhere, and the AI boom is forcing grids to expand.

Here are five takeaways from the summit about the state of the energy transition in the age of Trump and AI.

Companies look outside of US for opportunities

With Trump rolling back clean-tech incentives, some companies are refocusing their efforts abroad. That’s particularly the case for the battered green hydrogen industry, which has seen high costs, falling investment and stalled projects. In the US, gas is “relatively inexpensive,” and selling green hydrogen into Europe makes more sense, according to Gavin Rennick, president of new energy for SLB.

It’s also the case for carbon capture and storage. In a separate panel, Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s Anthony Cottone said the company is positioning its carbon removal product toward mandated carbon markets. Cottone is the president and general manager of the oil and gas major’s carbon removal unit, 1PointFive, which is currently commissioning a direct air capture plant in Texas.

While the US doesn’t have a federally-regulated carbon market, the European Union and other geographies have emissions trading schemes in place that make carbon credits for direct air capture more enticing.

Regulation is needed to scale green tech

For many green technologies, scaling the Valley of Death and commercializing successfully requires a bit of policy support. And not just carrots, but also sticks.

“We need to transition this not from a voluntary market but to a global regulatory market where there’s actually mandates,” Cottone said of the carbon market. In his view, that’s necessary to lower the technology cost curve and guarantee long-term customer demand for products like carbon dioxide removal credits.

That sentiment was echoed by infrastructure investor Chris Rozell, who co-founded Cresta Fund Management. “I don’t see any case today where you can make alternative fuels at a price that’s lower than crude,” but subsidies could make them “digestible for economies.”

Grid must double in size in 15 years

The US grid took more than 100 years to build out and now has to double in size to meet demand. And it has to do it in the next 15 years, according to industry executives.

Connecting the three power main grids is one of the “most cost effective things to do,” said Michael Skelly, co-founder and CEO of transmission developer Grid United. A national policy to develop high voltage power lines would facilitate that, he said.

Frank Kreikebaum, engineering chief for Smart Wires, said his company was able to help data centers connect in half the time of alternate solutions with the aid of hardware to better manage flow across power lines, substations and other equipment.

The data center build-out is costly

The bitter battle brewing over how to accelerate the AI data-center build-out without unduly burdening consumers was a key point of discussion, with NRG Energy Inc. CEO Larry Coben asking “Who pays for this expansion?”

Coben also noted that this new wave of infrastructure-building isn’t creating the jobs generated by past build-outs. “Data centers are extremely important, both business wise and to national security, but the long term job creation generally isn’t there,” he said.

Terawatt Infrastructure CEO Neha Palmer, meanwhile, emphasized the need for new power generation as electric vehicles proliferate. Like data centers, EVs need power “as fast as possible but the cost is also incredibly important” especially for heavy duty truck fleets that are comparing the cost per mile versus diesel, she said.

Redwood Materials Inc. Chief Executive Officer JB Straubel said batteries have a role to play in stabilizing the load for data centers, which see oscillating rather than steady power demand.

Biofuels may help US farmers

As US farmers struggle with low commodity prices and a trade war that’s hitting demand, biofuels are becoming a key market for the industry.

“I wouldn’t say it’s the answer, but it’s certainly a big part of the answer,” Donnell Rehagen, chief executive of Clean Fuels Alliance America, said.

Rehagen pointed to recent US proposals on biofuel blending mandates, saying he thinks the Trump administration has come to the same conclusion and “is looking at renewable fuel policy as a way to try to help agriculture get through a time like this.”

Fellow panelist Fernando Candia, Bunge’s vice president of global carbon solutions, said biofuel mandates “have enormous importance” for the industry and farmers, who are looking for the visibility and incentives they provide.",https://energynow.com/wp-content/uploads/Houston-Downtown-Skyline-1200x810-1.png,N,,2025-09-20 15:01:44.779195

The award, which recognizes significant contributions to reducing the environmental impact of film productions, was presented to del Toro by Sam Read, executive director of the Sustainable Entertainment Alliance.

Among its green achievements while filming in Toronto, Frankenstein used electric vehicles (EVs) on the production which were quickly recharged through temporary DC fast-charging stations provided by Netflix. The use of diesel generators was cut by more than a third, with Ontario’s clean electricity grid used instead through careful redistribution of available power. These measures, combined with hybrid vehicles, allowed the production to avoid over 50,000 liters of fuel. Additionally, while filming in the U.K., Frankenstein became the first Netflix production to use a mobile hydrogen power unit.

Read highlighted the impact of these efforts in his remarks: “We know from our industry research that the majority of a film’s carbon emissions come from fuel usage, so we’re honored to recognize Frankenstein and Guillermo del Toro’s legacy of sustainability, whether that is how you make the films, but also the films that you make which explore the balance between humanity and the natural world we live in.”

The production also made substantial strides in reducing waste, including minimizing single-use plastics and recycling 180 metric tons of steel from its sets. These initiatives reflected a holistic commitment to sustainability, from energy use to material recycling.

“Shout out to Miles Dale who is always insisting on this,” said del Toro, crediting his long-time collaborator, producer J. Miles Dale, for driving the sustainability efforts on Frankenstein. He added, “Miles Dale and I have been partners for more than a decade, and his dedication to these practices has always been inspiring.”

Dale noted, “We have 53 EV and hybrid vehicles on the show. With our fast chargers here, we can charge a car in about 20 minutes.” He continued, “I think increasingly we will have electric vehicles. That movement is coming. I think that we as producers are committed to doing that going forward.”

Running a sustainable production does not require giving up full creative control, notes del Toro, “We have to decide which one is the thing that we can do more reasonably when we want full control and also not damaging a natural resource. It is a people-driven industry. So you have an impact on the community immediately.”

The company, which owns Facebook, filed an application with US regulators this week seeking authorization to do so. A Meta representative said it was a natural next step to participate in energy markets as it looks to power operations with clean energy.

Buying electricity has become an increasingly urgent challenge for technology companies including Meta, Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. They’re all racing to develop more advanced artificial intelligence systems and tools that are notoriously resource-intensive. Amazon.com Inc., Google and Microsoft are already active power traders, according to filings with US regulators.

While big tech companies consume huge amounts of electricity, they also have contracts for power that they can flip around and sell when prices are high.

“There will be opportunities to sell electricity into the wholesale markets and make a little extra money doing that,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James.

Plus, tech companies that have batteries or on-site generators at data centers can sell power from those back to the grid when prices spike, said Andy DeVries, a utilities and power analyst at CreditSights Inc.

Power demand from data centers used to build and run AI models is set to quadruple in 10 years, based on projections from BloombergNEF. At the same time, power prices are rising amid this surge in electric demand. In fact, capacity payments — which generators get in some US markets — hit a record in an auction held this year by the country’s biggest grid, which stretches from Washington to Chicago.

The demand is so robust that some tech firms that touted their climate goals are now considering natural gas a key source to help power their data centers. Last month, for instance, Louisiana regulators approved utility Entergy Corp.’s plan to build three natural gas plants to power Meta’s data center there.

Meta’s application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeks authorization “to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services.” It didn’t identify, however, where in the US it would seek to trade power. The company would be required to file for membership in order to trade in one of seven competitive power markets, such as the Texas grid or the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which encompasses the Louisiana data center.

It filed the request through a subsidiary, Atem Energy LLC, formed to act as a power marketer. Meta asked for its application to be approved by Nov. 16.

In recent years, Nevada has built some of the largest clean energy projects in the country, with seven solar projects boasting more than 200 megawatts of capacity. Between now and 2030, another six are expected to come online.

Nevada's solar-plus-storage portfolio now includes several massive projects, including the Gemini Solar Hybrid facility. Completed in March 2024 with 690 megawatts of solar capacity and 380 megawatts of battery storage, it stands as one of the world's biggest solar-plus-storage plants. Not too far away, the Reid Gardner storage project adds another 220 megawatts of capacity.

According to Cleanview's project tracker, Nevada now hosts 66 utility-scale solar farms with a combined capacity of 5,285 megawatts. These megaprojects have helped Nevada become one of the largest solar markets in the U.S. — roughly 30% of the state's power capacity comes from utility-scale solar, more than any other state.

Why is solar and storage growing so quickly in Nevada?

The state has ideal conditions for solar deployment: abundant sunshine, and — critically — vast available federal land near major load centers like Las Vegas and Reno.

This geographic advantage has enabled large solar farms with co-located batteries that achieve significant economies of scale. (It also creates significant risk going forward given the Trump administration's recent policy changes favoring older energy industries.)

Nevada's transformation from coal state to solar and storage leader has also been driven by some of the smartest, most supportive clean energy policies in the country.

In 2019, Nevada's legislature increased the state's renewable portfolio standard (RPS), jumping from 25% to 50% by 2030, with a goal to be 100% carbon-neutral by 2050. The utility NV Energy responded immediately with an ambitious plan to add 1,200 MW of solar and 590 MW of battery storage by 2023.

The law also included provisions discouraging fossil fuels, prohibiting new coal, and limiting gas expansion. This effectively nudged the utility to use batteries for reliability instead of the gas peakers that utilities have traditionally relied on.

Another key driver is Nevada's opportunity to export power to California. Developers can store surplus solar generation and export it across state lines during evening hours when California prices are high.

As part of the Western Energy Imbalance Market, Nevada has seen multiple days where evening power prices in California spiked above $1,000 megawatts an hour — creating lucrative opportunities for battery discharge.

Lessons learned from the Silver State's Solar Boom

Nevada generated just under 30% of its electricity from utility-scale solar in 2024—three times the U.S. average. No state has a higher solar penetration rate, not even California.

And its success scaling solar and storage provides reasons for optimism. Nevada's emergence as a battery storage leader follows a familiar pattern in America's energy transition. In the early 2010s, Iowa and Texas pioneered utility-scale wind development thanks to exceptional resources and supportive policies. A few years later, California and North Carolina led the country's initial solar boom.

Today, Nevada is playing that same pioneering role for battery storage. Its combination of high solar penetration, perfect geography, and smart policy frameworks has made it an early adopter of a technology that will soon become ubiquitous.

Nevada won't be the last storage success story. Just as wind spread from Iowa and Texas to Oklahoma and Kansas, and solar expanded beyond California to states like Arizona and Florida, battery storage will likely proliferate across the country. Nevada is simply an early adopter of a technology that is quickly becoming essential to America's clean energy future.
