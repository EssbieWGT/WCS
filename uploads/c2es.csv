Two sites are available for lease, including a 95-acre parcel and up to 150 acres at the East Tennessee Technology Park.

Companies must also propose how they will power the energy-intensive data centers, either by building a new power plant or partnering with one.

This initiative is part of the Trump administration's goal to accelerate the development of data center infrastructure on federal land.

Private companies can now compete to build AI data centers and power plants on federal land in Oak Ridge.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced earlier this year that Oak Ridge was one of four sites selected to move forward with AI data centers, which offer storage for networked computer servers that process and manage massive amounts of information.

The energy department is now asking companies to get specific, and began requesting proposals Sept. 30, allowing interested parties to share their ideas for data centers − and for how they would be powered. The project also might support a core goal of President Donald Trump’s administration: “unleashing American energy.”

Trump has issued a series of executive orders in his second term intended to make the United States a leader in the construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. A July order specifically aimed to speed up the review of permits for data centers planned on federal land while reducing the regulations needed to build them.

What could companies do with data centers in Oak Ridge?

Whichever company – or companies – the government selects will lease land for the projects from the federal government. The lease terms would be negotiable, a Department of Energy spokesperson told Knox News via email.

Companies have until Dec. 1 to tell the energy department about their plans for two pieces of land. One covers about 95 acres in Oak Ridge − north of the intersection of Bethel Valley Road and Tennessee Highway 95 − and the other spans up to 150 acres in the East Tennessee Technology Park that housed Manhattan Project sites.

The Department of Energy's request lists options for each piece of land. The 95-acre site should accomodate a data center, while the Heritage Center could be used for another center, a power plant to support the center or both.

Data centers need a lot of power. The industry’s yearly energy use amounted to about 4.4% of the total energy used in the United States in 2024, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The energy department is asking companies to offer plans that show some way of meeting that demand, either through building a new power producer or through partnering with a separate, new energy-generating venture in the region.

The Oak Ridge area’s proximity to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s grid is listed in the request as a regional strength for East Tennessee.

The National Nuclear Security Administration also published a request for proposals for its Savannah River Site in South Carolina on Sept. 30. Like Oak Ridge, the Savannah River Reservation houses a national lab. It also produces tritium, a key component of nuclear weapons.

How long will it take to build the data center?

Knox News reported earlier this year the Trump administration hopes some data centers on federal property could start operating in 2027.

The timeframe the Department of Energy outlined in the request it published in September asks companies to show they can spend up to 18 months with site development and up to two years building facilities.

And if a company wants to build its own power producer, it should prove the technology behind whatever’s generating electricity will be usable and available by the time the data center starts working, energy department staffers said in their request.

Companies will be judged to determine whether their proposals are financially and technologically feasible, according to a Department of Energy news release. The government also wants to know how any interested parties plan to handle regulations and permitting.","https://www.knoxnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/04/PKNS/82886154007-ornl-wright-sy-0969.jpg?crop=6052,3404,x0,y315&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 05:57:54.215839

On today’s episode of Inside Automotive, NADA board member and Mercedes-Benz New London President and Owner, Jeff Aiosa, shares his perspective on the expiration and how it will likely affect the industry moving forward.

The automotive industry continues to face significant challenges as it transitions to an electric future. The expiration of federal tax credits will further slow the transition. However, Aiosa remains optimistic about the long-term future and that EV adoptions will continue to grow.

""I often say we're on an irreversible path to electrification. I feel that the timeline is much longer than what was initially anticipated.""

When electric vehicles are more aligned in terms of price and range with their ICE counterparts and there’s a better public charging infrastructure, Aiosa believes EVs will become more appealing to consumers and adoption will grow. Currently, there are approximately 135,000 to 140,000 electric vehicles unsold on dealer lots nationwide, leaving work to be done for both the new and pre-owned markets.

EV prices and sales after tax credit expiration

The sudden surge in EV purchases, as customers rushed to take advantage of the incentives before they expired, has pushed up the prices of used EVs, and they’re starting to creep closer to the prices of ICE vehicles. Despite this, they’re still a more affordable buy, as EVs typically depreciate by roughly 30% in the first year, significantly more than gas vehicles.

New vehicle sales are hovering around a SAAR of 16 million, with battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) representing roughly 8% of that total year-to-date. About half of that share is Tesla. With the federal incentives now gone, EV sales could be cut roughly in half.

Hybrids are easing the customer transition to electric

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have effectively helped customers transition to electric. The $7,500 incentive often persuaded customers to lease a PHEV, and many returned to the store satisfied with their vehicle. Approximately half of those customers stick with EVs for their next lease or purchase.

The federal tax incentive made it easier to sell EVs. However, with it now being gone, salespeople need to start getting more hands-on experience with the vehicles. Sellers who drive an EV as their personal vehicle often have an easier time selling them. Dealership staff who invest time in learning more about EVs and feel confident discussing their benefits and features will find it easier to sell their inventory in the future.

Impact of tariffs on affordability and ownership trends

Early pent-up demand in response to President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs temporarily accelerates sales. However, the full impact on 2025 vehicles was muted with no significant price increases. For the 2026 model year, prices have risen about 3% on average and could increase up to 15%. This increase will impact manufacturers, dealers and consumers alike.

Affordability remains a significant concern, with new vehicle prices averaging around $50,000. The pressure is pushing the average ownership cycle to 13 years, impacting new-vehicle sales, used-vehicle inventory and fleet turnover.

What’s next for the EV market?

As EV technology improves to provide extended range and the nation’s public charging infrastructure expands, Aiosa believes that consumers will adopt EVs more readily. While it will take longer than initially expected, the future for EVs remains promising.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10.09.25-Jeff-Aiosa-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 05:57:50.119998

The project, known as the Chula Vista Energy Center 2, will be developed by Wellhead Electric Company on a parcel that already hosts a natural gas power generation facility built in 2000.
The project cleared city safety reviews — including from the Chula Vista Fire Department and the Engineering and Capital Projects Department — and will follow state and federal codes under third-party fire engineer supervision.
McCann said the council’s unanimous vote reflected confidence in the system’s safety and its benefit to the city’s clean energy goals.
“It’s great because this project is going to generate millions of dollars in taxes and economic development that together will bring real value to Chula Vista and the local economy,” he said.","Chula Vista will soon be home to a 50-megawatt battery storage facility after the City Council on Tuesday unanimously approved the project, calling it a key piece of the city’s plan to expand renewable energy and improve grid reliability.

The project, known as the Chula Vista Energy Center 2, will be developed by Wellhead Electric Company on a parcel that already hosts a natural gas power generation facility built in 2000. The new installation will use containerized lithium-ion batteries to store excess renewable electricity and discharge it during peak hours or grid emergencies.

Mayor John McCann said the city took extra precautions in reviewing the proposal, noting lessons learned from older battery facilities that experienced fires in Otay Mesa and Escondido.

“We did our due diligence, and the technology that they’re using is far superior and up to date and new,” McCann said Wednesday. “They also are outdoors and not in a warehouse. So I think we did our due diligence in making sure that these battery systems would be as safe as possible.”

The project site at 3497 Main St. lies between Del Monte Avenue and Reed Court in a limited industrial zone, buffered from nearby residential areas by existing landscaping and fencing. The facility will occupy the northern section of the property, operating independently from the gas plant on the southern portion.

The system will consist of 56 temperature-controlled containers housing lithium-ion batteries, supported by transformers, electrical cabinets and substation improvements. A second phase of the project will add additional containers over time to offset gradual battery capacity loss, maintaining the site’s total capacity of 50 megawatts.

The project cleared city safety reviews — including from the Chula Vista Fire Department and the Engineering and Capital Projects Department — and will follow state and federal codes under third-party fire engineer supervision.

McCann said the council’s unanimous vote reflected confidence in the system’s safety and its benefit to the city’s clean energy goals.

“It’s great because this project is going to generate millions of dollars in taxes and economic development that together will bring real value to Chula Vista and the local economy,” he said.

Wellhead Electric President Harold Dittmer said the project will cost around $75 million and will feature “purpose-built containers that are tested and engineered like crazy,” using Tesla Megapack 2 technology and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which he described as safer and more stable than earlier versions.

“We had to work with the fire department and make sure that all of the codes are met and the spacing is far enough apart so that if one does happen to catch on fire, it doesn’t start the neighbor,” Dittmer said Wednesday. “The last thing in the world we want to do as long-term owners of these things is build something unsafe.”

McCann said the city did not contribute any public funds toward the project as Wellhead Electric owns the property and is financing construction privately.

“There was already an existing facility there,” McCann said. “Wellhead actually owns the property, and was just expanding on the property that they owned.”

He said the project represents private investment in local clean-energy infrastructure and will benefit the community through job creation and new revenue.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SUT-L-ENERSMART-BATTERIES-0609-01.jpg?w=1024&h=813,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:17.404220

So it’s hardly shocking that many former EV owners say they’d consider returning to battery power only if a generous incentive were back on the table, according to a recent study from The Harris Poll.

Read: Expiring EV Tax Credit Sent Tesla Sales Into Overdrive But Its Flagships Crashed

The survey, conducted between September 23 and 25, included responses from 2,095 adults across the United States. Of these, 1,675 participants, or about 80 percent, said they plan to buy or lease a new or used vehicle in the future. Within that group, 485 respondents, roughly 29 percent, said they were extremely or somewhat likely to choose an EV.

What Would It Take?

Among respondents who had previously owned or driven an electric vehicle but later switched away, 60 percent said they would need an incentive of at least $5,000 to consider returning to an EV.

A further 30 percent said they would need an incentive of between $2,500 and $4,999 to reconsider, while 11 percent said they would be willing to accept an incentive of less than $2,500.

Senior consultant at The Harris Poll, Greg Paratore, acknowledged that affordability remains the top concern for 64 percent of EV buyers.

Automakers Step In

While the removal of the new and used EV tax credit will impact demand for electric cars, Paratore noted that automakers could use the removal of the credit to build extra trust with consumers by helping to share the added cost burden.

For example, Hyundai recently announced it’s cutting prices of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by a significant $9,800 in the wake of the tax credit’s removal. Additionally, Hyundai is offering a $7,500 cash incentive on the remaining 2025 Ioniq 5s that it has in its inventory.

Meanwhile, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned that EV demand in the U.S. could tumble by as much as half due to the tax credit’s removal.

In New Jersey, meanwhile, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill has campaigned heavily on cracking down on the PJM if elected next month.","In August, the PJM Interconnection put out a “conceptual proposal” outlining potential new rules that would clear space on the nation’s largest grid by forcing large power users — namely, giant data centers — to cut back on electricity consumption during shortages. Hyperscalers had just begun endorsing the idea, popularized in a landmark Duke University paper, that occasionally dialing down data centers could help make the most of the existing grid — and potentially allow more server farms to come online before new power plants can be built.

However, in their public comments the big tech companies balked at the pitch, repeatedly accusing PJM of “exceeding” its authority. And last week, six of the biggest power users that would be subject to the rules — the tech giants Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and the utilities Calpine, Constellation, and Talen — proposed an alternative.

Acknowledging the need for load flexibility, they pitched the idea that data centers cut back on power usage just 24 to 100 hours per year, and only on a voluntary basis. Aniruddh Mohan, an energy associate at the consultancy The Brattle Group, said that could be sufficient, though it’s no guarantee.

“If sufficient large loads volunteered to provide demand response, it is possible that 24 to 100 hours per year of demand response could be sufficient for reliability under many conditions,” Mohan told Latitude Media via email. “If it turns out we still need more supply, it’s unclear how much more additional generation and storage can be brought online within the next five years.”

PJM issued a forecast last month calling for at least five gigawatts of load flexibility by 2030. While flexibility “conceptually is a good thing,” former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member Allison Clements explained on a recent Latitude Dispatch about PJM, it’s essentially a stop-gap measure for a grid plagued by bottlenecks and delays, and “not ideal from an efficiency or an economic perspective.”

As a secondary measure, the companies called on PJM to establish a new procedure that would trigger data centers to go off-grid and switch to on-site back-up generators. The proposal also calls for setting up a new procurement process that would lock in today’s current high prices for seven years, giving developers an extra incentive to invest in new clean, firm power plants to meet surging demand.

But they also acknowledged that the system may ultimately need less new generation than the hype today suggests.

Grid operators’ load-growth forecasts tend to come from transmission owners. In Texas, the ERCOT receives those estimates but modifies the forecasts based on factors such as how successfully large power users, like data centers, managed to come online. The PJM currently does not have that same kind of check on its forecasts.

The hyperscalers’ pitch called for implementing corrections based on a range of factors, including those that have nothing to do with generation, such as the availability of the microchips needed over the next five years to actually construct proposed data centers. ERCOT, for example, reduces all new data center demand by about half, based on the average number of proposed new server farms that entered into service between 2022 and 2024.

PJM has signaled interest in adjusting its load forecasting, including giving state regulators the chance to review and provide feedback before the grid operator finalizes load forecasts. “As the load forecast is driving these reliability considerations, this is definitely worth examining closely,” Mohan said.

But revising estimates’ enough to bend the curve on how much power is needed on the grid “is somewhat wishful thinking,” said Daniel King, a research fellow at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation.

“Even if, frankly, load forecasts do improve, it won’t be by the nearly double-digit gigawatt amounts that will really tip the scales or change the fact that we’re in the situation of pretty great resource inadequacy,” King told Latitude Media.

One thing the proposal’s nine-page slidedeck does not include: an idea for how PJM should speed up interconnections, a key consideration for bringing new power sources onto the grid.

But other pitches submitted to PJM do mention the interconnection queue. The grid operator has set a deadline of December for submitting a final proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

In the meantime, different parties have until October 14 to submit counter proposals. Then the PJM will negotiate a deal that draws from the range of solutions put forward. Once that blended proposal is public, stakeholders will have time to comment before PJM holds a final vote on what goes to FERC.

The talks come amid mounting political pressure on PJM to curb soaring electricity prices. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro held a 13-state summit two weeks ago to convene governments from every state in the PJM system and discuss ways to pressure the grid operator to bring new generation online faster and at lower rates. If that fails, the Democrat said, Pennsylvania may consider exiting the grid operator altogether and forming its own statewide market like those in New York and California.

PETERSBURG — Arevon Energy, Inc. has announced that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts of new domestic solar power to the grid and are the company’s first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was hosted to commemorate the start of operations at Ratts 1 and Heirloom. Speaking at the ribbon-cutting were Kevin Smith, Chief Executive Officer at Arevon; Jill Hyneman, Executive Director at Pike County Chamber of Commerce; and Aaron Meyer Principal at Winslow Elementary School.

“Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,” said Smith. “These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County’s economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana’s future.”

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects and also brought about an increase in spending at local stores, hotels, and restaurants. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency, and Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

“The Ratts 1 project is a great addition to IMPA’s power supply portfolio,” said Senior Vice President, Market Operations and Planning at IMPA Kyle Brouillette. “This solar site helps us further diversify our resources, assisting in our mission to provide low-cost, reliable, and environmentally responsible power. We’re glad to be a part of Arevon’s project and celebrate this milestone in energy production.”

To date, Arevon has partnered with and supported the following local organizations and initiatives: the Pike County Affordable Housing Program, Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Department, Elmer Buchta Technology Center, Pike County Chamber of Commerce, Pike County 4-H Fair, Pike County High School Career Fair, among others.

“Pike County is an energy community, and renewable energy sources are a piece of our diversified energy strategy. We are grateful for Arevon’s investment in our area,” said Ashley Willis, MPA, EDFP, executive director at the Pike County Economic Development Corporation. “Solar power is a wonderful asset for rural communities, like Pike County, to increase assessed value and has had a positive impact on our tax revenue for our taxing districts.”

Arevon is actively growing its portfolio in the Midwest region of the United States. Besides Ratts 1 and Heirloom, the company is currently constructing the two-phase 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri. In addition, Arevon developed and managed construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana Public Service Company, or NIPSCO, and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company. Arevon is also actively advancing development on other proposed renewable energy facilities in the region.

“Our county’s legacy in energy production is strong, and now we’re building on that foundation,” said Executive Director at Pike County Chamber of Commerce Jill Hyneman. “By welcoming solar investment, Pike County is showing that honoring our past and investing in our future can go hand-in-hand in strengthening our economy, our schools, and our community for generations to come.”",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Arevon-Pike-County-Solar-Power-Project-Ribbon-Cutting-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:22.204003

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars.
However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.
“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said.
While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.","Despite efforts at the federal level to curb California’s clean-air vehicle initiatives, including the phase out of gas-powered vehicles, optimism remains on the future of electric vehicles in the state.

Yan Searcy, dean of California State University, Northridge’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, home of both CSUN’s Institute for Sustainability and its master’s degree in Sustainability Program, said the positive outlook comes despite federal government challenges related to environmental policies, including Pres. Donald Trump’s signing of congressional bill overturning California’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban.

While Searcy said the state’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban was always “an ambitious goal,” he remains optimistic as the infrastructure that has been built over the past decade in support of EVs and consumer buy-in that has followed.

“The state has always been the site of innovation when it comes to transportation and that’s going to continue in spite of what is going on in Washington,” Searcy said. “The EV industry is thriving, and I expect more people to buy-in when it comes to zero-emission vehicles in California.”

The positive outlook comes as federal tax credits for zero-emission vehicles — up to $7,500 for car buyers — is set to expire on Sept. 30 after Trump signed his legislative bill in July.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars. However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.

“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said. “We had to make it financially attractive for people to take a chance on what at the time was this new technology.

“It seems in California specifically, every third car appears to be a Tesla,” he continued. “You go to shopping malls and there used to be one or two spaces for EVs, now there’s entire sections for vehicle charging, and that can be attributed to having buy-in from people over a number of years.”

That momentum won’t stop anytime soon, Searcy said, despite controversy earlier this year when it came to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his political activity. While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.

“It was never about electric cars, people might have had second thoughts when it came to buying an Elon Musk product, but they don’t regret buying the electric car,” Searcy said.

There are also more options than a decade ago when it comes to electric vehicles, Searcy noted, pointing out that car brands like Lucid and Rivian have also broken into the EV car market. Rideshare companies like Waymo, which utilizes driverless EVs and have also sprung up in major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, are attracting younger audiences in the process.

All of this, Searcy said, makes him confident Californians will continue their support of EVs and their positive impact on the environment.

“We’re raising a generation that is keen on sustainability and we’re not going back,” Searcy said. “There has also been a change in less than one generation in other ways when it comes to being sustainable; everybody now has their own water bottle and that’s just water. At least we can say Southern California was able to do that in less than one generation and I think we will look at EVs the same way in the years to come.”",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charging_City_Hall_04_2015_SFO_2649-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-08 23:58:31.862687

""","Last spring, tens of millions of people lost electricity across Spain, Portugal and part of France. Trains stopped in their tracks, and people were stuck in elevators, as southwestern Europe went without power for — in some cases — more than ten hours.

Immediately the finger-point began. Many people blamed solar and wind energy. Spain, one of Europe's front runners in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to the think tank Ember— sometimes more than 70%.

In the hours after the outage The Daily Mail published the headline ""Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?""

And on the day of the outage U.S. energy secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright went on CNBC to talk about the outage and criticized solar and wind. ""When you hitch your wagon to the weather,"" Wright said, ""it's just a risky endeavor.""

The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky and unreliable is a common talking point for critics of renewable energy, often repeated by groups with ties to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable.

Now a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators details what happened. The report finds that for the first time in Europe, a voltage surge caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to remain within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a power grid with too much wind or solar, says Chris Rosslowe, a senior energy analyst at Ember who was not involved in drafting the report.

""It contradicts the numerous claims that we've seen that an overreliance on renewables was the cause,"" Rosslowe says. ""That is clearly not true.""

But the misinformation about solar and wind energy causing the outage has had an impact. A new survey found that a majority of Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the blackout, and the most common was that too much reliance on renewable energy was to blame.

Countries around the world are using renewable energy to move away from polluting fossil fuels. That's why it's so important to counter false narratives about solar and wind, says Philip Newell, communications co-chair of the Climate Action Against Disinformation, a coalition of nonprofits.

""This content makes it seem more normal and feel more normal to hate on renewables,"" Newell says. ""Even though they're a solution to climate change.""

What did happen before the outage

The new report from the European grid operators' expert panel found multiple triggers shortly before the blackout.

First, oscillations, or sudden swings in power flow, hit the grid. It's still unclear what caused them. Spain's main grid operator took steps to control the oscillations, including sending less power to France. While these actions helped dampen the oscillations, they caused the voltage to surge upwards.

Voltage is like pressure in a water system. Just like it's key to have a certain amount of pressure for water to flow, there needs to be a certain amount of voltage to push electrons through a circuit. But voltage can't be too high, or it can cause short circuits or even fires.

When the voltage surged, transformers and power plants shut down. Antonio Gómez-Expósito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville, says the outage shows that Spain needs more regulations around controlling voltage.

The expert panel report, like other recent analyses from Spain's government and main grid operator, does not indicate that reliance on solar or wind power led to the outage. The panel will issue a final report next year.

Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions. ""We've known this has been a recurring issue,"" Newell says. ""The big frame is that 'renewables are bad and we can't trust them'.""

Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of ""inertia"" - it wasn't

When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.

Michael Shellenberger, a longtime critic of renewable energy and proponent of nuclear power with 1.4 million followers on X, said in a post the day of the blackout, ""Renewables don't risk blackouts, said the media. But they did and they do… it's clear that too little 'inertia' due to excess solar resulted in system collapse.""

Inertia is important to the electrical grid because it can help stabilize sudden fluctuations in a grid's frequency. Power plants that run on gas, coal or nuclear use large spinning turbines that create electricity and have inertia. More modern power resources, like wind, solar, and batteries, don't involve inertia, because they are digitally controlled. ""Wind and solar plants either have no inertia or very little,"" Gómez-Expósito says, ""but in return, they have infinitely greater response speeds.""

There is no indication that a lack of inertia was the cause of the outage, Gómez-Expósito says. Spain's main grid operator, Red Eléctrica, released a report about the outage this summer. ""The incident was not caused by an inertia problem,"" it said in a press release.

Renewable misinformation has an impact

False claims that too much reliance on solar and wind caused the blackout in Spain and Portugal fit into broader attacks on renewable energy.

In winter 2021, a massive power outage hit Texas. Investigations ultimately found that the outage's cause was gas and coal plants that were forced offline because of freezing temperatures. But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.

""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. "" Sort of exploiting, taking advantage of a crisis to make unfounded accusations.""

Shortly after the power went out in Spain, Newell and his team from the Climate Action Against Disinformation Coalition decided to do a survey about false narratives in the blackout's wake. They surveyed 1,200 people in Spain and 1,200 in the United Kingdom – because many in the U.K. were also paying attention to the outage.

They found seven in ten in Spain and six in ten in the U.K. fell for at least one false narrative about the blackout causes. The most commonly believed false narrative was that the reliance on renewables was at fault.

Newell says while most of the survey respondents acknowledge the reality of climate change, misinformation led many to question the reliability of renewable energy.

Renewable energy plus batteries proving to be reliable in warming world

Solar and wind resources are already proving to be part of a reliable grid, says Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available.

Mainzer says the key is pairing solar and wind energy with massive batteries. Batteries are especially important with solar, as they absorb excess solar energy during the day, and send it back into the grid after the sun sets and evening demand stays high, Mainzer says.

Mainzer says older power sources have their own problems. California faces a loss of hydropower during droughts. And Mainzer says, gas power plants have some reliability challenges, too.

"" During the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain,"" Mainzer says. ""They have to run harder, they mechanically get challenged, and we tend to see a higher outage rate amongst the gas fleet when the temperatures are really, really hot.""

Mainzer says the use of solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in California in 2022 when there was a heatwave hitting much of the state and gas plants were under performing. Texas' main grid operator, ERCOT, has also said that an increase in solar and battery storage has helped the state avoid power outages — especially as the state sees unexpected outages with coal plants.

As the planet sees longer and more intense heat waves with global warming, primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels, Mainzer says solar combined with batteries, both of which perform well in the heat, will be important to keep the lights on.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5568x3132+0+580/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F27%2Ffcd62c2446ce8689ab81442b1d93%2Fgettyimages-2211918663.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 23:58:44.862253

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

When a massive power outage hit Spain and Portugal last spring, there were all kinds of rumors about the cause. Now the findings of an expert panel are out, and the report contradicts one big line of misinformation, as NPR's Julia Simon reports.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In the hours and days after the outage, there was a lot of finger-pointing - it was a cyberattack. It was Russia.

CHRIS ROSSLOWE: Well, almost immediately, theories started circulating.

SIMON: Chris Rosslowe is an energy analyst with the think tank Ember.

ROSSLOWE: It wasn't a good time for getting to the truth.

SIMON: For many people, there was one prime suspect - solar and wind power. Spain, a leader in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to Ember. Sometimes more than 70%. On the day of the blackout, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright went on CNBC and criticized renewables.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: You know, when you hitch your wagon to the weather, it's just a risky endeavor.

SIMON: But a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators does not implicate renewables. It finds a surge in voltage caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to be within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a grid that's overreliant on wind and solar, says Antonio Gomez-Exposito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville.

ANTONIO GOMEZ-EXPOSITO: (Speaking Spanish).

SIMON: ""The problem isn't whether there are too many renewables,"" he says. Reports on the outage from Spain's government and main grid operator echo this point. Gomez-Exposito says he thinks Spain needs more regulations around voltage.

The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky is a common narrative of critics, many tied to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable. Still, in Spain, the misinformation had an impact. A new survey finds 7 out of 10 Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the outage. The most common? A grid with too much renewable energy was to blame.

Philip Newell is communications co-chair of Climate Action Against Disinformation, the coalition of nonprofits that commissioned the survey. False narratives against solar and wind, he says, are a recurring issue.

PHILIP NEWELL: This content makes it seem more normal and feel normal to hate on renewables. And the big frame is that renewables are bad and we can't trust them.

SIMON: Newell says it's important to counter this misinformation as countries around the world increasingly use renewable energy to move away from planet-heating fossil fuels. Grid operators from Texas to Australia are finding that renewables plus batteries are cost-effective and stable. Elliot Mainzer is chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. He says solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in 2022, when a heat wave hit California and gas plants were underperforming.

ELLIOT MAINZER: Especially during the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, that the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain. They have to run harder.

That's the Point. - Heatmap News",Andrew Moseman,,,,,https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-standard-ford-hyundai,"The impending end of the tax credit on September 30 helped propel Tesla to record sales numbers in the third quarter of 2025.
The tax credit deadline had looked like one that would demarcate two distinct EV eras, with October 1 acting as the beginning of new, less-affordable time.
By making the down payment before the end of September, Ford and GM qualified these vehicles for the federal tax benefit.
Incentives like the federal tax credit for EVs aren’t meant to last forever, of course.
Ford has only just announced a roadmap to overhaul its entire EV production system in order to stop losing billions on electric vehicles.","We finally know what Tesla means by an “affordable” electric vehicle. On Tuesday, the electric automaker revealed the stripped-down, less-fancy “Standard” version of its best-selling Model Y crossover and Model 3 sedan. These EVs will sell for several thousand dollars less than the existing versions, which are now rebranded as “Premium.”

These slightly cheaper Ys and 3s aren’t exactly the $25,000 baby Tesla that many fans and investors have anticipated for years. But the announcement is an indication of where the electric vehicle market in the United States may be headed now that the $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing an EV is dead and gone. Automakers have spent the past few months rejiggering their lineups and slashing prices as much as they can to make sure sales don’t crater without the federal incentive.

The impending end of the tax credit on September 30 helped propel Tesla to record sales numbers in the third quarter of 2025. It was a stark reversal from months of disappointing sales stemming from factors like increased competition and Elon Musk’s political antics that alienated potential buyers. Money talks, of course; Tesla sent me a blitz of emails to make sure I didn’t forget what a good deal I could get before September’s end. But now, with the deadline passed, Musk’s company needed a new shot in the arm to stop sales from falling off a cliff.

The budget Teslas are, indeed, lesser vehicles. They have simpler headlights, less power, and less range than the now-Premium versions. They even come in fewer colors. But the prices — $40,000 for a Model Y Standard and $37,000 for a Model 3 Standard — effectively mirror what those cars would have cost if the tax credit were still in place. In other words, you can still buy a Tesla in the $35,000 to $40,000 range. It just won’t be as good a Tesla as you used to be able to get for the money.

The tax credit deadline had looked like one that would demarcate two distinct EV eras, with October 1 acting as the beginning of new, less-affordable time. But it turns out things aren’t quite so black and white. Lots of automakers are experimenting with ways to soften the financial blow for those who still want to get into an EV. After all, there’s always a loophole.

For example, as the September tax credit deadline approached, Reuters reported on a scheme orchestrated by Ford and General Motors to allow the American car giants to keep the good times going by buying their own cars. It goes like this: Before the September 30 deadline, the financing arms of these big corporations began the process of purchasing a host of their own vehicles from their dealerships. By making the down payment before the end of September, Ford and GM qualified these vehicles for the federal tax benefit. (They even checked with the IRS to make sure this plot was legitimate, Reuters said.) They plan to pass on the savings by leasing those vehicles back to everyday Americans.

According to Car and Driver, a number of citizens did something similar to what the corporations devised — that is, some buyers made their first payments on EVs that won’t be delivered to them for weeks or months in order to qualify for the tax break. These shenanigans are for the short term, though. Ford and GM could pre-purchase only so many of their own vehicles, and Ford said this deal effectively extends the tax credit only another quarter, through the end of December.

The bigger question is whether the automakers can — or will — simply cut prices on their EVs to make the loss of federal incentives sting a little less.

That’s the plan at Hyundai. The Korean giant has announced an enormous price cut on its successful Ioniq 5, one that more than makes up for the vanishing federal incentive. The most basic version of that car will fall from $42,600 to $35,000, putting it on par with the Chevy Equinox EV that’s been a hit at that price. Fancier versions of the Ioniq 5 will fall by more than $9,000 for the 2026 model year. Hyundai and its partner Kia are offering some of the best October lease deals, too.

Other car companies have begun to follow suit. BMW will simply offer a $7,500 discount on its electric models for those who take delivery by the end of October. Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, and others, will do the same for electric sales through the end of the year. No word yet on what happens after these deals expire.

Incentives like the federal tax credit for EVs aren’t meant to last forever, of course. In theory, their purpose is to lift up a new technology until it can compete at scale with the tech that has been around forever.

Whether electric cars have reached that point is a contentious question. Ford has only just announced a roadmap to overhaul its entire EV production system in order to stop losing billions on electric vehicles. Hyundai’s EVs are profitable — or, at least they were before the Trump administration began monkeying with tax incentives and tariffs. A batch of more affordable EVs are on the way, though the ever-changing map of tariffs makes it unclear exactly how much they’ll cost when they finally arrive.

The short-term picture may well be that electric cars continue to be a loss leader for some automakers still trying to find their footing in the space. Whether their shareholders will tolerate this long enough for the margins to become sustainable — well, that’s the real question.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTcyNzcyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDE0NTk0OX0.kMqBwyLpWQ5sPYyLehfQIcStDnAkDON7JIySe8XGkwE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-08 23:58:59.120253

Since January, the Trump administration has made deep cuts to the nation’s science funding, including more than $1 billion in grants to the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the basic research at universities and federal laboratories, and $4.5 billion to the National Institutes of Health. Thousands of jobs for scientists and staff members have been terminated or frozen at these and other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Park Service.

To thousands of researchers — veteran scientists and new grad students, at state universities and Ivy League institutions alike — these sweeping reductions translate as direct personal losses: a layoff, a shuttered lab, a yearslong experiment or field study abruptly ended, graduate students turned away; lost knowledge, lost progress, lost investment, lost stability; dreams deferred or foreclosed.

“This government upheaval is discouraging to all scientists who give their time and lend their brilliance to solve the problems beleaguering humankind instead of turning to some other activity that makes a more steady living,” Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an email.

Next year looks to be worse.

Renewable electricity generation continues to grow rapidly worldwide, despite recent U.S. policy shifts, with global capacity expected to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

MORE: Hidden source of clean energy could power Earth for 170,000 years

Compared to last year, the IEA says pullbacks on renewables in the U.S. and China led to a slight reduction in its five-year global renewable energy growth forecast; however, even with the weaker prospects in those two countries, the agency reports that solar power continues to drive record growth.

In the U.S., the downward revision is primarily due to the early phase-out of federal tax incentives and other regulatory changes, which have lowered growth expectations by almost 50%. Still, the IEA said that in 2024, solar and wind accounted for 16% of total electricity in the U.S., surpassing coal.

While China and the U.S. may experience a downward trend in the growth of renewable energy sources, these losses are being offset by stronger outlooks in other regions, including India, Europe and most emerging and developing economies, where growth prospects have been revised upward due to ambitious new policies, including faster permitting.

And for the first half of 2025, record solar and steady wind growth led to renewables overtaking coal generation globally for the first time on record, according to a new report from Ember, an independent global energy think tank.

Renewables grew by 7.7% while coal generation recorded a decrease, according to Ember.

""Solar PV is on course to account for some 80% of the increase in the world's renewable capacity over the next five years,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.

The growth of renewable energy is not just confined to electricity generation. The IEA projects that renewable energy consumption in the transportation sector is expected to rise 50% by 2030. This surge will be driven by increased use of renewable electricity, liquid biofuels, biogases and renewable hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels.

A significant portion of this growth is expected to come from the continued expansion of electric vehicles, particularly in China and Europe, which are projected to account for 45% of the anticipated increase over the next five years.

MORE: Batteries, solar, wind and hydropower: Why renewable energy is essential to curbing climate change

The IEA highlights that surging energy consumption will likely not derail global sustainability efforts, as rapidly expanding low-emission energy sources, such as renewables and nuclear energy, will provide record-high electricity generation and offset additional global demand over the next three years. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and hydropower, are forecast to meet over 90% of the global electricity demand growth through 2030.

These changes are already delivering measurable environmental benefits. In 2024, carbon dioxide emissions in advanced economies dropped to their lowest level in 50 years. According to the IEA, the deployment of solar, wind, nuclear, electric cars, and heat pumps since 2019 is now preventing an estimated 2.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere each year.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e0TJDPUayGtnyKZWtiFR2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/0eba82bee8e58e03fb737d110a81f734,N,,2025-10-09 04:59:04.879007

Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans.
Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028.
Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.
“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says.","When I visited Hyundai Motor’s “Metaplant” in May to drive the new Ioniq9 electric SUV, the facility was a symbol of everything right about U.S. auto manufacturing. It’s a US $7.6 billion showpiece of automation staffed by gung-ho and highly skilled workers, capable of churning out 500,000 EVs a year at full crank. The biggest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history, the Metaplant is the linchpin of Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s bid to make the state the “electric mobility capital of the country.”

Then it all went wrong. On 4 September, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided the supersized facility in Ellabell, Ga., about one hour from Savannah. Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs. Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans. Following a week of detention, and tense negotiations between the South Korean and U.S. governments, the workers were ejected from the U.S. and sent home on a chartered plane. Outraged Korean officials opened an investigation into potential human rights abuses during the workers’ incarceration.

“America is not a safe place to work,” one of the workers told The New York Times, after his return home.

Production of the Ioniq9 and smaller Ioniq5 has proceeded apace. But the opening of the battery plant, jointly owned by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, has been pushed back by at least two months. And the episode laid bare some messy contradictions, as America seeks to stand up an EV-and-battery business that can compete against China.

The Trump Administration’s Mixed Messages Confuse Investors

President Trump has demanded that foreign companies build products in the U.S., using tariffs and other strongarm tactics to secure investment pledges. That contrasts with President Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered generous incentives to manufacturers and consumers. The Trump administration has also been nakedly hostile toward EVs and green initiatives, seeking to reverse Biden’s ambitious pollution and fuel-economy agenda, and deny the ability of California and other states to set their own greenhouse-gas standards. At the administration’s behest, the GOP-led Congress eliminated a $7,500 clean-car tax credit that ended Sept. 30. That tax break had spurred Hyundai to accelerate the Metaplant’s construction to make their EVs eligible for credits, and, over the years, had helped make EVs more affordable for hundreds of thousands of Americans. In the wary dalliance between Trump and manufacturers, there are enough mixed messages to keep a hundred dating apps buzzing.

“The Trump administration was raving about the plant, but then raided it less than two weeks later,” says Betony Jones, who served as senior advisor on labor to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Michigan’s former governor, and directed the Department of Energy’s office of energy jobs in the Biden administration. “It’s a confusing situation, and confusing for foreign investors,” she adds.

Trump insisted he had no intention of “frightening off” specialized workers such as the South Koreans, some of whom had helped build car, battery or semiconductor factories around the world, including in Michigan, Texas, Poland, Indonesia and the Middle East.

“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Responding to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Kush Desai, a White House deputy press secretary, said the President will support any company investing in the U.S. by slashing regulations and enabling them to bring in technical experts to set up facilities and train American workers. “Industry leaders in sectors ranging from autos to pharmaceuticals to technology have committed to investing trillions in the United States because they know they have a friend and ally in the White House,” Desai said.

Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028. The controversial raid comes at a fraught moment for EVs, amid slowing consumer demand and steep tariffs on raw materials and import cars, which have led many automakers to scale back electric plans and lean back into ICE cars and hybrids.

The raid, Jones says, also exposed familiar fault lines in labor and manufacturing. These included ones related to workplace safety and the proper role of foreign workers, and the tendency of foreign manufacturers to locate factories in the southern U.S., where they can operate free of union labor, often at lower wages. A TV station near the Hyundai complex, WTOC, had aired investigative reports about poor safety conditions and unauthorized labor at the plant. At least three workers have died there, according to law enforcement. Hyundai has sought to distance itself from the battery portion of the Metaplant, saying none of the foreign contractors were directly employed by the automaker. Both Hyundai and LG Energy Solution have begun their own inquiries into the raid, and have vowed to follow all laws and rules, including those for workplace safety.

Deportations Renew Attention to Visa Policy

In Georgia, many contract workers had arrived on six-month B1 visas issued for business travel, or through a visa-waiver program that allows stays of up to 90 days. Some companies, experts say, have played fast-and-loose with visa rules, in part because H-1B visas, which allow six-year stays for employees, are expensive and in short supply. Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.

“Previous U.S. administrations had largely turned a blind eye to” the visa abuses, according toThe Guardian.

The Trump administration now faces criticism for its new policy to charge $100,000 for those coveted H-1B visas, which some companies say would be counterproductive, unaffordable and potentially illegal. In Georgia, some local union workers said they had been unfairly bypassed for work in the battery plant.

“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says. “So what does that knowledge-transfer need to look like? How do we pivot from foreign workers and train up a U.S. workforce that has enough specialized skills to do those jobs?”

As General Motors pivoted to EVs, it struggled to scale up battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee, in a joint venture with LG Energy to manufacture a new line of batteries called Ultium Cells. The automaker’s “Factory Zero” in Detroit — where President Biden lauded GM CEO Mary Barra in 2021, and test-drove a GMC Hummer EV in a parking lot — also suffered glitches as GM sought to rush its batteries and EVs into production. That included a fire when a forklift pierced a stack of robotically-assembled batteries.

The Detroit factory was the American industry’s first attempt to scale up a fully automated assembly line to make pouch-style batteries (which have since been partially supplanted by prismatic cells). GM raced to bring in outside battery consultants and executives to fix battery and assembly issues, finally hiring former Tesla battery chief Kurt Kelty to run its battery operations. It paid off: after those frustrating growing pains, GM began cranking out Ultium batteries, and is now America’s leading producer of lithium-ion cells among automakers.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/aerial-view-of-the-hyundai-metaplant-shows-multiple-sprawling-buildings-shown-to-be-of-a-large-scale-by-comparison-to-some-cars.jpg?id=61673725&width=2000&height=1500&coordinates=272%2C0%2C273%2C0,N,,2025-10-08 22:01:17.373327

That program has absorbed the bulk of the population that would otherwise be using ACA tax credits to offset their costs.
This raises the possibility that some available revenues, including proceeds from enhanced tax credits, could be going unused.
The legislation cut off most legally present immigrants from eligibility for federal health programs, including ACA tax credits, starting in 2026.
Given these looming changes, the lost revenue associated with enhanced tax credits is one of many moving parts in a complicated financial structure.","As Washington skirmishes over the future of enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, New York has relatively little to gain or lose.

The number of New Yorkers using any ACA credits – enhanced or not – stands at about 119,000 or 0.6 percent of the population, the lowest proportion of any state other than the District of Columbia, according to the latest federal enrollment report.

That compares to utilization rates as high as 19 percent in Florida and 13 percent in Georgia and an average of 6 percent nationwide.

The driver of this disparity is New York’s Essential Plan, which offers zero-premium, government-funded coverage to residents up to 250 percent of the poverty level. That program has absorbed the bulk of the population that would otherwise be using ACA tax credits to offset their costs.

The Essential Plan also reaps the federal money that would otherwise have been spent on credits for its enrollees, covering all of its $14 billion budget.

Although the enhanced credits enacted in 2021 have nominally boosted that revenue by about $1 billion per year, it’s not clear the state is actually collecting that amount – because the program was unable to spend all of its available funding even before the enhancements took effect.

Still, the Hochul administration has joined a Democrat-led campaign to prevent the enhanced credits from expiring in December – and the state’s publicity materials portray the Essential Plan’s 1.7 million enrollees as having something to lose if that happens.

The original ACA tax credits were targeted to the working poor – people who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but didn’t have access to employer-sponsored health benefits and could not afford insurance on their own.

The law established a percentage of income that consumers were expected to pay toward their own coverage – on a sliding scale from 100 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level – and offered tax credits that were enough to cover the balance of a benchmark premium from coverage purchased through an ACA insurance exchange (see table).

As part of a pandemic relief package in 2021, Washington lawmakers enhanced the credits by lowering the share of income consumers were expected to contribute – to zero for incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty level and to no more than 8.5 percent at the high end. They also extended the credits to people of any income, ending what had been a benefit “cliff” at 400 percent of the poverty level.

As seen in the chart below, the biggest benefit of the enhancement went to people just above 400 percent of the poverty level, who saw their net costs cut in half. Based on a typical premium of $27,000, a family of four with income at 900 percent of the poverty level, or $289,000, could claim a credit of more than $2,000.

However, that would be an unusual scenario. Most Americans at that income level get health coverage through their employers – and have no reason to buy insurance directly. The bulk of people claiming ACA credits still fall below 400 percent of the poverty level.

New York’s ACA insurance change – known as the New York State of Health – said that 146,000 New Yorkers were benefiting from enhanced tax credits as of September 2024. This includes 43,000 or 29 percent with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level.

The report also said that federal funding for the Essential Plan “is estimated to be $1 billion higher as a result of these enhanced federal subsidies.”

That $1 billion figure is consistent with what the Health Department estimated when it applied for – and later received – federal authorization to extend the Essential Plan’s eligibility ceiling from 200 percent to 250 percent of the poverty level.

However, those same estimates indicated that the program’s revenue would exceed its costs by $1.4 billion even if the credits were allowed to expire – implying that the extra $1 billion was unnecessary in the near term.

Over its first nine years, excess revenue accumulated in the Essential Plan’s trust fund, which held a balance of $8.9 billion as of May, according to the state comptroller’s office. Since the program’s expansion took effect in April 2024, the comptroller’s records indicate that the trust fund balance is no longer growing because the state is now collecting only the federal revenue it needs to cover expenses. This raises the possibility that some available revenues, including proceeds from enhanced tax credits, could be going unused.

With enactment of President Trump’s tax- and budget-cutting package this summer, the Essential Plan’s well-cushioned finances are in jeopardy. The legislation cut off most legally present immigrants from eligibility for federal health programs, including ACA tax credits, starting in 2026. Some 730,000 of the affected immigrants are enrolled in the Essential Plan. Their departure will chop the plan’s revenue by more than half, or $7.6 billion.

In response, Governor Hochul has moved to unwind the program’s 2024 expansion. Officials say this would temporarily save the state money on covering about 500,000 of the affected immigrants but displace some 450,000 enrollees above 200 percent of the poverty level.

Given these looming changes, the lost revenue associated with enhanced tax credits is one of many moving parts in a complicated financial structure. As members of Congress consider whether that credits should be continued, the Hochul administration should do more to clarify how the money is being used now – and how it might be used going forward.",https://www.empirecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/capitol-720677_1280-e1759947097283.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:07.552701

The executive order has been used as an excuse by the Trump administration to give handouts to Big Oil and Gas executives while attacking affordable, clean energy, raising consumer costs and killing jobs in the process.

Sierra Club and nearly 170 other groups sent a letter to Senators asking them to support the resolution. The letter reads:

“President Trump’s declaration is a thinly-veiled attempt to ban cleaner and cheaper forms of energy and gut environmental protections in order to further enrich his oil and gas executive donors at the expense of our communities, property rights, and clean air and water.”

The groups cite a variety of reasons to support termination of the executive order including the administration’s attacks on grid stability, safety, and reliability, as well as undermining efforts to keep energy affordable for Americans, including rolling back energy efficiency standards.

In reaction, Sierra Club Director of Beyond Fossil Fuels Policy Mahyar Sorour issued the following statement:

“It has been painfully obvious from the beginning that the only reason Donald Trump declared an energy emergency was in order to line the pockets of his fossil fuel donors - he told us as much on the campaign trail. Now the American people are starting to feel the effects of higher energy prices because of this sham emergency and the subsequent attack on clean energy. We are grateful for the leadership of Senators Heinrich and Kaine and Senate Democrats to get rid of this disastrous executive order.”

The region has relied on companies like Engie to improve its energy sector alongside government subsidies and institutions. Now, Engie has revealed that it plans to expand its reach in specific markets instead of operating in too many countries, which undermines its long-term goals.

Engie aims to improve existing operations in the Middle East region

For any company the size of Engie, maintaining a smooth operation in several markets is key to its long-term plans for the energy sector. Engie has stated it plans to focus its energy on the Middle East region, where it hopes to expand its presence in several key markets.

The company is ramping up renewables, flexible power, and grid-stabilising technology in the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has been welcomed by the countries’ governments. In a recent interview, Engie’s leadership underscored the importance of adopting renewable energy generation.

“The ambitions for Engie in CO2 emissions reduction and net zero are stricter than the ambitions in the region. But we feel supported by the governments that have similar goals, even if the timelines sometimes differ.” – Engie’s Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) flexible power managing director Niko Cornelis

The company has stated that it plans to maintain a balanced approach to its legacy thermal and desalination operations, in line with a 2045 net-zero target. Not that long ago, the company was excited about the possibilities of the green hydrogen sector, but it has opted to focus on what it can control. The green hydrogen sector has seen significant investments in recent years, but a lack of optimism has led to the slow progress the sector has seen.

“What we have seen over the past two to three years is that while there were huge ambitions for green hydrogen, they were often based on optimistic assumptions about technological advances and cost reductions. For green hydrogen to truly scale, we need a viable offtake market — one that is prepared to absorb the premium costs that green hydrogen currently commands. This remains one of the biggest missing pieces in the ecosystem.” – Engie’s Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) flexible power managing director Niko Cornelis

Engie aims to position itself not as a developer, but as a long-term partner for the markets in the region

Keeping the renewable energy sector in mind, Engie has made several commitments to improving its portfolio in the region through a variety of projects, which include:

Battery energy storage systems (BESS)

low-carbon thermal power generation

desalination switching entirely to reverse osmosis (RO)

The transportation sector, which is directly linked to the energy sector, has seen a significant drop in traffic in the ports and rail networks of the world. Which could be solved by companies like Engie improving the existing infrastructure in markets where it already operates.

The project will produce deeply carbon-negative hydrogen from water without electricity for the mobility sector, setting a new benchmark for cost-effective decarbonization.

The project will be located at a dairy farm complex in California and will integrate dairy digester biogas systems with Utility's proprietary H2Gen technology to produce economical clean fuel for heavy-duty transportation. This innovative combination will deliver hydrogen with one of the lowest negative carbon intensity scores in the market and provide a scalable pathway to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation economically. The project has also secured initial offtake at attractive pricing to both partners.

Under the agreement, MEW will develop, build, and operate the anaerobic digesters and associated biogas treatment systems, while Utility will develop and operate the fuel production system. Together, the companies are demonstrating that collaboration across the agriculture and energy sectors can enable economic decarbonization at scale, further supporting the US's energy independence.

""This project is another breakthrough moment for Utility - proving that hydrogen fuel can be produced economically, without electricity, and at deeply negative carbon intensity – greener than 'green hydrogen' from renewable power,"" said Parker Meeks, CEO of Utility Global. ""Partnering with MEW allows us to unite world-class biogas expertise with our H2Gen® technology to deliver extremely clean fuel at scale and accelerate California's transition to zero-emission, heavy-duty transportation.""

""Maas Energy Works has always focused on turning dairy manure into biogas and clean energy,"" said Daryl Maas, CEO of Maas Energy Works. ""Partnering with Utility Global takes that innovation further -- producing carbon-negative hydrogen to power the growth of heavy-duty transportation.""

Once operational, the project is expected to produce approximately three tons per day of carbon-negative hydrogen fuel, creating a scalable solution to supply the growing network of hydrogen fueling stations across California. This fuel will play a critical role in enabling zero-emission trucks and buses to meet the state's leadership in climate and air quality targets.

The Utility Global–MEW collaboration represents an alternative model for the integration of bio-based clean fuels and industrial decarbonization technology. In addition to dairy farms, other sources of biogas like landfills and wastewater plants are also profitable opportunities for H2Gen to provide a practical and economic pathway to produce and decarbonize transportation fuels near the point of use. The project is currently in front-end engineering development, with final investment decision anticipated following completion of feasibility and design studies and finalization of binding offtake agreements in 2026.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Utility_MAW_9f500c6c4f.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:19.199291

The regulatory assault on renewable energy is broad and plainly at odds with Trump’s declaration of an energy emergency.
Even Saudi Arabia, the ultimate petrostate, is embracing renewable energy and seeking to acquire half of all its electricity from clean sources by 2030.
The rise of China as the clean energy superpower and the ambitions of a country like Saudi Arabia show that the U.S. is thinking small.","While the Trump administration has effectively declared war on wind and solar energy — blocking all permitting of projects on federal lands and pushing through a rollback of federal subsidies and tax credits — other nations are embracing renewable energy as a strategy for building economic and political strength. China remains the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases; however, it has also become the global leader in the manufacturing and deployment of renewable energy, electric vehicles and batteries, achieved through sustained industrial policy support that began a mere two decades ago.

The motivations were not primarily environmental. Chinese leaders saw these technologies as strategic industries of the future, and believed the country that dominated these technologies would gain economic and political advantage in the long run. Thus, clean technologies were included within China’s 2010 “Strategic Emerging Industries” policy and its “Made in China 2025” strategy.

Chinese thought leaders conceived of the strategy in epochal terms. The super power had missed out on each of the four major waves of industrialization technological change that had allowed European powers and the U.S. to become global hegemons and China’s elites and top academics were determined not to make the same mistake again. China’s Communist Party leadership saw clean technologies as part of a set of innovations, including artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, that were critical to Chinese modernization and global competition.

That dominance in clean technologies would enable China to position itself as a leader in global climate talks; build stronger ties with Global South countries in need of cheaper, cleaner energy; and reduce choking pollution within China was only further reason to go all in on clean technologies.

This strategy has been wildly successful. Today, China makes more than 70% of solar PV modules, 80% of the cells that compose those modules and 90% of the wafers used to make cells. It manufactures more than 60% of electric vehicles globally and accounts for roughly three-quarters of global battery cell production, with even greater dominance in cathode and anode production and critical mineral processing. China has rapidly expanded offshore wind capacity and now accounts for more than half of global capacity (41.8 gigawatts), up from just 1 gigawatt in 2015. China’s surge in renewables and electrification is starting to shrink its greenhouse gas emissions while creating the conditions for other countries to move away from fossil fuel use, according to a recent analysis by the think tank Ember. The surge is putting China so far out in front on clean energy that it’s now in a league of its own.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s team is severely hampering the development of clean energy projects in the U.S. and is even threatening existing manufacturing investments. The regulatory assault on renewable energy is broad and plainly at odds with Trump’s declaration of an energy emergency. The attacks on clean energy include the August stop-work order on the Revolution Wind offshore project, which was 80% complete, and the removal of a panoply of support for clean energy in the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The recent ICE raid on a multibillion-dollar Hyundai-LG battery plant project in Ellabell, Ga., was an own goal for an administration that claims to be bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

It doesn’t have to be this way. While Democrats and Republicans have deep disagreements over the risks of climate change and the role of fossil fuels in the future American energy mix, there is a political consensus that Americans can benefit from maximizing the availability of cheaper, more abundant energy. Even Saudi Arabia, the ultimate petrostate, is embracing renewable energy and seeking to acquire half of all its electricity from clean sources by 2030. Several Saudi companies announced a combined investment of $8.3 billion this year to stand up massive new solar and wind projects, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. The desert kingdom is also investing in becoming a major supplier of critical minerals, like lithium, copper and rare earths.

It might sound funny that oil-rich Saudi Arabia is racing to go green. But more electricity from sunshine means more barrels of oil they can save for export to willing buyers. And the truth is that Chinese-made solar panels are now the cheapest and easiest ways to become energy rich.

Projects on the list include two major direct air capture hubs that received billion-dollar awards from former President Joe Biden’s administration, including one that involves oil company .

Semafor reported the list earlier and said it could impact $12 billion in projects.

Also on the list is $500 million awarded last year to to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan to EVs; $335 million for to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois to build mid-size electric trucks; and $250 million for Stellantis to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to produce EV components.

Last week, the Department of Energy announced plans to cancel $7.56 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects it said would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

The Energy Department is also considering rescinding a $32 million award to which operates a Stellantis supplier in Ohio to produce plug-in hybrid components and battery packs and $89 million for expand its York, Pennsylvania plant for EV motorcycle manufacturing.

Also on the list is a $80 million award for to convert a former Georgia plant to build electric school buses; and $75 million to engine company to convert part of an existing Indiana plant to make zero-emission components and electric powertrain systems.

The DOE also is considering cutting $208 million for the to upgrade plants in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania to increase EV production capacity.

The Energy Department said in a statement it “continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.”

Occidental, GM, Harley-Davidson and Stellantis declined or did not immediately comment.

The total sum of the grants in question was uncertain. The list included some projects that DOE said in May it canceled.

The previous cancellations included $331 million at an olefins plant carbon reduction at ’s Baytown, Texas refinery; $500 million to in Louisiana; and $375 million to in Texas

The EPA held a virtual public hearing for the coke oven interim final rule in September, according to Post-Tribune archives.
An EPA brief filing acknowledged that coke ovens are capable of complying with the 2024 rule.
U.S. Steel responded to the EPA’s decision in a Tuesday statement.
The company does not have coke ovens at its Gary Works facility, but coke is produced at the Mon Valley Works Clairton plant near Pittsburgh.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed plans to delay regulations for steel industry coke plants, the Environmental Integrity Project announced.

“It is good news that the Trump EPA is abandoning its unlawful attempt to delay the compliance deadlines for recently updated air pollution control rules for steel industry coke ovens,” Haley Lewis, attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a news release. “Communities living near these facilities waited many years for these rules to be finalized by EPA in 2024 and putting them into action now is vital for reducing hazardous air pollution and protecting people living near these plants.”

The Environmental Integrity Project and EarthJustice filed a lawsuit against the EPA because of these actions, which Northwest Indiana groups Just Transition Northwest Indiana and Gary Advocates for Responsible Development joined.

“We’re glad that EPA recognizes the harm coke oven plants cause to communities and that it is more than reasonable for these facilities to meet emissions standards now,” Adrienne Lee, senior attorney at EarthJustice said in a news release. “The health and well-being of impacted communities should not come at the cost of giving corporate polluters a pass. We hope to see the same logic and law applied to air standards at steel mills, many of which are located in the same communities as coke ovens.”

According to the Environmental Integrity Project, the EPA finalized updates to the emission standards for steel facilities with coke plants in 2024, which would have required steel mills to reduce emissions since last April. However, President Donald Trump’s administration issued an interim final rule that would delay compliance until July 2027.

The EPA held a virtual public hearing for the coke oven interim final rule in September, according to Post-Tribune archives. The agency also hosted a hearing for the interim final rule for national emission standards for integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities, which revises all 2025 and 2026 compliance dates for April 3, 2027, according to EPA documents.

Multiple Northwest Indiana facilities were included in the rule updates, including U.S. Steel’s Gary Works facility and Cleveland-Cliffs’ Burns Harbor facility. The Indiana Harbor facility, which is operated by Cleveland-Cliffs and has a partnership with SunCoke Energy, was also included.

“Our communities, which have endured generations of environmental racism and injustice, cannot afford any more reckless and unnecessary delays to compliance for coke ovens,” Ashley Williams, executive director for JTNWI, said in a news release. “We are tired of defending our fundamental right to breathe and live a healthy life in Northwest Indiana. JTNWI is relieved that EPA heard our rally cry and withdrew this dangerous proposal.”

The lawsuit challenged the interim final rule because “it deprived nearby residents and communities of protection against toxic air pollution,” according to the Environmental Integrity Project’s news release. An EPA brief filing acknowledged that coke ovens are capable of complying with the 2024 rule.

U.S. Steel responded to the EPA’s decision in a Tuesday statement. The company does not have coke ovens at its Gary Works facility, but coke is produced at the Mon Valley Works Clairton plant near Pittsburgh.

“U.S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law; and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts,” a U.S. Steel representative said in an email statement. “Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps. Meanwhile, our environmental teams are working on plans and logistics toward compliance with the regulations. EPA remains open to revising the 2024 rule and we look forward to joining industry partners in continuing discussions with the agency..”

Chris Hardin, environmental manager for U.S. Steel, said in September that interim final rule deadlines are infeasible and based on insufficient data and miscalculations, adding that the EPA needs to fully consider all relevant factors before finalizing the rule, according to Post-Tribune archives.

During the EPA’s coke hearing, Michael Long, Cleveland-Cliffs’ senior director of environmental affairs, said the organization supports “environmental regulations that are based on sound science and prudent technology,” according to Post-Tribune archives.

“The technologies that would be needed … are not commercially available and have not been demonstrated to work in the coke byproduct industry either in the U.S. or internationally,” Long previously said. “EPA did not anticipate that we would need to research and develop technologies that have not been implemented in the coke sector, that might not be feasible…”

Overcoming hydrogen's commercialisation hurdles Despite its potential, hydrogen faces major challenges before it can be widely adopted.","Hydrogen's potential as a sustainable fuel source is gathering momentum as industries seek alternatives to fossil fuels.

When combusted, hydrogen produces water instead of CO₂: a characteristic that positions it as a key element in decarbonisation strategies.

It can be used directly in engines or to generate electricity in fuel cells, making it a versatile energy carrier. Recognising this potential, governments and trade blocs like the EU are actively developing hydrogen strategies to increase production and adoption.

The industry categorises hydrogen using a colour code system.

These codes signify the production method, with green hydrogen being produced using clean energy and grey hydrogen relying on fossil fuels.

Understanding hydrogen production methods

The most common method for producing grey hydrogen is steam reforming, which involves extracting hydrogen gas from natural gas.

This process releases considerable amounts of CO₂ as a byproduct. Another method, known as autothermal reforming, uses oxygen and carbon monoxide and also results in carbon emissions.

Blue hydrogen uses these same processes but incorporates carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to trap the CO₂ emissions, preventing them from entering the atmosphere.

Green hydrogen is produced using clean energy sources through a process called electrolysis. In this method, electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar power is used to split water into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen.

Growing demand and strategic industrial applications

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Global Hydrogen Review 2024, demand for hydrogen has more than tripled since 1975.

The report also notes that demand for low-emissions hydrogen saw a growth of almost 10% in 2023.

This rising demand is set against a backdrop of global climate commitments.

The United Nations states that as of June 2024, 107 countries that account for approximately 82% of greenhouse gas emissions have adopted net zero pledges.

Hydrogen could be key in meeting these targets, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as long-haul transportation, chemicals, iron and steel.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) projects that hydrogen could meet 12% of final energy demand by 2050.

A 2020 PwC report further estimates that the global demand for green hydrogen could reach 530 million tonnes by 2050, creating an export market worth an estimated US$300bn annually.

Major industrial players are already investing in hydrogen projects.

TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have partnered with a combined investment of over €1bn to develop large-scale electrolysers for producing low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonise their refineries in Northern Europe.

Emilie Mouren-Renouard, Air Liquide’s Group Vice President for Europe, Africa, Middle-East and India, says: “We are proud to lead the way on European renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production and to accompany TotalEnergies in their journey to decarbonising their industrial assets.

In Germany, BASF and Siemens are collaborating on a green hydrogen project that aims to produce up to a tonne of green hydrogen per hour.

The potential for specific manufacturing sectors is also being recognised. Alex Richards, Vice President & Regional Segment Leader at Schneider Electric, believes green hydrogen could be crucial for the UK's steel industry.

He says: ""Producing DRI [Direct Reduced Iron] using green hydrogen can result in over a 95% reduction in CO₂ emissions compared to steel produced with coal. ""This presents an opportunity to sustain a steel industry with much less environmental impact"".

Overcoming hydrogen's commercialisation hurdles

Despite its potential, hydrogen faces major challenges before it can be widely adopted.

According to the US Department of Energy, liquid hydrogen has a volumetric energy density of 8MJ/L, which is only a quarter of that of gasoline at 32MJ/L.

This means a much larger volume of hydrogen is required to produce the same amount of energy necessitating more sophisticated storage solutions like cryogenic methods or high-pressure tanks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8b15a693c1dcd3d5c904bb024bdd4a96:db46027a72a54eef8a7f18e13605528e/im2018040415co-300dpi.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:15.637803

The US EPA provides, to the best of our knowledge, the only other national-level inventory of wastewater treatment emissions in the USA.
For landfills, we used the US EPA’s Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LandGEM) to calculate the CH4 emissions factor for municipal solid waste landfills46.","Wastewater treatment is essential for protecting public health and the environment. However, treatment processes generate greenhouse gases (GHGs) while relying on energy and chemicals whose production also contributes to total emissions1. Globally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated wastewater treatment emissions to be 0.38 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2019, comparable to key industries targeted for decarbonization, including the chemical (0.37 Gt CO2e), cement (0.82 Gt CO2e) and iron and steel (1.35 Gt CO2e) industries2. Yet, recent studies found that the IPCC and US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) may underestimate methane (CH4) emissions from on-site processes alone by twofold3,4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions factors are often oversimplified and/or inaccurate5. This study aims to improve understanding of wastewater GHG emissions, which are critical for meeting global climate targets as this sector grows with increasing population and expansion of essential sanitary services.

On-site emissions at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs, also called water resource recovery facilities) are dependent on wastewater characteristics (for example organics and nitrogen), treatment processes, level of treatment and plant size3,5. N2O emissions span multiple orders of magnitude, but appear correlated with treatment objective5,6. Biogas used for on-site power generation can reduce imported energy, but leaking equipment and treated solids handling emits CH4 (ref. 3). In addition, upstream electricity emissions depend on power requirements of treatment processes and regional grid carbon intensity.

Given this complexity, emissions reduction strategies must consider key plant and geospatial characteristics, energy and material inputs, factors not currently accounted for in national emissions inventories7. Internationally, several studies report national wastewater treatment inventories (Supplementary Table 1), including on-site biogenic CH4 and N2O emissions7,8,9,10. However, they accounted for different emissions components inconsistently. For instance, the US EPA did not include upstream energy emissions7, and only one inventory considered on-site, non-combustion CO2 emissions9. Seiple et al. catalogued US facilities as part of their analyses to quantify the energy potential from wastewater sludge but did not estimate GHG emissions or energy consumption11.

Therefore, we developed an approach to inventory wastewater emissions based on facility location and treatment processes, accounting for on-site, upstream and downstream GHG sources. We estimated on-site emissions from treatment processes, on-site and upstream emissions from producing and using energy for facility operation and chemical production, and downstream emissions from off-site disposal of treated solid waste. We used this approach to generate a national emissions inventory of over 15,000 WWTPs across the contiguous USA. To capture uncertainty associated with various emission sources, we estimated potential emissions ranges using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters influencing emissions, providing guidance for future data collection and decarbonization efforts. Our approach allows policymakers and engineers to analyse trade-offs inherent to different treatment technologies, better informing interventions for reducing wastewater treatment emissions. This method can be adapted as new measurement studies improve accuracy of emissions estimates and associated emissions factors.

For clarity, the following terminology is used in all text and figures: CH4, N2O and fossil origin CO2 emissions are collectively described as ‘process emissions’ and refer to the gases produced on-site during biological wastewater treatment processes, unless otherwise specified. CH4 and N2O produced from biosolids disposal are distinguished as ‘landfill CH4’ and ‘land application N2O’. Emissions associated with natural gas include those from natural gas combusted on-site for heat (via boiler, dryer and incinerator) and chemical production, as well as upstream emissions from natural gas extraction and distribution. Electricity-related emissions are full fuel cycle, accounting for upstream and power plant emissions.

Total emissions include process emissions, energy emissions and downstream emissions from treated biosolids land application or landfill disposal. We did not include emissions from sewer systems, effluent discharge and facility construction. To facilitate comparison between generic configurations, we calculated emissions intensity (kg CO2e m−3) for each treatment train (Fig. 2c,d) using the national profile for electricity carbon intensity, while calculations elsewhere associated with inventoried facilities use the carbon intensity of the plant’s regional electricity supply (Supplementary Methods section 2.6.1). Highest total emissions are from configurations removing nutrients with membrane bioreactors: *D1e (1.8 [1.2–2.6] kg CO2e m−3) and *D3 (1.5 [0.85–2.4] kg CO2e m−3). Fifty-nine per cent [39–77%] (*D1e) and 71% [45–89%] (*D3) of emissions are from energy consumption, attributable to the electricity requirement of membrane systems and the natural gas needed for acetic acid production. The train with the next-highest carbon intensity is *G1 (1.1 [0.73–1.7] kg CO2e m−3). Here, 60% [40–76%] of emissions are produced through biological treatment (CH4, N2O and CO2) and 37% [22–56%] are from electricity and natural gas use. Across treatment trains, biosolids disposal at most accounts for 12% [4.6–26%] of total emissions (*C4). Finally, by comparing median emission values from identical configurations with and without energy recovery through combined heat and power (CHP), we found that energy recovery reduces total emissions by only 5.2–13%. Understanding whether emissions are driven by treatment processes or electricity requirements will inform decarbonization strategies, particularly as the US electricity generation mix continues to evolve17.

We conducted a sensitivity analysis using Spearman’s rank correlation to identify the following key drivers of emissions (P < 0.05 and an absolute ρ value >0.2) across treatment configurations: wastewater influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN), emissions factors for CH4 and N2O, electricity requirement and grid carbon intensity (Fig. 3). Across nearly all configurations, emissions are most sensitive to the CH4 emissions factor, even when anaerobic digestion is not present. By contrast, N2O emissions factor and influent TN are primarily, although not exclusively, important for nutrient removal facilities. COD is a statistically significant driver only in lagoon systems, for which fugitive CH4 emissions are directly proportional (as reflected in CH4 emissions factors). These findings underscore the importance of further refining emissions factors and influent wastewater variability through representative measurement campaigns and public datasets.

Nationally, wastewater treatment produces 47 [41–55] MMT CO2e per year (Table 1), based on a national-scale Monte Carlo simulation. CH4 dominates annual emissions (41% [31–54%]), followed by N2O (24% [16–38%]) and electricity (23% [19–27%]). Wider percentile ranges for CH4 and N2O reflect higher uncertainty and greater variability in available emissions data. Electricity emissions show lower uncertainty, reflecting less variation in estimates. While emissions from biosolids remain poorly characterized, our estimate of these emissions is only 1.1 [0.53–2.0] MMT CO2e per year, or 2.2% [1.1–4.3%] of national emissions. Emissions associated with natural gas production, distribution and combustion are similarly low (1.4 [1.2–1.5] MMT CO2e per year).

We estimated emissions from wastewater treatment in the USA are 47 [41–55] MMT CO2e per year, with CH4 and N2O accounting for 66% [51–86%] of emissions. Compared with previous works (Supplementary Table 1), our approach integrates a greater number of emissions sources, including electricity, CO2 (fossil origin) and biosolids disposal, and allows a side-by-side comparison across key emission types. Our estimates of GHG intensity for specific treatment trains range from 0.33 [0.19–0.74] kg CO2e m−3 (*C6) to 1.8 [1.2–2.6] kg CO2e m−3 (*D1e), aligning with models by the US EPA (0.5–1.8 kg CO2e m−3), although the relative contributions of different components differ20. Largely due to a higher number of identified anaerobic digestion facilities, our national estimate of CH4 emission (19 [15–25] MMT CO2e per year) is approximately twice that of Song et al., who estimated 9.7 MMT CO2e per year by drawing on one of the four source datasets used in this study3 (see Methods for additional details). Our nationwide estimate for N2O (12 [7.9–17] MMT CO2e per year) is similar to values reported by Song et al. (11.6 MMT CO2e per year), calculated using the same underlying emissions factor data that we grouped by treatment objective, whereas Song et al. organized by bioreactor type5.

Methane emissions are the largest single contributor to annual emissions in our inventory. We found that 85% [74–92%] (16 [12–21] MMT per year) of CH4 is produced by treatment configurations with anaerobic digestion (code 1 or 2). Anaerobic digestion produces energy on-site in the form of biogas, while reducing the spatial footprint of WWTPs and providing additional opportunities for resource recovery21. However, our results indicate fugitive CH4 emissions currently outweigh climate benefits gained from renewable biogas. On a volumetric basis, energy recovery (code suffix e) reduces the median emissions by only 0.061 kg CO2e m−3 on average. By contrast, the average of median emissions from treatment configurations with anaerobic digesters is 0.34 kg CO2e m−3, or 0.30 kg CO2e m−3 higher than those with aerobic digestion. While our analysis uses data from the USA, these findings have broader global implications as concerns about GHG emissions from similar treatment trains are global. Recent studies in Europe have identified key sources of methane leaks in anaerobic digestion facilities, including non-gas-tight digestate storage22, biomass storage tanks and pressure relief valves23. In addition, minor technical fixes to existing infrastructure have been demonstrated to reduce methane emissions from biogas facilities by up to 46% (ref. 23), highlighting the potential impact of leak detection and repair programmes and the importance of immediately adopting such a programme globally.

We developed N2O emissions factors adapted from those compiled by Song et al. (2024), distinguishing on the basis of treatment objectives (organics removal, nitrification and denitrification)5. However, 79% of the underlying measurement data come from denitrifying systems24. Additional measurements are needed from conventional activated sludge and nitrifying systems. Given the high spatial and temporal variability in N2O emissions from wastewater treatment6, improving the characterization of N2O production is essential. In addition, current N2O mitigation efforts use aeration, feed and process optimization25, which are not captured in existing facility-level data. Understanding current operation strategies and their impact on emissions should be a focus of future research.

The relative importance of electricity generation (23% [19–27%] of total emissions) will decrease with grid decarbonization26. Biosolids disposal through landfilling or land application contribute only a small portion of total emissions (2.2% [1.1–4.3%]), but CH4 and N2O from biosolids are poorly studied. We used IPCC’s emissions factor for managed soils, which has a high uncertainty (0.002–0.018 kg N2O-N per kilogram of nitrogen)27 but aligns with the small number of recent studies where biosolids were used as an agricultural amendment28,29,30. Finally, our model did not account for CH4 produced through different practices for biosolids dewatering and on-site storage, which also contribute to fugitive CH4 emissions31.

The US EPA provides, to the best of our knowledge, the only other national-level inventory of wastewater treatment emissions in the USA. The two inventories differ in that we included electricity-associated emissions to enable a side-by-side comparison of key emissions sources, reflecting the wastewater industry’s historic prioritization of achieving net-zero energy use1. Also differing from the US EPA, we did not include CH4 and N2O effluent discharge emissions because we focused on emissions that can inform decarbonization efforts. Comparing on-site emissions, our N2O estimate (12 [7.9–17] MMT per year) is comparable to the EPA’s value (16.3 MMT per year), although our CH4 emissions estimate (19 [15–25] MMT per year) is threefold greater than their estimate (5.6 MMT per year−1)7. The relative contributions of the two gases also differ, with CH4 contributing 63% [51–73%] (19 [15–25] MMT per year) of combined on-site CH4 and N2O emissions in our inventory but only 26% (5.6 MMT) in the US EPA inventory. This difference is meaningful, as the relative importance of each gas informs potential mitigation measures. CH4 and N2O emissions are produced by different wastewater treatment processes via distinct microbial pathways, which are impacted by local climate (for example, temperature and seasonal changes to operation6,32). In addition, atmospheric lifespan and global warming potential will impact the priority of mitigation strategies for these two gases.

There are several limitations to this work. Our analysis relies on data reported through the US EPA’s Clean Watersheds Needs Surveys (CWNS), which did not require reporting unit process data in the most recent 2022 survey. As a result, 75% of our inventory relies on unit process data from 2012, although we used supplemental datasets and manual verification to update the data where possible (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Methods section 2.2.2). Furthermore, our results indicate a strong linear relationship between cumulative national flow rate and emissions (Fig. 5b). However, most recent national flow data from the CWNS do not distinguish between observed and design flow at facilities, meaning we probably overestimated the volume of wastewater treated. In addition, we used uniform influent concentrations for all facilities and did not account for variations in effluent requirements based on local regulations. Given their importance in estimating GHG emissions, future CWNS surveys should require data reporting on treatment processes; biogas production and utilization; observed flow; and influent and effluent water quality.

There are also several opportunities for further refining in future inventories, particularly with expanded data collection. We made the simplifying assumption that, within a particular treatment plant configuration, energy consumption is directly proportional to flow rate, despite the potential for increased efficiency at larger sizes33. In addition, the energy requirements for lagoons may not reflect current designs and operation34. Future inventories and resulting mitigation efforts will also benefit from improved CH4 and N2O emissions factors, which will require direct measurement studies across a range of representative facilities, climates and time periods. Moreover, for lagoons, we used current IPCC assumptions that aerobic lagoons do not produce CH4 and that anaerobic and facultative lagoons do not produce N2O. However, given the lack of fully uniform mixing, and the many connections between CH4 and nitrogen microbial metabolism35, it is likely that both gases are produced across all lagoon categories.

Our analysis considered only climate impact, but facility-level decision-making requires a more comprehensive environmental assessment. For example, trickling filter configurations are among those with the lowest total emissions. However, they have large spatial footprints and need adequate hydraulic head differences across the plant to limit pumping requirements. In addition, because anaerobic digesters are the largest source of on-site emissions, facilities using incineration (codes 5 and 6) compare favourably because they have lower on-site emissions. However, incineration requires adequate pollution control measures to prevent release of particulates, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds, considerations that we did not capture.

Wastewater treatment is a growing sector inextricably linked to public and environmental health, and understanding its current climate change impact is critical for decarbonization efforts. This analysis provides a comprehensive inventory of over 15,000 WWTPs across the contiguous USA, including treatment configuration, energy requirements and emissions estimates. Although confined to the USA, a similar approach can be adopted elsewhere. In less data-rich contexts, the archetypical treatment configurations reported here can be selected on the basis of best fit with available information, or serve as a guide for future data collection. In the USA, we identify on-site emissions of CH4 and N2O as priorities for climate change mitigation efforts, expanding the historical focus of the wastewater sector beyond energy-associated emissions. In addition, data generated from this work can be used to determine the impact of specific policy levers on overall emissions, and to analyse the effects of adopting novel resource recovery and emissions reduction technologies.

Facilities inventory development

We integrated multiple national datasets to compile an inventory of wastewater treatment facilities in the USA, their energy requirements and GHG emissions (Fig. 6). Our inventory consists of 15,863 WWTPs that reported non-zero flow to the US EPA in 202215. Throughout this Article, WWTPs refer to facilities owned and/or operated by municipalities or other public entities, including treatment plants and lagoons. We determined the treatment train for each facility in our inventory, defined as a common set of unit operations designed to reduce wastewater pollution between the influent and effluent of the plant. We used unit processes reported across the aggregated 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2022 CWNS12,13,14,15, supplemented with additional publicly available data that provided more granular or recent information: the US EPA’s Lagoon Inventory Dataset36, the Water Environment Federation’s Water Resource Recovery Facilities Biogas Database37 and the US Department of Energy’s Combined Heat and Power Installation Database38.

Using reported unit process data, we assigned each facility one or more treatment trains, abbreviated using alphanumeric codes, based on those previously defined by Tarallo et al.16 but with modifications to reflect additional possible combinations of liquids and solids treatment processes (full details are provided in Supplementary Methods section 2.2.2) Each treatment train is a unique combination of unit processes depicted in Fig. 1, and each configuration includes liquids and solids treatment processes, with optional primary treatment, chemical phosphorous removal and CHP for energy recovery. Liquids (or secondary) treatment technologies include activated sludge configurations, trickling filters and membrane bioreactors. Solids treatment options include aerobic and anaerobic digestion, lime stabilization and two incineration methods (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 for additional details). With available unit process data, we assigned treatment trains to 10,962 facilities, approximately 69% of the national fleet.

Where unit process data were incomplete or unavailable, we assigned treatment trains on the basis of facilities of a similar size and geographic location. For the 1,991 facilities with only partial unit process data available (that is, plants that provide information on secondary treatment or solids management but not both), we assigned treatment trains on the basis of the most common treatment train of similar plant size in the same EPA region, considering key unit processes present (activated sludge, biological nutrient removal, aerobic/anaerobic digesters, lime stabilization, incineration and trickling filters). For the remaining facilities with either insufficient partial data or fully absent data (2,910 facilities), we assigned a treatment train on the basis of the most common treatment train of similar plant size in the same EPA region. Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 7 provide a size breakdown and additional details on facilities with missing data.

Facility-level emissions associated with energy

For all treatment trains in the national inventory, we calculated electricity and natural gas consumption, as well as on-site electricity generation from biogas utilization. We used energy calculations from the results of process models in GPS-X reported by Tarallo et al.16. Because our study includes treatment trains beyond those reported by Tarallo et al., we used mass and heat balances for unit processes to determine energy requirements for treatment trains that were not modelled previously16 (details in Supplementary Methods section 2.3.1).

To estimate the GHG emissions associated with electricity consumption, we assigned each facility a regional emissions factor (kg CO2e kWh−1). Specifically, we used existing model results that simulate the energy mix across 134 simulated subregions of the USA, reflecting state-level and utility boundaries and capturing the existing variation to maintain load–interchange–generation balance39. We calculated electricity emissions factor (kg CO2e kWh−1) for each geographic region using the corresponding total emissions (kg CO2e) divided by the net power generated, as reported in National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Standard Scenarios Cambium data for 202017,40. We used data from the mid-case scenario based on central parameter values, including future electricity consumption, fuel costs and technology selection. We also calculated full fuel cycle GHG emissions for electricity and natural gas using the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model41 (Supplementary Table 18).

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide

We estimated total CO2, CH4 and N2O from biological treatment processes, referred to here as ‘process emissions’ for brevity. For CO2, we assumed a baseline of 11.9% of influent carbon is of fossil origin, and 53.5% of influent COD (508 mg l−1) is released as CO2 during biological treatment42. To determine CH4 production, we used emissions factors based on the presence of key unit processes, and for N2O production we used emissions factors based on treatment targets. Namely, anaerobic processes (anaerobic digestors and lagoons) emit CH4, and nutrient removal processes emit N2O. For CH4, we used data reported by Song et al. (2023) to assign emissions on the basis of whether a facility contains an anaerobic digester3. For facilities with anaerobic or facultative lagoons, we used emissions factors reported by the IPCC43. For N2O, we developed emissions factors using data compiled by Song et al. (2024) to determine the median value of literature-reported values categorized by treatment objective: organics removal, nitrification or full denitrification5 (Supplementary Table 20). N2O emissions factors are a function of influent TN, and we assumed a range typical of domestic wastewater (23–69 mg l−1)44. As with CH4, we used N2O emissions factors reported by the IPCC for aerobic, anaerobic and facultative lagoons43. For uncategorized lagoons, we calculated both CH4 and N2O emissions factors using a flow-weighted average of the three other types of lagoon in the contiguous USA. For specific emissions factors and additional details, see Supplementary Methods section 2.4.

Biosolids-associated emissions

To estimate biosolids production, we combined reported production rates, where data were available, with mass flow calculations where data were unavailable. For 2,124 facilities, we used the US EPA’s Biosolids Biennial Report for 2020–202145, which documents the volume of biosolids produced, and their ultimate disposal through incineration, landfilling or land application. For the remaining facilities, we calculated sludge production based on facility flow rate, as developed elsewhere11 and described in Supplementary Methods section 2.5.1. For land applied biosolids, we used the IPCC N2O emissions factor for organic soil amendments27. For landfills, we used the US EPA’s Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LandGEM) to calculate the CH4 emissions factor for municipal solid waste landfills46. Full details are included in Supplementary Methods section 2.5.2.

Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses

For all treatment trains, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations (N = 10,000) for 19 input parameters subject to uncertainty. We selected all uncertainty ranges and distributions (Supplementary Table 24) using the tiered selection criteria previously developed47,48, with minor modifications described in Supplementary Methods section 2.6. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the relative impact of all input parameters on total per-volume GHG emissions for each treatment train, using Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficients. In this analysis, we defined key drivers of uncertainty as those with a P value <0.05 and an absolute ρ value >0.2.

For national-level results, we also evaluated uncertainty around two additional inputs: local electricity carbon intensity and facility biosolids production. We determined baseline facility-specific carbon intensity using 134 geographic regions reported in NREL Standard Scenarios Cambium data for 202017,40 and determined emissions factors for each electricity production pathway using the GREET model41. For local electricity carbon intensity, we assumed a uniform distribution with 80% and 120% of the baseline value as the lower and upper bound, respectively. For biosolids, we calculated the baseline facility-level mass flow rate and determined disposal pathways as described above and in Supplementary Methods section 2.5. Next, we used facility-level data to calculate the national total biosolids mass flow to landfills and land application. For our uncertainty analysis, we assumed a uniform distribution with 80% and 120% of the national total biosolids mass flow rate as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Full details are provided in Supplementary Methods sections 2.5 and 2.6.

Due to the large number of facilities included in this study, we report only median values for all facility-level results (Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Dataset C). Specifically, for each WWTP, we used median emissions factors to estimate emissions from individual processes (for example, biological CH4 emissions and upstream electricity emissions) and summed across all processes at a given facility to determine total emissions.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44221-025-00485-w/MediaObjects/44221_2025_485_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-08 22:59:17.409960

It’s boom time in the U.S. oil patch, but storm clouds are gathering.

In West Texas, the beating heart of the U.S. oilfield, the telltale signs of prosperity abound: Long lines at the gas station, trailer parks packed with roughnecks and roustabouts, and a healthy business for repair shops as windshields fall victim to gravel kicked up by oil trucks. (I can’t tell you, dear reader, how many windshields I cracked while reporting on the Powder River Basin’s oil boom in the early 2010s.)

Data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms what my colleague Shelby Webb observed during her recent reporting trip to the Permian Basin: The U.S. produced a record 13.6 million barrels of oil a day in July.

And yet, despite the big numbers, many oil producers are in a dour mood. BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil have all announced plans to lay off workers or have already done so, Shelby writes in a follow-up story today.

The belt-tightening is a reflection of the global oil markets. Yes, production is up, but demand is stagnant and storage tanks around the world are starting to fill up. An analyst at the Macquarie Group last week called the world’s oil market “cartoonishly” oversupplied. And that was before the EIA reported Wednesday that U.S. commercial crude stocks increased by 3.7 million barrels last week, eclipsing the 700,000 barrels predicted by analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

Add it all up and what you get are predictions of an oil price collapse. The EIA thinks Brent crude, the global price benchmark, will average $52 a barrel next year. That’s down from $81 a barrel last year and around $66 today.

History suggests that U.S. producers will be the quickest to cut production in the face of low prices, leaving their competitors in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations with a larger slice of the world’s oil-producing pie, said Rory Johnston, an oil analyst who writes the newsletter Commodity Context.

Yet so far there is little sign of U.S. production relenting. OPEC, meanwhile, reiterated a pledge to slightly raise oil production Sunday.

“There is a lot of question in the market of: ‘Is this growth sustainable?’” Johnston told me.

U.S. shale producers are better equipped to handle a bust in prices than they once were, said Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners.

Improvements in drilling technology means oil companies can produce more oil with fewer people. A round of oilfield mergers, such as Chevron’s $55 billion acquisition of Hess, has also resulted in companies focusing on developing only their most profitable assets.

Even so, most analysts think someone is going to have cut production to bring the world’s oil market into balance. The big question is whether that will be U.S. shale producers or OPEC, said Bob McNally, the president and founder of Rapidan Energy Group. “If OPEC+ doesn’t cut, we’ll go lower and it will have to be shale that cuts.”

How low oil goes has big political implications for President Donald Trump, McNally said. Consumers tend to reward presidents for low gasoline prices, especially if they dip below $3 a gallon. But there are dangers for Trump, too, McNally said.

A handful of American oil producers have already criticized Trump’s handling of the economy in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ quarterly energy survey — and that’s with the U.S. benchmark price, West Texas Intermediate, hovering in the low $60s. That could morph into full-fledged unrest if prices nosedive below $45 a barrel next year, McNally said.

Somebody might want to keep a running tally of broken windshields in West Texas.

Wright’s misleading talking points

Energy Secretary Chris Wright often hits on familiar themes laden with data when he barnstorms the globe to talk up the administration’s agenda, Brian Dabbs and Christa Marshall write.

But some of the data is misleading or doesn’t take fossil fuels into account.

For example, Wright has said that renewables provided 2.6 percent of global energy last year. While that’s largely accurate — “energy” includes transportation, which oil dominates — wind and solar provided roughly 17 percent of U.S. electricity last year. And electricity is projected to constitute a growing share of U.S. energy because of factors like the rise of electric vehicles, according to data analysis firm Ember.

Wright has also pointed to local protests of wind farms, but polling shows oil and gas projects might be even less popular.

“The public’s continued general preference for developing alternative energy may help explain its tepid support for fracking and offshore drilling,” the polling group Gallup said in April.

U.S. government gets into the mining business

The federal government now partially owns three critical mining companies, marking what experts say is a “new phase” in how the U.S. approaches industrial policy, writes Hannah Northey.

Most recently, the Department of Defense took a 10 percent equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Vancouver-based company that has mining claims in an isolated part of northwestern Alaska. DOD is also the biggest stakeholder in MP Materials, which operates the nation’s only rare earths mine in California. And the Department of Energy has a 5 percent equity stake in Lithium Americas, a Canadian company that’s developing a lithium mine in Nevada.

The moves are a departure from the U.S. government’s traditional use of grants, loans and tax incentives to stimulate private investment while maintaining distance from ownership, said Stephen Empedocles, CEO at the advisory firm Clark Street Associates.

“This model signals a change in U.S. industrial policy — one that treats the federal government less as a grantmaker and more as a strategic investor,” said Empedocles. “It sets a precedent for similar approaches in semiconductors and other critical supply chains.”

Trump’s cancer answer: AI, not regulations

Trump wants to cure childhood cancer with artificial intelligence, while powering that technology with energy that creates cancer-causing pollution, writes Ariel Wittenberg.

The president signed an executive order last week that increases funding for efforts to use AI for cancer research. It’s part of the administration’s support for the booming technology — and for fossil fuels, which Trump asserts is needed to power AI data centers.

But the Trump administration is also rolling back regulations on the energy industry designed to prevent people from getting cancer in the first place. For example, the administration is delaying rules to limit cancer-causing bromide released in the wastewater of coal plants.

“AI can be an amazing tool for earlier diagnosis and finding cures, but the way they are doing it, the pollution is going to become a huge problem causing more cases over time,” said Katie Huffling, executive director of the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

Asked during a briefing how the administration was balancing the goal of reducing childhood cancer with its rollback of environmental rules, a senior White House official said, “We are going to talk about the executive order today.”

The city is considering a $5.5 million pilot program to probe the use of cool pavement in areas with hot streets that would protect New Yorkers from sizzling asphalt during the summer months.

Such cool pavement — designed to stay cooler than traditional asphalt — reflects sunlight by using lighter colored-materials, coatings or grass, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The bill, sponsored by Brooklyn councilwoman Sandy Nurse, mandates the two-year pilot to include at least one neighborhood in each borough that has “high summer surface temperatures and low median income” by September 2026.

The city council’s transportation committee is set to consider the proposal during a Thursday hearing.

The cost of cool pavement sealant is about 60 cents more per square yard compared to traditional sealants, per the American Society of Civil Engineers, but the local pol argues the tactic is overrun with benefits.

“Cool pavement offers additional benefits, including decreased stormwater runoff, improved water quality, enhance street safety and better night time visibility depending on the treatment,” Nurse told PIX 11, adding that traditional asphalt absorbs heat and can make the city feel up to eight degrees warmer.

“Moreover, cool pavement treatments could also improve commercial activity where you are able to achieve the cool corridor effect,” she said.

BROWNSVILLE, Texas – At the southernmost point of Texas, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf, the Port of Brownsville is driving a new era of growth and opportunity. Vessels, trains, and trucks traverse the port’s industrial landscape, signaling more than just cargo in motion. This is the economic engine driving the Rio Grande Valley’s economy.

As the only deepwater seaport located on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Port of Brownsville has become a gateway for trade, a magnet for investment, and a catalyst for opportunity across South Texas. Currently, more than $20 billion in projects are in the pipeline, promising to further transform the economic landscape of South Texas.

The port’s long-term vision is guided by the Brownsville Navigation District Board of Commissioners. This five-member elected body oversees policy, planning, and major investment decisions. The current board includes Chairman Esteban Guerra, Vice Chairman Sergio Tito Lopez, Secretary John Reed, and Assistant Secretaries John Wood and Ernesto Gutierrez. Together, their leadership reflects a strong commitment to economic growth, public trust, and regional impact.

The Port of Brownsville continues to play a central role in the success of the region. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the port climbed to No. 41 among the nation’s 150 maritime ports for waterborne cargo, its highest ranking to date. In 2023, the port moved 11.2 million tons of waterborne cargo, up from 9.1 million tons in 2022.

That momentum carried throughout 2024, with total cargo reaching 28 million tons marking a 57 percent increase from 2023. Operating revenue at the port in 2024 surpassed $30 million for the fourth consecutive year, reaching $43.3 million.

This growth represents more than statistics. It means jobs for families, new business, and broader momentum across South Texas. Every ton of cargo supports a ripple effect that fuels the local economy.

Contributing to the port’s success are consistent investments in infrastructure. A centerpiece of that effort is the Brazos Island Harbor Channel Improvement Project, which will deepen the 17-mile-long ship channel from 42 feet to 52 feet. The increased depth will allow larger vessels to enter more safely, reduce wait times, and improve overall efficiency.

The project is divided into two phases. It’s backed by a Public-Private Partnership involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of Brownsville, and energy company NextDecade. In 2019, NextDecade committed to funding Phase 1, a $400 million investment, which includes deepening the channel near its Rio Grande LNG site and building two ship berths and a turning basin. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company received the contract from NextDecade for work on Phase 1. Phase 2, led by the port and the Corps, is supported by $68 million in federal funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In 2024, a $104 million contract was awarded to Callan Marine Ltd. The estimated completion date of the project is late 2026.

Infrastructure improvements on the port’s land are moving just as quickly. The port has expanded laydown yards, modernized roadways, and improved berths to handle high-volume cargo, including wind energy components. These updates are essential for maintaining the port’s competitiveness in a changing global market.

The Port of Brownsville continues to attract some of the largest private investments in the energy sector. Projects like Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG are shaping the future of U.S. energy exports. Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.

Rio Grande LNG, built by Bechtel Energy Inc., is a natural gas liquefaction and export facility with up to 48 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of potential capacity, making it one of the world’s largest LNG projects in development. Trains 1 through 4, representing about 24 MTPA and $25 billion in investment, are under construction and scheduled to begin operations between 2027 and 2030, supported by customers such as ADNOC, Aramco, Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies. Train 5, with commercial agreements secured from Jera, EQT, and ConocoPhillips, is advancing toward a positive Final Investment Decision, while Trains 6 through 8 are in early development and permitting.

Texas LNG, a project of Glenfarne Energy Transition, is a planned 4 MTPA export terminal at the Port of Brownsville designed to be one of the lowest-emission LNG facilities in the world. It has secured offtake agreements with companies including EQT Corporation, Gunvor Group, Macquarie, and a major European utility. Texas LNG recently cleared a key regulatory milestone with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is targeting a Final Investment Decision by the end of 2025. Kiewit Corporation has been selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, with the project expected to be completed by 2029.

The port is also prioritizing sustainability. From habitat restoration projects to native species conservation, it is working to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with environmental responsibility. These efforts help maintain a balance between progress and preservation.

The port’s location and multimodal access position as a unique link between global trade and emerging industries. It plays a growing role in renewable energy logistics, particularly in the transport of oversized equipment like wind turbines. It’s also supporting the commercial space industry. Just a short distance from SpaceX’s Starbase launch site, the port offers specialized logistics that support space innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With competitive costs, unmatched logistics, available land, and a growing labor force, the Port Brownsville is one of the most attractive locations in the country for nearshoring and industrial investment.

The recipe for both is simple: take the existing models, strip out a bunch of features and sell them at a lower price. Given that the automaker is facing the end of EV tax credits and leasing incentives and the arrival of an armada of new competitors, such models make sense on the surface. The vehicles, however, still start at $38,630 and $41,630, respectively, including destination fees, putting them in direct competition with newer alternatives.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Tesla’s new “Standard” Model 3 and Model Y are stripped-down base model versions of aging cars

Long-promised new $30,000 Tesla still vaporware, cheapest Model 3 starts at $38,630

Already basic inside, these new models don’t even have an AM/FM radio

Longtime Tesla observers will note that these two “Standards” are still nothing like the $30,000, clean-sheet design budget Tesla that CEO Elon Musk has been promising for at least half a decade.

As recently as the firm’s January earnings call, Musk personally confirmed that a new, next-generation small crossover would “start production towards the end of 2025.” Such a model is arguably more important to Tesla’s competitiveness in China than in the U.S., but the Model Y Standard definitely isn’t going to fill that gap. Nor is it likely to win over consumers alienated by the CEO’s political adventures.

That said, there will be people shopping for these two vehicles, so it’s worth taking a look at just how they stack up in this rapidly changing marketplace.

Both the Model 3 and the Model Y have had major refreshes in the last 18 months that smoothed out their harsh rides and spiffed up their bare-bones interiors, but they are now eight- and five-year-old designs, respectively, under the skin.

The changes on the Standard models remove a bunch of the things that made the updates compelling, and they make them resemble long-ago stripper models like Dodge Omni America or Chevrolet Chevette Scooter, which removed the back seat (and lots of other things) to reduce sticker shock in the stagflationary 1970s. They’re built to meet a price point and seem likely to feel that way.

That’s no bad thing, as the rear-drive versions of these vehicles handle a little better than the all-wheel drive ones, and they’ll still be relatively quick. Tesla says the Model 3 standard will do 0-60 mph in 5.8 seconds and the Model Y in 6.8. That's not rocket ship stuff, but more than okay for most drivers, and quicker than most similarly sized gas vehicles.

They’ll also have a very competitive maximum range of 321 miles and the usual quick and easy access to Tesla Superchargers, but charging speed will be limited to 225 kW (which is still really fast!).

A variety of features have been cut from both designs, particularly on the interior. The ambient lighting, rear passenger screen, leather seats, HEPA filter, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, sound-insulating double-paned acoustic glass and power-adjustable steering column are gone, as is AM/FM radio functionality.

That’s right, there’s no terrestrial radio (and no antenna), and there are only seven speakers instead of fifteen. The giant 15.4-inch screen remains, with its busy interface and complete lack of physical controls, though Tesla’s site does note that a “Turn signal stalk comes standard.” The consoles have been redesigned to make them simpler, and the power front seats lose their physical controls, so you can only use the screen to adjust them.

Both models keep their glass panoramic roofs, but here’s where the differences get really weird. The Model 3’s roof is just like any other 3, but Tesla’s engineers designed a sound-deadening headliner to cover over the one on the Model Y. They’ve kept the glass roof for manufacturing efficiencies; they just covered it over.

A couple of improvements on the cheaper models, however, are the manual rear vents, which are much more easily adjusted manually than through the touch screen and the manually adjustable steering wheel, which also eliminates an overly cumbersome process.

The Model Y also loses the refreshed design’s Cybertruck-inspired light bar. The whole front end gets a new and simpler fascia that resembles the kind of basic de-chroming and de-ornamenting that car companies used to differentiate base models in the 1950s. It’s just big and plain, and the adaptive high beams are gone too. Both Standard models get jet black 18-inch wheels, which look pretty small on the Model Y.

2026 Tesla Model Y

The new Model Y standard will also use the passive shock absorbers of earlier Model Ys, rather than the new (and massively improved) suspension pieces from the refreshed model that debuted a few months ago.

Tesla has also made changes to its suite of driver assistance gear. Autosteer, the lane-centering function for it adaptive cruise control systems, is deleted unless you opt for the optional, $8,000 “Full-Self Driving (Supervised)” setup, which would seem to negate the purpose of buying one of these cheaper models. Notably, despite the misleading name, it’s not a Level 3 autonomous system or “self-driving” in actuality.

How do these “Standard” Teslas stack up?

When the Model 3 was new in 2017, there really weren’t any other vehicles that could match it, and the Model Y was almost the same way in 2020, undercutting then-current EVs like the Jaguar I-Pace on price and practicality. But that was then and this is now, and today there are a host of alternatives that provide nicer interiors and experiences for the same price or less, and many have competitive range and performance.

The Chevrolet Equinox EV now starts at $34,995, including destination, and offers 319 miles of range, easier controls, bigger screens, similar safety features and a much nicer cabin. The freshly redesigned Nissan Leaf doesn’t have as much passenger space, but it does have over 300 miles of range, similar safety and connectivity features, another far nicer cabin and a price tag $8,000 lower than the Model 3 Standard. Then there’s the Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE rear-drive, which is pricier than these new Standard models, but comes with a big rebate and is materially nicer in lots of ways.

Congress’ acquiescence in cancelling the EV tax incentives has upended the electric market, but that affects Tesla as much as these competitors. Even so, there are still more affordable EVs that will come online in the near future, like the revived Chevrolet Bolt and the upcoming Kia EV3 and EV4.

It’s hard to see these stripped-down Model 3 and Model Y variants as a step towards the future rather than an attempt to eke out a little more mileage from old designs. Rideshare drivers might like them, as they still have very low operating and maintenance costs, but if you’re spending almost $42,000 off the lot, it seems like there are better, newer alternatives, as well as better-equipped pre-owned Teslas.

The new Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard are on sale now and should start hitting the streets soon. The Model Y’s stripped-down visage, at least, will be easy to recognize.",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c8e3a11/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F5a%2F2d%2F8cc8bb964e0a8d4eff7ecfedee2a%2F2026-tesla-model-y-standard-a1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:00:18.731261

October 7, 2025

The Michigan budget bills on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s desk rein in many cuts to Michigan environmental programs that were included in a budget proposal passed by Michigan's Republican-controlled House in late August.

The previous House budget would have cut $200 million, or roughly 19% of the funding, from Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, while the present budget proposal reduces the agency's funding by $71 million, or 7%, according to a House Fiscal Agency analysis.

The budget adds roughly $1.1 billion in annual road and bridge funding, with a small increase in education spending.

A stopgap funding measure was passed last week to allow the government to avoid a shutdown until Wednesday.

""What we have (includes) a lot of really important priorities and stayed a lot of cuts,"" state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) told Planet Detroit.

Public transit, Michigan hospitals, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources may benefit from funding included in the budget, which also removed language to weaken PFAS rules and limit the attorney general's ability to pursue litigation against oil and gas companies.

The budget totals roughly $81 billion when about $5 billion in Medicaid provider tax revenue is included. This is a step down from last year's $82.5 billion budget, but larger than the $78.5 billion proposal from House Republicans.

Michigan legislators passed the budget bills late Thursday and early Friday, with the Michigan Senate voting 31-5 on the general omnibus budget and the House voting 101-8. The Senate approved the education omnibus budget with a 31-5 vote, while the House voted 104-5.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is under pressure to reach a deal, state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said during budget negotiations in September.

Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is widely viewed as responsible for the state's last government shutdown in 2009, Irwin said, although he argues then-Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop (R-Rochester) was largely responsible.

""People see the governor as being in charge, even though, in reality, the governor does have to work with the legislature,"" Irwin said.

In a Friday statement, Whitmer said the budget represents a “big win for Michiganders” and is balanced and bipartisan, although she has not yet signed the legislation at the time of writing.

Michigan budget avoids major environmental job cuts

Cuts at EGLE should have minimal impacts on operations and staffing, agency spokesperson Dale George told Planet Detroit in a Friday statement.

The House budget would have cut 250 full-time EGLE employees, 116 of whom work on water quality programs in the water resources division, according to the Michigan House Fiscal Agency analysis.

Irwin said Monday that cuts to EGLE would likely only affect 15 unfilled positions, although he would prefer to see staffing levels at the agency increased.

The budget cuts funding for drinking water affordability in the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services budget from $10 million to $5 million.

Language that would have barred EGLE’s Water Resources Division from spending funds until the department adopts weaker federal drinking water standards for toxic PFAS chemicals was removed from the budget.

A provision to limit Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s ability to join other states in lawsuits or sue the federal government or oil and gas companies was also cut.

Nessel is suing the Trump administration over its energy emergency order, which would fast-track fossil fuel projects, and 3M, Dupont, and other companies for PFAS pollution damages.

Legislators struck a proposed $50 million earmark for the Copperwood Mine in the Upper Peninsula from the budget, a project that environmental groups and Indigenous nations have opposed, in part because of its proximity to Lake Superior and Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park.

Irwin said this was a ""particularly foolish thing to subsidize"" because development incentives are normally used to attract businesses that could go to other states.

""The mine can't relocate to Alabama,"" he said. ""The mine has to be where the copper is.""

Michigan budget includes support for health care, parks, transportation

The budget contains some good news for park and public transportation users, with funding increases for some programming, as well as health care funding that could be critical for hospitals.

The Michigan Health & Hospital Association said in a statement that the full funding of Medicaid would help patients maintain health care access, especially in rural and underserved areas.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which manages Belle Isle and other state parks, will see an $8.6 million, or 1.6%, funding increase, including modest bumps to capital funding and staffing.

Officials in charge of managing Belle Isle said last month that cuts to the DNR in the proposed House budget would seriously impact policing and upkeep of the island park.

The Michigan Public Transit Association praised the budget, which it said would provide increased funding for local bus systems and $65 million for projects to build, expand, and enhance public transportation.

Environmental groups expressed support for the budget's inclusion of $129 million for communities hosting wind, solar, and battery storage, but Evergreen Action and the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council criticized a fee hike for electric and hybrid vehicle owners.

Irwin said this is a bad policy that adds an extra fee for EV and hybrid drivers who already pay to cover the cost of what they would have paid in gas tax on an internal combustion vehicle.

One curious aspect of this year's proposed budget: the state revolving fund for water infrastructure and many other items were moved to one-time funding.

Irwin said this stems from a Republican effort to force departments to spend small surpluses they had built up, which could create funding issues in 2026.

""It means that there's going to be a big budget problem next year.""

Hello, my name is Haley Schulz. I am a Community Organizer with Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization that champions the public interest. I am firmly opposing the EPA’s proposal to repeal and delay the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requirements.

Not only has the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program been a primary pillar in data transparency for the public, but it has benefited industry and communities, alike. While providing essential emission data, companies can be proactive and monitor emissions, providing cost avoidance by being proactive rather than reactive. Communities I work with rely on many monitoring tools, like FLIGHT, to actively check industry polluters and use that data to protect their community, as well as hold polluters in-check in congruence with state and federal regulators, like the EPA. The public already lost EJ Screen. Pulling further resources with transparent data that benefits both industry and the public is reckless.

As the EPA, you are beholden to the public first. The claim that the GHGRP “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment” is a baseless statement. Decades worth of robust data and facts have proven what the public at-large AND the EPA have recognized and known for years – greenhouse gas emissions are harmful not only to our environment and way of life, but to human health. Unchecked emissions will only lead to a higher cost of mortality and negatively impact our society as we know it.

I live in Houston, Texas, where we are one of the most polluted cities in the country. Our petrochemical and fossil fuel buildout is significantly higher than most cities and we are home to the largest coal plant in the state. Without a program that tracks and reports GHG emissions, the public will be left in the dark without knowing what is in their air. For communities with climate action plans or companies with sustainability reports, they all rely on access to this data. While companies self-report emission data, the public shares their lived experiences and research, and the regulators enforce protective regulations. By removing or delaying the reporting of GHG emission data, we are eliminating visibility and taking out an essential pillar of checks and balances.

To cut the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program will not save $2.4 billion, it will cost Americans with their lives. Neither this program nor holding polluters accountable drive up the cost of living – it is a part of business to either reduce emissions to protect Americans or pay the fine. Until GHG emissions are essentially halted, or counties reach attainment status for ozone, there will still be a need to monitor, report, and make the data accessible for GHG emissions.

Without transparency, there can be no accountability. And without accountability, like what this program provides, the public is at the mercy of the offenders. Greenhouse gas emissions will not disappear if reporting is taken away, so by delaying actions taken thanks to this reported data, we are only making pollution control and environmental justice more expensive and difficult to handle in the years to come. Do not remove or delay the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requirements and let’s strengthen public confidence in the agency created to protect our environment. Thank you for your time and consideration of my comments.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:00:53.886968

Appalachian Power submitted its plan for the next 10 years to state regulators, and changes could be coming to its coal plants.

Appalachian Power filed its integrated resource plan last week with the West Virginia Public Service Commission.

The company mapped out six scenarios for its Mountaineer, Mitchell and Amos plants.

Only Mountaineer would stay in operation through 2035 in all scenarios, and it may be converted from coal to 100% natural gas.

In some scenarios, Amos would retire completely by 2035 or be partially converted to gas.

The Mitchell plant also would partially retire or partially convert from coal to gas.

The scenarios contemplate a delay in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency power plant rules that are currently under review by the Trump administration.

Karen Wissing, a spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, says if those rules are delayed, “maintaining coal operations at all three plants would be the most cost-effective option for our customers.”

“However,” she added, “if the EPA rules are not modified from their current form, conversion to natural gas generation would become a more cost-effective option.”

The company’s plan also outlines scenarios for both high economic growth or low economic growth.

A low-growth scenario would lead to the retirement of all coal generation by 2032.

The planning document outlined options for replacing the plants with wind, solar and combined-cycle natural gas.

The Amos and Mountaineer plants provide power to Appalachian Power customers in southwest Virginia.

Virginia’s Clean Economy Act sets targets for emissions reductions in electricity generation, something West Virginia lacks.

Of the three plants, Mountaineer had the highest capacity factor this year through July of 64%.

Amos had a capacity factor of 34% and Mitchell 25%. The average in the PJM region is about 40%. The West Virginia PSC and the legislature would prefer the plants operate closer to 69%.

An expert witness testified to the PSC over the summer that the three plants lost $81 million in the 12 months ending in February. The company has said it burned coal at a loss to manage an excess supply at the plants for worker safety.

It also has said that breaking coal contracts would have cost electricity customers more.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3490-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:10.962696

State AGs Continue to Target Auto-Renewing Subscriptions

State AGs Target Healthcare Fraud Through False Claims Settlements

State AGs Focus on Environmental Reporting and Climate-Related Conduct

1. State AGs Press AI Companies on Deepfake Risks and Child Safety

On August 22, 2025, all State AGs—except those from Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, and Texas—sent a letter to major search engines calling on them to strengthen measures against the spread of “deepfake pornography.”[1] The State AGs pointed to existing safeguards that redirect potentially dangerous searches—such as queries about building explosives or self-harm—toward safer resources and recommended similar guardrails for terms like “deepfake porn,” “nudify apps,” and “undress apps.” On the same day, all State AGs—except those from Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming—sent a similar letter to payment platforms asking them to block transactions tied to deepfake content, citing terms of service models that already restrict other prohibited activities.

On August 25, 2025, all State AGs—except those from Alabama, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin—sent a letter to major AI developers urging them to make child safety a priority in the design and rollout of chatbot technologies. The State AGs cited investigations showing AI-driven chatbots engaging in sexually suggestive or emotionally manipulative conversations with minors and cautioned that these incidents reflect broader systemic vulnerabilities. The AGs noted that they stand ready to use their enforcement authority to prevent the exploitation of minors.

Together, these letters highlight the State AGs’ growing focus on AI-related risks. Child safety and intimate image abuse are bipartisan enforcement priorities, with parallel federal interest in the executive and legislative branches. Companies in the technology sector should expect continued scrutiny, and service providers, such as payment platforms, also may face expanding obligations to address these concerns.

2. State AGs Focus on Consumer Fraud in the Electronic Payment and Robocall Spaces

We note two focus areas for recent AG activity in the consumer fraud space: (1) pursuing matters that have been abandoned by federal regulators; and (2) targeting companies that are allegedly providing platforms for fraud.

A prime example of the first area of focus is the lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General (NYAG) alleging fraud against Early Warning Services, LLC (EWS), the company that developed and operates the electronic payment platform Zelle. The NYAG brought this lawsuit after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar lawsuit.

Although EWS did not directly engage in the type of scams alleged in the complaint, the NYAG seeks to impose liability on EWS for allegedly “creat[ing] an atmosphere conducive to fraud” by designing Zelle without critical safety features, allowing scammers to easily target users and steal more than $1 billion between 2017 and 2023. The NYAG further alleges that EWS and its partner banks knew for years that fraud was spreading on Zelle, failed to adopt safeguards or enforce meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks, and fraudulently promoted and marketed the safety and security of the Zelle network.

Regarding the second area of focus, State AGs are sending warning letters to phone providers that are associated with a high volume of illegal and/or suspicious robocall campaigns even though the providers themselves are not making the robocalls. The Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force, comprised of State AGs from all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, sent notice letters to 37 phone providers warning them that their transmission of calls associated with high-volume illegal and/or suspicious robocall campaigns may violate state and federal law. These 37 notices follow five rounds of warning letters sent to 23 companies between November 2023 and April 2025. The Task Force is also sending notice letters to 99 downstream providers that accept call traffic from the 37 phone providers.

Businesses should anticipate heightened state-level enforcement, as State AGs are increasingly pursuing focus areas that they believe federal regulators will no longer focus on and targeting companies with platforms they believe may enable fraud. Risks extend to vendors and third parties and thus companies should strengthen fraud-prevention and monitoring systems, enforce clear compliance obligations with partners and other third parties, align marketing claims with actual security measures, and consider prompt engagement with regulators when issues arise.

3. Auto-Renewing Subscriptions Continue to Be Targeted by District Attorneys

On August 14, 2025, HelloFresh, the world’s largest meal kit delivery company, agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought jointly by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Consumer Protection Division and the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office. The case grew out of investigations conducted by the California Automatic Renewal Task Force, which was established by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office in 2015 to address rising consumer complaints about subscription-based traps.

The lawsuit alleged that HelloFresh violated California’s Automatic Renewal Law by deceptively enrolling consumers in auto-renewing subscription plans without proper disclosure or consent. It also alleged that HelloFresh violated California’s False Advertising Law by failing to disclose the material terms and conditions of advertised free meals, surprise gifts, and free shipping offers. As part of the settlement, HelloFresh agreed to pay $6.38 million in civil penalties, $120,000 in investigative costs, and $1 million in restitution to eligible California consumers.

Other state regulators have sued and secured settlements with companies offering automatically renewing subscriptions. For example, the NYAG initiated a lawsuit against an audio entertainment company and the Massachusetts Attorney General secured a $6.5 million settlement with a home security services company. This trend highlights the importance of clearly disclosing subscription terms, obtaining each consumer’s affirmative consent before charging their credit card, providing a post-transaction acknowledgment of the material terms of the transaction, and offering an easy-to-use mechanism for cancellation.

4. State AGs Target Healthcare Fraud Through False Claims Settlements

State AGs have been harnessing the federal False Claims Act and their own state false claims statutes to target fraud in the healthcare sector. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on persons and companies that knowingly submit false claims to the federal government. Most states have their own versions of the False Claims Act. Recently, AGs in Connecticut, Oklahoma, and Massachusetts have reached settlements with medical providers and companies for violating state and federal False Claims Act statutes often in partnership with federal prosecutors and agencies.

The Connecticut Attorney General reached a $150,000 settlement with a dentist, resolving allegations that she submitted false claims to Connecticut Medicaid through prohibited fees paid to a third-party patient recruiting company in violation of state and federal False Claims Act statutes. The Connecticut Attorney General alleged that the dentist paid the third-party patient recruiting company a fee for each Connecticut Medicaid patient it referred to her, whenever a patient received dental services over and above routine preventative care. This is the fifth settlement[2] arising from the Connecticut Attorney General’s joint investigations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into paying kickbacks for patient recruitment.

The Oklahoma Attorney General reached a $173,143 settlement with a psychiatrist, resolving allegations that he knowingly submitted false claims to the Oklahoma Medicaid program and then caused his agents and employees to fabricate records when the Oklahoma Health Care Authority notified him of the intention to audit his patient records. The Oklahoma Attorney General alleged that the psychiatrist “upcoded” claims for evaluating and managing patients and then submitted those false claims to the Oklahoma Medicaid program in violation of the Oklahoma Medicaid False Claims Act.

The Massachusetts Attorney General reached a $6 million settlement with two ambulance companies for violations of the Massachusetts False Claims Act. The settlement resolved allegations that the ambulance companies submitted false claims to MassHealth for more expensive services than were provided, violated MassHealth medical necessity requirements, and failed to disclose relevant information when submitting the companies’ applications to serve as MassHealth providers. As part of the settlement, the ambulance companies will implement a three-year independent compliance monitoring program.

These settlements demonstrate that State AGs, who often work closely with their federal counterparts, continue to aggressively enforce false claims violations to protect against defrauding state Medicaid programs, making compliance programs and accurate billing practices essential for providers.

5. State AGs Focus on Environmental Reporting and Climate-Related Conduct

On August 7, 2025, 22 State AGs, joined by several major cities and local governments,[3] submitted comments urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its proposal to repeal federal greenhouse gas reporting rules for the oil and gas sector. The coalition warned that eliminating the rules would undermine transparency and hinder states’ ability to track emissions, particularly methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The State AGs emphasized that reliable emissions data is critical for enforcement and policymaking and argued that the EPA has both a statutory duty and scientific basis to maintain strong reporting requirements. By highlighting the risks of regulatory rollback, the coalition signaled that environmental reporting and accountability remain an enforcement priority for certain states and localities.

Separately, on July 28, 2025, the Florida Attorney General announced an investigation into what that office described as a potential “climate cartel,” targeting major financial institutions and other entities that coordinate to restrict investment in fossil fuel industries. The investigation will examine whether such activities violate state and federal antitrust laws by limiting competition under the banner of environmental, social, and governance goals.

While the Florida Attorney General investigation is at an early stage, it reflects a contrasting trend in state enforcement, with some State AGs framing climate-focused initiatives as potential threats to market fairness. The investigation illustrates that environmental issues are not only a regulatory matter and increasing partisan matter but also an emerging battleground for antitrust enforcement.

The energy startup—co-founded in 2023 by CEO Zach Dell and COO Justin Lopas—offers fixed-rate home electric plans with whole-home battery backup. Backed by venture capital, Base aims to reimagine the power grid through distributed storage that delivers both affordability and reliability.

The company began serving the DFW region in 2024 and expanded into Dallas proper this past August. With a new office and warehouse in Grapevine, its North Texas footprint now includes Fort Worth, Arlington, Plano, and Irving.

Base says it’s working to lower electric costs for homeowners while proving how distributed battery systems can operate at utility scale.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” CEO Zach Dell said in a statement announcing the funding round.

The new funding, one of the largest Series C rounds of the year, was led by Addition. New investors include CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, and Ribbit, with continued support from existing backers Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Lightspeed. The round brings Base’s total funding to $1.3 billion, according to Crunchbase. Earlier this year, the company raised $200 million in its Series B funding round.

With the capital in place, the company plans to expand beyond its current Texas markets, including DFW, Houston, and Austin.

“We’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” Dell said in the announcement. He added that meeting the challenge “requires the best engineers and operators to solve it.”

A battery in every home, but no solar required

Base’s model is designed for reliability and resilience. It offers a fixed-rate energy plan that includes installation of a whole-home backup battery, even if the home doesn’t have solar panels. The company owns and maintains the battery, which kicks in automatically during outages to provide up to 24 hours of backup depending on usage.

The company recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to pool capacity from individual home batteries and bid it into the market. Base said the ability to participate in this program “strengthens reliability statewide and generates additional revenue from the grid.”

From print plant to power plant

To meet growing demand and support operations, Base said it is building its first factory in downtown Austin by repurposing the former Austin American-Statesman newspaper press facility. The site will manufacture energy storage systems and power electronics.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware,” said COO and co-founder Justin Lopas. “We need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves.”

While the factory in Austin is the company’s first, Lopas said, Base is already planning for its second. “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrializing America and reinventing the grid,” he added.

Since launching, Base reports it has deployed over 100 megawatt-hours of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the U.S. The company said that its growth is driven by organic demand, utility partnerships, and relationships with national homebuilders like Lennar.

Dell, whose father founded Dell Technologies, has emphasized the urgency of Base’s mission. “The pain every Texan feels in the summer and the winter is a preview of what may come nationwide,” he said in August. “Base Power is the key to unlocking an energy-abundant future through dispatchable, distributed battery storage.”

As Prepared for Delivery

Watch a video of Wyden deliver his remarks here

Shortly, the Senate will vote on a resolution brought forward by Senator Kaine on the topic of U.S. energy production.

Donald Trump came back into office huffing and puffing about “energy dominance.” He said all our economic problems would go away if we: “Drill, baby, drill!”

Here’s the reality. Like the vast majority of his agenda, everything he says about this issue is fraudulent, and everything he does is rooted in a sweetheart deal for his wealthy donors. Back in February, he signed the executive order declaring an “energy emergency,” which is the subject of today’s floor action. This emergency declaration has nothing to do with energy dominance, and everything to do with creating more giveaways to Big Oil. He’s looking out for the same oil and gas companies he solicited for big checks right in the middle of the 2024 campaign. His offer to them was, give me your money, get me elected, and I will let you oil companies run the show.

That was as dirty as it gets. But I’ll give Trump this: he’s kept his promise to Big Oil.

He has gutted American energy production, ceded ground to China on the clean energy arms race, and rigged the system in favor of fossil fuels.

After declaring this energy emergency, he and Republicans took a wrecking ball to American energy production by gutting tax credits for wind and solar energy in their budget bill. These tax credits passed under Democratic leadership back in 2022 finally put wind and solar energy on equal footing with oil and gas. My guiding principle when crafting that legislation was that creating good-paying American jobs and securing a clean energy future aren’t mutually exclusive. They can and must go hand-in-hand.

These tax credits helped to kick off a manufacturing boom in America. Hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments. Hundreds of thousands of jobs. New factories went up all over the country. Battery technology. Clean vehicles. Energy-efficient products for businesses and homeowners. It was already bringing down energy costs for consumers.

In terms of the global arms race for clean energy jobs and investment, the U.S. went from the middle of the pack to the front basically overnight. Until at Trump’s direction, Republicans destroyed all of that progress at the first opportunity, in order to pay for more tax cuts for corporations and his wealthy pals and donors. When Republicans were gearing up to pass their reconciliation bill, I warned that it would be a bloodbath for clean energy.

Fast forward three months. Manufacturing projects are being canceled. Jobs are being lost. Utility bills are rising.

Their budget bill was a total abandonment of clean energy, and the workers that will lose their jobs as a direct result.

And last week, the Administration announced plans to cancel over 7 billion dollars in funding for clean energy projects. Almost every single one of those projects was located in a blue state. Oregon alone had over 400 million dollars in funding canceled.

And they’re not stopping there. Republicans have derailed management of our public lands to prop up coal. Oregonians see through this for what it is. A gobsmacking attempt to hurt American families just to score campaign contributions.

Now, the United States is barreling toward a self-inflicted energy crisis manufactured entirely by Republicans. Energy demand is skyrocketing. Utility bills are rising. Keeping costs low and meeting demand is going to require an all-of-the-above approach. Instead, Republicans are focused on handouts to billionaires, Americans’ bank accounts be damned. It’s clear as Crater Lake that all the talk from Trump and Republicans about American “energy dominance” was a fraud. Nothing but a hollow campaign slogan.

The Republican energy agenda is a level of economic self-sabotage that leaves you slack-jawed.

I’ll close with this. The American people voted for cheaper groceries, utilities and gas. They didn’t vote for an energy crisis that benefits no one except Big Oil investors.

Beginning with Senator Kaine’s resolution, the Senate has an opportunity to help bring an end to Trump’s manufactured energy crisis. This is a chance for the Senate to fight for lower prices, more jobs, and greater energy security while Donald Trump works to undermine them.

I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I yield the floor.

Businesses are investing in carbon capture. Renewable energy has surpassed coal as the world’s largest source of electricity. The shift to a green economy is gaining momentum, partly thanks to Canada’s ambitious target to become carbon-neutral by 2050. Achieving this goal will require a new generation of workers to operate our system of solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal wells and nuclear plants. Job opportunities for green building technicians, sustainability consultants and energy auditors are essential—and increasing.

The push to combat climate change is set to boost the industry’s value to US$23 trillion globally by 2030. Here at home, Canada’s clean energy sector employed more than 466,000 workers in 2023 and generated $22 billion in employment income. Jobs in environmental sectors, including areas like carbon capture, critical mineral mining (retrieving minerals used in sustainable technologies), geothermal system installation and the electric vehicle industry are expected to grow by 3.4 per cent annually over the next decade—almost four times faster than the average employment growth. That’s in part due to support from the federal government, whose 2024 Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act mandates the creation of sustainability-focused jobs.

Regionally, British Columbia could have more than 317,000 new clean energy jobs between 2025 and 2050, with opportunities to work on cutting-edge projects like repurposing CO₂ for clean electricity production, decarbonizing buildings or protecting coastlines from climate impact. In Alberta, the government forecasts 10 per cent annual growth in clean energy employment and Ontario is heavily investing in nuclear and electrification projects, creating thousands of jobs.

College renewable energy programs to consider

There are several hands-on college diploma programs in clean and renewable energy available to students across the country. Most diploma programs are two years long, while advanced diplomas, which specialize in things like system design and energy modeling (digitally monitoring the energy output of a system, like in a home), typically take three years. In Mohawk College’s energy systems engineering technology program and Fanshawe College’s renewable energies technician diploma program, students get hands-on field experience with solar, wind and geothermal energy systems, and participate in a co-op. Lakeland College’s sustainable energy technology diploma covers solar, wind, biofuel and geothermal systems, with the opportunity to acquire certification from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners, or NABCEP, considered the gold standard in accreditation for many renewable energy professionals. Vancouver Community College’s clean energy technology diploma, meanwhile, prepares students for roles in renewable energy systems and green building design, or energy auditing of industrial sites.

Opportunities for renewable energy grads

A college diploma in clean and renewable energy can lead to a variety of in-demand jobs in Canada’s growing green sector. Students may go on to careers as solar or wind technicians, panel installers or EV infrastructure designers. Others find roles as sustainability consultants, building systems technicians or project coordinators who support clean energy installations. Students who want a leadership role can pursue additional credentials like the NABCEP certification or become project management professionals.

Graduates of clean and renewable energy programs earn competitive wages, which vary by role, experience and location. A 2023 survey by ECO Canada, an organization that advocates for workers in environmental and sustainability-related jobs, found that the annual salary for workers in Canada’s green economy in 2024 was $80,752, which is significantly higher than that of the average Canadian, which sits at $60,880. In Toronto, entry-level renewable energy technicians earn between $39,000 and $58,000 annually, with an average around $47,800, according to Glassdoor. As workers rise to senior roles, energy-related positions commonly net more than $100,000 per year.",https://cms.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MACLEANS-EDUCATION-IN-DEMAND-PROGRAMS-CLEAN-ENERGY-LAKELAND-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 18:02:33.827880

So why do so few Michiganders have a grasp of how the commission functions? Journalist and climate activist Bill McKibben told the New York Times that public service commissions often fly under the radar because they’re “protected by a force field of their own boringness,” discouraging individuals from participating in the process.

In hopes of breaking through that force field, Planet Detroit created this guide for Michiganders to gain a better understanding of what the Michigan Public Service Commission — or MPSC — does, who it serves, and how to get involved.

What is the Michigan Public Service Commission?

The MPSC is a three-person public body that regulates privately owned electric utilities, natural gas providers and pipelines, and to a lesser extent, phone and cable services across the state.

As “regulated monopolies,” investor-owned utilities, or IOUs, like DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, must get approval from the commission before making any major changes that affect the power grid or their customers.

When was the MPSC created and why?

The state Legislature first established the Michigan Public Service Commission in 1939. Originally operating as a five-person body, the regulatory agency was created to fill the void left after legislators disbanded the Michigan Public Utilities Commission, which oversaw a variety of utilities including rail, electric, natural gas, steam, telephone service, ferry service, and more.

The MPSC inherited its predecessor’s responsibilities, though over time the commission played less of a direct role in regulating telecommunication companies.

The commission temporarily had jurisdiction over water utilities from 1967 until 1995 — when state legislators repealed the law — as well as the regulation of motor carriers from 1968 until an executive order transferred the responsibility to the Michigan State Police in 1982.

What does MPSC regulate today?

The Michigan Public Service Commission regulates three main industries:

Electricity

MPSC regulates all investor-owned public utilities that distribute electricity to Michigan customers.

Seven IOUs are operating in the state of Michigan:

Alpena Power Co.

Consumers Energy Co.

DTE Energy Co.

Indiana Michigan Power Co.

Northern States Power Co. – Wisconsin (Xcel Energy)

Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corp.

Upper Peninsula Power Co.

The commission oversees all conditions of service for these utilities and has the power to approve or deny rate increases, new energy projects or expansions, infrastructure upgrades and more. DTE Energy and Consumers Energy are the largest investor-owned electric utilities operating in the state.

The MPSC requires that all IOUs submit a long-term plan, known as an Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, to ensure that electric energy supply will continue to meet or exceed demand, and to help utilities adhere to the latest policy standards and energy goals.

Natural Gas

The MPSC regulates the storage, transmission, and distribution of natural gas to ensure providers are following statewide safety and technical standards. Regulators also have jurisdiction to approve or deny residential and commercial rate changes and conditions of service like metering or billing.

Seven natural gas utilities are under MPSC’s purview:

Consumers Energy Co.

DTE Energy Co.

Michigan Gas Utilities Corp.

Northern States Power Co. – Wisconsin (Xcel Energy)

SEMCO Energy Gas Co.

Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corp.

Upper Peninsula Power Co.

Telecommunications

The commission no longer regulates retail rates for telecom services like phone, cable, and internet, but it still provides minimal oversight related to quality of service, reliability, and consumer protection.

How is the MPSC structured?

Commission members are appointed by the governor and typically serve staggered six-year terms. One commissioner is selected by the governor to serve as chairperson of the body, and no more than two members can share the same political affiliation.

Supported by a staff of about 200 people across nine divisions, the commission is tasked with making determinations in a variety of cases, ranging from proposed rate changes, energy upgrades, and licensing renewals to consumer disputes, administrative rulemaking, and more.

As a state agency, the MPSC is required to provide opportunities for public engagement related to matters under its jurisdiction. As such, anyone who would like to voice their opinion about a case before the commission can do so by filing a public comment or attending a regularly scheduled meeting either virtually or in-person.

Who serves on the commission?

Commissioner Dan Scripps (Term ends July 2, 2029)

Appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in February 2019 and named MPSC chair in July 2020.

Active in several state energy advisory groups.

Former member of the Michigan House of Representatives.

Graduate of Alma College and the University of Michigan Law School.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick (Term ends July 2, 2027)

Appointed by Whitmer in January 2021 and reappointed in July 2021.

Previously worked in the public and private sectors with a focus on energy storage and technology development.

Worked on the Juno and Curiosity spacecraft missions with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Holds a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering and a masters in energy systems engineering from the University of Michigan.

Commissioner Shaquila Myers (Term ends July 2, 2031)

Appointed by Whitmer in July 2025 to replace outgoing Commissioner Alessandra Carreon.

Former senior advisor to the governor.

Served as chief of staff for former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist.

Former legislative director for Senate Democratic Leader Jim Ananich and policy analyst for the Michigan Senate.

Holds a masters of public administration and an undergraduate degree from Oakland University.

Whitmer drew criticism from environmental groups over the summer when she made the decision not to reappoint Carreon to the MPSC upon the expiration of her partial term on July 2.

In a June 2025 letter citing concerns about the MPSC’s integrity, a coalition of nearly 20 environmental organizations referred to Carreon as “the clearest voice for frontline communities” who “drove efforts to make the clean-energy transition both affordable and inclusive.”

Despite those concerns, Whitmer appointed Shaquila Myers — her former senior advisor — in Carreon’s place, leading many to speculate whether the decision was politically motivated.

Who is the MPSC meant to serve?

State regulators are required to balance consumer interests against the interests of utilities and the importance of fostering competitive markets to ensure Michigan residents are receiving “safe, reliable and accessible energy and telecommunications services at reasonable rates,” according to the MPSC’s website.

How does the MPSC affect me?

Many Michiganders — including Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel — have harshly criticized DTE and Consumers in recent years for making more frequent rate hike requests.

In April, DTE filed for a $574.1 million rate hike case — its second-highest request in company history and the fourth in five years — months after state regulators approved a $217 million increase for the utility. That increase amounted to approximately $4.61 more per month for the average customer.

Consumers Energy similarly filed a $436 million electricity rate increase request with the commission in June, only three months after receiving approval for a $153.8 million rate increase that raised rates by $2.78 per month for customers on average.

In both cases, the utilities were approved for significantly lower rate increases than what they sought.

Nessel has referred to the continuous rate increase requests by DTE and Consumers as “an endless cycle,” accusing them of prioritizing profitability over improving service.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MPSCMay29-min-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-08 18:03:20.412245

Doral secures offtake agreement for 430MW Texas solar-plus-storage project

Yesterday, US independent power producer (IPP) Doral Renewables announced a power purchase agreement (PPA) with an unnamed “corporate buyer” for its 430MW Cold Creek solar-plus-storage project in Texas.

The project is currently under development, and will pair the solar generation facilities with a 340MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). The facility is located in the Schleicher and Tom Green Counties of Texas, and is expected to be connected to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid, and begin commercial operations, in 2028.

The deal will cover 75% of the facility’s energy output, which Doral estimates at over 1 million MWh annually, and all of the associated Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). While the developer did not name the offtaker, it described the company as a “well-known and experienced energy buyer”, and that this is a new commercial relationship for the company.

Arevon powers 264MW Indiana PV portfolio with Meta PPA

On Monday, US IPP Arevon began operations at two utility-scale solar projects in Indiana.

The Heirloom and Ratts 1 projects in Pike County, Indiana, represent 264MW in combined solar generation capacity. These projects—representing around US$400 million in investment—are the first utility-scale projects that Arevon owns in Indiana.

Both sites will operate under long-term offtake agreements. The 150MW Ratts 1 project is contracted under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA).

EDF and Enlight advance solar-plus-storage projects in the US

Last week, EDF Renewables announced that it had started work at its 150MW Milagro solar-plus-storage project in New Mexico, while Enlight Renewable Energy completed two tax equity partnerships for its 290MW Roadrunner solar-plus-storage project in Arizona.

The former project is co-located with a 75MW/300MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Milagro will supply electricity to utility El Paso Electric (EPE) under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

The latter project, meanwhile, is teamed with a 290MW/940MWh storage facility and the agreements were closed through Enlight’s US subsidiary Clēnera Holdings.

SunStrong raises US$900 million to refinance SunPower residential portfolio

US renewable energy services provider SunStrong Management has raised US$900 million to refinance a “large portfolio” of residential solar assets developed by SunPower.

The financing takes the form of an asset-backed securitisation (ABS), a form of fundraising backed by assets, in this case a 528MW solar portfolio, split across 18 states, currently managed by SunStrong. The deal was closed on 30 September, with money raised in four phases, and was heralded as “another significant milestone” for the company by its leadership, which offers management and servicing of existing solar projects.

The deal represents that latest positive development for SunPower, which was pushed to the brink last year after breaching a credit agreement, and having to file for bankruptcy.

California passes bills to reduce energy prices, ‘applauded’ by SEIA and CEBA

Last month, the California State Legislature passed two bills that aim to reduce energy prices in the state, which have been heralded as “common sense” solutions to energy affordability by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

The two bills are Assembly Bill 825 (AB 825) and Senate Bill 302 (SB 302), which cover regional electricity and taxes, respectively.

California law included a number of conditions that must be met before the beginning of 2019, including approval of bodies such as the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), to establish “an independent regional organisation” to work with the independent system operator (ISO) in managing the state’s energy grid.

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.

Dive Brief:

DMR Technologies is spending $1.4 million establishing its first full-scale drone manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Louisiana, the state’s economic development agency announced Oct. 2.

The 10,000-square-foot plant will serve as the Detroit-based company’s primary domestic production hub, integrating advanced flight control printing, rotor manufacturing, assembly, quality control and logistics, according to the press release.

The site is expected to create 521 jobs over the next 10 years, with an average annual salary of $85,000, as well as 766 indirect jobs. Renovations are currently underway and production is set to begin by year’s end.

Dive Insight:

North America has the largest agriculture drones market, which is currently valued at $5.4 billion and is expected to reach $12.7 billion by 2030, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence.

The growth could be due in part to the reforming of drone regulations, Mordor noted. In August, the Trump administration proposed a rule to revamp the authorization process for longer-distance drone operations, aiming to simplify the process for operators to obtain regulatory approval.

DMR anticipates the facility will assemble 500 to 1,000 drones within its first year of production, according to the press release.

The manufacturer is shifting production of its precision agriculture drone model, the Field Ranger X50 model, in an effort to shorten lead times, improve regulatory compliance and strengthen its domestic supply chain capabilities.

The facility will also house space for engineering and compliance teams focused on quality testing.

The existing industrial building is strategically located in the Acadiana region, providing easy access to Lafayette Regional/Paul Fournet Field Airport and the Port of Iberia. The area also stands at the intersection of Interstates 10 and 49, between the Houston and New Orleans markets, granting access to other U.S. customers through the Mississippi River and to international markets via the Gulf of Mexico, according to the economic development organization One Acadiana.

The location provides DMR Technologies with a “strong logistics footprint” to serve its U.S. and international customers, Ryan Case, co-founder and U.S. operations head, stated in a press release.

“This isn’t just about production — it’s about access,” Case said in a statement. “With the launch of our Lafayette facility, we’re eliminating lead time issues and delivering next-day fulfillment for many of our U.S. customers.”

The location also provides the company with the infrastructure and policy environment that DMR Technologies needs to ramp up production and operate efficiently, David Wang, co-founder and CEO, stated in a press release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9e5UC5fwuZxVVOcWnPhzl-z9asRGyeYFG8eB6jLPs4Y/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ETVJfVGVjaG5vbG9naWVzRmllbGRfUmFuZ2VyX1g1MF9kcm9uZS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-10-08 18:03:43.103930

Tesla argues that these incentives are critical for maintaining grid stability, especially as demand for AI and domestic manufacturing grows, requiring over 60 gigawatts of capacity deployment annually. The loss of these credits could disproportionately affect Tesla, which relies on them to make its EVs and energy storage solutions more affordable. For instance, the $7,500 EV credit directly reduces the cost of models like the Tesla Model 3, making them more competitive against gas-powered vehicles.

We have to get renewable energy infrastructure built, and quickly,” Kotek said in a statement.
Kotek’s order comes after the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill made sweeping changes to when and how developers can receive tax credits for building renewable energy projects.
That’s due, in part, to the approval process that renewable energy developers must navigate to get all permits necessary to begin construction.
Under the governor’s order, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, which regulates utilities, will accelerate procurement of renewable energy resources.","Oregon is preparing to fast-track solar and wind permits to take advantage of federal tax credits before they expire next year, in response to an executive order signed Monday by Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek.

It directs state agencies to prioritize, authorize and accelerate renewable energy projects in the state.

“With the elimination of promised incentives by the Trump Administration, states must step up as the last line of defense against climate catastrophe. We have to get renewable energy infrastructure built, and quickly,” Kotek said in a statement. “We cannot afford to lose this critical window; every wind and solar project we help complete now directly fights the irreversible climate damage we’re racing to prevent.”

The state needs more renewable energy projects, like wind and solar, on its grid to meet its renewable energy goals and help lower the cost of electricity.

But Oregon is nearly at the bottom of the country when it comes to adding renewables to the grid due to lengthy permitting processes as well as delays and costs associated with hooking these projects to regional transmission lines, as a joint investigation by OPB and ProPublica found.

The executive order directs state agencies, boards and commissions to take “any and all steps necessary and authorized by existing statutes ” to prioritize siting and permitting renewable energy commercial projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026.

Those projects would qualify for the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit — if they also follow other requirements and complete construction within four years. If projects fail to meet the July 4 construction deadline, they only have until December 31, 2027, to come online in order to qualify for those credits.

Kotek’s order comes after the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill made sweeping changes to when and how developers can receive tax credits for building renewable energy projects. The tax credits could fund between 30% to 50% of most solar and wind projects.

Under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, those credits sought to lower construction costs for wind and solar projects and to boost the renewable energy industry, as part of a push to help the transition from fossil fuels to power homes.

Because those credits are being phased out under the Trump-backed bill, Oregon could lose about 4 gigawatts of planned wind and solar energy, or enough renewable electricity to power one million homes. According to Atlas Public Policy, a data and policy firm based in Washington, D.C., Oregon has nine wind and solar projects now at risk of not qualifying for the tax credit.

The new deadline to receive tax credits could be especially challenging in Oregon.

That’s due, in part, to the approval process that renewable energy developers must navigate to get all permits necessary to begin construction. Those include state land use and siting permits that take years to get. A project may also have to go through an environmental impact study that could take years to finish and add additional time to when a project might be approved.

As developers wait for these permits, some also have to wait for the Bonneville Power Administration to allow projects to connect to its transmission lines, another barrier to getting these projects done. Bonneville owns about 75% of the Northwest’s transmission lines, and its lines are largely full with no capacity for new sources of electricity. It can take years before Bonneville determines whether a proposed project can plug into its grid.

Kotek’s executive order might help fast-track those projects within state agencies, but renewable developers would still need Bonneville’s approval to hook on to the grid so their power can reach homes and businesses.

Now, Oregon’s on the clock to approve and begin construction on those projects.

The executive order directs the Oregon Department of Energy and the state Energy Facility Siting Council to identify and prioritize siting approval for projects that must begin construction by July 4 to get federal incentives. The highest priority would be given to projects that have secured contracts between a developer and a utility and that can demonstrate they will provide benefits to Oregon ratepayers.

Under the governor’s order, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, which regulates utilities, will accelerate procurement of renewable energy resources. Kotek also directed the commission to consider using an outside contractor to study how solar and wind power projects connect to the electrical grid.

“Oregonians are already feeling the strain of rising energy costs and worsening climate impacts, yet Congress and the Trump administration have launched an all-out assault on affordable clean energy and our safe climate future,” Climate Solution Oregon Director Nora Apter said in a statement. “By moving swiftly to get as many wind and solar projects across the finish line as possible before the loss of federal tax credits, Governor Kotek is defending Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and energy resilience against these senseless attacks. Today’s action will help ensure that renewable energy projects can capture critical federal incentives before they disappear – keeping Oregon competitive and able to power our state’s growing energy demands with clean, affordable electricity.”

Oregon joins a handful of states that have already moved to more rapidly approve qualifying projects, like Colorado, Maine and California.

Both through legislation like the Big Beautiful Bill, as well as executive actions by the president and political leaders of federal agencies, the Trump administration has rescinded billions in previously approved federal funding for climate action and renewable energy projects.

Last week, the administration cancelled funding for an additional $400 million in renewable energy projects, most of them aimed at building out transmission, including the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and Portland General Electric’s $250 million Bethel-Round Butte transmission line.

In August, the administration also rescinded Oregon’s $87 million Solar For All Grant, a program aimed at boosting solar adoption for low-income residents. The state sent a formal letter asking the federal government to reverse its decision.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CB2PVDCAVNETZAS4QL3IEVGLBA.jpeg,N,,2025-10-08 17:05:17.988007

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

The Detroit News

(TNS)

General Motors Co. no longer will apply for federal electric vehicle tax credits as part of a scheme to extend savings to customers after Congress and President Donald Trump axed the government incentive program in September, the Detroit automaker confirmed Wednesday.

The company will continue to offer about $6,000 in savings on EV leases through October, with the cost footed by GM. The federal tax credit offered savings up to $7,500.

“GM worked on an extended offer for the benefit of our customers and dealers,” according to a GM statement. “After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit. GM will fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October.”

GM and crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. used their finance arms to place down payments on EVs in inventory from dealerships at the end of September. That would enable the companies to apply for the federal tax credits before the program expired Sept. 30 and then extend the discounts to their customers through leases beyond the deadline. Reuters was first to report GM’s reversal Wednesday.

A Ford spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on whether the automaker will reverse course on its tax credit plan.

Sources familiar with the matter said U.S. Sen. Moreno, R-Ohio, met with both GM and Ford and pressured the automakers to abandon the tax credit plan.

The automakers’ plan was to pass along savings to lessees to avoid a sudden price uptick following the loss of the tax credit.

Most EVs cost thousands of dollars more than similar gas-powered models, a top reason why the electric market is lagging in the United States. Without the tax credit, analysts and automakers predict a steep drop in sales, at least temporarily.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month he wouldn’t be surprised if U.S. EV sales are halved following the loss of the tax credit.

The idea behind Ford and GM’s programs was to help EV buyers transition away from discounted prices with the end of the government incentives.

“VOTE NO on PROP 50. STOP Newsom’s Rigged Elections!”

The signs in English and Spanish, paid for by Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, are one of the only clues in this region that California voters are hurtling toward a statewide special election next month.

Residents here would be the first to tell you they spend far more time thinking and worrying about the rising cost of living, access to water for their farms, homelessness and the threat of immigration raids than the shape of California’s 52 congressional districts.

Many of them don’t realize that in just a few weeks, they’ll be asked whether they want to temporarily change their districts — and for some, their representation in Congress — in a gerrymander that favors Democrats. And unlike in politically attuned coastal hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, traditional online, TV and mail campaign ads are rarely enough to get people to vote. Often they need an in-person push from a friend or family member.

But even those unfamiliar with the term “Proposition 50” proved they could quickly form an opinion as soon as someone — a friend, a relative, a journalist, a politician — explained the measure.

At the Kern County Fair in Bakersfield, past the Ferris wheel and rows of food stalls hawking corn dogs and Labubu-themed drinks, congressional candidate and educator Randy Villegas shook hands and snapped selfies in the exhibit hall with fairgoers at Democrats’ pamphlet-laden table.

Nearby waited Villegas’s former drumline student Nickolas Orozco, 29, a cafeteria and playground security monitor for a local elementary school. Although he was raised in a Democratic household, Orozco adopted more conservative views post-graduation when he moved to North Carolina. Now, back in Bakersfield, he considers himself a “true neutral” politically. He has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and his top concerns are affordable housing and resources for K-12 schools.

Orozco’s stern expression melted into a grin as his former teacher greeted him with a hearty handshake and slap on the back. He told Villegas he knew “little to nothing” about the upcoming special election and was at the Democrats’ booth to learn more.

“Educate me, like you used to,” Orozco said.

As Villegas explained how congressional districts are drawn every 10 years after the Census to ensure proportional representation, Orozco interjected.

“I think I may have lied, I heard about this,” he said excitedly. “This is happening in Texas.”

Yes, Villegas said, Texas Republicans redrew their maps this summer, in the middle of the decade, to help their party keep control of the U.S. House. In response, California is asking voters to temporarily suspend its current maps, drawn by an independent citizens commission, and instead adopt gerrymandered districts that favor Democrats for the next five years. Ballots are already going to voters.

“Can I count on you to vote ‘Yes’ on it?” Villegas ultimately asked.

“I don’t see why not,” Orozco replied. “I mean, we’ve got to stand up to Texas!”

A district Democrats have eyed for a long time

Newsom and his party hope Prop. 50’s new maps will help their challengers oust five congressional Republicans and offset likely GOP pickups from mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas and Missouri. But a pickup in the 22nd Congressional District, which currently spans from the town of Hanford through the San Joaquin Valley to Bakersfield, is far from guaranteed.

Democrats have long dreamt of ousting Republican Rep. David Valadao, a dairy farmer who fashions himself a political moderate. Yet to their disappointment, Valadao has consistently defied political gravity and Democrats’ voter registration advantage in the district. His only loss in the last 15 years came in 2018 during the first Donald Trump presidency after Valadao alienated voters on both sides of the aisle by voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act and in favor of Trump’s first impeachment.

But two years later, Valadao won his seat back even as former President Joe Biden won the same district by more than 10 percentage points over incumbent Trump.

A campaign spokesperson for Valadao, Andrew Renteria, did not respond to multiple emailed requests for an interview.

Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield doctor who specializes in addiction treatment, hopes she can lead Democrats to a repeat of 2018 by punishing Valadao for his vote to pass Trump’s megabill.

The legislation could in the next 10 years push an estimated 57,000 of Valadao’s most vulnerable constituents off Medi-Cal, the state’s health care program for the poor, according to an estimate from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Another 8,200 would lose access to health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Valadao’s district has the highest Medicaid enrollment rate of any congressional seat, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.

Yet Bains, who has often been a thorn in the Democratic Party’s side for her moderate approach in the state Legislature, has distanced herself from Prop. 50. She was the sole legislator to buck her party and vote against the plan to fast-track the special election. Bains declined to be interviewed through her spokesperson, Adam Capper, who said she had no additional comment on Prop. 50.

“I oppose any effort to circumvent independent redistricting, and the courts should act to stop these political games,” Bains said previously. “We don’t need more ways for politicians to rig the system.”

Farmers and other rural Californians are spooked that the new maps will dilute their votes by drawing them into districts with voters from urban centers. For instance, a new proposed district in Northern California lumps conservative, rural Modoc County with some of the state’s wealthiest communities in uber-liberal Marin County.

In the San Joaquin Valley, Prop. 50 would stretch the compact 22nd Congressional District, which currently includes parts of Kings, Tulare and Kern counties, to include the northwest corner of the city of Fresno and smaller towns like Kerman.

Jenny Holterman, a fourth-generation farmer in Kern County whose family primarily grows almonds, denounced Democrats’ redistricting plan as a “power grab” that threatens to leave farmers and rural Californians with far fewer voices in Congress.

“This is not a game. This is our livelihood. This is our representation that you’re playing with,” said Holterman. She called the Democratic effort to oust him “really sad.”

“He is that boots-on-the-ground that actually understands how an agriculture business works,” Holterman said. “That’s who should represent the valley.”

Voter turnout could decide Prop. 50’s fate

Campaign strategists and election watchers agree there are two big questions whose outcomes could decide the race — who can sell a simpler message, and which side can convince more uninformed voters to turn out.

Republicans could benefit from energizing conservatives as well as uninformed voters who, with limited information about a complex subject, might be predisposed to vote “no” and keep the status quo.

“If the message is simple enough — ‘Hey, stop Trump,’ or ‘Hey, protect our elections,’ — it’s likelier that they’ll end up turning out more voters in the valley,” said Blake Zante, executive director of nonprofit The Maddy Institute which focuses on public policy affecting the San Joaquin Valley.

On a recent Friday just after 7:30 a.m., Democrats Doug Hillhouse and John Waddell waved American flags and signs from an overpass on Highway 198, just outside the town of Lemoore.

Dubbed the “Bridge Brigade,” the two men, along with several others from the Kings County Democrats, alerted the drivers below to the upcoming special election and urged them to vote “Yes.” Lashed to the bridge was a series of poster boards that read, “Worried? Register to vote. Yes on 50,” while another urged drivers to honk their horns.

“We’re out here fighting the demagoguery,” said Hillhouse, a former Republican who became a Democrat after Trump took over the GOP. He argued that Prop. 50 represents a proportional “tit for tat” response to Texas Republicans.

“If we don’t get that passed, we’re going to be doomed to Republican rule,” said Waddell, who stood next to Hillhouse on the bridge and carried a sign that read, “ICE is gestapo.”

While the bridge brigades, billboards and television advertisements might raise awareness about Prop. 50, those alone won’t guarantee that voters turn out, said Zante. Instead, person-to-person voter engagement through door-knocking — but especially through conversations with friends and family — is much more effective at getting voters to cast ballots.

Reno Lanfranco, who owns several businesses in Kerman, about 20 minutes west of Fresno, views Prop. 50 as Newsom’s personal vanity project and a waste of taxpayer money. He blames California Democrats for high taxes — sales, income and gasoline — as well as what he feels is a byzantine regulatory system.

“I’m telling everybody — all my employees, if they want to listen to me or not, and all my customers — vote no on it,” said Lanfranco, an imposing figure with his plaid work shirt stretched taut across his muscled frame, as he surveyed his hardware store.

Prop. 50 would also disenfranchise conservative voters like himself, he argues, which is especially infuriating since Democrats hold a legislative supermajority and control all statewide offices.

“We have very few Republicans in office now and it’ll just squeeze the rest of them out,” he said. “That’s not right.”

One of Lanfranco’s employees credits his boss with helping him understand what’s at stake in the next special election. Shawn Delgado, a 24-year-old clerk at the hardware store, hadn’t heard of Prop. 50 until a CalMatters reporter asked for his opinion on it. After some follow-up research and talking with his boss, he’s leaning toward a “no” vote.

“We already have a bipartisan committee to decide those maps,” said Delgado, who voted for the first time in 2024 and supported Trump. While he acknowledged that redrawing California’s maps might be “more fair as a whole for the country,” he argued California shouldn’t gerrymander and disenfranchise its own Republican voters just because other states are redrawing their maps.

Fear of immigration raids could keep some voters home

One potential roadblock to voter education in the Valley is the palpable fear of immigration enforcement raids, even among citizens. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to allow law enforcement to racially profile their targets has stoked existing fears and prompted many Latino people to stay home, lock their doors and refuse to answer the door for anyone they don’t know, even if they are U.S. citizens.

Maria Pacheco, the mayor of Kerman and a frequent leader of local protests against immigration and customs enforcement, said many Hispanic residents are “politically disillusioned” and aren’t paying close attention to Prop. 50 — and she doesn’t blame them.

“How do you get the community to come out and vote when they’re afraid to come and go to the grocery store?” Pacheco said.

She noted that any white vans or SUVs that drive through town immediately trigger her and others who are fearful of ICE. “How do you get the community to want to participate when they’re seeing that their government is against them right now?”

But Pacheco also said she was enraged by the “racist and inhumane” rhetoric that Texas Republicans, specifically Gov. Greg Abbott, have used to justify their detention and deportation of Hispanic people who they claim are violent criminals or entered the country illegally. While ICE has not conducted raids in Kerman or the surrounding area, she’s on edge. It’s not a matter of if, but when, the immigration crackdown will come.

“Harvest is coming to a close. So, is this when they’re gonna do it? When we’re no longer needed?” she said.

After Texas redrew its congressional maps to give Republicans an edge in five additional districts, Pacheco was proud of Newsom and California for “not just sitting back and allowing it,” but taking a stand and asking the people to weigh in as well. She’s worked to turn that pride into momentum and is encouraging community members to participate in the special election.

In one-on-one and small-group meetings with Hispanic voters, Pacheco emphasizes that voting “Yes” on Prop. 50 with a mail-in ballot from the relative safety of their homes is a small yet crucial act of resistance and a step toward reclaiming the humanity the Trump administration and GOP states have worked to strip away.

“We can’t just sit and be complacent. We have to be brave,” Pacheco said. “We have to be uncomfortable for just a little while so that we can turn this around and make a difference.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092525-Redistricting-Day-2-LV-31.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-08 16:02:23.373134

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union should ease its CO2 reduction targets for cars, vans and trucks, with longer compliance periods and a greater role for hybrid vehicles and alternative fuels, the bloc’s auto association said on Wednesday.

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) presented proposals to the European Commission, which is due to review its targets by the end of the year, taking into account the squeeze on the sector from U.S. tariffs and Chinese supremacy in electric vehicles.

ACEA’s premise is that cutting new car and van CO2 emissions by 100% by 2035 with intermediate 2030 targets is no longer feasible, with automakers facing fines for factors beyond their control, such as insufficient charging stations or low demand.

EVs have a market share of around 15.8% of new EU cars, with vans at 8.5% and trucks at 3.6%.

For cars, ACEA proposes that compliance with 2030 targets should be based on the average for the five-year period 2028-2032, that small EVs should be given a super credit towards meeting targets and that plug-in hybrids and range-extenders play a greater role.

It also wants vehicles using carbon-neutral fuels to be put on a par with EVs and incentives for decarbonisation initiatives, such as using green steel.

For vans, it recommends meeting 2025 CO2 emission targets over the period 2025-2029 and modifying the 50% reduction target for 2030. For trucks, ACEA wants a review earlier than the planned 2027 and urgent action to prevent manufacturers from being fined for missing current targets.

Transport and environment campaign group T&E said ACEA’s proposals would create loopholes, meaning carmakers would only have to achieve a 52% EV market share in 2035.

ACEA said this was a very premature assessment and that the clear majority of vehicles sold would be electric. Allowing flexibility would not slow down the transformation, it said, but would ensure the bloc’s economic security.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the automaker devised a scheme towards the end of September under which its in-house lending arm, called GM Financial, would initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The automaker planned to apply for the federal tax credit on those cars. This money would then be rolled into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year under the plan.

The company was planning to claim credit on roughly 20,000 EVs on dealership lots or en route to stores under the plan, the report said.

However, GM has now opted to kill the plan and decided not to claim the tax credit, a spokesperson told Reuters. As per the report, the decision was influenced by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, who raised concerns about the scheme.

Federal tax credit of $7,500 on the purchase of new EVs expired on Sept. 30, raising prices for end customers and creating concerns about EV demand in the fourth quarter.

Reuters on Wednesday noted that it is unaware if Ford is continuing a similar program it devised while nearing tax credit expiration.

GM shares traded 1% lower at the time of writing. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around GM rose from ‘neutral’ to ‘bullish’ territory over the past 24 hours, while message volume stayed at ‘normal’ levels.

GM stock is up by 7% this year and by about 23% over the past 12 months.

There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm.

Last week, the White House announced that it was going to abruptly terminate nearly $500 million in clean energy grant funding to factories and other businesses across New York. These cuts will risk more than 1,000 good-paying jobs and harm economic growth in regions across the state, with an estimated statewide economic hit of $650 million. With the cancellation of these projects, communities will suffer and families will go without paychecks, including those in the very districts whose Congressional representatives continue to greenlight reckless cuts out of Washington.

“Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York's economy and hard-working families are paying the price,” Governor Hochul said. “These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state's economic progress. New York Republicans should grow a spine, stand with our workers and demand that President Trump restore this funding.”

Empire State Development President, CEO, and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “These federal cuts are shutting down projects already underway, and will stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good paying jobs. Communities that were on the brink of transformative growth will now face stalled investments and lost paychecks, as New York's progress toward a sustainable future stalls. Governor Hochul continues to stand up and speak out for New Yorkers, and the businesses looking to drive economic growth in the 21st century.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “These federal funding cuts put thousands of good-paying jobs at risk while harming the momentum of New York's clean energy industry by creating further uncertainty for the organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow here. Once again, short-sighted political games at the federal level will undermine innovation and progress in one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy.”

Senator Charles Schumer said, “Donald Trump’s rash actions will hike energy costs for New Yorkers and waste hundreds of millions in investment by wiping out projects already underway in his reckless campaign of chaos & revenge. This goes beyond targeting blue states. It is taking a wrecking ball to working families’ lives from Jamestown to Rockland County, putting countless construction workers out of jobs and raising families’ electric bills just to score petty political points. NY House Republicans’ silence — as Trump rips away billions of sound investment and thousands of good-paying jobs from their backyard — is deafening. Instead of playing politics with the shutdown, President Trump should be working on bipartisan solutions to lower Americans’ costs, boost diverse energy supply, and create jobs.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Clean energy is the way of the future for a healthier and more affordable New York State. These Trump administration cuts will have devastating consequences for New Yorkers’ quality of life, the state’s economy, and the overall wellbeing of our communities. I am deeply disappointed in my Republican colleagues who are turning their backs to their constituents by supporting these funding cuts.”

Representative Jerrold Nadler said, “Trump has brazenly cut half a billion dollars in clean energy funding, and my Republican colleagues lack the spine to stand up to him. We will not let Donald Trump’s personal campaign of retribution against our city and state continue down this reckless path. This careless decision will have detrimental consequences; if New York’s economy gets hit, the entire country will feel it, thousands of good paying jobs will be lost, and hard-working families will go without paychecks. These cuts must be reversed immediately, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on Trump to give New York our already approved funding back.”

Representative Nydia M. Velázquez said, “These cuts are a direct attack on New Yorkers and our clean energy future. These grants create good jobs, grow our economy, and move our state toward sustainability. Stripping away this funding threatens workers in my district and across the state and undermines the progress our communities have fought to achieve. New York Republicans need to stand with their constituents instead of standing by while this administration puts New Yorkers’ livelihoods on the line.”

Representative Yvette D. Clarke said, “At a time when Trump’s devastating cuts risk undermining the economic stability of communities across New York, our neighbors statewide are pleading with their Republican representatives to stand up for them, their families, and their futures – but they’ve heard nothing back but betrayal. New York Republicans are running out of time to figure out if they serve the people who put them in Congress, or the corrupt president who will toss them aside the instant they’re no longer useful. I stand with Governor Hochul and the people of our state in demanding my Republican colleagues make the right choice by, at long last, putting New York first.”

Representative Grace Meng said, “We should always be working to promote jobs and economic growth in our state and that includes New York’s clean energy sector. I have spoken out against cuts made by the administration that harm our local communities, and I will continue to do so. New York deserves to receive all the resources we require.”

Representative Adriano Espaillat said, “From the rising costs of groceries, utilities, and housing, affordability is among the highest concerns facing New Yorkers and their families. Yet, the Trump administration has failed to work collaboratively to find solutions that would provide families the much needed relief they deserve. Rather than focusing on solutions to curb these ballooning costs, the administration has canceled critical projects and programs that communities rely on. We will stand firm to combat the administration’s ineffective and dangerous policies that threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of New York families and we will hold them accountable.”

Representative Paul Tonko said, “Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to advance our state’s growing 21st century economy, Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have chosen to unilaterally terminate hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy funding for New York State and our Capital Region. Let’s be clear — these aren’t Democratic or Republican projects. These are cutting-edge programs working to drive innovation and bring energy costs down for everyone. By canceling hundreds of these projects across the nation, Donald Trump and his enablers are showing that they care more about their own power than about making life affordable or delivering good-paying jobs for the American people. It’s time for my Republican colleagues to stand up to this bullying behavior and advocate for the best interests of our communities.”

Representative Joe Morelle said, “At the direction of Donald Trump, Congressional Republicans chose to shut down the government rather than negotiate with Democrats—and New Yorkers are paying the price. These cancelled grants—including over $75 million destined for the Rochester region—will hurt businesses and families across our great state. As Vice Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’m working with my colleagues to stand up to Donald Trump and secure the federal investments New Yorkers deserve.”

Representative Dan Goldman said, “Donald Trump’s reckless and shortsighted clean energy cuts are nothing short of partisan warfare against New Yorkers. After kicking over a million New Yorkers off their health care, Trump and his New York Republican allies like Elise Stefanik and Mike Lawler are now yanking away half a billion dollars in clean energy funding as punishment for a shutdown they caused. They’re putting politics over paychecks and jeopardizing thousands of good-paying union jobs in communities across our state. Once again, New York Republicans in Congress would rather serve Trump’s political agenda than stand up for their own constituents.”

Representative Tim Kennedy said, “Canceling these shovel-ready projects will kill jobs, stifle innovation, and raise costs for working families. These projects would have lowered energy costs and strengthened our grid during severe weather. Instead, Trump and Congressional Republicans have again sided with special interests over their own constituents, making it harder for families to pay their bills and for America to lead in the industries of the future. Western New Yorkers should be building the technologies that power the next generation, not watching those opportunities disappear because of Republicans in Washington.”

Representative John W. Mannion said, “This administration thinks research and innovation only matter in the states they won in an election. They're wrong. These reckless cuts are job killers that hurt families across New York. They also sell out our future, hand an advantage to China, and will drive up energy costs for everyone. This funding should be restored immediately - and I'm advocating to restore it in congressional districts represented by either party, because that's what's good and right for all New Yorkers and all Americans.”

Representative Josh Riley said, “Families and small businesses in the Hudson Valley and Southern Tier are already getting squeezed by sky-high utility bills — and now this administration wants to make it even harder to keep the lights on. These cuts will only make life more expensive for working people. I’ve fought utility monopolies and their outrageous rate hikes, and I’ll keep fighting to restore funding and lower costs for Upstate New Yorkers.”

Assemblymember Al Stirpe said, “The ongoing attack from the current federal administration on anything that promotes clean energy continues unabated. Any disruption in already approved funding for these programs threatens the potential for new, high-paying jobs, stifles economic growth, and stagnates significant progress towards greener alternatives. As Chairman of the State Assembly Economic Development Committee, it is clear that such cuts do nothing but set New York State’s businesses and communities back – all while hurting real people and working families in the process. Companies that had been planning their next steps forward in the clean energy sector will now be faced with unnecessary hardship or be forced to reconsider critical investments. Without restoring this funding, New York risks falling behind in one of its fastest-growing industries and losing hard-won progress in the clean energy sector.”

Assemblymember Micah Lasher said, “Donald Trump is once again targeting New York's economy by slashing funding for clean energy, putting thousands of good-paying jobs on the chopping block. Every Republican member of Congress from New York has a lot to answer for. I stand with Governor Hochul in demanding that these cuts be immediately reversed.”

Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy said, “Clean energy investment has been one of the most effective drivers of growth in our state, fostering innovation, strengthening our economy, and positioning us as a leader in sustainability. The withdrawal of these funds threatens to stall that momentum and undermine years of progress. I urge the Trump administration to reconsider this decision and fully restore the funding. Maintaining our commitment to clean energy is not only sound environmental policy, but it is also a vital economic necessity for the Capital Region and New York State as a whole.”

Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz said, “Who is served by these cruel and vicarious cuts supported by New York’s cravenly sycophantic GOP caucus? Did New York Republicans realize that they were electing ‘representatives’ who would gladly vote to crush their local economies, strip away good-paying jobs, and let their communities wither all to pay for tax cuts for billionaires? It’s disturbing that elected officials would so openly and brazenly vote against the best interests of their constituents, but that’s today’s GOP. Their legacy will be one of shame and dishonor, accumulated in the service of a felon. New York deserves far, far better than this group of feckless bootlickers who sell us out for their own benefit.”

City of Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said, “GE Vernova has played a vital role in revitalizing the GE campus through continued innovation in clean energy technologies. However, the proposed federal funding cuts threaten to significantly impede this progress, with far-reaching negative impacts not only on the company's momentum but also on the broader economic and workforce development efforts across the city and county.”

Amherst Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa said, “Not only do these cuts immediately impact families and businesses, by cutting funding for clean energy development, Washington is taking direct aim at future generations. There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm. Today’s investments are the cornerstone that builds industry of tomorrow. These cuts are reckless and they significantly hurt local communities. I join Governor Hochul in urging our local representatives to immediately restore this vital funding – we need to invest in energy the same as we invest in infrastructure, it is our lifeblood.”

Henrietta Town Supervisor Steve Schultz said, “The need to reduce our environmental impact is reinforced almost every news cycle with violent storms, record high temperatures, shrinking glaciers, and rising sea waters. As with any developing technology, it can have difficulty competing with established solutions. This is where a responsible government steps in with incentive programs and policies to help level the playing field while those new technologies mature. The United States has a long history of such programs, which has helped the nation not only lead the world in new technologies but become an economic superpower while doing so. The investment in these new technologies pays dividends in the long term. Plug Power, Inc, in Henrietta, is an example of this, creating clean energy equipment for use in industrial and commercial settings. Dramatic cuts, especially those of a retaliatory or vindictive nature as we have seen lately out of Washington, will have a lasting negative impact that could take years or decades to recover from.”

Brighton Town Supervisor William Moehle said, “The Trump administration’s attacks on green energy investments are bad for the nation, but they are especially bad for Brighton. $4,969,022 in funding has been cut for one of Brighton’s high technology businesses, Ionomr Innovations, which conducts cutting edge clean technology research here in Brighton. Now more than ever, it is important to fund advances in clean energy technology, and I call on the administration to restore this important research funding for America’s future.”

Albany County Legislature Chairwoman Joanne Cunningham said, “We are resilient in Albany County. Even with nearly $111 million of our taxpayers’ funding not returning to us, we will continue to support our local business community with our state partners and Governor Hochul in particular. Recognizing the uncertainty of federal funding, we are proactively working to advance development in Albany County through our partnership with the State and the Governor on the multi-million-dollar expansion of the Albany Capital Center. We’re also thankful for the $400 million the State is investing in Downtown Albany at her request. With this continued support, we’re confident we can overcome this latest challenge.”

Rensselaer County Legislature Deputy Minority Leader Nina Nichols said, “Governor Hochul stands with the thousands of New Yorkers whose livelihoods are threatened by Washington’s reckless cuts. Slashing $500 million in clean energy grants doesn’t just stall progress—it risks over 1,000 good-paying jobs and delivers a $650 million blow to our economy. These communities deserve investment, not abandonment.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/thumbnails/image/wind_offshore.jpg?h=765d7f50&itok=gHZpIsa4,N,,2025-10-08 16:01:54.878719

EV Charger Rebates in Indiana In addition to federal credits, Indiana businesses may qualify for statewide and utility rebates that further reduce costs.
For businesses in Indiana, EV charger rebates and the commercial EV tax credit make installing chargers far more affordable than most realize.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer a niche market. More consumers and businesses are choosing EVs every year, and commercial properties that install EV chargers can benefit from increased customer traffic, tenant satisfaction, and long-term property value. For many businesses, the biggest concern is cost. Fortunately, EV charger rebates in Indiana and federal tax credits make installation much more affordable.

To make this easier, we’ll break down what business owners need to know about available incentives, eligibility, and how to maximize your return on investment.

The Cost of Commercial EV Charger Installation

Before diving into incentives, it’s important to understand what businesses typically spend. Commercial EV charger installation costs vary based on:

Type of charger – Level 2 chargers are more affordable and common, while DC fast chargers require a bigger investment.

Electrical upgrades – Some properties need panel upgrades, trenching, or new wiring to support the load.

Permits and compliance – Meeting local electrical codes, ADA accessibility, and inspection requirements adds to the total cost.

On average, businesses can expect installation to range from $6,000–$12,000 for Level 2 chargers, and $30,000+ for DC fast chargers. That’s where commercial EV tax credits and rebates become crucial.

Federal EV Charger Tax Credit

The federal government offers strong financial support through the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit.

Covers 30% of installation costs (equipment + labor).

Maximum credit of $100,000 per charger for commercial projects.

Applies to both Level 2 and DC fast charging stations.

This credit was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act, meaning businesses still have access to these savings for projects completed in the coming years.

EV Charger Rebates in Indiana

In addition to federal credits, Indiana businesses may qualify for statewide and utility rebates that further reduce costs. While programs change frequently, here are common opportunities:

Utility Incentives – Some Indiana utility companies offer rebates for installing commercial charging infrastructure. These can cover anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per charger.

State & Regional Grants – Programs tied to environmental goals sometimes provide additional funding for EV infrastructure, especially for fleets or multi-unit properties.

Partnership Programs – Businesses may also receive cost-sharing incentives if they partner with charger networks to make their stations public.

It’s always smart to consult with a licensed installer who stays updated on Indiana rebate availability.

Stacking Incentives for Maximum Savings

The good news? Businesses can often combine federal credits with state or utility rebates. For example:

A hotel installs four Level 2 chargers at $40,000 total.

A federal tax credit covers 30% ($12,000).

The utility rebate contributes another $6,000.

Final out-of-pocket cost: just $22,000.

By stacking incentives, businesses can cut nearly half of their upfront expense.

Why Businesses Should Act Now

The EV market is growing rapidly, and properties without charging risk being left behind. By installing chargers now, businesses benefit from:

First-mover advantage – Attract eco-conscious customers and tenants before competitors.

Tax savings before programs expire – Incentives are powerful, but they’re not guaranteed forever.

Future-proofing properties – As EV adoption grows, demand for charging stations will only increase.

How To Get Started

Consult a Commercial EV Installer – A licensed electrician can assess your site’s electrical capacity, permitting needs, and charger options.

Research Incentives – Check federal, state, and utility programs that apply to your property.

Plan for Scalability – Even if you start small, consider installing infrastructure (conduit, panels) for future expansion.

Apply for Credits and Rebates Early – Many programs have limited funding windows.

For businesses in Indiana, EV charger rebates and the commercial EV tax credit make installing chargers far more affordable than most realize. From retail centers and hotels to office parks and multi-unit housing, these incentives help properties stay competitive while supporting a greener future.

With the right planning and professional installation, you can take advantage of available funding, reduce upfront costs, and enjoy long-term benefits for both your business and your community.",https://www.zimmermanelectricindy.com/hubfs/Zimm%20blog%20-%20commercial%20ev%20(3).jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:03.215435

Addition led the round, with support from existing and new investors. The fresh capital will help Base scale up operations, grow its team, and build out domestic manufacturing to meet surging demand for resilient, distributed home batteries.

Base Power is a licensed electricity provider operating in Texas’s deregulated electricity market, and it functions as a virtual power plant (VPP). Its model is simple but transformative: customers pay a monthly fee for energy, installation, and a home battery – no rooftop solar required. When the grid is up, Base’s networked batteries help stabilize it; when it goes down, the battery keeps the lights on at home.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Zach Dell, Base Power’s CEO and cofounder. “We’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

In under two years, Base has already deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours (MWh) of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-growing distributed energy platforms in the US. The company’s rapid growth has been fueled by organic customer demand, partnerships with major homebuilders like Lennar, and collaborations with forward-thinking utilities.

Base Power currently serves homeowners across the Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin regions, and plans to expand nationwide. To support that growth, the company is building its first factory, an energy storage and power electronics manufacturing hub at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin.

The company also recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to participate directly in the grid market. That means extra reliability for the state and lower costs for customers through shared revenue from grid services.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by deploying hardware — and we need to make that here in the US, ourselves,” said Justin Lopas, Base’s COO and cofounder. “This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second. We’re building the tools and systems to reindustrialize America and reinvent the grid.”

Electrek’s Take

Texas’s grid struggles, from heatwaves to winter blackouts, make Base Power’s model timely. Linking home batteries to a virtual power plant offers home backup and grid support. (I was part of a VPP in Vermont, and I can’t stress enough how great it is, especially in power outages.)

With $1 billion in new funding and a planned Austin factory, Base aims to scale fast. For context, Tesla deployed over 31 GWh of storage in 2024, but that figure includes utility-scale Megapacks as well as residential Powerwalls because Tesla didn’t separate out the two in its report. Sunrun’s VPPs now include 20,000+ customers across nine states, and it supplies significant grid support in California. Base’s 100 MWh so far is much smaller, but as a licensed electricity provider, not just a technology platform, its focused Texas rollout and participation in the state’s ADER program could position it as a nimble challenger in the growing VPP space.

While electric vehicles and hybrid car sales were up throughout the beginning of this year, experts do not expect this upward trend to continue.
“The state envisions the large-scale transition of Colorado’s transportation system to zero emission vehicles,” said Colorado’s 2023 Electric Vehicle Plan.
This includes 940,000 electric vehicles on Colorado roads by 2030, as explained previously by Toor.","(The Center Square) – As national incentives for electric vehicles end, Colorado has decided to jump in and offer its own incentives.

Last week, Gov. Jared Polis announced an increase in Colorado’s point-of-sale electric vehicle rebates.

“The market has made it clear: EVs are here to stay. Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost,” Polis said. “I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: Get out there right now.”

Starting Nov. 3, rebates will increase from $6,000 to $9,000 for new EV purchases and leases and $4,000 to $6,000 for used EV purchases and leases.

These rebates are all through the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program, which is designed to assist income-qualified Coloradans “recycle and replace their old or high-emitting vehicles” with EVs. When the program launched in 2023, it received $25.6 million in funding from the Colorado Energy Office for its first three years. Polis’ office said it anticipates it will also receive ongoing funding through 2032.

To meet eligibility criteria, the buyer must have a household income below 80% of the area median income in the county where the resident lives. In the past two years, just over 2,700 Coloradans have taken advantage of the credits.

The state hopes this will continue to incentivize Coloradans to buy electric vehicles.

“Transportation is a leading source of emissions in Colorado, making widespread EV adoption essential to achieve our climate goals,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor. “Coloradans have made it clear that they want EVs, and with Congress revoking key incentives that save Coloradans money, we are stepping up. These increased incentives will help ensure EVs stay affordable in Colorado as we work toward nearly 1 million EVs on our roads by 2030.”

This comes even as market experts anticipate a decline in EV sales, as previously reported by The Center Square.

While electric vehicles and hybrid car sales were up throughout the beginning of this year, experts do not expect this upward trend to continue.

“With credits disappearing and shrinking, we expected a sharp downturn in these numbers,” said the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves. It is unclear how Colorado increasing rebates might affect that prediction.

Longterm, the state hopes that light-duty electric vehicles will make up “nearly 100%” of the market share by 2050.

“The state envisions the large-scale transition of Colorado’s transportation system to zero emission vehicles,” said Colorado’s 2023 Electric Vehicle Plan.

In response to the Unleashing American Energy EO, CEQ issued a rulemaking removing their authority to create new regulations under NEPA and to remove current CEQ NEPA regulations from the federal code on February 25. CEQ also issued a memo directing federal agencies to “revise or establish their NEPA implementing procedures (or establish such procedures if they do not yet have any) to expedite permitting approvals and for consistency with NEPA as amended by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), including the deadlines established in NEPA.”

On July 3, several agencies released updated NEPA procedures in accordance with the CEQ memo. USDA, DOE, DOI, DOT and the Army Corps of Engineers published interim final rules while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) published a final rule. NACo submitted comments to the five agencies accepting comments on their interim final rule. The comment letter can be found here.

The updated NEPA guidelines present several challenges for counties. CEQ provided NEPA guidance that was standard across the federal government. However, the recent rescission of the CEQ guidance has created a patchwork NEPA system that could lead to delays for projects that must potentially clear multiple sets of guidance across multiple agencies.

The role of counties as cooperating agencies is also unclear in this new patchwork NEPA system. Counties support streamlining the NEPA process to better serve residents through the construction of critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, highways, ports, irrigation systems, forest management, transmission lines, energy projects, broadband and water infrastructure. However, not all the agencies included in this analysis outline how counties and other local government stakeholders will be included during the early stages of the planning process.

Tax credits: Pretax or income tax, or some of each

While tax credits are typically claimed on the income tax return, there is diversity in how they are accounted for in the financial statements. This diversity arises from a number of factors, including:

who generates the tax credit;

how the tax credit can be monetized; and

what the tax credit is designed to incentivize.

Adding to this diversity are the policy choices in US GAAP – of which there are many – and practices that have developed over time as entities try to apply the limited guidance available.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) ushered in a new era of credit monetization – introducing elective payment (direct pay) and third-party transfer provisions that expanded access to tax credits well beyond the traditional tax-paying population.

Red States Might Be Next.,"Maxine Joselow, Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, maxine-joselow, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/climate/trump-clean-energy-grants-cuts.html,"The New York figures represent the first official tally of how the funding cuts, which so far have largely targeted Democratic-led states, would affect the state and its growing clean energy sector.
At the same time, many lawmakers and companies fear that the Energy Department could soon cancel even more funding, including for projects in Republican-led states.
The Energy Department said on Wednesday it had not made any final decisions beyond the initial $7.5 billion in cancellations announced last week.
“The department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Energy Department, wrote in an email.
The Trump administration initially chose to slash a subset of those funds, about $7.5 billion, that were largely concentrated in blue states.","The Energy Department’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for clean energy projects is poised to cause significant job losses and disruptions, leaders of several states have said, even as internal documents suggest that the agency may be contemplating deeper cuts in the months ahead.

The agency’s termination of more than two dozen grants in New York State alone would threaten more than 1,000 jobs and nearly $500 million in investments in the state, according to figures compiled by the office of Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, and reviewed by The New York Times.

The New York figures represent the first official tally of how the funding cuts, which so far have largely targeted Democratic-led states, would affect the state and its growing clean energy sector. They come as President Trump appears to be seeking to maximize the pain of the government shutdown for his political opponents, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader.

At the same time, many lawmakers and companies fear that the Energy Department could soon cancel even more funding, including for projects in Republican-led states. An internal document circulating among lobbyists and lawmakers suggests that the agency is considering terminating an additional $12 billion in Biden-era awards, including funding for two large projects in Louisiana and Texas that aimed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Technology that removes carbon dioxide, a main driver of global warming, is supported by some oil and gas companies that want to use that captured gas to extract more crude from mature oil fields. One of the federal hubs would have been located in the Louisiana district of Representative Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker.

The Energy Department said on Wednesday it had not made any final decisions beyond the initial $7.5 billion in cancellations announced last week.

“The department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Energy Department, wrote in an email. “No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced. Any reporting suggesting otherwise is false.”

In New York, most of the canceled funding would have gone toward Democratic congressional districts. But some of the money would have benefited Republican districts in the blue state, including those of Representatives Nick Langworthy and Mike Lawler.

“By refusing to stand up to Trump, New York Republicans in Congress are stabbing their own constituents in the back,” Ms. Hochul said in a statement. “Instead of celebrating the opening of a local factory or congratulating a neighbor on their new six-figure job, these Congress members would rather stand idly by as Trump strips their communities of 21st century economic opportunity.”

The Energy Department had awarded more than $26 million to two companies in Mr. Lawler’s Hudson Valley district, including a company developing advanced batteries. “I’m in New York and I’m a Republican, and obviously this project cancellation impacts my district, so it’s not just Democrats getting impacted,” Mr. Lawler told CNN.

A spokesman for Mr. Lawler, Ciro Riccardi, blamed Democrats for the shutdown. “None of this would be happening if Senator Schumer and his caucus hadn’t shut down the government at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries,” he wrote in an email.

In the Central New York district of Representative John Mannion, a Democrat, a factory that makes parts for electric heat pumps may no longer pursue a $25 million expansion after the Energy Department canceled a $5 million grant to help pay for the project. The expansion of the Bitzer Scroll plant would have added a new assembly line, initially creating 20 jobs.

“The whole thing of Trump bringing jobs back to America is completely running in reverse for us,” John Allcott, vice president of North American operations for Bitzer Scroll, told the local media outlet Syracuse.com. “It’s just killing us.”

For months, political appointees at the Energy Department have been reviewing billions of dollars worth of climate and infrastructure spending that had been awarded by the Biden administration, claiming that the money was rushed out the door but providing few details about specific problems.

In recent weeks, the Energy Department sent the White House’s Office of Management and Budget a list of roughly $23 billion in funding that it had marked for potential termination, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to describe internal documents.

The Trump administration initially chose to slash a subset of those funds, about $7.5 billion, that were largely concentrated in blue states. The cuts underscored the administration’s strategy of putting pressure on Democrats to accept a Republican budget bill and reopen the government.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled,” Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, wrote in a social media post last week.

Those projects include major upgrades to electrical grids in California, Minnesota and Oregon; efforts to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations in Colorado; and large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest.

This week, however, a leaked list marking an additional $12 billion in potential terminations has been circulating in Washington. It indicated that funding could be canceled for dozens of projects in Republican-led states as well.

That larger list of potentially affected projects includes the five remaining clean hydrogen hubs in places like Appalachia, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest and Texas, many of which aimed to produce hydrogen from natural gas. It would also include a variety of grants for retooling automotive factories to produce electric vehicles or to recycle lithium-ion batteries.

The list of expanded targets also suggests that the Energy Department is considering axing up to $1.2 billion in awards for so-called direct air capture hubs in Louisiana and Texas. Those hubs, authorized by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, aimed to test and scale up technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

It is uncertain whether or when the Energy Department might go through with this additional wave of cuts, and the leaked list has set off a furious lobbying battle in Washington to save projects. Some companies that would be directly affected by the cuts said they had not heard of any final decisions.

“We aren’t aware of a decision from D.O.E. and continue to productively engage with the administration in a project review,” said Vikrum Aiyer, head of global policy at Heirloom, a company working on carbon dioxide removal and a main participant in Louisiana’s direct air capture hub.

Companies or universities that receive federal awards typically sign a legally binding agreement and then spend their own money, on the expectation that they will be reimbursed by the government. Any recipients that have their funding axed could potentially sue the Energy Department, just as recipients from the Environmental Protection Agency have sued after the Trump administration canceled their grants.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08cli-energy-mtkb/08cli-energy-mtkb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:01:58.337383

Many European countries have ambitious decarbonization targets and supportive policies for clean energy technologies, creating a favorable environment for Plug Power’s hydrogen solutions.",", a key player in the green hydrogen market with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, is navigating a period of significant transition as it grapples with leadership changes, financial challenges, and a strategic pivot towards global markets. According to InvestingPro data, the company has shown strong momentum with an impressive 246% price return over the past six months, though it continues to face operational challenges. The company, known for its hydrogen fuel cells and production technologies, is at a critical juncture as it seeks to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions while addressing operational hurdles and regulatory uncertainties.

Leadership Transition and Strategic Direction

Plug Power recently announced a significant leadership change, with Jose Luis Crespo set to become the new CEO in March 2026, succeeding Andy Marsh, who will transition to Executive Chair of the Board. Crespo, currently serving as Chief Revenue Officer, brings nearly 12 years of experience with the company and is expected to drive growth, particularly in European markets.

This transition comes at a crucial time for Plug Power as it enters its next growth phase. The company is shifting its focus towards expanding its presence in Europe, a move driven in part by uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and potential changes to the 45V tax credit for hydrogen production. This strategic pivot aims to diversify the company’s market exposure and tap into regions with favorable clean energy policies.

Financial Performance and Market Position

Plug Power’s financial performance has been a mixed bag, with recent quarters showing both promise and challenges. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported revenue of $174.0 million, surpassing analyst estimates. This performance was largely driven by strong electrolyzer sales, which reached $45 million compared to an estimated $25 million.

Despite this positive revenue surprise, Plug Power has revised its full-year revenue outlook for 2025 to $700 million, down from the previous target of $850-$950 million. This adjustment reflects ongoing challenges in the market and the company’s operational environment. InvestingPro analysis reveals concerning fundamentals, including a negative gross profit margin of -66.5% and significant cash burn. InvestingPro subscribers have access to 16 additional key insights about PLUG’s financial health and market position.

Looking ahead, analysts project revenue growth from $628.8 million in 2024 to $1,132.5 million in 2027, indicating significant expansion potential. However, this growth trajectory is accompanied by concerns over profitability and cash burn rates.

Operational Challenges and Cost Reduction Efforts

One of the primary challenges facing Plug Power is its ongoing struggle to achieve profitability. The company has been grappling with high cash burn rates, with $230 million burned in Q2 2025, up from $146 million in the previous quarter. InvestingPro data shows the company’s total debt stands at $992 million, though it maintains a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.59 and a current ratio of 1.59, indicating sufficient liquidity to meet short-term obligations. This significant cash outflow has raised concerns about the company’s liquidity and its potential need for expensive debt or equity financing.

In response to these challenges, Plug Power has initiated a comprehensive cost reduction program. The company aims to achieve $200 million in annualized cost savings across various operational areas. These efforts are crucial for improving the company’s financial health and moving towards profitability.

Encouragingly, there have been signs of improvement in gross margins, which rose from -55% to -31% quarter-over-quarter. This progress is attributed to equipment cost reductions and better hydrogen pricing. Management has set an ambitious goal of reaching gross margin breakeven by the end of 2025, a target that will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Impact

The regulatory landscape plays a significant role in shaping Plug Power’s prospects, particularly in the United States. The company has been navigating uncertainties surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act and potential changes to hydrogen production tax credits. These policy shifts have the potential to significantly impact the demand for Plug Power’s products and services in the U.S. market.

The clarification of the 45V Production Tax Credit (PTC) and 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has provided some positive policy tailwinds for Plug Power. However, delays in finalizing these rules have slowed market adoption, creating short-term challenges for the company.

In response to these regulatory uncertainties, Plug Power has been actively exploring opportunities in European markets, including Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, and the UK. This geographical diversification strategy aims to mitigate risks associated with U.S. policy changes and tap into regions with supportive clean energy initiatives.

Market Opportunities and Growth Potential

Despite the challenges, Plug Power remains well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Based on InvestingPro’s comprehensive Fair Value analysis, PLUG currently appears to be trading near its Fair Value.

One significant opportunity lies in the potential for hydrogen to supplement U.S. power grid shortages. As the energy sector continues to transition towards cleaner alternatives, Plug Power’s technologies could play a crucial role in addressing grid stability and reliability concerns.

Furthermore, the company’s expansion into European markets opens up new growth prospects. With many European countries aggressively pursuing decarbonization goals, Plug Power’s hydrogen solutions could find fertile ground for adoption and deployment.

Bear Case

How might the CEO transition impact Plug Power’s growth strategy?

The upcoming CEO transition from Andy Marsh to Jose Luis Crespo in March 2026 introduces an element of uncertainty to Plug Power’s growth strategy. While Crespo brings extensive experience with the company, any leadership change carries inherent risks. There may be a period of adjustment as the new CEO implements his vision, potentially leading to short-term disruptions in operations or strategic direction.

Moreover, the transition comes at a critical time when Plug Power is pivoting towards European markets and grappling with financial challenges. If the new leadership fails to execute this strategic shift effectively or struggles to address the company’s profitability issues, it could hinder Plug Power’s growth prospects and erode investor confidence.

What risks does Plug Power face in terms of liquidity and cash burn?

Plug Power’s high cash burn rate presents a significant risk to its financial stability. The company burned through $230 million in Q2 2025, an increase from previous quarters. This level of cash consumption raises concerns about Plug Power’s ability to fund its operations and growth initiatives without resorting to dilutive equity issuances or taking on expensive debt.

If the company fails to significantly reduce its cash burn or achieve profitability in the near term, it may face liquidity challenges. This could force Plug Power to seek additional financing on unfavorable terms, potentially diluting existing shareholders or increasing its debt burden. In a worst-case scenario, persistent liquidity issues could threaten the company’s long-term viability and ability to compete effectively in the rapidly evolving clean energy market.

Bull Case

How could Plug Power’s expansion into European markets drive growth?

Plug Power’s strategic pivot towards European markets presents a significant growth opportunity. Many European countries have ambitious decarbonization targets and supportive policies for clean energy technologies, creating a favorable environment for Plug Power’s hydrogen solutions.

By diversifying its geographical presence, Plug Power can tap into new customer bases and potentially secure large-scale projects. The company’s experience in the U.S. market could give it a competitive edge in Europe, allowing it to quickly establish a strong foothold. If Plug Power successfully executes its European expansion strategy, it could drive substantial revenue growth and reduce its dependence on the U.S. market, mitigating risks associated with policy uncertainties in a single region.

Longer lead times and rising costs are also delaying data center construction and grid expansion projects, underscoring the urgent need for increased domestic transformer manufacturing capacity to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.
One such company, Pennsylvania Transformer Technology (PTT) – which Quanta acquired in 2023 – is expanding its manufacturing footprint to bolster domestic transformer production.
PTT, a domestic manufacturer of a wide range of sizes and types of power transformers for electric utility and industrial applications, is investing heavily in facility expansions in both Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
In 2024, a year after the PTT acquisition, Quanta acquired Niagara Power Transformer Corp., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based manufacturer of power transformers.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to kickstart its new Speed to Power initiative, seeking stakeholder input on how to best leverage DOE funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity.

The timing of the initiative and the RFI is critical as the nation faces unprecedented load growth, driven by factors like data centers and electrification, and as DOE projects a staggering 260% increase in transformer capacity by 2050 to meet future demand.

“In the coming years, Americans will require more energy to power their homes and businesses, and with President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is ensuring we can meet this growing demand while fueling AI and data center development with affordable, reliable, and secure sources,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Sept. 18.

In the RFI, which has a Nov. 21 deadline, DOE requests that commenters identify potential projects and challenge areas with specificity and supporting data.

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we’re leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race,” said Wright.

The RFI underscores a growing national concern over the power grid’s capacity to handle explosive demand growth — with one of the largest bottlenecks being the critical shortage of transformers. Lead times have ballooned from months to as long as three years.

Driven by surging demand from electrification, data centers, and domestic manufacturing, the need for transformers has soared even as U.S. production capacity has lagged. The result is a heavy reliance on imports amid supply chain constraints.

Compounding the issue are shortages of essential materials such as grain-oriented electrical steel, copper, and aluminum, along with logistical challenges and a shortage of skilled workers in manufacturing and the electrical trades.

“This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand,” Ben Boucher, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told Reuters in August, noting that utilities have been stockpiling transformers to ensure they have adequate supply.

Longer lead times and rising costs are also delaying data center construction and grid expansion projects, underscoring the urgent need for increased domestic transformer manufacturing capacity to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.

The private sector is taking action, with new players investing to meet critical grid needs. As an example, Quanta Services Inc., the leading specialty contractor for the energy industry, has made several strategic acquisitions of key manufacturers of essential grid components, including transformers.

One such company, Pennsylvania Transformer Technology (PTT) – which Quanta acquired in 2023 – is expanding its manufacturing footprint to bolster domestic transformer production. PTT, a domestic manufacturer of a wide range of sizes and types of power transformers for electric utility and industrial applications, is investing heavily in facility expansions in both Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

Most recently, PTT announced a $102.5 million investment to expand its operations in Raeford, N.C., adding 300,000-square-feet across two new state-of-the-art facilities to increase manufacturing capacity of transformers to help reduce domestic supply chain bottlenecks and meet the high demand.

“This will not only enhance our production capacity, it will provide economic benefits to the community by creating additional well-paying, high-quality jobs and more broadly, contribute to the country’s economic growth,” said PTT President Sandeep Chakravarty.

In 2024, a year after the PTT acquisition, Quanta acquired Niagara Power Transformer Corp., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based manufacturer of power transformers. Quanta plans to invest in expansions and upgrades at Niagara’s 105,000-square-feet factory through 2030.

“We continue to see constraints on large transformers. The factory certainly helps us with that,” said Quanta CEO Duke Austin during last year’s third-quarter earnings call in which he mentioned the Niagara Power acquisition.

“Our backlog in the business has gotten longer, not shorter … The supply chain constraints are there. They’re real. We’re trying to do things in the lower 48 with the load that we see and so I think we’ll continue to see ourselves get in a good position to make sure that we can have self-performed capabilities both from a manufacturing standpoint, as well as to build and the craft skill labor on certain critical path items,” Austin added.

With federal initiatives like DOE’s Speed to Power and private-sector investments from companies such as Quanta Services, the path forward depends on aligning policy, production, and innovation to ensure the U.S. grid can meet the accelerating demands of the AI-powered, electrified economy.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2197288849-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:01:33.582062

General Motors (GM, Financial) introduces a $6,000 incentive program for electric vehicle leases, replacing the expired $7,500 federal tax credit.

GM's financial health shows consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins, but faces challenges with debt levels and insider selling.

Valuation metrics suggest GM is fairly valued, with a P/E ratio close to its 3-year high, indicating potential market caution.

General Motors (GM) has decided not to pursue the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit and will instead introduce its own $6,000 incentive program for electric vehicle leases through October. This change follows scrutiny over automakers like GM and Ford using IRS rules to continue offering credits despite the expiration of the government’s tax credit at the end of September. By purchasing vehicles through their finance arms, companies could previously claim tax credits indirectly. The move signals a shift in response to potential policy conflicts with green initiatives.

General Motors Co. emerged from the bankruptcy of General Motors Corp. (old GM) in July 2009. GM has eight brands and operates under three segments: GM North America, GM International, and GM Financial. The United States now has four brands instead of eight under old GM. The company regained its US market share leadership in 2022, after losing it to Toyota due to the chip shortage in 2021. 2024's share was 17.0%. The Cruise autonomous vehicle arm, which GM now owns outright, previously operated driverless geofenced AV robotaxi services in San Francisco and other cities, but after a 2023 accident, GM decided that it will focus on personal AVs. GM Financial became the company's captive finance arm in 2010 via the purchase of AmeriCredit.

With a market capitalization of $54.05 billion, GM operates within the Consumer Cyclical sector, specifically in the Vehicles & Parts industry. The company has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market landscape.

Financial Health Analysis

General Motors has shown robust financial performance with a revenue growth of 24.3% over the past three years. The company's operating margin stands at 5.68%, indicating an expansion that is generally a positive sign for profitability. However, the net margin is relatively low at 2.55%, suggesting room for improvement in cost management.

On the balance sheet front, GM's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.05, reflecting a significant level of leverage. The current ratio of 1.22 and quick ratio of 1.05 indicate adequate liquidity to meet short-term obligations. However, the Altman Z-Score of 1.24 places GM in the distress zone, highlighting potential financial vulnerability.

Insider activity raises some concerns, with 10 insider selling transactions and no insider buying over the past three months, totaling 2,074,824 shares sold. This could be perceived as a lack of confidence in the company's near-term prospects.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

GM's valuation metrics suggest it is fairly valued in the current market. The P/E ratio of 8.68 is close to its 3-year high, indicating that the stock might be priced at a premium relative to its earnings. The P/S ratio of 0.32 and P/B ratio of 0.82 are within historical ranges, suggesting a balanced valuation.

Analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $60.85 and a recommendation score of 2.3, indicating a moderate buy. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 41.54 suggest the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, while moving averages provide a mixed signal.

Institutional ownership is strong at 85.34%, reflecting confidence from large investors, although insider ownership is low at 0.39%.

Risk Assessment

GM's financial health grades highlight some areas of concern. The Altman Z-Score indicates potential distress, while the ROIC of 3.47% is below the company's WACC, suggesting inefficiencies in capital utilization.

Sector-specific risks include the cyclical nature of the automotive industry and potential regulatory changes impacting electric vehicle incentives. GM's beta of 1.64 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which could lead to significant price fluctuations.

Overall, while GM demonstrates strong revenue growth and expanding margins, challenges such as high leverage, insider selling, and potential financial distress warrant careful consideration for investors.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00006B5P.png?20,N,,2025-10-08 16:01:42.645095

“RCEA is very concerned with the reports that the Department of Energy has plans to terminate the TERAS project,” said Eileen Verbeck, Deputy Executive Director of RCEA.
The TERAS project leverages local renewable energy generation, battery storage, and advanced grid control systems to strengthen Tribes’ energy independence, providing power to critical health and public safety needs.
About the TERAS Project The Tribal Energy Resilience and Sovereignty (TERAS) Project is a multi-Tribe, multi-partner initiative to design, build, and operate a network of community microgrids in Northern California.
The project combines innovative and proven technologies to deliver clean and reliable power, strengthen Tribal sovereignty, and create a scalable model for energy resilience in rural and Indigenous communities across the country.","On October 2, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects nationwide. Among the rescinded awards is the Tribal Energy Resilience and Sovereignty (TERAS) Project, a regional initiative led by the Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe, Hoopa Valley Tribe, and Yurok Tribe, in partnership with the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (applicant), the Schatz Energy Research Center (project design and development lead), and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (local utility).

In January 2025, RCEA entered into a conditional award agreement with DOE’s Grid Resilience Innovations Program for $87.6 million to support TERAS. The funding was intended to build a network of Tribally owned and operated community microgrids designed to address persistent power reliability issues across Northern California’s rural and mountainous terrain. While DOE has not directly notified RCEA of a change in award status, the TERAS project appeared on a circulated list of terminated projects.

“RCEA is very concerned with the reports that the Department of Energy has plans to terminate the TERAS project,” said Eileen Verbeck, Deputy Executive Director of RCEA. “We remain hopeful that the federal government will continue to support this project, but in the event of termination, we will pursue alternative funding to ensure the successful completion of this critical work.”

The TERAS project is designed to support more than 140 miles of power lines on the Hoopa 1101 circuit, which experiences some of the most frequent and longest-duration power outages in the state. This electricity circuit serves communities along the Trinity and Klamath Rivers — including Hoopa, Weitchpec, and Orleans — which are home to essential government services for the Hoopa Valley, Yurok, and Karuk Tribes. Already, Tribal Nations pay 56% higher electricity prices than the U.S. average and experience 6.5 times more outages. Along the Hoopa 1101 circuit, families and Tribal facilities currently experience dozens of outages each year, which take their local water, critical communication, and health systems offline, increase the risks to elders during heat waves and freezing weather, interfere with classroom education and information access, and cause a significant loss in stored food and other supplies.

The TERAS project leverages local renewable energy generation, battery storage, and advanced grid control systems to strengthen Tribes’ energy independence, providing power to critical health and public safety needs. The Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe’s nationally recognized microgrid system would serve as the pilot site for new technologies, providing a model for other rural and Tribal communities facing similar challenges nationwide.

[DISCLOSURE: The Blue Lake Rancheria is a minority owner of the Outpost’s parent company, Lost Coast Communications, Inc.]

“We are deeply disappointed by this news, as the TERAS project represents years of technical design, multi-tiered partnership, and extensive regulatory and policy review,” said Linnea Jackson, General Manager of the Hoopa Valley Public Utilities District. “Most importantly, TERAS will provide critical energy resiliency in our remote region of Northern California, where reliable power is a daily necessity for health, safety, and community well-being. The Hoopa Valley Tribe remains strong and steadfast in pursuing other solutions and pathways to ensure this project moves forward and our people have the resilient energy systems they deserve.”

Despite the federal uncertainty, the TERAS team affirmed its unified commitment to advancing the project. Philanthropic and purpose-driven partners now have a unique opportunity to help advance a first-of-its-kind, scalable model for community-owned microgrids that can be replicated in other regions facing climate and infrastructure challenges.

The majority of that growth comes from the solar sector, underscoring the importance that the renewable energy sector plays in India’s long-term decarbonization goals as well as providing enough electricity to meet the rise in energy demands from its citizens. Several industry insiders have praised the accelerated adoption of the renewable energy sector in the region.

Solar power is leading the transition of India’s energy sector in the first half of this year

For a nation as industrious as India, innovation and an accelerated adoption process of technology are key. For many generations, India has lagged behind the rest of the world in reducing its vast emissions from the energy sector. India has extreme levels of poverty, and as such, the government is responsible for developing new and innovative solutions to the nation’s energy needs that do not make electricity more expensive.

According to state energy department data, India has seen a significant increase in renewable energy projects, adding much-needed electricity to the national grid. Among the biggest contributors during the first half of the year are:

Solar power – 22,806 MW

Wind energy – 14,235 MW

Large hydro – 1,990 MW

Small hydro – 113 MW

Biopower – 129.8 MW

The pace of the renewable energy buildout in the Indian state of Gujarat is astonishing

Several nations around the world have implemented significant measures aimed at curbing the reliance on the conventional energy sector in favor of the possibilities presented by the renewable energy sector.

Industry analysts have noted that the surge in production can be attributed to several factors, including but not limited to:

Favorable government policies – India’s government is incentivising the renewable energy sector with favorable policies aimed at increasing the output for the sector.

The commissioning of large-scale solar parks and hybrid projects – India has commissioned several massive projects, as well as a new hybrid solar/wind project that is the first of its kind.

Improvements in transmission infrastructure – Improving the existing infrastructure would allow faster grid integration.

Another factor to consider is the falling project costs and rising corporate demand for clean energy. The rapid surge in the renewable energy sector reinforces the Asian nation’s goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070.

The news of India adding several companies to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-II has been welcomed by industry insiders. An industry analyst has stated his thoughts on the nation’s surge in solar power capacity.

“Aggressive govt policy coupled with a favourable atmosphere has driven the growth in RE installations. Gujarat has also set a benchmark in rooftop solar installations for other states to follow. Moreover, Gujarat has showcased that RE is affordable and can easily be deployed on a large scale. This also reflects the acceptance of RE and even if govt doubles the target, that can be achieved.” – Jaideep Malaviya, solar energy consultant

India has made significant progress in accepting the renewable energy sector in recent years",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_714533934_L-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:49.627646

Strategic Implications for Energy Companies Texas remains the core of the U.S. energy economy, and TXSE’s approval creates a regulatory and financial platform potentially tailored to that sector.
Key Considerations: Legislative Support: Texas Senate Bill 1057 offers favorable governance treatment for companies listed on Texas exchanges—providing incentives even for non-Texas-based companies to list locally.
Existing Exchanges & Flexibility: NYSE launched “NYSE Texas” in Dallas.
Notably, NRG Energy recently dual-listed on “NYSE Texas,” signaling increased regional diversification in exchange strategy.","On September 30, 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally approved the Texas Stock Exchange (“TXSE”) to operate as a national securities exchange.[1] This marks a major milestone — the first fully integrated national exchange approval in many years — and sets the stage for TXSE to begin trading and listing activities in 2026.

For decades, U.S. equity markets have been dominated by two national exchanges: the NYSE and Nasdaq. The SEC’s approval of TXSE introduces a new contender, potentially increasing competition in trading, listings, and market structure.

One of TXSE’s core ambitions is to help reverse the long-term decline in U.S. public companies. In the 1990s, the U.S. had over 8,000 listed companies; today, that number has fallen to around 4,400. TXSE seeks to compete directly in listings, targeting mid- to large-cap companies. It has adopted a mandatory confidential pre-application review and has publicly noted that approximately 35% of currently listed U.S. public companies would not meet its listing criteria.

Strategic Implications for Energy Companies

Texas remains the core of the U.S. energy economy, and TXSE’s approval creates a regulatory and financial platform potentially tailored to that sector.

Key Considerations:

Legislative Support: Texas Senate Bill 1057 offers favorable governance treatment for companies listed on Texas exchanges—providing incentives even for non-Texas-based companies to list locally.

Lower Compliance Burden: While maintaining federal compliance, TXSE intends to streamline the listing process, potentially reducing ongoing costs compared to legacy exchanges.

Industry Alignment: Major TXSE shareholders include Kelcy Warren, executive chairman of Energy Transfer, who owns over 30% of the exchange’s parent company. Other major investors include BlackRock, Citadel Securities and Charles Schwab.

Existing Exchanges & Flexibility: NYSE launched “NYSE Texas” in Dallas. Nasdaq has also announced plans to open a regional headquarters in Dallas. Early indicators suggest energy companies—particularly midstream, E&P, and transition-focused firms—may consider dual-listing, migration, or spinout listings on TXSE. Notably, NRG Energy recently dual-listed on “NYSE Texas,” signaling increased regional diversification in exchange strategy.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit.
A Ford spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on whether the Dearborn automaker will reverse course on its tax credit plan.
Sources familiar with the matter said U.S. Sen. Moreno, R-Ohio, met with both GM and Ford and pressured the automakers to abandon the tax credit plan.
Without the tax credit, analysts and automakers predict a steep drop in sales, at least temporarily.","General Motors Co. no longer will apply for federal electric vehicle tax credits as part of a scheme to extend savings to customers after Congress and President Donald Trump axed the government incentive program in September, the Detroit automaker confirmed Wednesday.

The company will continue to offer about $6,000 in savings on EV leases through October, with the cost footed by GM. The federal tax credit offered savings up to $7,500.

“GM worked on an extended offer for the benefit of our customers and dealers,” according to a GM statement. “After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit. GM will fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October.”

GM and crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. used their finance arms to place down payments on EVs in inventory from dealerships at the end of September. That would enable the companies to apply for the federal tax credits before the program expired Sept. 30 and then extend the discounts to their customers through leases beyond the deadline. Reuters was first to report GM's reversal Wednesday.

A Ford spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on whether the Dearborn automaker will reverse course on its tax credit plan.

Sources familiar with the matter said U.S. Sen. Moreno, R-Ohio, met with both GM and Ford and pressured the automakers to abandon the tax credit plan.

The automakers’ plan was to pass along savings to lessees to avoid a sudden price uptick following the loss of the tax credit.

Most EVs cost thousands of dollars more than similar gas-powered models, a top reason why the electric market is lagging in the United States. Without the tax credit, analysts and automakers predict a steep drop in sales, at least temporarily.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month he wouldn't be surprised if U.S. EV sales are halved following the loss of the tax credit.

The idea behind Ford and GM’s programs was to help EV buyers transition away from discounted prices with the end of the government incentives.

While not as tariff-sensitive as solar, policy changes still shift wind’s relative cost-competitiveness.

Slower solar development may also hamper battery economics in the medium to longer term.","Kushal Patel, Gregory Gangelhoff, Tali Perelman and Amber Mahone are colleagues at Energy and Environmental Economics.

The U.S. electric system is embroiled in a phase of rapid change and great uncertainty. Demand growth is accelerating and sudden policy changes threaten project viability. The path forward will hinge less on predicting exact outcomes and more on preparing for a wide range of possibilities.

After years of relatively flat load growth at the national level, electricity demand is growing at the fastest rate in decades. E3’s modeling projects national growth of between 1.1% and 2.2% annually through 2035, driven by data centers, electric vehicles, heat pumps and manufacturing. These sectors continue to expand robustly, despite federal rollbacks on clean energy and advanced manufacturing incentives.

But just when new generation development is becoming indispensable for meeting rapidly increasing demand, the economics of building resources have been thrown into turmoil. Federal actions, most notably the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with recent tariffs, have reshaped costs and created unprecedented uncertainty around answering a seemingly simple question: “How much do new renewables, energy storage and natural gas generation cost?”

Restrictions associated with Foreign Entities of Concern, or FEOC, in the OBBBA also cast doubt on federal incentives in the near term, separate from the cost impacts above. Trade restrictions are especially affecting the economics of solar and wind. Reciprocal tariffs and Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties, or AD/CVD, have been finalized on imported solar equipment and are still in progress for storage, both aimed at addressing concerns about international pricing and supply chain dependence.

These shifting policies are already reshaping project timelines and market behavior, with developers responding in markedly different ways. In the near term, the rush to build before incentives expire is driving extreme price dispersion, even for identical technologies. Price dispersion reflects project realities: some projects are racing to lock in equipment and secure contracts before tariff step-ups or tax credit cliffs, while others are holding off, unsure how long the current conditions will last. In this environment, two wind or solar projects that look the same on paper can exit construction with very different cost profiles and pricing risks. Even projects already selected through requests for proposals are not immune, as unexpected cost pressures are leading developers to request offtaker contract protection upfront or via renegotiation.

Below are the results of E3’s updated resource cost forecasts incorporating recent federal and congressional action. The arrows represent how OBBBA and tariffs change costs for each technology relative to prior expectations. For instance, tax credit expirations and FEOC rules create added risk for solar and wind, while batteries face high but more predictable tariff exposure.

Solar: Exposed to trade policy more than any other resource, solar faces a wide range of cost impacts. Capital costs could increase by 30% to over 300%, depending on AD/CVD tariffs. Corresponding levelized costs could rise by 44% to 470%. Solar also faces reduced long-term certainty from OBBBA’s shorter tax credit timeline. If projects experience only reciprocal tariffs and minimum AD/CVD tariffs announced by the Commerce Department, E3 would expect levelized costs to increase by up to 114%. This is before incorporating FEOC dynamics, however, which E3 would expect to further increase costs all else being equal.

Wind: Wind is similarly affected by earlier expiration of production and investment tax credits, which introduces uncertainty around project economics in the 2030s. While not as tariff-sensitive as solar, policy changes still shift wind’s relative cost-competitiveness. Furthermore, increasing federal hostility to wind development, such as restricting development on federal land and revoking permits for projects already under construction, seem to pose greater risk to wind than solar.

Battery Storage: Tariff impacts are smaller in range but more certain, largely due to dependence on imported lithium-ion cells. Battery projects are less affected by OBBBA’s tax credit revisions, with eligibility extending through 2032. Under safe harbor provisions, which let developers preserve credit eligibility based on when construction begins, some projects could still qualify through 2036 before a credit phase-out period begins. Storage may be more susceptible to risk of FEOC non-compliance, however, given the dependence of the current supply chain on China. Slower solar development may also hamper battery economics in the medium to longer term.

Gas: Under the highest tariff assumptions, the competitiveness of new gas combined cycle plants is enhanced, most notably for projects requiring around-the-clock power. These dynamics could influence build decisions through 2029, with the greatest effect on projects still in early planning or pre-construction phases. The rapid increase in data center load also enlarges the market for CCGTs due to higher run times. Gas CTs may also maintain an advantage over battery storage for peaking applications, at least until battery supply chains can adapt to the new tariff regime.

For most resources, tariffs introduce greater potential cost pressures than OBBBA’s shortened tax credit windows. Critically, we must avoid over-indexing to recent policy and tariff actions or assuming a smooth return to Inflation Reduction Act incentives post-2028. America’s polarized political environment points strongly to continuous policy volatility, with frequent swings that can lead to sudden market accelerations, crunches, pauses, or complete reboots.

This table shows tariff impacts for key technologies as represented in E3’s RECOST model and market report for July 2025. Tariff inputs shown here should be interpreted as reasonable points on a wide spectrum of potential tariff rates that could apply to projects.

The net effect of these changes indicates a near-term rush to develop existing renewable projects seeking safe harbor from changing credits and tariffs. Meanwhile, accelerating load growth will continue to drive development of battery energy storage and new thermal generation projects.

This pattern is likely to generate a boom-and-bust cycle for developers of both renewable and conventional projects: rapid deployment while incentives last, potential pauses in expiration years as developers wait to see if extensions are authorized, and the risk of a lasting slowdown if federal tax benefits are not renewed.

This investment climate will also trigger changes to planning, procurement, permitting and development strategies:

Resource planning will need to encompass a wider range of load and price possibilities. Flexible plans will lead to better outcomes for ratepayers in an uncertain world.

Procurement strategies will tilt toward established and reputable developers, while preserving contractual and technological optionality through flexible contract structures, like power purchase agreements with reopener clauses or development options that allow adjustments if costs or policies change unexpectedly. We’re seeing greater reliance on quantitative triggers in contracts that set clear thresholds associated with trade policy changes or load forecast deviations that automatically prompt contract or planning updates. This makes contract and policy monitoring more structured and less ad-hoc.

Development sites are likely to be planned with surplus interconnection capacity, phased build schedules, and adjacent parcels to create modularity, leaving open the option for storage add-ons, fuel switching, or clean-firm upgrades as needs arise and as technology costs change.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/2QBGmziF_434PL5cgL24hW1NhbW8glyYxi5YW7pwASg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9PQkJCQV9zaWduaW5nLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-08 16:02:13.187629

Lacy McManus, FUEL’s director of Workforce Development, told members of the Louisiana Clean Hydrogen Task Force on Tuesday that the program is focused on scaling proven initiatives that prepare students and workers for clean energy careers.

“I made the strategic decision to take the resources at my disposal and really look to scale what was already working in Louisiana,” McManus said, noting that about $1 million in grant funding has already been distributed across 14 workforce projects statewide.

Six months into those projects, McManus said interim reports show “tangible results” in education and training.

“We were thrilled to see the K-12 students we were able to reach over the summer through intensive programming, the graduate and higher ed students we engaged, and the many K-12 teachers we were able to influence as well,” McManus said.

The goal, she added, is to expose more young people and educators to opportunities within Louisiana’s evolving energy ecosystem – a key step toward retaining local talent as the state’s energy industry diversifies.

“This was just the tip of the iceberg that we were able to achieve in the last year,” McManus said.

Looking ahead, McManus said FUEL expects to announce another $45 million in National Science Foundation funding over the next three years, covering the next phase of the grant.

“Our mission for the next phase is to ensure we’re preparing an innovative energy workforce from all Louisiana communities to participate, benefit and contribute to our energy ecosystem,” McManus said.

The upcoming phase — covering years three through five of the NSF grant — will focus on three core areas, beginning with education and training partnerships across all levels, from K-12 to higher education and technical programs.

The FUEL initiative, led by Louisiana State University and supported by more than 50 public and private partners, is one of several federally funded “regional innovation engines” across the country. It is designed to accelerate energy research, commercialization, and workforce development while supporting local economies.

As part of that broader effort, Louisiana Economic Development previously committed $67.5 million in matching funds to the NSF’s grant – one of the state’s largest single investments in energy innovation.

“LED’s support through matching funds for the FUEL partnership is a strategic investment in Louisiana’s economic future,” said Josh Fleig, the agency’s chief innovation officer. “Energy has long been the backbone of Louisiana’s economy, and by investing in technologies and research that keep us on the leading edge, we’re ensuring our state remains a global industry leader for generations to come.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/22/9220c79c-b079-4183-beb7-b2fe2eeaff91/68de8c3e677b9.image.jpg?crop=1080%2C567%2C0%2C19,N,,2025-10-08 20:03:54.099821

“The Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” DOE press secretary Ben Dietderich said in an email to Canary Media.

1PointFive didn’t immediately return Canary’s request for comment on the purported DOE funding cuts.
China, for example, has announced plans to build 37 domestic ​“carbon management and removal” projects by 2030, according to the Carbon Removal Alliance.","America’s fledgling carbon-removal industry is on edge following funding cuts from the Trump administration — and rumors of even further clawbacks to follow.

On Tuesday, a list of potential U.S. Department of Energy award terminations shared with Canary Media, and which circulated in Washington, included two giant direct air capture (DAC) hubs planned in Louisiana and Texas. Each project has received about $50 million to begin planning and developing CO2-sucking facilities, and together they are slated to receive up to $1.1 billion in federal support.

However, a spokesperson for DOE said that it is ​“incorrect to suggest those two projects have been terminated” and that no determinations have been made beyond the award cancellations announced last week. On Oct. 2, the agency said it was scrapping 321 grants totaling over $7.5 billion — including nearly $50 million to help 10 smaller DAC initiatives begin concept and engineering studies for future installations.

“The Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” DOE press secretary Ben Dietderich said in an email to Canary Media. Following last week’s cancellations, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said more cuts would be announced, though he did not specify further.

The real and rumored grant terminations reflect the chaos and confusion that’s engulfed virtually every federally backed energy project since the start of the second Trump administration. Even developers whose awards haven’t been slashed — at least not yet — must try to navigate the lengthy and complicated funding process with an agency wracked by layoffs.

For carbon removal in particular, ​“a lot of these projects have kind of been in limbo this year, not sure of if they should commence and continue their work,” said Courtni Holness, the managing policy adviser for the nonprofit Carbon180. ​“There’s a lot of uncertainty around if they’re going to get continued funding, if they’ll be able to be reimbursed.”

While cutting greenhouse gas emissions is the most urgent and necessary way to tackle climate change, the world will also need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere in order to avert the worst consequences of a warming planet, climate scientists say. However, most carbon-removal solutions are early-stage, expensive, and largely unproven at any meaningful scale, making government support critical to their success.

The Biden administration launched the Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program in 2023 with $3.5 billion in funding provided by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The DAC initiative was part of a broader push by the DOE to help the private sector deploy novel technologies at commercial scale.

Funding for the Louisiana and Texas megaprojects ​“represented the largest ever public investment in carbon removal,” said Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180. If completed as planned, the hubs are each expected to create thousands of jobs in the regions where they’ll operate.

The South Texas DAC Hub is an initiative of the Occidental Petroleum subsidiary 1PointFive. The project is located just south of Corpus Christi and is expected to be capable of removing over 1 million metric tons of CO2 per year — roughly equal to the annual emissions from 2.5 gas-fired power plants. The project will use technology developed by Carbon Engineering, a company that 1PointFive acquired for $1.1 billion in November 2023.

DAC plants can use giant industrial fans to draw in large amounts of air, then separate out the carbon using chemical solutions or filtered materials. The captured CO2 can be injected into deep geological formations, or it can be repurposed to make valuable industrial products, such as concrete and synthetic fuels.

1PointFive didn’t immediately return Canary’s request for comment on the purported DOE funding cuts.

The company is separately building another DAC facility in the Texas Permian Basin that is designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually and could begin operating later this year. That project, called Stratos, will likely use captured carbon for ​“enhanced oil recovery,” a process that involves pumping the gas into older oil wells to force up any remaining fossil fuels.

Although Stratos didn’t receive a DOE grant, the operation will still likely benefit from the federal 45Q tax credit, which was expanded under the GOP-led budget law that passed in July — mainly for the benefit of carbon-capturing projects linked to oil production.

Meanwhile, in Louisiana, a coalition of companies is building a DAC hub called Project Cypress. Climeworks and Heirloom, two leading carbon-removal developers, are partnering with the applied-sciences organization Battelle to design and operate two facilities, which together are intended to capture over 1 million metric tons of carbon per year. The company Gulf Coast Sequestration will then take the captured CO2 and permanently store it in a deep saline aquifer.

Climeworks, a Swiss company, will use its fan-driven technology, a version of which is already operating in Iceland. The U.S. startup Heirloom will build a separate plant for its own DAC process, which involves heating trays of limestone inside kilns to turn the mineral into a ​“sponge” that absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere.

Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global policy, said on Tuesday that the company wasn’t ​“aware of a decision from DOE” to cancel its federal award and that the companies continue ​“to productively engage with the administration in a project review.”

Both the South Texas and Louisiana DAC hubs still face significant hurdles to crossing the finish line — including sourcing massive amounts of clean electricity to run their machines — even if they ultimately receive federal funding as promised. 1PointFive, for example, has run into local opposition, in part because of its association with the fossil fuel industry. Community advocates in both states have said they felt shut out of early planning processes that should have included them.

For DAC proponents, rescinding federal awards means the U.S. could risk losing out on the potential jobs and investment these first-of-a-kind projects are expected to create, especially as other countries press ahead. China, for example, has announced plans to build 37 domestic ​“carbon management and removal” projects by 2030, according to the Carbon Removal Alliance.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Climeworks-Mammoth-plant_2025-10-08-172604_gwam.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=3969166eeeb0fc1b88a6ad3bf70cf1ff,N,,2025-10-08 14:04:10.766957

But when the rubber meets the road, electric utilities are still turning to carbon-free energy sources.

In an annual Request for Proposals (RFP) issued this week, Dominion Energy Virginia (DEV) and Dominion Energy North Carolina (DENC) are exclusively seeking bids for power purchase agreements (PPAs) with new solar, onshore wind, and energy storage projects in Virginia and North Carolina. Dominion says the PPAs will support its customers’ future energy needs, as outlined in the company’s most recent Integrated Resource Plan. The projects associated with the PPAs will also support local jobs, increase spending in local communities, and bring in new tax revenue for local governments.

Dominion is interested in proposals for five categories:

New photovoltaic (“PV”) solar: Utility-scale (>3 MW) and distributed projects (<3 MW)

New PV solar generation co-located with energy storage

New onshore wind

New onshore wind co-located with energy storage

New stand-alone energy storage

The company will consider facilities located in Virginia and North Carolina. For distributed projects smaller than 3 megawatts (MW), the facilities must be located within the DEV or DENC service territories, where there are location grid benefits to Dominion Energy customers. Dominion encourages the submission of PPAs from solar, onshore wind, and energy storage projects on previously developed sites, such as former landfills or industrial uses.

All participating bidders must register by submitting an Intent to Bid Form and an executed confidentiality agreement (CA) by January 20, 2026. The Intent to Bid Form, CA, and other additional information on this RFP can be found near the bottom of the page linked here. The deadline for submitting proposals is February 9, 2026.

Why Renewables Still Make Sense

Love ’em or hate ’em, renewables comprise the bulk of new power generation coming onto the grid in the United States, accounting for about 90% of additions thus far in 2025 and roughly the same throughout all of last year.

Interconnection queues packed with clean energy projects can be explained to some degree by widespread federal support over most of the last decade, in addition to the more than two dozen states and territories actively adhering to emissions reduction legislation to the benefit of more than half the U.S. population.

The bottom line, however, is that solar, wind, and storage are the most cost-effective and fastest-to-market generation solutions available. Why wait for a gas turbine when a solar+storage site can be brought online in half the time? Even without tax incentives, most stakeholders recognize that renewables will play a sizable role in addressing unprecedented load growth spurred by data centers.

More Utilities Procuring Clean Power

Dominion Energy is far from the only utility seeking to add clean power to its system. Last month, fellow southern U.S. service provider Georgia Power got the green light from the Georgia Public Service Commission for five new PPAs, adding more than 1,000 MW of large-scale solar capacity across the state. The projects were selected through the company’s 2023 Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) request for proposals, part of the utility’s 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP). Each facility will be built and operated by third-party developers under long-term PPAs.

The utility also received approval to procure 500 MW of energy storage, to be online no later than the end of 2031. That RFP, administered by independent evaluator Ascend Analytics on behalf of Georgia Power, solicits standalone storage with grid-charging capability and energy storage with new or existing renewable resources and grid-charging capability.

Xcel Energy subsidiary Southwest Public Service Company (SPS) announced new generation resource additions in July as part of an overall portfolio to meet the “rapidly rising” energy needs of its Texas and New Mexico service areas.

Even in an area rich in gas infrastructure, a significant portion of the utility’s 2024 request for proposals consists of bids for solar and wind projects. The selected portfolio included extensions of 521 MW of existing generation and 17 new power projects that will add 5,168 MW of new nameplate capacity and 3,121 MW of accredited capacity to the SPS system by 2030.

Associated Press

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/04/AP25107485680530.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 14:04:29.308236

Experts say that despite rising costs, there are steps consumers can take to make energy bills more manageable.
Switching providers could shave 10% to 20% off monthly utility bills, said Owen Quinlan, Arbor's head of data.
TURN is lobbying for utilities in the state to have spending caps tied to inflation, among other initiatives aimed at lowering consumer electricity bills.
""Legislators are paying attention, and a lot of them are reporting that the number one issue their constituents call them about is their rising utility bills,"" she said.","If you're a utility customer in the US, you've likely seen your rates go up this year.

Residents in at least 41 states and Washington, D.C., are experiencing increased electric and natural gas bills now or will see increases in 2026, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress.

Costs are rising largely due to the AI data center development boom and the resulting strain it has placed on the country's aging electric grid.

The good news is that, depending on which state you live in and your electricity provider, you might be able to lower your bill through energy conservation. The bad news is that simple steps such as unplugging devices and turning off the lights when exiting a room are ultimately no match for the pace of rising rates.

Data centers accounted for 4.4% of electricity consumption in the US in 2023, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That amount is expected to triple by 2028.

Utilities across the country are predicting an additional 60 gigawatts of new demand from data centers by the end of the decade. That's enough electricity to power six major cities.

Major utilities are planning multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects to meet the enormous demand expected to come from AI. Existing regulations will allow much of those costs to be recovered from a utility's entire customer base.

In August, regulators in Louisiana approved Entergy's plans to spend $5 billion on three new natural gas plants needed to serve a massive Meta data center in the state. Consumer advocacy groups opposed the plan, arguing that average ratepayers would ultimately bear the cost for one of the world's largest companies. Similar battles are unfolding before utility regulators in states across the country.

""It's really creating tremendous stress for a huge segment of the population that struggles to pay those bills,"" said David Conn, head of business development and policy at Exceleron, an energy management software company.

Energy and cost-saving tactics

If you've ever reviewed your energy bill, you may have noticed that many line items factor into a monthly total. While the amount of energy you use is supposed to be the largest part of the bill, utilities often tack on charges and service fees that don't have anything to do with individual consumption. Data centers are driving up the price of those additional charges, as well as the cost of electricity, making the energy you do consume more costly.

The bottom line: If you're a customer of a utility that also serves data centers, your bill is probably going to rise no matter how much energy you use.

""It's one of those things where consumers are fighting against an 800-pound gorilla, and that's a challenge,"" said Larry Paulhus, head of electric consulting at RINA North America.

Experts say that despite rising costs, there are steps consumers can take to make energy bills more manageable.

Arbor is part of an emerging class of new startups aiming to help.

Utility customers who live in one of the 14 states with a deregulated energy market can use Arbor's free app to find a different energy provider. Switching providers could shave 10% to 20% off monthly utility bills, said Owen Quinlan, Arbor's head of data.

Exceleron is another one. The company offers prepay programs for 75 utilities, including major providers like Georgia Power and Salt River Project in Arizona.

Prepay programs allow utility customers to pay their bills in advance, making them eligible for refunds later on if they consume less energy than they originally paid for. With Exceleron's software, customers can track how their daily energy consumption affects their bills, and adjust habits accordingly to lower the amount of their monthly bill.

It is difficult to know exactly how much money programs like these can save customers. There are many line items on an electric bill — such as costs for new transmission lines — that are out of an individual customer's control.

Reducing a home's energy consumption by 10% likely won't equate to a 10% lower bill, said Exceleron's Conn.

""It's probably going to be less than that, but every little bit helps,"" he said.

Natural gas prices are also on the rise right now, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Curbing reliance on gas fuel can help lower energy bills in the long term, said Cooper Marcus, founder of QuitCarbon, who advises homeowners on energy management.

Replacing a gas boiler with an electric heat pump and installing solar panels on a home's roof can lead to significant long-term savings.

""These are not things that people do at once overnight, but that's okay,"" said Marcus. ""Homes last for decades. Our investment horizons should be decades.""

For people struggling to manage higher rates now, long-term solutions don't offer much relief.

""It's really understandable that people want some control over their expenses, and there are things that people can do to bring down those bills. It's just not realistic for so many people,"" said Sylvie Ashford, an analyst at The Utility Reform Network.

Ashford noted that in California, where TURN is based, 40% of the population are renters who can't install solar panels to reduce costs.

TURN is lobbying for utilities in the state to have spending caps tied to inflation, among other initiatives aimed at lowering consumer electricity bills.

""We try very hard not to make what we're doing political,"" Scaringe said on the ""Decoder"" podcast.

Donald Trump's administration has rolled back EV subsidies and signed a resolution to block a new gas-powered car sales ban.

Should a vehicle be associated with a certain political party? Rivian's CEO doesn't think so.

Electric vehicles have been caught in the crosshairs of Donald Trump's administration. The Trump administration removed the electric vehicle tax credit and signed a resolution to block California's plan to phase out new gas-powered car sales. Several automakers rolled back their EV plans, and analysts expect an industry-wide slowdown.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe wants to ""depoliticize electric vehicles,"" he said on the ""Decoder"" podcast on Monday. Scaringe said that EVs had ""become political.""

""They shouldn't be,"" he said.

Scaringe said Rivian employs almost 16,000 people domestically and has one of the ""strongest technology teams, I think, in the United States.""

""We spend a lot of time with the administration on that, and there's a lot of support and enthusiasm for what we're creating and building in that regard,"" he said.

The national emphasis on domestic manufacturing and reshoring the auto industry has bolstered gas-powered vehicles. In June, General Motors announced a $4 billion investment into US manufacturing plants, which included producing gas-powered vehicles to ""meet continued strong demand.""

Compare that to just a few years ago, when several large automotive companies were pledging to phase out the combustion engine.

In August, Scaringe said that he saw a ""reprioritization of capital towards internal combustion,"" one that was ""very bad for my kids and their kids, and very bad for the US auto industry.""

While Trump's policies are evenly applied to the EV industry, he has publicly supported a select few companies. For much of his presidency, Trump has lauded Tesla — one of Rivian's competitors — and even purchased one of the company's EVs.

On the podcast, Scaringe referenced a classic Michael Jordan quote from his partnership with Nike: ""Republicans buy sneakers, too.""

""We have a lot of Republicans who buy our vehicles and love them,"" Scaringe said. ""We have a lot of Democrats who buy our vehicles and love them. We have people who are in the middle, and we have Independents.""

But the opportunities can be easy to miss, and often require navigating a maze of requirements, said Bettina Bergoo, director of affordability and competition at the Virginia Department of Energy.

The department recently launched an online platform, called Energy Connect, which aims to make incentives more accessible, including tax credits, loans and direct assistance.

""It's Virginia's one-stop shop for information about energy savings programs,"" Bergoo said.

The goal is to help people lower their monthly electricity bills while also reducing stress on the regional power grid.

Power demand is expected to surge in Virginia over the next several decades, largely because of data centers that use huge amounts of electricity.

That demand is driving higher prices. Dominion Energy, for example, has proposed a series of rate hikes that would soon add about $21 to the average customer's bill.

Bergoo said the state especially wants to target households with a high energy burden, meaning they spend a disproportionate amount of their income, at least 6%, on energy costs.

Energy Connect is designed to serve homeowners, renters, businesses, multi-family property owners and residential contractors.

People can visit the interactive platform online and type in information such as location and income. The website then matches users with a list of incentives for which they could qualify.

Those include buying into clean energy solutions, such as electric vehicles, solar panels and battery storage.

Other programs promote energy efficiency, using better home insulation, appliances and HVAC systems to reduce overall power usage.

Many of the listed incentives will expire by the end of this year or next, following the Trump administration's rollback of programs associated with clean energy.

But some federal options will still be available, as well as others through electric utilities and state and local governments, Bergoo said.

For example, Virginia's annual sales tax holiday allows consumers to purchase certain Energy Star and Water Sense products tax-free, such as energy-efficient heat pumps, thermostats and showerheads.

Several programs, including Dominion's EnergyShare, also offer weatherization assistance at no cost to lower-income customers.

Bergoo said the state hopes to expand its new initiative to provide more information to contractors, including plumbers, HVAC technicians and installers of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

""As more Virginians are taking advantage of these programs, that means more demand for contractors,"" she said. ""We want to ensure that they have not only the information about the programs, but also support in growing their businesses and getting the right training to grow the energy workforce.""

For people that prefer in-person help or lack reliable internet access, Virginia Energy plans to train a group of community members called ""energy ambassadors,"" who will begin local outreach later this year.

(Reuters) - is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering a $7,500 tax credit for several months on electric-vehicle leases following the September 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said on Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, declining to elaborate on the reason for its decision.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It is unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

GM had planned to claim the credit on roughly 20,000 EVs that were on dealership lots or being shipped to stores, people familiar with the matter said. Its finance arm, GM Financial, began making down payments on those vehicles before the deadline to qualify for the subsidy on each of those cars, the sources said.

In its statement on Wednesday, the company said it would ""fund the incentive lease terms"" through the end of October.

The formula for determining the down payments that GM Financial paid to dealers on those EVs was 5% of the maximum price for each car. For example, GM Financial would have made a down payment of about $6,300 for two Chevrolet Blazer EVs, which top out in the mid-$60,000s, according to documents GM provided to dealers outlining the terms.

GM scrambled to put together the program just a few days before the September 30 tax-credit expiration, and outlined the details on a call with dealers on September 29, three sources said. GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.

Emerging Trends

Government Initiatives Drive Growth in Solar Charge Controller Market

India’s commitment to expanding its renewable energy capacity has significantly impacted the solar charge controller market. The government’s proactive policies and initiatives have created a conducive environment for the growth of solar energy systems, thereby increasing the demand for efficient charge controllers.

In the fiscal year 2024–25, India added a record 21 GW of solar power capacity, contributing to a total of 25 GW of renewable energy installations. This surge was driven by various government schemes aimed at promoting solar energy adoption.

For instance, the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana (PMSG) was launched with an investment of over ₹75,000 crore to provide solar power to about 1 crore households, offering 300 units of free electricity every month. This initiative is expected to significantly increase the number of residential solar installations, thereby driving the demand for solar charge controllers.

Additionally, the Maharashtra government introduced the SMART Solar Scheme, providing additional subsidies for rooftop solar installations, particularly targeting Below Poverty Line (BPL) and economically weaker sections. This scheme is expected to benefit 5 lakh consumers, further accelerating the adoption of solar energy systems and, consequently, the need for efficient charge controllers.

Drivers

Government Initiatives Propel Growth in India’s Rooftop Solar Sector

In 2024, India witnessed a significant surge in rooftop solar installations, with 4.59 GW of new capacity added, marking a 53% increase compared to the previous year. This growth was largely driven by the government’s proactive initiatives aimed at promoting clean energy solutions across the country.

A notable policy in this regard is the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched in 2024. This scheme has been instrumental in facilitating the adoption of rooftop solar systems among households, especially in rural and underserved areas. By providing financial incentives and simplifying the installation process, the program has enabled nearly 900,000 households to embrace solar energy, thereby contributing to the overall increase in rooftop solar capacity.

Additionally, state-level initiatives have further bolstered this growth. For instance, the Maharashtra government’s SMART Solar Scheme offers additional subsidies for residential consumers using below 100 units of electricity per month, targeting economically weaker sections and Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. This localized approach ensures that the benefits of solar energy reach a broader segment of the population, promoting inclusivity in the transition to renewable energy.

These government-led initiatives not only facilitate the adoption of rooftop solar systems but also contribute to the overall growth and sustainability of the renewable energy sector in India. By addressing financial barriers and providing necessary support, these programs play a crucial role in empowering households to harness solar energy, thereby reducing dependence on conventional power sources and promoting environmental sustainability.

Restraints

High Initial Capital Costs Impede Widespread Adoption of Solar Charge Controllers

One of the primary challenges hindering the widespread adoption of solar charge controllers in India is the high initial capital cost associated with advanced technologies, particularly Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controllers. These controllers, while offering superior efficiency and performance, come at a significantly higher price point compared to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controllers. For instance, a 1 kW MPPT system can cost up to ₹50,000, whereas a comparable PWM system may be available for approximately ₹30,000. This price disparity poses a substantial barrier, especially for low-income households and small-scale farmers who are the primary beneficiaries of government solar initiatives.

The financial constraints faced by these groups are further exacerbated by limited access to affordable financing options. While government schemes like the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana and the SMART Solar Scheme aim to provide subsidies, the upfront costs remain a significant hurdle. For example, under the SMART Solar Scheme, a Below Poverty Line (BPL) household is required to contribute ₹2,500 for a 1 kW system, despite the state covering the majority of the cost. Such contributions, though minimal, can still be burdensome for economically disadvantaged individuals.

Moreover, the integration of solar charge controllers with other solar components, such as inverters and batteries, increases the overall system cost. The total expenditure for a complete solar setup can range from ₹1.5 lakh to ₹2 lakh, depending on the capacity and quality of the components. This cumulative cost deters many potential users from adopting solar solutions, thereby slowing the growth of the solar charge controller market.

Opportunity

A Promising Growth Opportunity for Solar Charge Controllers

Agrivoltaics, the integration of solar photovoltaic systems with agricultural activities, presents a significant growth opportunity for solar charge controllers in India. A recent study estimates the potential for agrivoltaics in India at 3,200 GWp, with states like Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan leading the way.

This vast potential is driven by several factors. Firstly, agrivoltaics allows for dual land use, enabling farmers to generate income from both crops and solar energy. Secondly, it provides a sustainable solution to the increasing energy demands of the agricultural sector, which currently accounts for a significant portion of India’s electricity consumption. For instance, Andhra Pradesh’s agriculture sector alone accounts for nearly 18,000 million units of power annually, creating a ₹10,500 crore subsidy liability for distribution companies.

The implementation of agrivoltaics requires efficient solar charge controllers to manage the energy produced and ensure optimal performance. These controllers regulate the charging of batteries and inverters, preventing overcharging and enhancing the lifespan of the system. As the adoption of agrivoltaics increases, the demand for advanced solar charge controllers is expected to rise correspondingly.

Government initiatives further bolster this growth opportunity. Policies such as the PM KUSUM (Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) scheme aim to promote the integration of solar energy in the agricultural sector. Under this scheme, farmers are encouraged to install solar pumps and grid-connected solar power plants, thereby reducing their dependence on conventional energy sources and enhancing their income.

Originally granted awards under former president Biden’s administration, the two projects in question are the South Texas DAC Hub by Occidental Petroleum’s subsidiary 1PointFive, and Project Cypress in Louisiana, a joint initiative between Battelle, Climeworks, and Heirloom.

A list published last week by Latitude showed the 321 financial awards that were cancelled as per DOE’s announcement released on Oct 2, 2025.

At that time, Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub were not among the initiatives affected by the terminated awards.

This week, however, a new list emerged that seems to indicate the federal funding for these two projects might be cut as well.

«It’s the best and worst time for carbon removal,» Julio Friedmann, Carbon Direct

The new DOE-issued list, obtained by MIT Technology Review, reportedly contains the names of the two projects and a column titled “latest status,” where the entry states “terminate” for the ~$50 million awards granted for each project.

The amount “to be terminated” matches the one approved as a first tranche of federal funding allocated to the projects, and it remains unclear whether a cancellation of this first portion means no further funding will be granted to Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub.

The original government support for these projects intended to provide each of the two DAC hubs with $500 million or more in total grants as they develop over time.

As climate solutions, the two DAC hubs would serve to pull atmospheric CO2 pollution as a complementary measure to the emissions reductions needed to meet global environmental targets on time and limit planetary warming to no more than 2°C.

Relevant: DOE Considering Funding Cuts For The Two Largest DAC Projects In The US

The hubs would do this through a large-scale deployment of direct air capture technology, praised as an effective tool for tackling atmospheric CO2, but also considered challenging due to its high operational costs and intense energy demand.

In this regard, the DOE funding would provide a solid financial backbone for the deployment of Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub, helping the country advance on climate goals and fortify its global leading position in climate innovations, while also unlocking economic growth and thousands of new employment opportunities.

If the funding for these two projects is indeed cancelled, the U.S. could miss out on these benefits, raising questions on the future of the carbon removal field in the country.

The reports of the new DOE list have prompted reactions across the carbon removal industry, with many stakeholders coming out with public commentary.

As highlighted in a publication by the Carbon Business Council, the decision to terminate the funding for Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub would translate into a risk exposure for more than 130,000 jobs in the United States, along with paused factories, lost leadership edge, and billions of dollars of missed opportunities.

In a joint statement, Giana Amador of the Carbon Removal Alliance and Ben Rubin of the Carbon Business Council and publisher of the Carbon Herald stated:

“The U.S. DAC Hubs program, with $3.5 billion appropriated by Congress, was set to support the largest carbon removal facilities in the world and were intended to further establish American leadership in the sector. If funding for the TA-3 Hubs is cut, the door will be open for other countries to take up leadership of the industry, and claim the job creation and economic benefits of carbon removal.”

As renewable energy sources like solar and wind continue to scale, their intermittent nature poses a serious challenge to achieving true 24/7 power availability. The solution lies in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) Market, which are redefining the way the world generates, stores, and consumes electricity. According to Fairfield Market Research, the Battery Energy Storage System Market has entered a transformative phase where innovation, government incentives, and grid modernization converge to make round-the-clock renewable power a reality.

The Role of Battery Energy Storage in Renewable Integration

Renewable energy, while clean and abundant, is inherently variable. Solar energy systems depends on daylight, while wind generation fluctuates with weather patterns. Without an effective energy storage mechanism, this inconsistency leads to grid instability and wasted potential. Battery energy storage bridges this gap by storing surplus power during periods of low demand and releasing it during peak hours.

Modern BESS solutions use lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and flow batteries to deliver grid-scale flexibility. This capability ensures that renewable energy can be dispatched on demand — not just when the sun shines or the wind blows. As a result, the integration of renewables into national grids becomes smoother, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and stabilizing power supply even during high-demand intervals.

Why 24/7 Renewable Power Matters?

The goal of 24/7 renewable energy is not just an environmental commitment — it’s an economic imperative. Businesses, industries, and governments are under pressure to meet net-zero emissions targets while maintaining cost efficiency and grid reliability. Achieving continuous renewable power allows for uninterrupted operations, minimizes outages, and reduces dependence on traditional energy sources that emit greenhouse gases.

Battery storage is key to this transformation. With robust storage systems in place, renewable energy can move from being a secondary power source to a primary one, capable of supplying energy whenever and wherever it’s needed. Countries like the U.S., Germany, and China are rapidly scaling up their storage infrastructure, setting global benchmarks for sustainable grid modernization.

How BESS Balances Supply and Demand in Real Time?

One of the most crucial advantages of the Battery Energy Storage System Market is its ability to balance electricity supply and demand dynamically. When renewable generation exceeds consumption, batteries absorb the excess power. Later, during peak demand or low generation periods, that stored power is released to the grid.

This flexibility minimizes energy curtailment and reduces dependency on gas-powered peaker plants. Moreover, advanced software and AI-driven control systems enable predictive energy management, ensuring that storage and dispatch cycles align perfectly with grid requirements. This balance is vital to supporting renewable energy penetration in both developed and developing regions.

Technological Advancements Driving the Battery Energy Storage Revolution

The performance and affordability of BESS have improved dramatically over the past decade. Technological innovations have focused on three key areas — battery chemistry, energy density, and system efficiency.

Lithium-ion batteries remain dominant due to their proven scalability and efficiency. However, emerging technologies like solid-state batteries and redox flow batteries are gaining traction, offering longer lifespans and enhanced safety. Meanwhile, improvements in energy management systems (EMS) and thermal regulation ensure that storage units operate optimally under varied environmental conditions.

Furthermore, the rise of second-life EV batteries — repurposed from electric vehicles — has opened new sustainability pathways. These repurposed cells provide affordable storage solutions, extending battery life cycles and reducing waste in the renewable ecosystem.

Grid Resilience and Decentralized Power Generation

Energy storage is not limited to utility-scale grids; it also empowers communities and industries to generate and store their own energy. This decentralization strengthens grid resilience and reduces the risk of widespread blackouts.

Microgrids and community-based storage projects are rapidly expanding across rural and remote regions. These localized systems ensure continuous access to power, even when main grids fail or natural disasters strike. In addition, smart grid infrastructure allows utilities to integrate multiple distributed energy resources (DERs), enabling a two-way power flow between producers and consumers.

In regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, Battery Energy Storage Systems are accelerating electrification efforts, providing reliable power for hospitals, schools, and small businesses.

Policy Support and Global Investments Accelerating Market Growth

The Battery Energy Storage System Market is thriving thanks to proactive government policies and strong investment momentum. Nations across the globe are introducing subsidies, tax credits, and renewable energy mandates to drive adoption.

In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act offers long-term investment tax credits for standalone energy storage projects. The European Union’s Green Deal and the United Kingdom’s Energy Security Strategy emphasize large-scale storage as a core enabler of decarbonization. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific economies — particularly China, India, and South Korea — are emerging as key manufacturing and deployment hubs for advanced storage technologies.

Private investors and energy giants are also accelerating deployment. According to Fairfield Market Research, investment in grid-scale battery storage projects has grown exponentially, as companies recognize the strategic importance of storage in achieving net-zero energy systems.

Applications Beyond the Grid: Industrial and Residential Adoption

Battery energy storage is no longer confined to large utility installations. Industries, commercial facilities, and households are increasingly installing energy storage systems to reduce energy costs, improve efficiency, and enhance energy independence.

Industrial users leverage storage for peak shaving, ensuring operations remain stable during demand surges. For residential consumers, home battery systems paired with rooftop solar panels are becoming mainstream, enabling self-consumption and backup power during outages.

As storage prices continue to fall, decentralized adoption will drive the next wave of growth, creating a multi-dimensional market ecosystem that spans households, commercial buildings, and public infrastructure.

Building a Sustainable Energy Future

The path to 24/7 renewable energy is clear — and Battery Energy Storage Systems are paving the way. With advancements in chemistry, intelligent control systems, and supportive regulatory frameworks, battery storage is no longer a futuristic concept but a commercial reality transforming the global energy landscape.

Consequently, solar generation hit new highs in the first half of the year, and fossil-gas generation has fallen rapidly in turn.

While the state hasn’t been building new gas generation, it has connected gigawatts of new solar and batteries each year.","California has labored for years to build enough clean energy to wean itself off fossil fuels. Now the effort is paying off in an undeniable way.

President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy might tweet that solar plants are ​“essentially worthless when it is dark outside.” But in California, batteries are proving the opposite, by shifting ever more solar into evening and nighttime hours. Consequently, solar generation hit new highs in the first half of the year, and fossil-gas generation has fallen rapidly in turn.

From January to July, as noted by Reuters, solar generation delivered 39% of the state’s generation, a record level, while fossil fuels provided just 26%, a new low since the dawn of modern gas power. In April, a temperate shoulder month, gas generated less than 20%. For context, across all of last year, solar provided 32% of California’s power — the highest rate of any U.S. state — nearly unseating gas as the largest source of power.

Initially, California’s billions of dollars in solar subsidies and suite of supporting policies couldn’t overcome the state’s gas dependency. The solar systems cranked out excess power through the sunny hours, much of which got curtailed for lack of simultaneous demand, then California turned to fossil fuels to keep the lights on at night. That addiction at times overpowered the state’s environmental ethos: California even opted in 2020 to waive enforcement of a regulation protecting marine life because it would have shuttered a number of coastal gas plants that the grid wasn’t ready to lose, despite having a decade to prepare for the rule.

Such desperation gave temporary succor to solar skeptics and gas boosters. But when an energy system starts to change, snapshots in time are less instructive than the trend lines. And California’s trend lines have been pointing in one direction.

While the state hasn’t been building new gas generation, it has connected gigawatts of new solar and batteries each year. These resources are nearly free to operate once built, while gas plant owners have to buy fuel to combust and keep complex machinery in fine working order. And the price of gas has been going up, amid greater demand both at home (due to data center expansion) and abroad (with liquefied exports going to the highest bidder). Now California’s gas plants have more competition in the peak hours from cheaper, cleaner resources; they’re getting squeezed toward fewer hours of intense demand.

But it would be a mistake to think that these trends stop at the Sierra Nevada. Indeed, these patterns are playing out nationally: Very little new gas capacity is getting built, quite a lot of solar and batteries are, and gas prices are going up.

Some regions allow developers to respond nimbly to these trends, namely Texas, which indeed has leapt ahead of California in its pace of solar and storage installations. Other regions obstruct such dynamism and face the consequences, like the mid-Atlantic wholesale markets run by PJM, where skyrocketing capacity auctions are pushing costs to crisis levels.

California’s grid overhaul has been a long time coming, and one lesson here is that big changes — like redesigning the energy system for the world’s fourth largest economy — take time. But other states won’t have to wait as long: They can tap into a mature supply chain that scaled up thanks to California and other early adopters, plus the industrial expertise to design and manage large solar construction efforts and the financing options de-risked by years of data from earlier projects.

The federal government is trying to stymie renewables however it can. But California is demonstrating the rewards for getting solar to escape velocity, and that momentum is set to carry forward in the coming years.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2198226759.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=64e71656c59b62552714da3c5b8d16d1,N,,2025-10-08 13:08:38.296661

Following the end of Jeep Cherokee production in 2023, the plant was idled and has remained in limbo since.
However, Stellantis announced plans to re-open this facility by 2027 earlier this year, with a focus on producing a mid-size EV pickup truck.
These projects are part of a broader set of federal subsidy awards that are on the chopping block, totaling over $12 billion.
Reporting from Reuters suggests that these cuts stem from deficit left by the continuing government shutdown.","The transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to battery-electric propulsion requires adaptation by all involved parties, surely, but there's arguably no stakeholder more affected than those who actually produce the vehicles. Retooling factories that produced internal combustion models for decades costs a pretty penny—and now, domestic automakers like General Motors and Stellantis may have to dip further into their savings after a series of previously promised federal grants to help with the transition might be canceled.

Reporters at Reuters have reportedly viewed documents from the U.S. Department of Energy that indicate the federal agency is considering canceling around $1.1 billion in retooling grants awarded to the two domestic automakers. Specifically, GM was set to receive $500 million to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly plant for EV manufacturing, while Stellantis was slated for $335 million to revived its shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant for EV pickup production and $250 million to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant into an EV parts factory.

GM's Lansing facility was previously home to production of the Chevrolet Camaro as well as decades of Cadillac sedan models; it continues to produce the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 lines, though the automotive conglomerate has expressed interest in expanding its production capabilities for years. GM even announced its plans to expand manufacturing plans to include EVs as a result of the grant award back in 2024, citing the importance of a resilient supply chain and the necessity of offering a wide array of vehicles to its customer base.

Stellantis's stake in this grant award is arguably more vital, as the $335 million subsidy would allow the automaker to re-open its idled Belvidere, Illinois, plant. The factory most recently produced models like the Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Dart, but has a pedigree dating back to the L-body Dodge Charger hatchback and the Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released Tuesday. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.

""A turning point"" for global fossil fuel power generation

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

""That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,"" said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

""The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,"" said Wiatros-Motyka. ""This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.""

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

China and India leading the green energy transition

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

""It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,"" said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. ""This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.""

U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase

In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown.

Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mr. Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Mr. Trump's efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

""The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they're also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That's going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,"" Gerrard said.

Renewables ""still have an opportunity to make inroads into displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,"" said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn't involved in the report.

Smith said that while she remained ""very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/21/07820a9f-33b5-4901-a722-f791770cd5eb/thumbnail/1200x630/2aa1457a05e15e73f7c672fc54dd1f34/gettyimages-2192581301.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:09:00.876939

Harvesting solar energy rather than ethanol leads to less pollution from fertilizer runoff and less erosion from tillage while providing a new drought resistant revenue stream.
Agrivoltaics, the term for agriculture plus photovoltaics (solar energy technology), is a practice that can create efficient dual-use purposes for farmland.","Yesterday was one of those days when you can feel the world shifting. The thinktank Ember reported that for the first half of 2025 renewable energy produced more electricity than coal. More to the point, solar and wind grew so fast that they covered all the growth in demand for electricity so far this year, with room to spare.

That means that fossil fuel emissions for producing electricity plateaued—even fell slightly—over the first half of the year. It’s an epochal moment: it demonstrates that the clean energy transition is not destined to be the slow, dragged-out affair that most analysts would have predicted even five years ago.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said one of the Ember researchers. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.” Fossil fuel use for electric generation fell 2 percent in China, and dipped in India as well.

We are allowed to celebrate good news—indeed, in the shadow of our disintegrating democracy it’s necessary that we celebrate what we can when we can. But not because this is a fait accompli—instead, because celebrations along the way give us new strength to push harder for faster change. Which we desperately need to do.

Because we we got new data about the earth this week too, and it’s epochal as well. And also bad. A study in Nature looked at four of the largest systems on earth—the Greenland ice sheet, the Atlantic currents, the South Asian monsoon, and the Amazon rainforest—and found that in each case “the stability of these four tipping elements has declined in recent decades, suggesting that they have moved towards their critical thresholds, which may be crossed within the range of unmitigated anthropogenic warming.”

Another way of saying this is: the damage from the carbon and methane trapping heat in our atmosphere has now reached the most critical systems for supporting life on our planet. We have very little time, if any.

And the other caveat to today’s good news is that it didn’t apply to the U.S.—growth in electric demand outpaced new renewable supply in this country, meaning that we poured more, not less, carbon into the air in the first half of the year. Which is hardly surprising, given the Trump administration’s all out war on clean energy. We are quickly emerging as the planet’s rogue nation, determined to deny climate and slow the energy transition as best we can, all in the name of selling more fossil fuel. As Mitchell Beer writes

“The forecast for the United States is revised down by almost 50%” from a year ago, the report states, after the Trump administration phased out federal renewable energy tax credits ahead of schedule, imposed severe import restrictions on renewables industries, suspended new offshore wind leasing, and curtailed wind and solar leasing on federal lands.

That sets up the third piece of epochal news, this one more about economics and hence politics. Though not many people paid too much attention, new data this week showed that China is now exporting more clean energy than the U.S. is exporting dirty energy.

The US, which has positioned itself as a major fossil fuel exporter, sold $80 billion in oil and gas abroad through July, the last month with data available. China exported $120 billion in green technology over the same period.

With that number, you can feel world leadership passing from Washington to Beijing. It’s even more remarkable because the thing that China is mostly exporting—solar panels—keeps getting cheaper and cheaper

Dollars only tell part of the story. The price of solar panels is falling, which means that China is exporting more of them per dollar earned. August’s solar export revenue was nowhere near the high set in March 2023. But the 46,000 megawatts of power capacity shipped abroad set a record.

As Edward White writes in the Financial Times,

While US President Donald Trump calls climate change a con, China is offering new technology and products to countries to develop green energy and to prepare for increasingly frequent and intense storms, floods and droughts.

Two days after our Changsha trip I attended a meeting in Beijing of Chinese officials and representatives of climate-vulnerable nations, a group that includes 74 nations with more than 1.8bn people.

Liz Thompson, a former UN assistant secretary-general and now climate change ambassador for Barbados, said just as climate-vulnerable states are hit by more disasters, they are hampered in their response because of a lack of access to technology and financing. “These challenges provide compelling reasons to work more closely with China,” she said.

Chinese officials and business leaders are keen to oblige. Zhang Shiguo, executive director of China New Energy International Alliance, an organisation backed by government associations and renewable companies, said the country’s green products had already reached 170 countries. “The reason China’s new energy sector has done well is the determination to act,” Zhang added.

The bewildering disgrace of America’s conduct in the world—a disgrace due entirely to the Trump administration, which continues to dismember the Biden-era efforts to compete with China in the clean energy field—is outweighed by the good news from the rest of the world: the atmosphere doesn’t care which nation the co2 comes from. But it should be one more spur—alongside the sickening pictures from Chicago—for all of us to do what we can to restore the rule of reason in our country. No Kings Day is October 18. Here’s a guide that we at Third Act have put together for finding the demonstration near you.

+Surprising no one who’s been paying attention, a big new study finds that carbon offsets have been an abysmal failure. As Ajit Naranjan chronicles

The failure of carbon offsets to cut planet-heating pollution is “not due to a few bad apples”, a review paper has found, but down to deep-seated systemic problems that incremental change will not solve.

Research over two decades has found “intractable” problems that have made carbon credits in most big programmes poor quality, according to the study. While the industry and diplomats have made efforts to improve the system, it found much-awaited rules agreed at a UN climate summit last year “did not substantially address the quality problem”.

“We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale,” said Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School and co-author of the study, in Annual Reviews. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed.”

Carbon offsets are a tool to cut emissions efficiently by crediting rich polluters for financing cheap climate action abroad while pumping out the same amount of planet-heating gas at home.

The greatest obstacle: American oil lobbyist and master strategist, Don Pearlman… Declared “gripping” (The Times), “extraordinarily funny” (Variety), and a “genuinely daring” (Evening Standard) “triumph” (Telegraph), KYOTO asks who gets to decide what’s worth saving when the entire planet is at risk—and what we’re willing to give up so we can move forward, together.

+I think Solar United Neighbors is one of the most remarkable groups in the country. They’ve concentrated on helping people build rooftop solar, but in the wake of Trump’s trashing of tax credits for that work, they’ve also been pushing for larger solar farms. They have a way of talking about renewables that makes sense to many people: here’s a bit of their recent work in Indiana, which will hopefully serve to counter the industry disinformation that has scotched many projects across the heartland

Creating energy isn’t a new endeavor on Indiana farmland. In 2024, 43% of Indiana’s corn went to ethanol production. But, in terms of land-use efficiency, solar beats ethanol in multiple metrics. Most importantly, solar is 20 times more efficient than ethanol, even when accounting for useful byproducts such as animal feed. Harvesting solar energy rather than ethanol leads to less pollution from fertilizer runoff and less erosion from tillage while providing a new drought resistant revenue stream.

The loss of farmland should be taken seriously, but the reality is that solar is not the driving force of farmland loss. Between 2013 and 2021, only 5% of lost Indiana farmland was converted to energy production (which includes new wind, natural gas, biomass, and solar production), while 68% of lost agricultural land was developed into homes and neighborhoods. And solar, unlike housing developments, can be returned to agricultural land at the end of its useful life.

Adding solar does not have to stop agricultural production on farmland. Agrivoltaics, the term for agriculture plus photovoltaics (solar energy technology), is a practice that can create efficient dual-use purposes for farmland. In Indiana, there are already a growing number of sheep herds, pollinator habitats, and crop studies under solar panels.

And on this question of land use, here’s Mark Jacobson of Stanford on video busting all the myths about renewables and land use. A good thing to forward to people worried about this

+The pundit Matthew Yglesias suggests that environmental groups working in elections back off questionnaires that try to pin politicians down, and instead elect Democrats broadly in alignment with progressive goals. It’s worth a read, even from someone who has routinely downplayed the seriousness of the climate crisis.

+China is quickly building a network of offshore wind turbines designed to withstand the typhoons that often strafe the coast

A good example is a model called OceanX manufactured by China’s Mingyang Smart Energy Group.

With a floating foundation, the OceanX model supports not just one but two turbines. The main reason behind the unique design is to increase the platform’s output. Compared to a single turbine whose blades swipe across the same area as OceanX’s two turbines combined, OceanX can generate 4.29% more electricity, according to Mingyang. This is because the two turbines’ blades spin side by side in opposite directions – one clockwise and the other anti-clockwise – so the wind between them will blow faster, enabling more electrical energy to be converted from air kinetic energy, the company says.

But the floating platform also has plenty of intriguing features to counter typhoons and stay balanced during extreme weather, says Wang Chao, the turbine’s chief designer. For example, its foundation is tied to the bottom of the ocean by ropes via one single point underneath it. This allows the structure to change its orientation more easily to be aligned with the wind. “As long as the turbines face the typhoon, the load (forces) they take will be the smallest and they will be the safest,” Wang says

+For years, the fossil fuel industry has used ‘stability’ as an argument against renewable energy on the grid. But as batteries have plummeted in cost, that’s actually become one of the biggest selling points: solar plus batteries, for instance, were credited with stabilizing the Texas grid this summer, even amidst high temperatures. What doesn’t help? Coal. The newest, biggest coal-fired power plant in the U.S., also in Texas, went offline after a catastrophic accident in April. It now appears it will be out of service until…April 2027. As Seth Feaster explains,

The outages at Sandy Creek are also reminiscent of the operating problems at another major new coal plant. Comanche 3, a 750-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado that came online in 2010 and is majority-owned by state-regulated utility Xcel Energy. From its opening, it had a history of unexpected and costly outages, capped by a year-long closure starting in January 2020 that was caused by a catastrophic loss of lubricating oil, extensively damaging the turbine and generator.

Facing a backlash from ratepayers and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, Xcel ultimately reached an agreement to close the plant in 2030, some 40 years earlier than its originally planned retirement. As part of that settlement, Xcel also agreed to gradually step down the use of the plant between 2025 and 2030.

This agreement may soon be challenged by the Trump administration, which is trying to keep coal plants across the country from closing —regardless of the cost to ratepayers and the reliability of the plants—under the guise of an energy emergency and 90-day orders to stay open from the U.S. Department of Energy.

+The always-interesting Hannah Ritchie has a report on a topic I knew nothing about: apparently, we could eliminate most of the heat-trapping contrails from passenger jets just by rerouting them for a minute or two to avoid the areas where the condensation is most likely to form.

One crucial reason why eliminating contrails could be so cost-effective is that a very small percentage of flights create the majority of the impact. This means we don’t need to divert or shift the trajectory of all the world’s flights; only a few percent of them.

Just 3% of flights generate 80% of the warming. A further 14% generate 29%.

Using detailed weather forecasts, satellite images, and flight plans, scientists can identify where these zones will be far in advance and work with flight planners to find a way to reroute flights crossing these zones to avoid them

+As veteran readers know, my real hope for the future of air travel is…blimps (in no small part because I rode in one once, and it was unbelievable fun). Anyway, a new French venture is getting close to putting out a cargo blimp

A subsidiary of the NYFI industrial group, Voliris has been making all sorts of innovative aircraft, airships in particular, for over two decades. Its latest concept is also the most complex: an air cargo shuttle with an enormous inflatable wing, engines, and an automated flight system. It’s called NATAC (Navette Aérienne de Transport Automatique de Containers/Automatic Air Shuttle for Containers) and it’s referred to as an aircraft, although it doesn’t look like one.

This concept is innovative in more ways than one; it’s foldable and inflatable, which makes it very easy to ship to different locations; it’s fully automated so that it can operate without human intervention; and it’s 100% hydrogen-compatible – for now, this means that the airship component can switch from helium to hydrogen as the carrier gas, but in the future, its engines could also use hydrogen as fuel.

Capacity-wise, this heavy-duty workhorse is designed to carry up to 30 tons of cargo. Thanks to its hybrid airship design, it can do so with four times less engine power than a conventional cargo aircraft and doesn’t need ballast when setting down its payload. The entire structure can be shipped via container to any location (ten standard 40-foot/12-meter containers are enough) and then inflated on-site.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T7af!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b3f31b2-6757-4aa2-884c-2ef4633d10fa_1200x1070.jpeg",N,,2025-10-08 17:05:32.974359

It's as if there was a race to see who could go all-in on EVs first, with companies like Volvo and Bentley pledging to abandon gas cars by 2030. Others, like Ford of Europe, promised it would only sell electric passenger cars by the end of the decade.

Other brands set targets for EVs to represent a large share of their annual sales. Porsche, for instance, hoped electric cars would account for more than 80 percent of total deliveries by 2030, while Audi projected it would discontinue ICE cars altogether by 2032.

Yet, many of these goals have since been delayed; some by a few years, while others have been indefinitely postponed. Notice the pattern?

Automakers jumped on the EV bandwagon, assuming demand would skyrocket. But while most announced plans to phase out combustion engines entirely, two major players bucked the trend: BMW and Toyota.

Neither BMW nor Toyota committed to aggressive EV-only strategies. Instead, the best-selling luxury brand and the world’s largest car manufacturer argued that EVs wouldn’t be suitable everywhere in such a short timeframe. Not only are electric cars generally more expensive than their gas counterparts, but the charging infrastructure is still underdeveloped in many parts of the world.

BMW has stayed true to its ""Power of Choice"" philosophy, offering customers what they want, whether it’s gasoline, diesel, plug-in hybrid, or electric. Come 2028, the company will even launch a hydrogen-powered vehicle based on the X5, featuring a fuel-cell setup co-developed with Toyota.

Then there's the legislation accelerating the demise of conventional drivetrains. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse has repeatedly voiced concern about the European Union’s planned 2035 ban on new gas-powered car sales. He argues the policy would severely limit consumer choice and devastate the automotive industry by forcing companies to cut tens of thousands of jobs:

'We don’t believe in technically one-sided regulations that limit supply. As a standalone technology, e-mobility leads down a dead-end street—that much is now clear. The differences are simply too great, even just within Europe. Europe needs a top-performing automotive and supplier industry. We are fighting for this and pushing back against negative developments.'

That’s not to say BMW is ignoring decarbonization. The company has poured more than €10 billion into the Neue Klasse, its largest single investment ever. The new iX3 leads a wave of upcoming electric vehicles, including an i3 sedan arriving next year. A fully electric iX5 has already been confirmed, with many more zero-emission models to follow in quick succession.

Still, BMW remains committed to combustion engines, even large-displacement ones, such as the M division’s inline-six and V-8. Both are being reworked to meet Euro 7 regulations, ensuring a future for the 3.0- and 4.4-liter powertrains in performance models. Even diesel isn’t disappearing, with BMW already confirming it for the next-generation X5 due in 2026.

Toyota, meanwhile, plans to use its upcoming gasoline engine for everything. Andrea Carlucci, Toyota Europe’s Vice President of Product Strategy and Marketing, recently said: ""We are trying to optimize the new engine for any type of application, whether it’s electric, hybrid, or hydrogen.""

Last year, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda made headlines by predicting that EVs would never exceed a 30 percent global market share. Regardless, Toyota’s current approach mirrors BMW’s by refusing to artificially limit customer choice. It’s not betting everything on EVs at the expense of combustion engines, especially given its long-running success with hybrids since the Prius debuted in 1997.

Toyota is also investing heavily in alternative solutions to reduce emissions while keeping engines alive. It’s working with Mazda and Subaru to develop synthetic, carbon-neutral, and bio-based fuels. The company has even been testing hydrogen-burning combustion engines, fitting GR Yaris and GR Corolla experimental prototypes with modified versions of the 1.6-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine.

Because BMW and Toyota never had to overhaul their strategies, both now enjoy a competitive advantage. Just look at Porsche, which must now make unexpected investments to replace the first-generation Macan with a new gas-powered crossover that wasn’t originally planned. Likewise, the 718 Boxster and Cayman will once again receive combustion engines, while a three-row SUV initially intended to be electric-only will launch first with conventional powertrains.

These unplanned course corrections are costly. But that’s not to say EVs are in decline. Despite all the AI-generated anti-EV slop spreading online like a disease, electric vehicle sales continue to grow, just not as quickly as automakers had hoped.

According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), EVs represented 17.7 percent of total new car sales in Europe during the first eight months of the year, up from 14.1 percent. In 2024, over 20 percent of new cars sold globally were electric, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

The IEA also reported that global EV shipments rose by more than 25 percent year over year, exceeding 17 million units. For 2025, it expects another 25 percent increase to more than 20 million units, with China accounting for about 14 million EVs, or roughly 60 percent of its new-car market.

Because BMW and Toyota never had to overhaul their strategies, both now enjoy a competitive advantage.

BMW and Toyota appear well prepared for whatever the future brings. By sticking to a multi-energy strategy established years ago, both automakers are positioned to serve all market segments around the world, regardless of how quickly the shift to electric power unfolds.

The only safe prediction is that some regions will transition far faster than others. In 2024, for example, EVs made up 89 percent of new car sales in Norway, according to the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV). Meanwhile, a study by Experian Automotive found that only 9.2 percent of cars sold in the United States last year were fully electric.

A brutal heat dome swept across the East Coast, while a powerful derecho tore through the Midwest, leaving more than 28,000 homes and businesses without power in Iowa alone. Demand surged to record levels. Yet despite the pressure, the grid avoided major blackouts. Smarter, more flexible systems are beginning to deliver results, but the need for faster transformation is undeniable.

COMMENTARY

Official forecasts from the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and regional operators predicted tight conditions. They were right. In July, U.S. fossil fuel electricity generation hit a nine‑year high—290 terawatt hours (TWh).

This summer also underscored how central renewables are to grid resilience. Renewables supplied a record 44% of the nation’s power through the first seven months of 2025, and, according to Cleanview, 13.5 GW of new renewable generation in Texas slashed ERCOT’s blackout risk from 11% to less than 1%.

Meanwhile, longer-term trends show that renewables-heavy areas enjoy lower costs. Day-ahead electricity prices in ERCOT North fell nearly 50% between 2023 and 2024 with record-breaking solar output, despite continued load growth from data center expansion. This isn’t a coincidence—it’s the economics of zero marginal cost generation working exactly as intended.

Renewables and Demand Response Are Key to Grid Stability

More solar and storage capacity drives lower costs and better reliability. When the sun shines and batteries are charged, the marginal cost of electricity drops toward zero. When demand spikes, storage systems and flexible resources like demand response can respond faster than traditional power plants, providing the response that the modern grids need.

Across North America, demand response activity is reaching new highs—last summer, Enel North America’s demand response resources were dispatched 411 times, totaling almost 11,000 MWh for the grid, or nearly 1,700 hours. This year, we project a record 720 dispatches for the year. During some of the most extreme peak loads this summer, PJM deployed demand response resources to help reduce load by more than 4,000 MW. These dispatches aren’t signs of a failing grid. They’re evidence of a system that’s working smarter, using every available resource to balance supply and demand in real time.

The sophistication of today’s electricity customers is another game-changer. Data centers and other large digital operations, the very loads driving unprecedented demand growth, have the potential to be intelligent and dynamic grid participants. They understand electricity markets, can quickly adjust their operations based on price signals, and actively contribute toward grid stability, rather than just consume power. For example, Google recently signed demand response agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Power Authority for its AI data centers.

Economic Case is Still Strong

The economics of electricity markets are increasingly favoring smart, flexible approaches to grid management. Grid conditions, generation availability, weather conditions, and customer demand can change significantly and swiftly on an intra-day basis. Having tools available to the grid operator that can respond equally as fast as those changing conditions is key to maintaining stability.

While capacity constraints in some regions have led to higher wholesale prices, like in PJM, these conditions also drive investment in cost-effective solutions. Because of the lag in timing to bring new generation or new transmission online to meet demand growth, grid operators are turning to demand response and storage resources that can be added more quickly and provide reliability benefits at a fraction of the cost.

This shift creates real value for consumers. A single demand response event can provide similar grid benefits to a new peaking power plant while costing far less to deploy and maintain. Businesses participating in these programs can offset rising electricity costs by earning revenue for their flexibility, creating a win-win dynamic.

Smart energy users are discovering that operational flexibility has genuine economic value. A manufacturing facility that is available to reduce demand, even if only called upon for a few hours a year, earns payments for that availability. A data center that can shift computing loads based on grid conditions can take advantage of energy price variations between on-peak and off-peak pricing. These capabilities represent new revenue opportunities that didn’t exist in a centralized grid model.

A Cautionary Tale

While this summer demonstrated the resilience of our evolving grid, we shouldn’t be satisfied with scraping by. According to the Department of Energy, data center electricity demand could reach 12% of total U.S. consumption by 2028, up from about 4% today. This transition must be realized utilizing electricity resources that are flexible, dynamic and cost-effective.

The window for staying ahead of this growing demand curve is narrowing. Every month of delay in streamlining the interconnection process and building new transmission infrastructure makes the challenge harder. The alternative—relying primarily on fossil fuel generation—is often more expensive, slower to deploy, and can’t match the operational flexibility that modern grids require.

The past year proved that transition is possible almost everywhere: the grid can handle extraordinary demand if renewables, storage, and demand response scale together. In 2024, for the first time ever, the California ISO service area achieved 100% clean energy for a period of the day every three out of five days, without issuing a single emergency alert, while ERCOT managed record demand with lower prices.

Grid operators are already adapting to manage higher levels of renewable penetration, but they need the tools to succeed. That means storage to capture excess solar generation during the day and discharge it when the sun sets. It means more sophisticated demand response programs that can tap into the inherent flexibility of the technology sector and industrial operations. And it means transmission infrastructure that can move clean energy from where it’s generated to where it’s needed.

But we must continue to move quickly to meet rising demand. The data center boom isn’t slowing down, and neither should our progress toward a modern energy system. The grid of the future won’t look like the grid of the past. It will be more distributed, more flexible, and more intelligent. This summer showed what’s possible, but we need to keep building a resilient grid everywhere—fast.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stockcake-power-grid-1024x1011.png,N,,2025-10-08 13:11:44.053093

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord.","Certified adapters often cost $200-$250.

Using the wrong adapter could damage your vehicle and the charger.

Electric vehicle owners, beware: Buying a cheap, unapproved converter to connect your EV to a Tesla DC fast charger — or connect your Tesla to the more common CCS charger — could damage your vehicle.

Experts agree the best course is to use the adapter your vehicle’s manufacture recommends. They typically cost $200 or more. You can find adapters for under $100 on Amazon, but cheap, off-brand devices could be less efficient and not as reliable.

Worst case, it might damage your vehicle and void the warranty.

“If an adapter overheats, it can melt and damage the inlet on your vehicle and the charger,” said Ted Bohn, the engineer at Argonne National Laboratory who chaired the public-private committee that created the safety standard for adapters you can rely on.

A melted adapter could essentially weld your vehicle’s inlet port to the charging cable, rendering both inoperative.

High voltage, high stakes

DC fast chargers are complicated devices that carry high electric voltages. They connect a big expensive vehicle to a charging kiosk that almost certainly costs more than the vehicle.

What could go wrong?

Plenty, and a faulty adapter could leave you on the hook for damage to both. The tab can easily run into thousands of dollars.

A bad adapter might even expose vehicles and chargers — conceivably, even your home — to cybersecurity threats.

Automaker-approved adapters are available from new car dealers and automakers’ websites and apps.

“It’s important to stick to the adapter your vehicle manufacturer specifies,” Consumer Reports Associate Director of Automotive Testing Gabe Shenhar said. “People who bought cheaper alternatives had problems, including voiding their warranty and the adapter overheating.

“It’s not worth saving a few bucks on something that could damage your vehicle.”

Why do I need an adapter to charge my EV?

EV owners typically use DC fast chargers when they drive long distances or don’t have access to a Level 2 (240 volt) charger to fill their battery overnight or at work. Run by companies like Electrify America, EVgo, Ionna and Charge Point, DC fast chargers — as the name suggests — deliver high levels of power to charge the battery quickly, so the vehicle can get back on the road.

Most EVs use what’s called a CCS, or combined charging system, plug. Teslas have a different plug, called NACS, or North American charging system.

The two are incompatible because Tesla built its DC fast chargers first. It kept the design proprietary, so only Tesla vehicles could charge at its kiosks, which the company calls Super Chargers.

The network of fast, convenient chargers gave Tesla a major sales advantage. Imagine what it would’ve been like in 1910 if Ford owned most of the gas stations in America, and only Fords could fill up at them.

Getting back to the present, it took other automakers a while to catch on, but they eventually agreed on the CCS design. They and independent charging companies built thousands of them around the country.

Now anybody can use Tesla's chargers

Result: A VW or Chevy EV owner couldn’t charge at a Tesla station, and vice versa. On top of that, NACS chargers earned a reputation for being faster and more reliable than CCS.

They were seen as the gold standard.

Today, there are about 17,000 NACS charging stations and something over 18,000 CCS stations in the United States. The numbers are continually increasing, due to EV sales and rising demand. That compares with 145,000 gas stations nationwide. Concern about access to chargers held EV sales back.

Automakers negotiated to get their vehicles access to Tesla’s network.

To solve that, engineers from automakers, charging companies, the U.S. Department of Energy and others created a standard for adapters to connect CCS vehicles to NACS chargers. Doubling the number of places to fast-charge was a boon to automakers, but, initially, owners couldn’t buy an adapter. It still was like trying to plug an English appliance into an American outlet: The plugs didn’t match.

Why did my adapter cost $225?

SAE International, the engineering group that created standards for everything from lubricating oil to how heavy a trailer a vehicle can safely tow, oversaw standards for reliable adapters that work with all vehicles and chargers.

Called J3400/1, the standard specifies performance for charging, durability, use in all kinds of weather and more. They also shut down before damage occurs if something goes wrong and the adapter starts to overheat.

Any adapter stamped UL 2252 has been certified to meet those standards by UL Solutions, the long-standing independent testing group once known as Underwriters Laboratories.

“The requirements outlined in the standard are designed to ensure that an adapter meets safety standards not only when it’s first used but continues to meet them over time — even after typical wear and tear from everyday use,” said UL Solutions engineer Joe Bablo.

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord. It’s a sophisticated safety device.

G'head, run a pickup over it

Adapters that meet the standards have been certified to work for years in all weather conditions, endure repeatedly being dropped to the ground and more. A Ford video shows the automaker’s adapter surviving being driven over by an F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup.

Adapters that don’t meet SAE standard can even present cybersecurity concerns.

Some early adapters had USB ports so they could be updated. The ports left them open to hacking. The standard bans that: Adapters are now like an air-gapped computer, with no data link to the outside world.

“GM designed our adapter to meet the same standards as our vehicles,” GM Energy Chief Operating Officer and Head of Public Charging Bill Hotchkiss said. “We tested it in fleets of vehicles.

“Our chargers are good in all conditions: hot, cold, heavy rain, through thousands of use cycles. These are high-voltage connections. We want to make sure our customers are secure.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/25/PDTF/85380733007-g-mbrand-app-controls-super-charger-session-2.jpg?crop=9503,5346,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-08 13:09:12.461704

Confronting the Mineral Conundrum Critical minerals underpin the world's efforts to build a cleaner, safer future for all.","The world is racing to increase supplies of lithium, cobalt, copper and other ""critical minerals"" that are building blocks of modern technology. Not only are these minerals used in industries like defense, healthcare and electronics, but they are also key to producing the clean energy technologies that are increasingly powering our lives.

Yet critical minerals present an environmental and social conundrum. While necessary in the fight against climate change, mining and processing of these minerals can drive greenhouse gas emissions, pollute the environment and bring risks to nearby communities. Mining and production are also concentrated in a small handful of countries, and surging demand is adding to geopolitical tensions — from trade disputes to global debates over the prospect of deep-sea mining.

There is no question the world will need a lot more of these minerals, and quickly. But how do we meet this demand in a way that's responsible and equitable?

What Are Critical Minerals and Why Do They Matter?

Critical minerals are those that are essential to countries' economies or development. They are generally in high demand and prone to supply chain disruptions, although countries differ on which minerals they define as ""critical"" depending on their level of access, what the minerals are used for, their export value and national supply risks.

Most countries' critical mineral lists include copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements. These are used widely in clean energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels, EV batteries and motors, as well as in energy transmission infrastructure like power lines. Additional minerals important for the energy transition include aluminum, manganese, silicon and silver, among others.

Many critical minerals are integral to other industries as well. NATO includes several on its list of essential raw materials for defense. And they are needed to manufacture the semiconductors that underpin our electronics, from smartphones and computers to lighting and medical devices.

While the terms ""rare earth elements"" and ""critical minerals"" are sometimes used interchangeably, the two are not the same. Rare earth elements are a subset of critical minerals that includes 17 elements (such as neodymium, promethium and cerium) used extensively in clean energy systems and other advanced technologies. Contrary to their name, rare earth elements tend not to be rare. The challenge is that they are often found in very low concentrations and are intermingled with other minerals, making it difficult and uneconomical to extract them.

Can the World Meet Growing Mineral Demand?

Rapid growth in zero-carbon technology has supercharged the world's need for critical minerals, and demand is expected to keep climbing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that if governments are to meet their announced energy and climate pledges, critical mineral demand could more than double from 2022 levels by 2030 and quadruple by 2050.

Despite this high demand, there are likely enough critical minerals to meet the world's need. But the reality of accessing them is complex. Some critical minerals, like aluminum and palladium, have stable reserves on land that can fulfil the world's demand through 2050 and likely beyond. For others, like copper, nickel and cobalt, current reserves are likely to come up short, and it will take a combination of more exploration, technological advances and economic incentives to increase supply.

New mining requires long lead times.

Part of the challenge with scaling up critical mineral supplies is that mining operations move slowly. From discovery to first production, it takes an average of 15.5 years to develop new mining projects, depending on the mineral, location and mine type. Long lead times raise questions about the world's ability to ramp up output as demand grows, especially if companies wait for deficits to emerge before committing to new projects.

Mining and processing are concentrated in a handful of countries.

Extraction and processing of critical minerals are highly concentrated, both in terms of geography and ownership. For example, in 2023, Indonesia held 42% of global nickel reserves and 54% of global nickel production, while the Democratic Republic of Congo held 55% of global cobalt reserves and 74% of global cobalt production.

Once mined, the majority of these minerals are shipped to China for processing before they can be applied in end uses. China processes more than half of the world's lithium, two-thirds of its cobalt, one-third of its nickel and nearly all rare earth elements.

China's dominance in processing stems from early strategic investments in global mining and its history of looser environmental standards — although lax regulations are tightening as harms from irresponsible mining come to light. The country's longstanding investment in clean energy development has also propelled it as a leader in mineral-intensive EV battery and solar panel manufacturing, driven by a combination of relatively low, capital and land costs.

How Is the World Responding to Supply Risks?

As countries move to protect their national security and energy independence, critical minerals have become a central point of conflict. Some with a healthy mineral supply, like China, have imposed export restrictions as a geopolitical lever, heightening the urgency for other countries to build up their domestic supplies. For example, the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to establish a secure and dependable critical minerals value chain for the bloc. In the U.S., the Mine of the Future initiative provides nearly $100 million in funding to accelerate research, innovative mining technologies and commercialization, while the Defense Production Act elevates critical minerals as a national security imperative.

Some countries — such as the U.S., EU, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea — have joined international initiatives like the IEA Critical Minerals Security Programme and the Minerals Security Partnership to work together on strengthening critical mineral security and scaling up investments in sustainable supply chains. China's partnerships through its Belt and Road Initiative, which supports infrastructure development mainly in developing and emerging economies, have been instrumental in the country's ability to dominate mineral processing.

Several countries and companies are also racing to pursue deep sea mining, a frontier area of exploration. The ocean floor is estimated to hold significant reserves of copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, silver, gold and rare earth elements. Recent technological advancements have made it possible to readily access these minerals; however, little is known about the deep ocean, and research suggests mining it could pose grave environmental threats.

What Are the Dangers Associated with Critical Mineral Mining?

All mining has social and environmental impacts. These can sometimes be positive; for example, responsible, industrialized mining may bring jobs, income and services to areas with few other economic opportunities. But there are also serious risks to nature and communities, particularly when it comes to irresponsible and illegal extraction.

For one, extracting, processing and shipping minerals releases planet-warming emissions. Global mining already represents about 8% of the world's carbon footprint, and emissions from critical mineral production will grow alongside demand.

Mining can also strain water quality and supplies. Sixteen percent of critical mineral mines, deposits and districts are in highly water-stressed areas (places that already use 40% of their available water each year to meet demand). This means there is high competition for water and sometimes not enough left over to sustain important freshwater ecosystems. If mining waste isn't managed properly, it can leach hazardous materials like acidic mine drainage or tailings impoundments (process waste) into the surrounding environment and contaminate groundwater.

Between 2001 and 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares of forest to mining and related activities, an area of land roughly the size of Montenegro. Felling trees not only releases emissions (36 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year), but also harms ecosystems. And it often involves extensive removal of vegetation and soil that Indigenous and local communities depend on for food and livelihoods.

While mining may help bolster local economies, it has a track record of social harm when not well regulated. For example, of the 255,000 workers engaged in small-scale mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 40,000 are children — some as young as six years old. Communities may face also forced displacement, loss of traditional livelihoods, and health risks linked to pollution from mines.

When it comes to ocean mining, there are many unknowns. But the research available suggests the practice could irreparably harm fragile deep-sea ecosystems. It could also affect species beyond the ocean floor, including fish like tuna that are vital to food security.

How Can the World Scale Up Mineral Supplies Responsibly?

The key question is how to balance the world's growing need for critical minerals with the inherent risks of mining — particularly when these minerals are essential to securing a stable climate and a safer future. This will require: 1) ensuring that all mining is done responsibly, and 2) encouraging a circular mineral economy to minimize demand for new extraction.

Mainstream responsible mining.

Responsible mining means extracting critical minerals in a way that safeguards the environment and respects people and communities. Several different levers can support responsible mining, including:

Standards: An overarching international framework for critical minerals can help regulate and compare companies' environmental, social and governance efforts in a meaningful way. There are numerous protocols already in place — such as the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, Toward Sustainable Mining and The Copper Mark — but they need to be used more widely. Efforts to harmonize industry-led standards, such as the Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative, are currently underway.

Regulations: Countries can encourage or even require responsible mineral supply chains through policymaking. Regulatory levers may address trade and export controls, resource management, international cooperation and supply chain security. The EU's Conflict Minerals Regulation, for example, requires that gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum be sourced from conflict-free areas across the world.

Technology: Technological advancements can help mining companies reduce their impact. For example, mining companies operating in water-scarce areas are increasingly required to develop desalination plants so they don't put pressure on limited freshwater supplies.

Transparency and accountability: Through groups like Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), countries can commit to disclose information along their mineral value chains. Organizations like the Accountability Accelerator can help hold stakeholders responsible for their mining activities, with consequences for inaction.

Market-based incentives: Large buyers like governments and companies can exert their influence through green procurement, committing to purchase only critical minerals that have been responsibly mined. Companies can also join forces through corporate buyers' clubs and can opt to pay a green premium for products that have met specific environmental, social and governance targets. Financing is also an important lever, and groups like Mining 2030 are looking to define the role of finance in realizing a socially and environmentally responsible mining sector.

Promote a circular economy.

A shift from our current economic model of ""make-use-discard"" to one that emphasizes reduction, reuse and recycling can ease resource pressures, helping to minimize the need for new mining and the impacts that come with it.

Critical mineral use can be reduced through material-efficient products. For example, more and more EV models on the market are SUVs and other larger passenger vehicles that require larger batteries and therefore more minerals. Governments can encourage car manufacturers and consumers to opt for smaller vehicles through measures like the EU's recently announced Small Affordable Cars Initiative. New technologies can also help substitute demand; for example, cobalt-free EV batteries rely on cheaper, more abundant resources, such as iron and phosphate.

Reusing older clean energy components after the end of their ""first life"" can keep minerals in circulation. Retired EV batteries, for example, often retain 70%-80% of their capacity and could be used in renewable energy storage, EV charging stations and microgrids. Retired commercial solar panels could power off-grid structures like electric bike stations or community solar systems. This can help reduce waste while creating new jobs and expanding access to clean energy. However, second-life use needs to be properly managed to avoid becoming a loophole for waste dumping in lower-income countries. ​

Increasing mineral recycling could reduce the need for new mine development by 40% for copper and cobalt and 25% for lithium and nickel by 2050. Though in near-term, improvements in recycling may be outpaced by rising material consumption. For instance, the share of total copper demand that was supplied by secondary or recycled copper actually fell from 37% in 2015 to 33% in 2023.

Fortunately, policy momentum in support of recycling is gaining strength. Since 2022, more than 30 new policies related to critical mineral recycling have been introduced globally. These include India's 2022 Battery Waste Management Rules, which regulate the recycling and management of all batteries, and Vietnam's Decree No.8/2022/ND-CP, which mandates recycling rates and specifications for producers and importers of specific products, including batteries and solar cells.

Confronting the Mineral Conundrum

Critical minerals underpin the world's efforts to build a cleaner, safer future for all. But they are not without risks. As surging demand spurs geopolitical tensions and environmental and social concerns, the need for meeting this demand responsibly is paramount. Countries and companies must work together to ensure that supply chains are not only secure, but sustainable — and that we're making the most of the minerals already in play to minimize the need for new extraction as much as possible.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-10/lithium_0.jpg?VersionId=fk85E.5AHCkoTEeNlAy8g_QplY4bcgSN&h=b6d03109&itok=VSOZCc3B,N,,2025-10-08 16:02:05.662657

The road to a greener future India’s electric vehicles future is within reach but not guaranteed.","India’s automobile industry stands on the cusp of a transformation. Rising pollution, volatile fuel prices, and mounting climate concerns are converging to make electric vehicles not just an alternative but a necessity. EV adoption promises to cut emissions, reduce fossil fuel dependence, and lower import bills, while spurring innovation, job creation, and investment. Together, these factors could position India as a leader in sustainable mobility.

The electric vehicles market in India has expanded rapidly in line with NITI Aayog’s target of electrifying 30% of vehicles by 2030. Global EV sales surged from 0.9 million units in 2016 to nearly 19 million in 2024 — a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.8%. India has outpaced this with a 59.4% CAGR over the same period, moving from 50,000 units in 2016 to 2.08 million in 2024. Although EVs accounted for only 2–3% of new car sales — below the global average of 5% — India remains the fastest-growing large EV market.

NITI Aayog projects a 49% CAGR between 2022 and 2030, reaching 10 million annual sales by decade-end. Encouragingly, adoption is spreading from metros to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, signalling a broader social and economic shift. Passenger vehicle data for FY2024–25 show this transition gaining traction. While petrol cars dipped from 2.57 million to 2.47 million units, EV sales grew 50%, from 80,000 to 120,000 units. The numbers remain small, but the trajectory is clear: cleaner mobility is no longer a niche trend.

Why electric vehicles transition matters

The case for electrification extends beyond convenience or cost. Transport contributes about 14% of India’s total CO₂ emissions, and vehicular pollution drives air quality in major cities to hazardous levels. Meanwhile, oil imports account for over 85% of India’s crude consumption, burdening the trade balance.

Government incentives—tax breaks, subsidies, and fee waivers—have boosted sales, but the rationale is strategic. A 2023 NITI Aayog perception survey found that 75% of EV buyers cited fuel savings as the top motivator, followed by pollution reduction. In short, EVs align environmental necessity with economic logic.

The bottlenecks: Cost and infrastructure

India’s electric vehicles revolution faces familiar hurdles. High upfront costs, driven by expensive lithium-ion batteries, remain the biggest deterrent. These batteries also add weight and affect vehicle range.

Policy Circle is now on WhatsApp. Click here to join the channel

The lack of adequate charging infrastructure compounds the problem. As of mid-2025, India had only around 12,000 public charging stations—grossly insufficient for mass adoption. Rural and semi-urban regions are particularly underserved, making EV ownership impractical outside major cities.

Awareness gaps and concerns about reliability, battery life, and resale value persist. Dealers and financiers remain cautious, dampening consumer confidence. Unless infrastructure and financing evolve together, achieving 2030 targets will be difficult.

Government push: Policy and incentives

Public policy has been central to India’s electric vehicles push. Schemes like FAME I and II subsidize vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure, while states including Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu offer additional tax waivers and subsidies. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cells is encouraging domestic battery manufacturing, reducing import dependence.

By mid-2025, 29 states and Union Territories had adopted EV policies aimed at lowering imports, expanding manufacturing, and creating jobs. NITI Aayog’s “Shoonya” campaign has promoted zero-emission transport, especially in delivery and ride-hailing sectors.

A further boost came from the GST Council’s September 2025 decision to retain the 5% GST rate on EVs while reducing taxes on small cars, two-wheelers, and auto components to 18%. This move will lower costs across the supply chain and make EVs more competitive.

Cleaner air, lower costs

One of the strongest arguments for electric vehicles lies in their environmental payoff. The Central Pollution Control Board estimates that vehicles contribute nearly 30% of PM2.5 levels in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. Replacing internal combustion engines with EVs could sharply reduce urban pollution and improve public health.

Battery prices are projected to fall by almost 60% within five years, according to BloombergNEF, narrowing the price gap with petrol vehicles. With improving technology and economies of scale, affordability will no longer be a major obstacle.

Two- and three-wheelers are leading the charge. E-rickshaws, delivery scooters, and shared mobility fleets are rapidly electrifying. Firms such as Tata Motors, Ola Electric, Ather, MG Motor, and Maruti Suzuki have expanded their EV portfolios, from the Nexon and Tiago EVs to the Ola S1 range.

Learning from global leaders

India’s progress is impressive but still trails global leaders. China dominates the EV supply chain, controlling over 70% of global battery manufacturing and offering vast charging networks. Norway, at the other extreme, has achieved over 80% EV penetration in new car sales through a mix of tax waivers and infrastructure investment.

Electric bus fleets in Indian cities like Delhi and Bengaluru are expanding, but the penetration of electric trucks and long-haul vehicles remains limited. Accelerating this segment will be vital if India is to meet its 2030 target of 30% electrification.

Public sentiment and social shift

EVs are increasingly part of urban aspiration. The NITI Aayog survey shows 87% of respondents view EVs positively, citing lower operating costs and environmental gains. Young professionals between 18 and 35 are leading adoption, attracted by the combination of tech-driven design, convenience, and climate awareness.

Still, concerns linger over charging access, upfront costs, and long-term performance. Overcoming these anxieties will require trust built through transparency, warranty support, and widespread charging visibility.

The road to a greener future

India’s electric vehicles future is within reach but not guaranteed. The sector needs a coordinated push—affordable finance, resilient infrastructure, and long-term policy clarity. Private players must invest in R&D, while the government must ensure grid readiness and localize critical supply chains.

If India sustains its current pace, the outcome will be transformative. Cleaner cities, reduced oil imports, and a new generation of green jobs could redefine India’s economic landscape.

The road ahead may be long, but the direction is unmistakable. Electric mobility is not merely a technological shift—it is India’s route to a cleaner, more self-reliant, and globally competitive future.

But there’s no arguing that the tax credit accelerated that demand. The policy, which gifted a $7,500 tax rebate to buyers for EVs starting in 2009, did a lot to bring EVs closer to affordability;, being new, highly complex products, they were always going to be more expensive than their ICE counterparts. Without the tax credit, it’s entirely possible that Tesla wouldn’t be near as big as it is today. As of last week, that EV tax credit is dead. Unsurprisingly, automakers and dealers alike worry the EV market will now cave in on itself, considering every car in the segment just got a whole lot more expensive. To counteract this, automakers are attempting to fill the gap with discounts, rebates, and other incentives. But many of these deals won’t last forever.

What else? Tesla has offered its own car insurance since 2019 as a way to integrate the car ownership experience under one roof. Now, that arm of the company is facing a ban in California, with users reporting big delays in responses and unreasonable claim denials.

In other news, there’s a report out of Washington that says the Department of Energy is considering revoking $1.1 billion in grants to General Motors and Stellantis that would’ve been used to revitalize and retool old plants to build electric cars.

Speaking of Stellantis, it was named as a possible partner alongside Ford in a potential tie-up with Nissan. A report suggests Nissan could start selling rebadged Rogue hybrids to either of the brands mentioned above, a deal that could include a team-up in electric vehicle development. Nissan’s really doing everything it can to stay in the game.

The Discounts Aren’t Totally Gone Just Yet

There’s no doubt that the sales of electric cars are about to see a big slump in the fourth quarter. Lots of buyers sprang for their EVs last month to take advantage of the federal tax credit before it disappeared for good, resulting in record sales for some brands, including Tesla. With a bunch of satisfied buyers now out of the market (and the credit gone), there’s no way Q4 sales will reach anywhere near Q3’s numbers.

To cushion the fall, numerous brands are offering discounts of their own to keep buyers coming through the door. The most interesting strategy comes from Ford and GM, which, as The Autopian reported previously, actually used a loophole to take ownership of cars in its inventory it plans to lease to customers before the September 30th deadline, allowing lessees to take advantage of the credit even after that deadline has passed. Clever stuff.

Stellantis, the last of the Big Three, is using a more conventional approach by simply replicating the tax rebate with a bonus cash allowance of its own, and eating the discount itself. All of the conglomerate’s hybrids and EVs qualify, which means you’ll be able to use it on cars like the Dodge Charger Daytona, the Jeep Wagoneer S, and Jeep’s lineup of plug-ins. The discounts will only apply to existing inventory, according to Automotive News, and according to Stellantis’s websites, they expire on November 3.

Then there’s Tesla, which, on October 1st, added a $6,500 lease credit for the Model 3 and the Model Y to offset the loss of the federal rebate. It’s worth noting this credit isn’t available for either of the more affordable “Standard” versions of those cars launched yesterday. In fact, Tesla doesn’t give potential owners the option to lease that trim at all, according to its website.

Rivian is following in Tesla’s footsteps, offering a lease credit worth up to $6,500 for new owners. The offer expires at the end of the month, and only applies to a few models. From InsideEVs:

The biggest rebate of $6,500 applies to the 2025 R1S and R1T in three specific configurations: the tri-motor, the dual-motor with the Max battery pack and the Performance Upgrade, and the dual-motor with the Large battery and the Performance Upgrade. In other words, Rivian is trying to get rid of its inventory, but it’s worth noting that neither the entry-level Dual version with the Standard battery pack nor the top-spec Quad variant is eligible for any of these discounts.

That said, buyers can get $6,000 off the lease price of a 2026 R1S or R1T with the tri-motor configuration, while the 2026 R1S and R1T dual-motor with the Max battery and Performance Upgrade are eligible for a $5,000 lease bonus.

It’s not just American brands getting in on the action. BMW is offering $7,500 off its electric lineup and $5,000 off its plug-ins. This is only for vehicles purchased, not leased, and the discount ends after November 1, according to Car and Driver. Hyundai is taking what feels like a more permanent approach, slashing prices of its Ioniq 5 by up to $9,800 for the 2026 model year.

So if you’re sad you missed out on the federal credit, just know that there are still deals out there, at least for a few more weeks. Though the golden era may be behind us for now.

California Is Threatening To Shut Down Tesla’s Insurance

Tesla owners who use Tesla’s insurance are pretty upset with the service, at least according to California’s Department of Insurance. The organization announced plans last week to hold the car company’s subdivision accountable for failing “in their legal obligations to adequately handle hundreds of California automobile policyholder claims.” From the release:

The actions allege that, despite being repeatedly warned by the Department of Insurance, the Tesla Companies and State National instead chose to abandon their responsibility to consumers and persist with their non-compliant claims-handling practices, placing profits above people and flouting the law with impunity.

After continuing to receive a significant number of consumer complaints related to the handling of their automobile policyholder claims beginning in 2022, the Department of Insurance repeatedly warned the Tesla Companies and State National of the significant harm to their policyholders — largely Tesla drivers — unless immediate corrective actions were taken. Throughout numerous meetings with, correspondence between, and reports to the Department of Insurance, the companies repeatedly committed to improvements, but the number of justified consumer complaints and violations continued to mount. Instead of correcting their unlawful and egregious behavior, the companies disregarded the Department’s serious warnings and continued their misconduct, and the number of consumer complaints and the amount of legal violations have only continued to significantly increase. The companies face monetary penalties up to $5,000 for each unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act, or up to $10,000 for each such act determined to be willful.

Tesla Insurance has been in the news for years over allegedly less-than-satisfactory business practices. Reuters published a wide-ranging report back in 2023 covering the firm’s alleged inability to deliver timely communications, pay out on claims, or even pick up the phone. The CDI’s accusations seem similar:

The Department’s accusations are based on the companies’ ongoing systemic failures and willful unfair claims settlement practices including, but not limited to, the following alleged violations:

Egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps of the claims handling process, causing financial harm, out-of-pocket expenses, potential third-party liability exposure, and distress to policyholders

Unreasonable denials and delays in fully paying valid claims to consumers

Failure to conduct thorough, fair, and objective investigations of claims, thus denying consumers the insurance benefits they expect

Failure to advise policyholders of their rights to have their claims denials reviewed by the Department – a major consumer protection in California to make sure insurers are held accountable by their regulator

The CDI says Tesla Insurance has 15 days from October 3 to respond to the accusations, or else the provider could have its license to operate in the state suspended.

GM And Stellantis Could Be Out $1.1 Billion In Factory Retooling Grants

The cuts just keep on coming. Last year, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.1 billion to GM and Stellantis to retool a trio of plants, with plans to convert them for EV and EV parts production. That money might not be coming in anymore, according to a government document seen by Reuters. From the report:

The projects are among a list of $12 billion in awards that could be canceled as the partial government shutdown persists.

Among those grants: $500 million awarded to GM to convert Lansing Grand River Assembly in Michigan to build electric vehicles; $335 million for Stellantis to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to make midsize electric pickups; and $250 million for Stellantis to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to produce EV components.

The possible cancellations come a week after the Energy Department announced plans to cancel $7.56 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects that it said would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

The Lansing plant currently builds the Cadillac CT4 and CT5, while the Belvidere plant hasn’t built anything since 2023, when the last-gen Cherokee went out of production.

As for why these previously earmarked funds could be canceled over the government shutdown, well, you’ll have to ask the current administration. As Reuters points out, this news comes just a week after the DOE announced plans to cut $7.5 billion in financing for various energy projects, and a week after White House budget director Russell Vought said on X that the admin would be cancelling nearly $8 billion in climate-related funding in 16 Democratic-run states. Only Belvidere falls under the States mentioned, though, so going by this Reuters report, the admin’s planned cuts could reach even farther than expected.

Nissan Could Supply Rebadged Rogue Hybrids To Ford Or Stellantis

The Nissan Rogue is a great car, and the world can use more of them. That could soon be a reality, as Rogue production may add a badge-engineered sibling wearing bodywork from one of the Big Three American automakers. A report from Automotive News claims the company is in talks with brands like Stellantis and Ford to sell an electrified crossover based on the ever-popular SUV. From the report:

The compact crossover would feature Nissan’s e-Power hybrid system, which uses a battery-powered electric motor to drive the wheels and a gasoline engine to recharge the battery.

Nissan would assemble the vehicle alongside the Rogue in Smyrna, Tenn.

Discussions include potential collaboration on electric vehicle development, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.

“It’s not a quid pro quo,” the person said, adding that a deal could happen even without an EV partnership.

While a Nissan official told Autonews there were no agreements in place right now, they did say the company “remains open to dialogue that delivers strategic, complementary market opportunities to our core model development efforts.” So that’s something.

If such a partnership does materialize, the badge-engineered, Rogue-based hybrid will likely use Nissan’s third-generation e-POWER tech, which utilizes one of the most thermally efficient engines in production right now. It’s already for sale in Europe, and it’s expected to make its first appearance in America via the Rogue next year, according to Autonews.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

This month might be the last opportunity to get a properly discounted electric car before things get really expensive. So I’m listening to Janis Joplin’s “Get It While You Can” from her 1971 album, Pearl. But instead of love, I’ll be thinking about EVs.

(Reuters) -General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering for several months a $7,500 tax credit on electric-vehicle leases following the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said on Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars hours ahead of the deadline then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried that they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax credit expiration. It’s unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

“The future of the bus is electric. However, building the necessary public charging infrastructure is taking too long,” said Till Oberwörder, CEO of Daimler Buses. “We want to give an important impulse with our charging stations. Our new battery-electric intercity bus, the eIntouro, already connects cities and rural areas. It is also suitable for shorter trips. These are currently the most practical applications for electric buses and coaches outside of urban public transport. For long-distance travel to remote destinations, however, a comprehensive charging network is needed so that bus operators can use electric coaches economically and without compromising passenger comfort.”

The initiative will begin with a pilot project in the city of Cologne, Germany. Four public fast charging points for electric buses and coaches are set to be installed near the city center next year. Daimler Buses subsidiary Daimler Buses Solutions will be responsible for planning, construction, operation and maintenance.

The Buspark Cologne parking facility serves as a central location for all intercity buses and coaches taking tourists to Cologne. Bus operators will be able to quickly charge their electric buses and coaches—regardless of brand—with green electricity. Unlike electric city buses, which serve shorter routes and are usually charged overnight at 50 to 80 kW, coaches require especially powerful charging solutions. The four new fast charging stations will each provide a nominal output of 400 kW. The stations will be accessible to the public 24/7.

Daimler Buses debuted the series-production version of its first battery-electric intercity bus, the Mercedes-Benz eIntouro, at the recent Busworld 2025 trade show in Brussels.

US President Donald Trump has been rather busy of late, what with taking undisclosed medical treatments on a regular basis, pasting cheap gilt flourishes all over the walls of the Oval Office, building a new ballroom, and sending troops from former Confederate states to invade the Union once again. Meanwhile, he has apparently forgotten all about his war on electric vehicles. In fact, the US has been adding more EV charging stations by the bucketful all this year, indicating that the EV movement is here to stay regardless of Trump’s fossil-friendly energy policy.

Putting EV Charging Aside For The Moment, Let’s Revisit The Civil War

To be clear, there is nothing funny about the current situation. It’s 2025 and the person who occupies the White House has styled himself as a modern-day Jefferson Davis, with his Secretary of Defense playing the role of Robert E. Lee.

For reasons best known only to themselves, other news media has failed to connect the dots, leaving it up to us clean tech reporters to spell it out for them. Okay, we will spell it out for them. In August, the President ordered troops from five Republican-controlled former Confederate states — Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina — to invade Washington DC, a feat they failed to perform during the first Civil War lo these many years ago, costing much bloodshed along the way.

In his efforts to foster a modern-day takeover of DC by the former Confederacy, Trump also took a detour over to Ohio and West Virginia, two non-Confederate states currently under Republican control. However, that was just a matter of convenience. The President reverted to the theme of a Confederate takeover this week, sending troops from the former Confederate state of Texas willy-nilly into parts north of the Mason-Dixon Line.

Sheetz Keeps The EV Charging Momentum Going

So much for connecting the dots. This article was supposed to be about EV charging, so let’s get to it. The sharp U-turn in federal energy policy notwithstanding, stakeholders in the travel plaza, quick-serve restaurant, and gas-plus-convenience store areas have played a defining role in the expansion of the public EV charging network in the US this year, with the family-owned business Sheetz front and center.

The latest news from Sheetz is particularly significant because builds on the company’s ongoing relationship with Vontier, a leading global mobility tech firm headquartered in the US.

“Vontier Corporation…announced today that Driivz, a Vontier company and leading global software supplier to electric vehicle (EV) charging operators and service providers, will partner with Sheetz, one of the fastest-growing, family-owned and -operated convenience retailers in the United States, to power its growing EV charging network with advanced EV charging and energy management software,” Vontier announced somewhat cumbersomely on October 7.

As noted by Vontier, Sheetz has already set up 125 EV charging stations among its operations, through third-party providers. The partnership with Driivz slaps the Sheetz brand on its charging station network, supported by the Sheetz mobile app.

Trevor Walter, the EVP of Petroleum Supply Management at Sheetz, put on his EV charging hat to explain the new arrangement with Driivz. “EV drivers already choose our stores because of the amenities and services we provide,” Walter explained in a press statement. “This partnership allows us to build on that trust— making charging a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience, while delivering the same consistency and value customers expect each time they visit.”

It’s Not Just Sheetz

No word yet on how many more charging stations Sheetz expects to crank up under the new partnership with Driivz, so stay tuned for more on that. Meanwhile, another ripe opportunity for new EV charging stations has been cropping up in the multi-unit residential market.

For the latest development in that area, let’s turn to The Solomon Organization, a leading real estate operator with more than 22,000 residential apartments in its portfolio, which spans New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.

On October 1 the up-and-coming EV charging investment firm 3V Infrastructure announced a new partnership with TSO, under which 3V will install Level 2 EV charging stations at more than 60 TSO properties in nine different states.

The new charging stations are being installed under the Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) model, in which neither the property owner nor the tenants pay any up-front costs. “Through the partnership, 3V will fund, install, and operate smart Level 2 EV charging infrastructure powered by SWTCH,” 3V explained in a press statement.

“We built 3V to remove the financial and operational barriers for property owners by fully funding, installing, and managing charging infrastructure long-term,” emphasized 3V CEO Aubrey Gunnels.

3V began surfacing on the CleanTechnica radar in August of 2024 and they have been very busy since then, including a financial assist from GDEV Management’s recently closed Fund II venture, so keep an eye open for more activity where that came from.

Fine Tuning The EV Experience

Growing the nation’s network of EV charging stations is just one way to push the vehicle electrification movement forward. Also helping things along is new technology that finally puts EV range anxiety to bed once and for all. In that regard, check out the new “State of Mission” model under development at the University of California-Riverside. Rather than simply announcing the battery’s current state of charge, the SOM model will factor in traffic patterns, hilly terrain, and other elements specific to the driver’s route.

“The model learns from how batteries charge, discharge, and heat up over time, but it also respects the laws of electrochemistry and thermodynamics. This dual intelligence lets it make reliable predictions even under stress, such as a sudden temperature drop or a steep uphill climb,” UC-Riverside explains.

With range anxiety falling by the wayside, EV affordability continues to be an obstacle. In August, Ford and GM both announced plans to address that issue in the coming years, partly with the aid of the new LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) battery formulas.

On October 7 Tesla also rolled out its affordable EV plan, consisting of “cheaper versions” of two existing models, marketed under the somewhat unflattering title, “Standard.” The new Standard EVs offer less battery range among other budgetary features.

So far the news has provoked little more than a collective yawn from the fourth estate, with Associated Press providing a representative sample from the general media.

“The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, follows a slump in Tesla sales covering most of the past year due to anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company. The company is also offering a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $35,000,” AP reported on October 7, referring to the automaker’s recent brand reputation woes.

Among members of the automotive press, Motor Trend chipped in its two cents:

While they are well below $45,000, a slightly used 2025 model year version of either vehicle can be had for equal or even less money, and you’ll get all the content lost to create the Standard trims.

You’ll also get all the battery range of the 2025 model year, or nearly so. Today’s batteries practically outlast the rest of the car, making used EVs an attractive alternative for bargain hunters.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and drop them a note about, well, everything.

The investment round values Base Power at about $3 billion, not counting the new money, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to discuss financials publicly.
(Base Power also offers its software to power companies.)
That could help Base Power sell excess energy from its batteries at times of higher demand.
Base Power plans to use the new funds to expand to other regions, among other investments.","As cities around the world grapple with ever-increasing energy needs — for data centers, electric vehicles and more — power companies are rushing to meet that demand.

Base Power, a two-year-old power company based in Texas, is taking an unorthodox approach: It leases huge batteries to homeowners that it can tap for extra energy as needed. And it has amassed yet more financial resources to carry out its plan.

The company plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $1 billion in new funding.

The investment round values Base Power at about $3 billion, not counting the new money, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to discuss financials publicly. That is more than double the company’s valuation in April, according to the data provider PitchBook.

Though many power companies are focusing on building giant industrial batteries as a way to store energy — often generated by wind or solar facilities — and provide it when demand rises, Base Power is building what amounts to a fleet of home batteries. The company essentially leases and installs residential backup batteries at a discount to competing systems, and sells power to its customers.

The company then uses software to fill the batteries when electricity is cheap and draw from them when power is more expensive, profiting from the difference in price and passing some of the savings onto customers. (Base Power also offers its software to power companies.)

The goal, according to Zach Dell, Base Power’s co-founder and chief executive, is to build “the modern power company.”

Since it began operations, Base Power has sold more than 100 megawatt hours’ worth of battery capacity, or enough energy to power 33,000 U.S. homes for an hour.

Key to Base Power’s business has been the deregulated nature of the energy market in Texas, where it operates and where customers can choose among different power providers. The company recently qualified for a state program that allows fleets of batteries to combine their power and send it back to the grid.

That could help Base Power sell excess energy from its batteries at times of higher demand. “We can say, ‘Hey, we can give you 100 megawatts faster and cheaper than anyone,” Mr. Dell said.

Though the company had raised $200 million in April, investors clamored to put more money in to help it expand, Mr. Dell said in an interview. It has already embarked on expensive new projects, notably by building a battery factory in Austin, Texas — it currently buys batteries from a company in Asia — and plans to build a second soon.

“The administration has been very clear that they want America to be an energy powerhouse,” Mr. Dell said.

Base Power plans to use the new funds to expand to other regions, among other investments. Mr. Dell said the company was likely to announce its next U.S. market by the end of the year, and hoped to expand internationally by the second half of 2026.

Participants in the round include existing backers such as Addition and Thrive Capital, where Mr. Dell previously worked as a venture capitalist. It also includes new investors like CapitalG, the Google-affiliated investment firm.

“Base Power’s commitment to resilient, affordable energy is transforming how communities in Texas — and soon, nationwide — access electricity,” Lee Fixel, Addition’s founder, said in a statement.

Mr. Dell’s father, the technology billionaire Michael Dell, is not among Base Power’s backers. “He’s an incredible mentor, coach and friend,” the younger Mr. Dell said. “But this is being built kind of independent of his capital and direct resources.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/business/08db-basepower/08db-basepower-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:09:53.073346

The facility will be further supported by $12 million in investments from Nano Nuclear itself.
Quotables: “With the strong presence of nuclear utilities and R&D institutions in Illinois, this is the ideal ecosystem for us to thrive,” said Florent Heidet, chief technology officer at Nano Nuclear.
Beyond those applications, Nano Nuclear says that the reactor’s modular design will allow a multiunit configuration to fulfill gigawatt-scale power needs.
In 2021, Pritzker and the Illinois legislature passed the REV Illinois Act into law with the aim of bolstering the state’s clean manufacturing sector.","The funding will come in the form of incentive awards from the Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) program. The facility will be further supported by $12 million in investments from Nano Nuclear itself.

More details: In July, the company acquired a property in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook for $3.5 million. It features a 23,537-square-foot standalone facility, including a dedicated 7,400-square-foot nonnuclear demonstration area.

The facility, which Nano Nuclear promises will create 50 new full-time jobs, will be used to support personnel who are working to advance the company’s flagship project: the Kronos MMR (micro modular reactor) at the University of Illinois–Urbana-Champaign.

Quotables: “With the strong presence of nuclear utilities and R&D institutions in Illinois, this is the ideal ecosystem for us to thrive,” said Florent Heidet, chief technology officer at Nano Nuclear.

Nano Nuclear CEO James Walker added, “This new hub will play a central role in our work to construct, demonstrate, and ultimately commercialize our Kronos MMR.”

Some context: Illinois’s funding of new nuclear development is in line with the state’s nuclear legacy and present, considering it is the largest nuclear energy producer in the country. It also aligns with Pritzker’s generally pronuclear stance, especially when it comes to smaller-scale reactors like the 15-MWe high-temperature, gas-cooled Kronos MMR, which is designed to be co-located with data centers and other energy-intensive industries and could also meet needs for industrial heat.

Beyond those applications, Nano Nuclear says that the reactor’s modular design will allow a multiunit configuration to fulfill gigawatt-scale power needs.

In 2021, Pritzker and the Illinois legislature passed the REV Illinois Act into law with the aim of bolstering the state’s clean manufacturing sector. While electric vehicles and renewable energy were the highlighted focuses of the legislation, it also served as a booster to nuclear. This is because it included companies in the nuclear sector under the definition of “renewable energy manufacturers.”

The new Chicagoland facility will be Nano Nuclear’s second demonstration facility in the U.S. The first, in Westchester County, N.Y., opened in February.",https://www.ans.org/file/20043/l/NANO-Nuclears-KRONOS-MMR.png,N,,2025-10-08 12:06:04.117731

MOFs, as they are known, are being explored for their use in wastewater cleanup, PFAS removal, timed or multidrug release systems, and more.

The cages are made of metal ions held together by organic, or carbon-containing, molecules. The cages can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional, and they can be formed from a host of metals and organic linkers.

Richard Robson of the University of Melbourne dreamed up the first MOFs, inspired by the tetrahedral, or pyramidlike, shape that carbon atoms take to form diamonds. He mixed a form of copper with a nitrile, an organic compound with nitrogen bonded to carbon, and watched as it formed a repeating structure with small holes in it.

Following a 12 percent drop in vehicles sold during the second quarter of 2025, Tesla is making an attempt to win back customers.

Although the American marque was expected to reveal a low-cost version of the Model Y SUV, the cheaper Model 3 sedan came as a surprise.

Tesla’s reductions will help offset the impact of the U.S. government ending federal EV tax credits. These previously reduced prices by $7,500 (£5,500).

Model 3 cut back to the EV essentials

In the United States, the Model 3 Standard will cost $36,990 (£27,500), representing a $5,500 (£4,100) saving over the rest of the range.

On the outside, the Model 3 Standard has 18-inch Prismata wheels and a choice of just three paint finishes.

A stripped-out approach is taken to the interior, with cloth upholstery, a manually adjustable steering wheel, and no FM radio or rear touchscreen. Following recent revisions, the Model 3 will also come with indicator stalks in place of touch-sensitive buttons on the steering wheel.

Tesla has not confirmed full technical details, but the Model 3 Standard offers an official range of 321 miles based on EPA testing.

No glass ceiling to Model Y ownership

The new Tesla Model Y Standard costs $39,990 (£29,750), undercutting Premium trim by $5,000 (£3,700), and offering a battery range of 321 miles.

A similar pared-back strategy has been applied here, with the panoramic glass roof removed, along with the FM radio and subwoofer for the sound system.

Cloth upholstery is used inside, and there are manual side mirrors and a manually adjustable steering wheel. When it comes to climate control, there is no longer a HEPA filter to provide protection against bioweapons.

Owners of both the Model 3 and Model Y in Standard trim will have to use their smartphone to lock and unlock their car. No physical key is provided.

Tesla intends to release lower-priced cars for other worldwide markets, with more details expected soon.

Dive Brief:

The Department of Energy terminated 321 financial awards worth about $7.56 billion after a review determined the projects failed to meet economic or national energy standards, according to an Oct. 2 release.

The DOE said the decision, which affects 223 projects, followed a case-by-case review of awards issued under clean energy and manufacturing, many of which were approved in the final months of the Biden administration.

Democratic leaders in Congress blasted the move as politically motivated, noting the terminations affected 108 Democratic districts versus 28 Republican House districts, and could likely raise energy prices.

Dive Insight:

The cancellations signal heightened scrutiny of federally-backed energy projects and create another layer of risk for contractors in the space.

The terminations stem from a May DOE policy that tightened financial review standards across several program offices, including the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Fossil Energy, according to the release.

The agency concluded the shuttered projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” according to the release.

Recipients have 30 days to appeal the termination decisions.

The policy shift piles on more uncertainty for contractors engaged in federally supported clean energy work. For example, in April, the Trump administration ordered construction halted on Equinor’s 810-MW Empire Wind 1 project offshore New York. The stoppage cost an estimated $50 million per week before the order was lifted in early October.

Similarly, Ørsted’s 700-megawatt Revolution Wind project in offshore Rhode Island secured a court injunction in September to restart work after a separate stop-work order.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/n90UBVtt7AiJLnXoMo0jA1dGm1dw3Doua4jIcA6cPjU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjIzODM0NjYwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-08 12:06:23.365802

From the 1920s until the 1990s, the Electruck was the only production electric vehicle that could be purchased (albeit commercially) from a mainstream automaker in America.","Electric automobiles have existed since the late 1800s, and while they had a flash of market share back in the early days of the automobile, it hasn’t been until the last 15 years that the technology has really taken off. But tracing the roots of the first modern, practical, or mainstream EV is difficult, especially when most of the qualifiers are subjective.

Some benchmarks, like the 2012 Nissan Leaf, 2008 Tesla Roadster, and the 1997 General Motors EV1 are obvious. However, the history of modern EVs can be traced back even further. Arguably, the first modern, production EV from a major automaker was the 1974 AM General DJ-5E Electruck.

An obscure battery-powered postal Jeep may seem like an unlikely starting point for the EV revolution, but in many ways it is a forgotten milestone.

Smoggy History

While gasoline was still relatively cheap in the 1960s, air pollution had become a major problem in large U.S. cities. In response, the federal government passed the Clean Air Act and several other laws which included a small amount of funding for automakers to research electric vehicles. In response, GM developed the battery-powered Electrovair I & II concepts, plus the hydrogen fuel-cell-powered Electrovan concept. Ford made advances with sodium sulfur batteries, but wouldn’t put them in a vehicle until the 1990s.

American Motors Corporation joined the program with the development of the Amitron, a two-seater city car concept that claimed an impressive 150 miles of range per charge. The proposed powertrain used a clever dual-chemistry battery system, where two smaller nickel-cadmium batteries provided rapid on-demand power for acceleration and larger but slower-discharging lithium batteries provided the energy for sustained long-range cruising.

The Amitron was also supposed to have regenerative braking, a revolutionary idea for a passenger EV in the 1960s. Although the technology had existed on some electric cars in the early 1900s, it had to be articulated manually through separate controls in combination with friction brakes. The Amitron would be the first EV that automatically transitioned from regenerative braking to friction brakes with just one brake pedal.

However, reports from the time indicate that the Amitron did not actually have a motor or battery when it first appeared at auto shows in 1967. Supposedly, AMC planned to road test the battery technology in a Rambler American prototype the following year, but whether the powertrain was ever installed in the Amitron remains unclear.

Despite newly appointed CEO Roy Chapin’s optimistic platitudes about the technology and VP of Styling Richard Teague’s jokes of a future EV called “the Voltswagon,” the Amitron never got past the concept stage. Like Ford and GM, AMC soon admitted that EVs were still too expensive and impractical, even with new battery technologies. But while Ford and GM abandoned their EV efforts, American Motors would get a second chance.

(Not So) Speedy Delivery

In 1969, AMC purchased Jeep Corporation from Kaiser Industries, which included a division for government vehicle production. Renamed AM General in 1971, the division manufactured everything from tactical five-ton trucks to urban transit buses to postal delivery Jeeps.

Around that time, the United States Postal Service began testing electric delivery vehicles from various manufacturers across the country. In Cupertino, California, which was plagued by air pollution and smog, the regional Post Office eventually purchased 30 battery-powered vehicles from Harbilt Electric Trucks, an English manufacturer that specialized in milk delivery vans. While usage was limited to dense, low-mileage, urban routes on relatively flat terrain, the results were positive. Along with being cleaner, the EVs were also cheaper to operate than the gasoline-powered Jeep DJ-5s already in use, as a 1978 U.S. Department of Energy report later highlighted:

“Performance of the Harbilt vehicles has been outstanding from both a reliability and cost standpoint as indicated by… operating and maintenance costs of $0.085 per vehicle mile versus $0.120 per vehicle mile for the ICE Jeeps.”

While the Harbilt test was motivated primarily by reducing air pollution, the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo provided a second, equally urgent reason to pursue electric vehicles. Following the success of the Harbilts, the Postal Service opened bids in 1974 for an additional 352 electric delivery vehicles for use in select markets. Requirements were:

Minimal ground-level pollutants

Low noise level

Low energy cost

Low maintenance cost

20-mile range

33-mph top speed

30 mph in 20 seconds acceleration

300 stops and starts per charge

Ability to climb a 10% grade at 10 mph

Four-year battery life

Right-hand drive

Sliding side doors

Easy mount/dismount

Steering and handling comparable to present gasoline vehicles

Acceleration and braking close to that of the existing fleet

Safety engineering to meet DOT standards

Necessary accessories (lights, defroster, gauges, etc.)

With thousands of gasoline vehicles already in service that were already DOT-approved and met the right-hand-drive and sliding door requirements, AM General partnered with electronics manufacturer Gould Industries to build an electrified version of the DJ-5. Competing against Otis (the elevator company) and Electromotion (a startup that used a lot of SAAB parts), AM General won the contract with the lowest bid. Appropriately, the new vehicle would be called the DJ-5E Electruck.

The Electruck would be assembled at AM General’s plant in South Bend, Indiana (which had formerly belonged to Studebaker’s defense group before Kaiser Jeep acquired it). The body and chassis were mostly unchanged from the conventional DJ-5, but Gould would supply the entire propulsion system, including the motor, batteries, controller, and chargers. Ironically, the vehicles wouldn’t be 100% electric, as a small gasoline heater was necessary to heat the cabin and defog the windows.

Like the Amitron, the DJ-5E would have regenerative braking, making it the first production EV since the early 1900s to have this feature. Unlike the Amitron, the DJ-5E would use lead-acid batteries, which were a proven technology and far cheaper than either nickel-cadmium or lithium batteries. Unfortunately, they were also considerably heavier and less energy-dense.

Outputting 54 volts, the battery pack contained 27 cells and weighed approximately 1,300 pounds. Total storage was listed as 330 amp-hours, which equaled 17.82 kWh–or roughly one-quarter the size of the battery in a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV. All told, the DJ-5E’s curb weight was a hefty 3,618 lbs, about 1,200 lbs more than the gasoline-powered DJ-5C.

Propulsion came from a 20-horsepower DC electric motor that itself weighed 263 lbs. Mounted almost dead-center in the frame, it connected directly to the rear differential with no transmission. The motor also functioned as a generator during regenerative braking, but unlike modern EVs, the system was activated only by the brake pedal, not by lifting off the accelerator. Connected to a speed sensor, it worked only above 15 mph before transitioning to friction brakes.

Like all other DJs, the 5E was rear-wheel-drive only (despite being a Jeep). Charging hardware was optional, with an onboard 120-volt unit adding 90 lbs, or an exterior 240/480-volt unit available in a weatherproof cabinet. Depending on voltage, charging times ranged from 10 to 15 hours.

Performance could best be described as “middling.” The low horsepower and high weight yielded a glacial zero-to-30 mph time of 20 seconds and a maximum speed of 33 to 40mph. The primary range estimate, based on a 300 stop/start drive cycle from the Postal Service, resulted in an estimated 29 miles from 100% to 20% charge. When driven at a constant speed, range estimates were as high as 60 miles at 20 mph, falling to just 32 miles at 35mph. Unimpressive though the figures may have been, they met or exceeded all of the Postal Service’s requirements.

Going Postal

A pilot model of the DJ-5E was delivered to the USPS on September 4th, 1974, and it passed all its tests. Official production deliveries began in May 1975 and continued until March 1976, with a total of 352 DJ-5Es being delivered to the Postal Service. The majority went to the smog-plagued cities of San Bernardino, Torrance, and Gardena, California, while additional Electrucks were sent to Evansville, Indiana, Charleston, South Carolina, Falls Church, Virginia, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut. As of May 1977, 310 were put into service, with 33 as spares and nine used for training programs.

In March of 1977, the Postal Service supplied an Electruck to NASA for performance testing. NASA had been hired by the Energy Research and Development Administration (a precursor to the United States Department of Energy) to compile a report on electric and hybrid vehicles. The DJ-5E came remarkably close to AM General’s estimated figures for range and acceleration, although NASA did conclude that the 15-mph speed threshold of the regenerative braking system prevented it from adding any meaningful amount of energy back during low-speed stop-and-go driving (which I’d argue kind of defeated its whole purpose). The report also mentioned difficulty starting from a standstill on hills, due to the brake pedal cutting all power to the motor, requiring drivers to use the emergency brake as a hill holder to prevent coasting backwards.

As for the Postal Service, responses to the DJ-5E were…mixed. From the beginning, there were problems, as the 1978 D.O.E. report explained,

“Unfortunately, the performance capabilities of the Harbilt resulted in some routes being accepted for DJ-5E assignments with requirements in excess of the performance specifications used by the U.S.P.S. for procurement of the DJ-5E. These routes were later identified as being responsible for some vehicle failures due to overstressing the assigned vehicles.”

In colder test climates, DJ-5Es struggled to complete routes as short as five miles, having to be replaced with internal combustion vehicles until the weather warmed up. While the California fleets fared better, the Jeeps were still more problem-prone compared to their English counterparts:

“DJ-5Es have experienced a very high failure rate relative to the Harbilt vehicles… about 7 failures per vehicle per year. This contrasts with the less than one failure per vehicle per year indicated by the Cupertino records for the Harbilts…

A table breaks down the cause of failures, which were overwhelmingly due to the powertrain. Motor controllers were especially troublesome, requiring 639 repairs by April of 1977, most of which were performed by Gould Industries under warranty. Unfortunately, by the time Gould developed a more reliable replacement, another problem had popped up:

“Recently the DJ-5Es have been experiencing an excessive number of battery failures… warranty repair records… show a total of 143 battery replacements in 1976, which means a battery replacement rate of almost one per operating vehicle per year, or an average life of about 3,000 vehicle miles. The batteries carry a 4-yr warranty, which implies that Gould expected to achieve a life of at least 1,200 cycles.”

As it stood, batteries on average lasted only 300 charge/recharge cycles before they failed, or only about a third of the life Gould was expecting. Luckily for the postal service, the batteries were all replaced under warranty, which must’ve cost Gould a fortune. Despite all this, the report claims the Electrucks weren’t a total disaster:

Despite the excessive number of failures experienced with the U.S.P.S. DJ-5Es, the availability of the vehicles to perform scheduled duties has been fairly good. This can be attributed primarily to the excellent support provided by Gould to minimize downtime and reduce failure rates. The U.S.P.S. reports the percentage availability–the percentage of days vehicles successfully complete their assigned routes–as 97% for the DJ-5E fleet through 1976.

But as battery failures increased with age, so did downtime, causing the Postal Service to substitute more gasoline vehicles. Even with Gould and AM General footing the bill for most of the repairs under warranty, higher-than-expected maintenance costs ended up making the DJ-5Es more expensive on average to operate than their gasoline counterparts, and that didn’t even include the nearly double initial purchase price over ICE Jeeps.

It was likely for these reasons that the Postal Service didn’t order any more DJ-5Es after its initial 352 units, although AM General managed to convince Canada Post to purchase five of them and Bell Telephone to order 10 as maintenance vehicles. By 1983, the USPS retired most of its DJ-5Es, just one year after the Cupertino Post Office gave up its fleet of beloved Harbilts.

Return to Sender

Ironically, AMC trotted out the old Amitron concept again in 1977, this time with a fresh coat of paint and the new name: Electron. It was part of Concept 80, a traveling exhibit designed to get the press and the banks to have more faith in AMC’s ability to build modern, economical cars. Looking through the video archives at the Kenosha History Center, I thought I spotted a DJ-5E in the background of the show, too.

But aside from a print brochure, a service parts catalog, and a single paragraph in AMC’s 1974 shareholders’ report, I haven’t been able to find much more official information from American Motors on the DJ-5E. I guess 367 electric Jeeps weren’t a big priority when the company was struggling just to make payroll in the late 70s.

That 1978 DOE report includes data on several other EVs available at the time, all of which had major drawbacks compared to gasoline vehicles. With low ranges but high price tags, the technology simply wasn’t there to make practical electric cars. Yet, we had to start somewhere.

When I look at the DJ-5E, I see more than just a goofy, impractical mail truck; I see a milestone in the slow but determined evolution of electric vehicles. Unlike the Electrovair, or even the Amitron, this wasn’t just a headline-grabbing one-off prototype never intended for sale. And while other third-party companies throughout the ’70s and ’80s built EV conversions of existing cars (including AMC models) or designed and built low-volume models, AMC was the only major automaker to actually build its own.

From the 1920s until the 1990s, the Electruck was the only production electric vehicle that could be purchased (albeit commercially) from a mainstream automaker in America. Although its production was very limited, it pioneered features that we now take for granted in modern EVs, like regenerative braking, a silicon-based controller, and a separate 12-volt accessory battery. That’s pretty innovative stuff, and it wasn’t GM or Ford who figured it out; it was little AMC.

In light of that, I think the AM General DJ-5E deserves to be up there with the Tesla Roadster, the GM EV1, and the other milestones of EV history. And while EVs still have a ways to go until they’re as popular as gasoline cars, it looks like the Postal Service is going to give EVs another try. Hopefully, it will work out better this time around. If any of those postal workers from the 1970s are still on the job, I think they would be pretty impressed to see how far we’ve come since the days of the Electruck.",https://media.hagerty.com/media/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electruck-Lead-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:11:57.174528

Third Circuit Rules Pennsylvania Commission’s Transmission Siting Decision Preempted by Federal Law

In a September 5, 2025 decision, a unanimous three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order denying Transource Pennsylvania’s application to build transmission lines in Pennsylvania was invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The specific project is meant to relieve congestion along the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, and is projected to lower costs in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. However, it is also forecasted to increase costs in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Commission decided there is not a need for the project, and in doing so it rejected PJM’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-approved cost-benefit analysis. The Third Circuit concluded the Pennsylvania Commission’s decision frustrated FERC’s objectives. It found that regional planning was one tool FERC had developed to support competition and held that “[w]hen an RTO has selected a project for inclusion in a regional transmission plan as part of its federal mandate, a state regulator cannot, consistent with the Supremacy Clause, reject the project based on a lack of ‘need.’” The district court had also found that the Pennsylvania order violated the dormant commerce clause, but the Third Circuit did not reach that issue.

D.C. Circuit Upholds FERC Decision on Solar-Plus-Battery Project in Post-Chevron PURPA Case

On September 9, 2025, in a 2-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld FERC’s certification of the Broadview solar power facility as a “small power production facility” under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The court had upheld FERC’s decision in 2023, but the United States Supreme Court remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit following the decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), overruling Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The Broadview facility will be capable of generating up to 160 MW and has a 50 MW battery, but the facility’s inverters can only send 80 MW to the grid. The question before the court was whether Broadview will violate the 80 MW power production capacity ceiling for a “facility” set forth in 16 U.S.C. § 796(17)(A). Earlier, the court had deferred to FERC in resolving the issue, but on remand the court concluded for itself that the “power production capacity” of a “facility” is the amount of power it can send to the grid. The D.C. Circuit held this reading of the statute best accounts for the facility as a whole and not just the maximum capacity of the solar production array, which the court characterized as just one component of the facility.

Xcel Energy and Telecommunications Defendants Settle Marshall Fire Litigation

On September 24, 2025, one day before trial was scheduled to begin in Boulder County District Court in Boulder, Colorado, Xcel Energy, Qwest Corporation, and Teleport Communications America announced an approximately $640 million settlement in principle to resolve claims brought by individual plaintiffs, subrogation insurers, and public entities related to the 2021 Marshall Fire. In its statement, Xcel Energy said that approximately $350 million of the settlement would be funded by its remaining insurance coverage and none from its customers. Xcel Energy did not admit any fault, wrongdoing, or negligence, consistent with its position throughout the litigation. Plaintiffs had sought billions in damages.

Pennsylvania Supreme Court Allows Utility to Keep Competitors Add-Ons off Utility Bills

On September 25, 2025, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that FirstEnergy does not have to provide “on-bill billing” to third parties offering non-utility goods and services, such as tree trimming services and smart thermostats, even though it will include such amounts when customers purchase such goods and services from FirstEnergy itself. Under Pennsylvania law, FirstEnergy and other Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) do have to provide on-bill billing when customers choose to purchase power generated by a different utility operating as an electric generation supplier (EGS), but the court concluded that the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania’s Competition Act do not apply to non-commodity goods and services.

Trump Administration Cancels Awards to Clean Energy Projects in Blue States

In a press release issued on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects. DOE stated that the projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on the investment of taxpayer dollars. DOE did not provide a list of the projects in question in its press release, but reports indicate they include a Minnesota Power direct current upgrade project and Xcel Energy long-duration energy storage projects. The projects are clean energy projects and are located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, Democratic leaning states.

Texas Commission Approves Two Entergy Gas-Fueled Plants with $2.4 Billion Hard Cap

On September 11, 2025, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for Entergy’s proposed gas-fueled 754-MW Legend Power Station and 453-MW Lone Star Power Station. Legend is a combined cycle facility that would be carbon capture-enabled and have a hydrogen-capable turbine, and Lone Star is a combustion turbine facility with a hydrogen capable turbine. In remarks at hearing and a Commissioner Memorandum, Chairman Thomas Gleeson agreed Entergy needs to address projected capacity shortfalls but advocated for a hard cap on costs in light of concerns that the utility had not taken sufficient steps to ensure the projects will be cost effective. Notably, Entergy had not issued a request for proposals to determine what projects to pursue. The Commission set a $1.6 billion hard cap for the Legend project and a $799 million hard cap for the Lone Star project.

Nevada Commission Institutes Daily Demand Charge for Nevada Power and 15-Minute Interval Net Metering for Sierra Pacific Power

In a September 16, 2025 Order, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) resolved the contested issues in rate cases brought by Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company, both of which do business as NV Energy. Importantly, the PUCN established a new daily demand charge for all Nevada Power residential and small business customers to be implemented beginning April 2026, which will be calculated based on the maximum amount a customer uses each day with the daily charges summed up monthly. The new charge is designed to address what the PUCN said was “under-recovery of costs” from customers with solar generation participating in a statutorily required net-metering program. PUCN also established 15-minute interval net metering, rather than monthly net metering, for new net metering customers in Sierra’s service territory to address the same issue.

Framework for New Proactive Grid Planning Process Adopted in New York

On September 18, 2025, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) adopted a Proactive Planning Framework designed to establish a statewide unified process to study and identify necessary system upgrades to support building electrification and transportation electrification. In contrast to New York’s Coordinated Grid Planning Process, which is focused on higher-voltage infrastructure, the new process is to use bottom-up modeling to identify upgrades to distribution and local network systems for NYPSC consideration. The first step under the framework is for utilities to file plans outlining data needs and assumptions needed to develop granular load forecasts.

Washington Commission Adopts Rules for Combined Gas and Electric Integrated System Plans

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission issued rules on September 26, 2025 for combined gas and electric Integrated System Plans that Puget Sound Energy, the state’s only large gas and electric utility, will have to begin filing in 2027. The rules include specific plan requirements, including a cost test to be used for emission-reduction measures. The combined planning process was mandated by the Washington Legislature in the Large Combination Utilities Decarbonization Act, which was enacted in 2023. A voter-approved initiative, Initiative 2066, would have required significant changes to the rules and the underlying statute in ways that would continue access to and use of natural gas, but it was found unconstitutional by a district court earlier this year. The Washington Supreme Court granted review of that decision on September 3, 2025.

FERC Issues Direct Final Rule to Sunset 53 Existing Regulations

On October 1, 2025, the FERC approved a direct final rule to incorporate a conditional phaseout date into 53 existing regulations. FERC stated that the rules chosen for sunsetting are “outdated, seldomly used, or duplicative regulations.” Some regulations are outdated because their governing regulations or statutes have been amended or repealed. Other regulations concern filing protocols that are not used by FERC anymore. The rule will be effective 45 days after being published in the Federal Register and the conditional sunset dates incorporated into the existing rules are one year after the effective date. FERC explained that the one-year period provides an opportunity to comment on the costs and benefits of the regulations in question prior to the sunset date. FERC also stated that if it receives significant adverse comments on any part of the direct final rule by 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register, it will withdraw such part of the rule and address it in a separate rulemaking. FERC’s action was taken in response to Executive Order 14270, “Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

AUSTIN, Texas, October 08, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Base Power announced today it has raised $1 billion in Series C financing, led by Addition. All other major investors are re-investing, including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New major investors include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

Power is the foundation of day-to-day life, yet America’s aging grid is strained, unreliable, and increasingly vulnerable. Base is a first-of-its-kind energy company powering America with reliable and affordable electricity. Base delivers for homeowners and for the grid through a network of distributed storage technology.

""The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,"" said Zach Dell, CEO and co-founder of Base Power. ""The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.""

In less than two years, Base has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity. That pace makes it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the U.S., driven by organic growth, partnerships with leading homebuilders like Lennar and with forward-thinking utilities. The company has also rapidly expanded operations, now serving homeowners across the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Greater Houston, and the Austin region, with plans to expand nationally in the near future.

To meet current and future demand, Base is building its first energy storage and power electronics factory at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press in the heart of downtown Austin.

Base recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the grid. This participation strengthens reliability statewide and generates additional revenue from the grid, helping Base lower costs for homeowners while proving how distributed assets can operate at utility scale.

""We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,"" said Justin Lopas, COO and co-founder of Base Power. ""The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves.

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy – heat from the Earth itself – has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted US$1.7 billion in public funding – compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs.

Why geothermal energy is unique

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of geothermal energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just 6 or8 feet down (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient thanair-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable powerin Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere.

And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/istock-2192345122.eLPq14x7xl.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-08 09:57:48.204177

Many of these companies, which have avoided the US market due to high tariffs, offer electric vehicles that are cheaper than Tesla's Standard models.","Tesla's ""most affordable"" EVs are finally here — but how cheap are they really?

The electric carmaker's shares fell on Tuesday after the launch of new stripped-back versions of Tesla's best-selling Model Y and 3.

The new Model Y and Model 3 Standard cost $39,990 and $36,990, around $5,000 less than Tesla's flagship models, but come without Autosteer, rear screens, leather seats, and radios.

Despite this, the new variants will cost you around $2,000 more than the classic Model 3 and Y would have done before the expiry of the $7,500 federal tax credit for a new electric car, which ended on September 30.

Wannabe Tesla owners can still access EV subsidies in states like New York and Colorado, but many customers now face the prospect of paying more than they would have just over a week ago for a car with fewer features.

The Model Y and 3 Standard are also more expensive than the cheapest EVs on the market. The Nissan Leaf starts at $29,990 in the US, while Tesla's Detroit rival General Motors sells the electric Chevy Equinox from $35,100.

Tesla's affordable models are also a long way from the $25,000 price tag that has often been held up as a benchmark for electric vehicle adoption.

Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup Slate is targeting a price point in the mid-$20,000s with its buzzy electric truck, while GM and Ford have both said they will ship electric cars that cost $30,000 or less in the coming years.

Elon Musk floated the idea of a $25,000 Tesla as early as 2020, saying the vehicle had ""always been our dream."" But the company has backed away from plans to build a radically low-cost vehicle in recent years.

Last April, Reuters reported that Tesla had scrapped a proposed affordable model, code-named NV91. In October 2024, Musk told investors that the rise of autonomous vehicles meant it would be ""pointless"" for the company to build a non-robotaxi $25,000 car.

The Model Y and 3 Standard, which Tesla first teased in April 2024, are built on the automaker's existing production lines.

Tesla reported record quarterly sales last week, but the EV giant still faces an uphill struggle to beat last year's total as it battles fierce competition from upstart Chinese automakers, which are expanding around the globe.

Many of these companies, which have avoided the US market due to high tariffs, offer electric vehicles that are cheaper than Tesla's Standard models.

The Xiaomi YU7, a Model Y competitor and monster sales hit, starts at 253,500 yuan ($35,600) in China, while BYD offers its Seagull hatchback for as little as $25,000 in some European markets.

For Tesla fans disappointed by the price tags on the new models, there is another way of getting a $25,000 Tesla.

Used Tesla prices have plummeted over the past year, with the average cost of a pre-owned Model 3 falling to just over $25,000 in July, per data from iSeeCars.

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said, opening National Clean Energy Week last month.
The reason for the trend, she explained, is the enormous opportunity in the clean energy market: “The federal opportunity on the clean energy side may be diminished right now, but the market opportunity is massive.
U.S. Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH-8) noted that global electricity demand is surging due to the growing use of data centers.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) reflected on the importance of state support for clean energy.
As Sen. Murkowski said, “Americans, including Republicans, broadly support clean energy.” Both parties have changed their tune over the years, according to Sen. Curtis.","“I can remember a time when energy wasn’t necessarily political,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said, opening National Clean Energy Week last month. “The reality that we’re facing right now is this is not necessarily the happiest year on record for clean energy. You’ve got some headwinds that you’re facing,” she reflected on the uncertainty facing the industry.

And yet, Sen. Murkowski expressed optimism and pointed out reasons for hope: “What I’m here to assure you is that it will get better. It will get better. And the reason I’m so confident of that is just looking at at the fundamentals, the cold, hard facts of new industries that are emerging to create more demand for electricity than ever, ever before; of a strained grid, where reliability can only be protected if we build out more of everything that we have, and we do it as fast as we can; and, rapidly rising electricity prices. The solution to all of this is more power.” Taking resources off the table, whether they be fossil fuels or clean energy, is simply a bad idea, she argued.

Sen. Murkowski pointed to a report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which found that solar accounted for 77.7% of the capacity added to the grid; when combined with wind, renewables accounted for nearly 96% of the new sources of generation in 2025. The reason for the trend, she explained, is the enormous opportunity in the clean energy market: “The federal opportunity on the clean energy side may be diminished right now, but the market opportunity is massive. Even with less federal support, what clean energy can tap into is virtually unparalleled.”

Sen. Murkowski was not the only legislator to advocate for an all-of-the-above approach at NCEW. U.S. Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) explained, “We’re now in a world where we need every electron we can get, and we’re not quite sure where we’re going to get all of our electrons and where they’re going to come from.” That was why it was so easy for him to support clean energy credits during the budget reconciliation process, he remembered. U.S. Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH-8) noted that global electricity demand is surging due to the growing use of data centers. He said that Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) have all told him, “We’ve got to have more power,” and “We cannot take any generation offline that we have right now.” He reflected on the country’s trajectory, starting in 2008 when House Republicans promoted an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy to reduce reliance on foreign oil and gas, which ultimately led the country to become the world’s number one natural gas producer. He summarized, “We have great things that can happen in this country. So, it’s using everything we have at our disposal so we make sure we’re on top.”

U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA-01) added that his state’s energy needs have resulted in a diverse energy mix: “Because Georgia has been the number one state in which to do business for eleven years in a row, we need every electron we can get, and that’s why I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy.” He shared estimates that in the next decade, the state will need about 9,500 more megawatts (MW) of power, or two more Plant Vogtles, which is already the country’s largest supplier of clean energy. Tapping into clean, reliable energy is the state’s solution to prepare for the future and remain a top business hub.

U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX-33) noted that there is room for a state like Texas, which is known for its oil and gas, to lead in other energy forms, as well: “I’m very proud to be a Texan, because I think that we probably do all-of-the-above better than anyone else.” For example, the state is a dominant player in the wind industry and a leader in solar energy. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) reflected on the importance of state support for clean energy. She said that she loves being from the Commonwealth of Virginia “because I’ve got a great governor who is also on board with this all-of-the-above energy approach, and he’s really set the stage for us and allowed us really a safe space to be all-of-the-above energy champions, from nuclear small modular reactors… to geothermal and traditional forms of energy.”

As for the role of the federal government, U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI-07) discussed the importance of Congressional support for clean energy: “As we continue our work in Washington, we must remain laser-focused on strengthening the energy capacity of our country by promoting an all of above energy approach and unleashing American energy production.” At the same time, U.S. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV-03) said that the government should allow the free market to play out: “We need to make sure we’re doing everything to not pick winners or leave losers. It shouldn’t be Washington that is making these decisions on what investments should be made. It should be investors.”

U.S. Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA-50) concurred that as a country, we should move beyond relying solely on oil and gas and “truly invest in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that looks to the future instead of clinging to the past.” The country should “invest in all forms of energy, build transmission, get out of our own way, and honor the rights and expectations of our private investor partners,” he detailed. U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ-06) simplified, “We have to be supporting every form out there.”

Multiple leaders pointed out that clean energy has broad bipartisan support. Rep. Ciscomani stated that his district is one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, and one-third Independent, and “I call it a district where good ideas win, and this is what we’re working on here is one of those good ideas.” He advocated for Congressional Republicans to step up and lead on these issues by working with both public and private partners. As Sen. Murkowski said, “Americans, including Republicans, broadly support clean energy.”

Both parties have changed their tune over the years, according to Sen. Curtis. He reminisced on a time when Democrats did not want to admit that the country needed nuclear power, and Republicans did not want to discuss climate. Now, he pointed out, “I think there’s about 85 in the House Republicans that are pretty comfortable talking about climate.”

Rep. Walberg used his state as a specific example of what can happen when there is bipartisan collaboration. After the 2022 closure of the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan caused an adverse economic impact of more than $250 million, “a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders came together to request the funding necessary to reopen the plant, and the Trump administration continues to pave the way for the plant’s awaited restart.” It will generate more than 800 MW of energy, enough to power approximately 800,000 homes, and create 600 jobs in the area.

Rep. Lee concurred, “I think we have to remember that there are members of Congress who are committed to working across the aisle, and that it doesn’t matter if you represent a blue state or a red state, a rural community or an urban community – we all understand our needs, and it’s going to require all of us to put the hatchets down a little bit and work together.” Sen. Curtis summarized, “We need to figure out how to keep the politics out of it.”

U.S. Sen. Murkowski concluded that the incredible demand for energy should cause all of us, across the aisle, to stretch our imaginations as to what is next: “What’s next that’s going to allow us to meet this in a manner that is head-on, demonstrating our resolve, demonstrating our ingenuity in these spaces that we have long led on? And we will continue to lead in all forms of energy, whether they are what we know today or what will be coming tomorrow.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/548225642_1353175589503893_8662140847904679327_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 09:57:52.123647

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

America’s national parks, national monuments, and wild public lands don’t deserve this fate and we’ll work tirelessly to stop it from happening,” Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a news release.
There are also parcels on the east side of Zion National Park, including a portion of the North Fork of the Virgin River and North Fork Road, the analysis says.
“Coal mines near Zion, Bryce Canyon or Capitol Reef?
It was decided decades ago that these lands would be off the table,” Cory MacNulty, Southwest campaign director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement.","An initiative of Congress’ spending package known as the “big, beautiful bill” started becoming a reality last week, leaving environmentalists with deep concerns about the future landscape of national parks.

The map of 13.1 million acres of federal land now available for coal leasing triples the benchmark set by the law and includes parcels near or directly adjacent to landmarks like Zion, Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef national parks, an analysis from groups including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance found.

“The Trump Administration views Southern Utah’s remarkable redrock country as just another place to exploit and plunder as they promote new coal mining. Nothing could be further from the truth. America’s national parks, national monuments, and wild public lands don’t deserve this fate and we’ll work tirelessly to stop it from happening,” Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a news release.

About 48,000 acres of federally-owned land in Utah are available for coal-mining operations, a big step in the Trump administration’s plan to increase energy production in the country, particularly fossil fuels.

According to the analysis, an almost 12,000-acre parcel available for coal leases is directly adjacent to the west side of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and south of Bryce Canyon.

Mining in the area could affect the water that feeds tributaries of the Paria River, Jacqualine Grant, executive director of Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners, said in a statement.

There are also parcels on the east side of Zion National Park, including a portion of the North Fork of the Virgin River and North Fork Road, the analysis says. Public land bordering scenic roads like state Highway 89, also known as Utah Heritage Highway, and the Mount Carmel Scenic Byway would also be available for lease in the area.

East of Capitol Reef National Park, the Bureau of Land Management is also offering an approximately 2,000-acre piece of land for leases, the environmentalists said.

“Coal mines near Zion, Bryce Canyon or Capitol Reef? It’s absurd. It was decided decades ago that these lands would be off the table,” Cory MacNulty, Southwest campaign director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. “Dirty energy development has no place near our national parks, especially as iconic landscapes across the Southwest are already at risk of having hazy skies, polluted water, and a degraded visitor experience from nearby drilling and mining.”

The Department of the Interior, however, argues that opening the land for lease, along with lowering royalty rates to 7%, will help strengthen supply chains and the country’s energy security.

“President Trump promised to put American energy workers first, and today we’re delivering,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a news release. “By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing, and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security, and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs.”

Lease sales are already happening across the country, according to the release. Together, they add hundreds of millions of tons of coal.

The agency is also spearheading efforts to recover minerals like uranium, zinc, germanium, tellurium and rare earth elements from mine waste and abandoned sites.

As stipulated within the Fremont PPA, UAMPS will pay a fixed price of US$13.6/kW-month with no escalation for battery storage capacity.
When combined with the solar energy price of US$35.45/MWh, UAMPS expects the hybrid Fremont facility to cost between approximately US$69/MWh and US$74/MWh.
This includes NEER, who in August received approval to develop a 200MWh project in Salt Lake City, dubbed Dominguez Energy Storage.","Located near Cedar City in Iron County, the project will pair a 99MWac solar farm with a 49.5MW/198MWh battery energy storage system.

The Fremont development was selected by UAMPS as part of its 2024 resource procurement plan, which will purchase all energy and related project products, including renewable energy credits (RECs) and capacity rights. Acting as the scheduling coordinator, UAMPS will have exclusive rights to dispatch the BESS.

UAMPS negotiated the agreement with Longroad on behalf of its 50 members, who must now all individually approve the PPA in order for it to become effective.

Although the guaranteed delivery date of the project is June 30, 2028, commercial operations are expected by December 31, 2027.

Under the terms of the agreement, Longroad will be fined US$21,970/day if it’s unable to deliver the BESS before this guaranteed date.

Tariff related adjustments

With the ongoing uncertainty surrounding import tariffs, offtake agreements in the US are increasingly including future tariff-related pricing adjustments as standard.

Energy-Storage.news has reported on the signing of several new offtake agreements over the past six months, with each featuring provisions whereby developers can increase the contract price if they can prove costs have been impacted by import tariffs.

This recent reporting includes agreements between NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) and Orange County Power Authority, alongside EDP Renewables and Ava Community Energy.

Utilities Director at Northern California Power Agency (NCPA), Alan Kurotori, revealed during a recent Board of Directors meeting that developers are “really insisting” that these provisions be added to offtake agreements.

As stipulated within the Fremont PPA, UAMPS will pay a fixed price of US$13.6/kW-month with no escalation for battery storage capacity.

However, if a third-party evaluation demonstrates that project costs were impacted due to import tariffs introduced after January 1 2025, Longroad can amend this price as high as US$14.14/kW-month, representing an increase of up to 4.7%.

When combined with the solar energy price of US$35.45/MWh, UAMPS expects the hybrid Fremont facility to cost between approximately US$69/MWh and US$74/MWh.

Operation Gigawatt

Utah is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with coal and fossil gas having provided a cumulative 77% of the state’s net electricity generation during 2025, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

As for BESS, Utah’s utility-scale energy storage industry is still very much in its infancy, with the State only having a single operational 1MW project as of October 2 2025.

However, things have begun to pick up over the past six months, with some of the US’ most prominent independent power producers (IPPs) having progressed several large BESS projects.

This includes NEER, who in August received approval to develop a 200MWh project in Salt Lake City, dubbed Dominguez Energy Storage.

As recently reported by Energy-Storage.news, rPlusEnergies also secured more than US$500 million in financing for a larger 400MW/1,600MWh hybrid solar and storage BESS project located in Emery County. Construction is currently underway, with the project scheduled to come online sometime next year.

Additionally, Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced plans last year to double the state’s energy capacity over the next ten years, as part of a plan known as “Operation Gigawatt.”

Although the plans remain fairly broad, the Office of Governor Cox last month celebrated the news that technology provider Torus has raised US$200 million in private capital to deploy its proprietary battery storage and flywheel technology in Utah.

“Utah-based companies like Torus are proving what’s possible, deploying new capital to strengthen the grid, improve reliability, and meet America’s growing energy needs,” said Cox.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Longroad_Energy_Sun-Streams-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:11:04.735368

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy – heat from the Earth itself – has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted US$1.7 billion in public funding – compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs.

Why geothermal energy is unique

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of geothermal energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just 6 or 8 feet down (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere.

And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/694654/original/file-20251006-56-n1yweb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C486%2C4804%2C2402&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-08 08:59:01.745418

Rural Texas grapples with pros, cons of data centers",JAYME LOZANO CARVER TEXAS TRIBUNE,,,,,"https://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/article/31485,economic-boom-or-environmental-disaster-rural-texas-grapples-with-pros-cons-of-data-centers","“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.
Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them.
These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development.
The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.
“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers.","Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company cofounded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers” Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water” Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

And in the White House, one senior policy advisor has held high-ranking positions at big oil firms including Shell.
The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuel lobby firm, for comment.
Fossil fuel donors poured $96m into Trump’s 2025 presidential campaign and affiliated action committees, and contributed $11.8m to Trump’s second inauguration.
The current Trump administration has also been completely unabashed about doing the bidding of the oil sector, said Zibel.","Donald Trump has placed dozens of people with ties to the fossil fuel sector in his administration, including more than 40 who have directly worked for oil, gas or coal companies, according to a new analysis.

The report from Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy and ethics non-profit that has been critical of the Trump administration, alongside the Revolving Door Project, a corporate watchdog, analyzed the backgrounds of nominees and appointees within the White House and eight agencies dictating energy, environmental and climate policy. That includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.

The analysis comes as Trump wages broad attacks on climate and energy policies and on renewable energy. The president’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for instance, opened swaths of federal land to drilling and mining and enshrined the rapid phaseout of incentives for renewable energy. The administration has also launched an unprecedented assault on climate science, for instance with an energy department report on climate change that experts derided as full of misinformation. The report was created to justify the planned overturning of a key legal finding that forms the basis of virtually all US climate regulations.

“With the firehose of terrible, bad things that have happened on the environment front … it’s important to remind the public that these aren’t just actions from the amorphous, ginormous thing that is the Trump administration writ large,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, report author and senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project. “It is often specific actors coming from specific moneyed interests that are carrying out this disastrous deregulatory agenda.”

The authors identified 111 employees whom they deemed “fossil fuel insiders and renewable energy opponents”. That includes 43 people who were directly employed by coal, oil or gas companies. Among them are well-known senior officials such as energy secretary Chris Wright, the former CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy.

The list also includes lesser-known administration members. The energy department’s efficiency and renewable energy office – which recently told workers to avoid using terms such as “climate change” and “emissions – for instance, is led by a former fracking executive. And in the White House, one senior policy advisor has held high-ranking positions at big oil firms including Shell.

Another 12 Trump officials, the authors found, have ties to fossil fuel-funded rightwing thinktanks, the report found. Among them: former employees and fellows of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative group that has fought renewable energy and made what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, as well as the anti-environmentalist group Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the fossil fuel moguls the Koch brothers.

A total of 29 other Trump officials are former corporate executives from polluting sectors whose business interests are tied up with fossil fuels, such as chemicals, automaking and mining, the report says. Other officials have ties to utility companies that sell fossil fuels or elected officials who have pushed pro-coal, -oil and -gas policies.

Reached for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “It’s totally pathetic and transparent that The Guardian is regurgitating a press release from a self-described anti-Trump group and calling them a ‘consumer advocacy nonprofit’ in order to attack White House staff.”

Trump has castigated critics of his administration and warned of a crackdown against progressive non-profit organizations.

The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuel lobby firm, for comment.

The researchers found that 32 employees at the Department of the Interior alone have ties to polluting energy, making it the most compromised federal agency. That includes interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota who has long accepted oil funding and been a conduit between fossil fuel industry donors and Donald Trump’s campaign. Burgum himself owns land that he leases to oil company Continental Resources, the report notes. That firm is run by major Trump donor and ally Harold Hamm, whose business interests Burgum has often supported.

Fossil fuel donors poured $96m into Trump’s 2025 presidential campaign and affiliated action committees, and contributed $11.8m to Trump’s second inauguration. Since entering office, his administration has not only enshrined pro-fossil fuel policies and rules, but also crafted tax breaks and tariff carveouts benefitting the industry.

In addition to oil-tied nominees and appointees, the authors identified several Trump administration higher-ups who were appointed or nominated to powerful positions with little or no subject matter expertise.

“These people may not be tied to fossil fuels so directly, but their inexperience is dangerous,” said Alan Zibel, a co-author and the research director at Public Citizen, speaking broadly about the administration’s links to fossil fuels interests. “It’s reasonable to think they will be pushovers, or easy marks, for the oil industry’s agenda.”

Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of general counsel, Sean Donahue, for instance, has scant legal experience, having worked in the first Trump administration EPA for three years, then briefly for a regional law firm in Buffalo, New York, and then for a solar energy company.

“He has never tried a case to verdict, never taken a deposition, never signed a pleading and never argued a motion,” said the senator Sheldon Whitehouse in May.

Asked for comment about Donahue by the publication Inside Climate News in April, Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokesperson, defended his nomination. ​​“President Trump made a fantastic choice in selecting Sean to lead EPA’s Office of General Counsel,” she said. “His years of public service to the American people at the federal and state government level is a boon to the agency.”

In another example, one White House aide working on energy policy, Jarrod Agen, came to the role after working for Mike Pence, the former vice-president, and defense company Lockheed Martin. Agen does not appear to have direct energy industry or policy experience, the report says.

In her statement, Kelly of the White House said: “Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, and Jarrod Agen are all exceptionally qualified to deliver on the American people’s mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash our nation’s energy potential – which is what President Trump was overwhelmingly elected to implement, even if The Guardian doesn’t like it.”

Trump oversaw a massive slew of anti-environmental actions during his first term. During his second term, equipped with rightwing plans like the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, he has overseen a far broader and harsher crackdown on climate rules and renewable energy.

The current Trump administration has also been completely unabashed about doing the bidding of the oil sector, said Zibel.

“There’s no shame,” he said. “They are proud and willing to go out there and tout the fact that they are doing favors for the oil and gas industry, mining industry, the coal industry.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59bcba0dfd45a884c0d418382fab45eb9831428/373_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f30af528cc495a48f2233b2f81a35af0",N,,2025-10-08 08:59:06.865965

Power and climate policy analyst Shankar Sharma has written a strongly worded letter to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), questioning India’s environmental credibility ahead of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress scheduled to be held in Abu Dhabi from October 9–15.

Referring to a recent Down to Earth report announcing the unveiling of India’s first Red List of Endangered Species at the global forum, Sharma said the move “rings hollow” when juxtaposed with the country’s continuing clearance of projects in ecologically fragile regions.

“Whether the successive governments in our country have made honest and diligent efforts to conserve critical elements of nature in the last 50-55 years is the question haunting environmentalists,” Sharma wrote. “If not, what is the purpose of unveiling India’s Red List at an international event?”

Citing data from the ministry’s own Parivesh portal, he noted that the MoEF&CC had approved 87% of proposals for environment clearance between 2014 and 2020, including over 270 projects in and around protected areas and biodiversity hotspots. “If this rate of environmental clearance is to continue, the country is likely to lose most of its original forests of enormous ecological significance within a few decades,” he warned.

Sharma pointed to findings from an IIT Kharagpur study that revealed a steady decline in India’s forest health despite claims of increased green cover. Only 16% of forests, the study found, retain high strength and resilience — a statistic Sharma said should “alarm any responsible government.”

He also cited the Forest Survey of India’s 2023 report, which showed that more than 46,000 sq km of forest became non-forest land over the past decade, and that the forest cover of eight mountain states had declined in just two years. “The destruction of forest wealth in ecologically sensitive areas clearly establishes the true health of our forests, which are the abode of wildlife,” he said.

The analyst’s letter draws special attention to the controversial 2,000 MW pumped storage project (PSP) proposed in the Sharavati Lion-Tailed Macaque (LTM) Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka — a project that has sparked massive public protests and opposition from scientists, conservationists, and even political leaders across parties.

“Even in 2025, the National Board for Wildlife is considering a ghastly project proposal to divert about 400 acres of thick tropical rainforest lands within and around the Sharavati LTM Sanctuary,” Sharma wrote. “There are many benign and better alternatives.”

He highlighted that the sanctuary zone harbours at least 77 species listed in the IUCN Red List, including endangered lion-tailed macaques, and cited multiple scientific objections raised by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and retired forest officials.

In his earlier submission to the Ministry and expert committees, Sharma reported that public hearings in September 2025 saw massive and unanimous opposition to the Sharavati project, with more than 10,000 people attending and not a single voice in support. Political figures including former BJP MLA Haratalu Halappa, JD(U) leader Mahima J. Patel, and a state cabinet minister have all opposed the project.

“It is hard to imagine how our ministers can feel proud to represent India in IUCN’s Conservation Congress under such a deplorable policy regime,” Sharma said. “Unless MoEF&CC demonstrates its commitment by rejecting forest diversion proposals within protected areas, all tall claims will remain empty rhetoric.”

He urged the Ministry to “permanently reject” clearances for projects within natural forests and sanctuaries until India achieves its National Forest Policy target of 33% forest and tree cover.

“The ongoing approval process for the Sharavati PSP will be seen as a red flag for conservation of nature in our country,” Sharma cautioned, calling on the government to show “commitment and integrity” in protecting India’s biodiversity.

What's being done about skyrocketing energy prices?
If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse.
With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast.","A new analysis by Bloomberg has uncovered the extraordinary impact that power-hungry data centers already have had on the electricity bills of millions of ordinary Americans, and the news is not good.

Over the past five years, Americans who live in areas near data centers have seen their electricity bills increase by as much as 267%, Bloomberg found.

""It's killing my pockets,"" said Antoinette Robinson, a resident of East Baltimore, Maryland, per Bloomberg.

What's happening?

As massive new data centers used to power artificial-intelligence models and cloud computing have sprouted up across the U.S. and around the world, they have consumed larger and larger amounts of electricity, outpacing new sources of electricity production.

According to basic economic principles, when demand goes up faster than supply, prices increase. As a result, millions of Americans, many of whom already were struggling to make ends meet, have seen their electric bills skyrocket.

""Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,"" said David Crane, the CEO of Generate Capital, per Bloomberg. Crane warned the strain on power supplies in certain markets could result in brownouts as soon as the next year or two.

In 2023, data centers consumed 4.4% of all electricity produced in the U.S., according to a Department of Energy study. The same study projected that, by 2028, that figure could reach 12%, with data centers consuming as much as 580 terawatt-hours per year.

By way of comparison, in 2019, the entire country of Canada consumed a total of 530 terawatt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. That year, Canada ranked sixth out of all nations in terms of energy consumption.

Why does data-center power consumption matter?

While many experts have warned of the coming data-center power crunch, Bloomberg's analysis has shown that, for many Americans, the electricity shortages have already become a harsh economic reality.

Nicole Pastore, who has seen her own electricity costs go up by 50% in just the past year, serves as a judge overseeing rental disputes in Baltimore. In that capacity, she has observed firsthand the impact that skyrocketing power prices have had on many of the city's most vulnerable residents.

""It's utilities versus rent,"" Pastore explained, per Bloomberg. ""They want to stay in their home, but they also want to keep their lights on.""

Many hard-hit residents wonder why they should have to, in effect, subsidize the country's AI boom, while already-wealthy tech companies rake in the resulting profits.

""They can say this is going to help with AI, but how is that going to help me?"" asked Kevin Stanley, an East Baltimore resident who is unable to work because of his glaucoma, according to Bloomberg. ""How's that going to help me pay my bill?""

What's being done about skyrocketing energy prices?

If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse. As tech companies in the U.S. race to keep pace in the fierce competition to dominate artificial intelligence, even more massive — and more power-hungry — data centers are in the works.

With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast. Meanwhile, policymakers could force tech companies to pay more for their own energy use and the strain they place on power grids, rather than pushing those costs onto consumers.

Unfortunately, recent policy changes have turned the U.S. away from cleaner, renewable sources of energy and toward dirtier, extracted fuels, which has hurt both the prospects for new electricity production and the environment.

According to S&P Global, the worldwide waiting list for the turbines used in gas-fueled power plants is currently seven years long, not nearly fast enough to meet rising demand.

By comparison, renewable-energy facilities such as solar arrays and wind farms can be brought online much more quickly and at much lower environmental costs.

To make a difference, you can help push for a return to policies that favor cleaner, renewable-energy production by contacting your elected representatives and voting for candidates who share your energy priorities.

Additionally, by installing solar panels on your home, you can drop your own electricity bill to practically zero while also reducing demand on already-maxed-out power grids.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1KgRtWcSPHYPnxWFIrDyow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/fc7770651f181966c6cf084cc2ccaacc,N,,2025-10-08 11:01:36.108413

Rewiring America has a tool you can use to find contractors for a range of projects that qualify for the clean energy tax credits.","If you’ve been considering energy-efficient upgrades to your home, now may be the time — as in , right now. A raft of tax breaks designed to incentivize energy improvements are about to be switched off.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which help homeowners save hundreds or even thousands of dollars on heat pumps, solar panels and other clean-energy changes, were originally set to end in 2032 and 2034, respectively, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act accelerated their expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

“The clock is ticking, and it’s really important for folks to start the process,” says Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrifying homes and communities.

Claiming the credits requires more than just buying energy-efficient equipment and materials — they also must be installed by the end of the year, says Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird, a wealth management firm in Milwaukee. Depending on where you live, finding contractors who are available to do the work in time could be a challenge.

Here’s what to know to increase your chances of beating the deadline to claim these valuable tax breaks, including how the y work, what types of upgrades qualify, which upgrades to prioritize and how to line up installation.

How do the credits work?

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit is worth up to $3,200. You can claim 30 percent of the cost of qualified energy-efficient improvements, up to $1,200, for “building envelope components” (doors, windows, insulation, etc.) and up to $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves and boilers.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit is for solar, wind and geothermal systems. It’s equal to 30 percent of the total purchase and installation cost, with no limit on the dollar amount.

Depending on the upgrades you make, you can claim both credits, Steffen says. And if you claimed either or both in the past, you can claim them again for any upgrades you made this year.

You must submit Form 5695 when you file your federal tax return to claim the credits. Tax credits reduce your tax liability dollar for dollar. These particular credits are nonrefundable: If the credit amount you qualify for is more than what you owe in taxes, you won’t receive the difference as a refund.

Another expiring energy tax break is the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit. It’s worth up to 30 percent of the cost of installing an electric vehicle charger at your home, up to $1,000. It ends June 30, 2026.

“For folks who went out and got a new EV or used EV, they can take their time to get the charger,” Pierce says.

What upgrades are eligible for the credits?

To qualify for the home energy tax credits, the equipment you install must be new and meet the standards listed below. (For good measure, you can ask manufacturers whether the materials or systems you’re considering buying qualify for the tax credits, Steffen says.)

Qualified expenses for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit

Building envelope components

Exterior doors: Must meet Energy Star requirements.

Exterior windows and skylights: Must meet Energy Star Most Efficient certification requirements.

Insulation and air-sealing materials: Must meet International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) standards.

Home energy audits

An energy audit entails hiring a professional who uses specialized equipment, such as infrared cameras, to examine your home and create a report with personalized recommendations for energy-efficiency improvements. “It’s like a physical for your home,” Pierce says. It must be conducted by a qualified home energy auditor. Contact your utility provider or local government energy office to find one in your area.

Residential energy property

Qualified expenses must meet the Consortium for Energy Efficiency’s highest-ranking level for energy-efficient performance. The cost of upgrading your breaker box and other electrical components to support the following appliances and systems also qualifies for the credit.

Biomass stoves and boilers

Central air conditioners

Electric or natural gas heat pumps

Electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters

Natural gas, propane or oil water heaters

Natural gas, propane or oil furnaces or hot water boilers

Electric panel upgrade to support residential energy property

Qualified Expenses for the Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit

Battery storage technology: Must have a capacity of at least 3 kilowatt hours.

Geothermal heat pumps: Must meet Energy Star program requirements at the time of purchase.

Solar panels: Solar roofing tiles and solar roofing shingles qualify.

Solar water heaters: Must be certified by the Solar Rating & Certification Corporation or a comparable entity endorsed by the government of the state in which the water heater is installed.

Fuel cells: Must have a power output of at least one-half kilowatt of electricity using an electrochemical process and an electricity-only generation efficiency greater than 30 percent.

Wind turbines: No special requirements.

For more details about claiming these credits, see the IRS Instructions for Form 5695 or consult your accountant.

Which upgrades should you prioritize?

Pierce recommends getting a home energy audit and using the report to identify which energy-efficiency upgrades to prioritize.

Home energy audits cost, on average, $437, according to the home improvement marketplace HomeAdvisor. But most qualify for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which offsets up to $150 of the cost. (In addition, many utility companies offer rebates for home energy audits.)

If you can afford to purchase and install solar panels, now is an opportune time to do it, before the 30 percent tax credit expires at the end of the year. The average 12-kilowatt home solar system costs $29,649 to install without the credit, according to solar marketplace EnergySage, but the average payback period is only 6 to 12 years.

To see if your home is a good candidate for solar panels, enter your address into Google’s Project Sunroof. This tool uses Google Earth imagery to determine how many hours of usable sunlight your house receives each year, the recommended size of a solar installation for your roof and the estimated net energy savings over 20 years.

Line up installation ASAP

Don’t wait to find a contractor. Many are already booked solid through the end of the year, says Emily Walker, director of content and insights at EnergySage. You may need to do some digging to find one available in your area.

You can get quotes from prescreened solar and heat pump installers at EnergySage.com. Rewiring America has a tool you can use to find contractors for a range of projects that qualify for the clean energy tax credits. You can also shop around for contractors on marketplaces like Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack and Yelp.","https://aarp.widen.net/content/ev6nuwfaj2/jpeg/108145_Act%20Fast,%20These%20Energy%20Tax%20Breaks%20Are%20Going%20Away.jpg?crop=true&anchor=0,0&q=80&color=ffffffff&u=0bjybw&w=1140&h=655",N,,2025-10-08 13:08:34.086246

My research initially focused on whether adult blue crabs eat eelgrass vegetative shoots containing seeds and if those seeds remain viable after consumption. Within a week of trial runs, it became clear that adult blue crabs did not want the seeds. I discussed the plan with my mentor, PhD student Heather Bruck, and wondered if crab size played a role, as smaller claws might be better suited for picking up seeds. This led to my next question: Do juvenile blue crabs and other marine invertebrates consume eelgrass seeds? I found that smaller blue crabs and urchins ate the seeds more often than the larger crabs.

The sum will be on top of the $8 billion cut in funding for innovative energy projects, such as carbon capture, announced last week.

Off With Their Heads

The latest cull, according to an article in Reuters, has been dubbed the “kill list.” Quite an apt description for an administration which has no time for renewable energy projects – describing wind turbines as windmills – climate change science or previous President Biden’s embrace of green energy.

It has, since the first day of Trump’s return to office in January, been advocates of a fossil fuel first policy dubbed, “Drill, Baby, Drill.”

The kill list includes major carbon removal and clean hydrogen efforts that had been approved by the Department of Energy under the Biden administration.

So, which companies’ projects are heading to the Guillotine?

Occidental

One of the projects set to be ditched is the South Texas Direct Air Capture Hub, a facility that Occidental Petroleum’s (OXY) 1PointFive subsidiary planned to develop in Kleberg County, Texas.

Direct Air Capture (DAC) pulls CO₂ directly from the atmosphere, which can then be stored underground or reused. The proposed plant would have pulled 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ from the air every year to combat global warming.

The original government support for this project would have led to $500 million or more being given in total grants as it developed over time. Occidental shares were up slightly in pre-market trading.

General Motors

General Motors (GM) was awarded $500 million last year to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan to EVs. The grant came from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. These grants aimed to support U.S. production of efficient hybrid, plug-in electric hybrid, plug-in electric, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. GM had described the move as underscoring its “commitment to U.S. manufacturing leadership.”

A theme, which President Trump has been equally as enthusiastic about and one of the fundamental reasons behind his tariff hikes. GM shares were flat in pre-market trading.

Stellantis/Samsung

Fellow car maker Stellantis (STLA) has two projects on the block. A $335 million grant to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois to build mid-size electric trucks, and $250 million to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to a gigafactory producing EV batteries. It was part of the StarPlus energy joint venture between Stellantis and electronics group Samsung (SSNLF). Stellantis shares were 0.6% higher in pre-market trading.

These investments in storage could help alleviate a major stumbling block for the energy transition, a lack of available grid capacity.","Indeed, the outlook is relatively positive for the solar and wind sectors, in particular, with the DNV report estimating that these technologies, both standalone and co-located with battery energy storage systems (BESS), will account for 32% of the global power mix by 2030. This will grow to more than 50% by 2040, despite a 55% growth in total electricity demand compared to today’s figures.

Energy security rises ‘to the top of concerns’

However, uncertainties over energy security loom large over many countries; moderating a panel on the relationship between the energy transition and energy security issues, DNV chief communications officer Ulrike Haugen described the situation as “moving from one vulnerability to the next one”.

“Clearly, if we think about energy security, it has risen in the last few years to the top of concerns,” explained Frans Everts, president-director of Shell Netherlands and one of the speakers on the panel. “One of our scenarios is an ‘archipelago world’, which describes a world of blocs and interests, with national interest driving scenarios. Countries and nations – and groups of nations – focus on their own self-interests, and there is a driving force of competitiveness.”

“We are witnessing a world that is fragmenting into power blocs,” agreed fellow panellist Tom Middendorp, chair of the International Military Council on Climate and Security.

“Countries are scrambling for influence over markets and control over critical resources; not just oil and gas but clean tech supply chains,” he added. “The energy transition itself has become a new arena of strategic competition … that race brings innovation, but new dependencies and fault lines.

“Strategic competition over resources is intensifying, supply chains and markets are repeatedly disrupted by shocks … and uncertainty is no longer an exception, I’m afraid it’s the new normal.”

Insulating oneself from a reliance on global supply chains has been a hallmark of many countries’ policies this year, most notably an increased demand for manufacturing capacity in the US and the imposition of tariffs on solar products imported from overseas.

The DNV report suggests that the growing importance of energy security for many national governments could disrupt priorities within the energy transition, noting that policies from “security-focused governments” are likely to result in 9% more nuclear capacity being installed by 2060, due to its perception as a reliable source of power.

“We came from a decade where the focus was on setting targets for climate and energy … and I think what we see is that in the long term, energy security and the push to climate neutrality should go hand in hand,” added the third panellist, Niels Redeker, deputy director of the climate division of the Dutch Ministry of Economy and Climate.

“Competitiveness and geopolitical developments have added strategic autonomy questions, so the issue is becoming more complex,” he continued. “We have to find a balance between sustainability, security and affordability.”

Solar and solar investments remain affordable

The issue of affordability and investment was picked up in the second panel discussion. Karin van Selm, CEO of wholesale Europe, Africa and Asia at Rabobank, suggested that there remains considerable interest in clean energy investments, particularly as the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for energy sources such as solar continues to fall.

“There’s a lot of appetite and capital available for the energy transition; Rabobank has already been involved in renewable project structures for over 30 years,” said van Selm.

This is reflected in DNV’s latest figures, which show that investments in solar and wind are expected to grow from US$110 billion and US$60 billion in the last decade, respectively, to a mammoth US$900 billion and US$540 billion, respectively, by 2044.

“The issue we’re obviously seeing is the predictability of policy at the moment,” continued van Selm, suggesting that a lack of capital is not the limiting factor in delivering clean energy investments, but some of the political uncertainty that is making new power generation projects less bankable.

“It’s not the business case – I think the business case is very much there – but if we look at what has happened over the last period, the unclarity of the policy across the world – the US really changing last-minute –immediately had an impact on the business model that we thought was predictable a few years ago.”

Strikingly, in his opening remarks, Eriksen noted that while the sheer volume of capital invested into electrification is likely to increase, these investments will account for a smaller portion of Europe’s total finance.

“Over the years, DNV has consistently found that electricity expenditures are progressively becoming a smaller portion of GDP,” he said, noting that electricity spending accounted for 3.6% of global GDP in 2024, and is expected to halve to 1.8% in 2060.

“This pattern is likely to be mirrored at microlevels in households too … we expect energy costs to become an even smaller proportion of household spending.

Grids and batteries to work in tandem

The DNV report notes that many of these investments will be made in the storage space, with capital committed to batteries and pumped hydro storage having grown seven-fold in the decade to 2025 to US$50 billion a year. Looking ahead, the analyst expects solar-plus-storage projects to receive as much investment as standalone PV in 2029, and these projects will receive US$150 billion a year as early as 2030.

These investments in storage could help alleviate a major stumbling block for the energy transition, a lack of available grid capacity.

While DNV expects grid investments to double by 2050, a lack of available grid capacity continues to hamper renewable power deployment – the report notes that without the current absence of grid capacity, Europe’s operational solar capacity would be 16% higher by 2035 – and Manon van Beek, CEO of TenneT and another panellist, said that securing permitting is the main priority for her as a grid operator.

“We need permits and we need them at speed, so we need space to build,” she said. “A project in our world is 10-12 years, two years of which are construction. I’m very much in favour of a democratic process, but we need to get this done right first time.”

Ray See, executive president of the Americas at CATL, suggested that the future of the world’s grids could see an increased reliance on large-scale transmission infrastructure and small-scale storage deployments working in tandem, calling storage an “important intermediary to balance the grid.”

“There are baby steps that countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia are doing, where they start off with the distributed, behind-the-meter [system],” he added, suggesting that this kind of project could be easier to deploy than the “centralised power generation” of large-scale grid systems.

“All this, coupled with all these financing structures that allow low interest rates, [means] a lot of entrepreneurs and industrial players could be looking at behind-the-meter to be deployed first, and then gradually, as they see the benefits, the market can grow.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dnv.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 08:00:31.355016

Solar power helps insulate residents from the rising costs of natural gas and other fossil fuels while delivering cleaner air.
For homeowners, the clean energy revolution doesn't have to stop at the grid.","A wave of clean energy is about to roll out across Mississippi. Six new solar farms — representing more than $1.8 billion in private investment — are in the works across the state, reported WLBT3, marking one of the biggest renewable energy pushes Mississippi has ever seen.

Together, these projects could generate more than 1,400 megawatts of power, enough to light up hundreds of thousands of homes for decades to come. Furthermore, they're designed to reduce reliance on dirty energy sources, lower energy costs, and provide long-term stability to the state's power grid. Facilities are planned in Hinds, Holmes, Lowndes, Lee, Union, Jasper, and Pontotoc Counties, with individual investments ranging from $175 million to $650 million.

Beyond clean energy, these solar farms are expected to create nearly 1,300 temporary construction jobs and around 30 long-term service roles. Local governments and school districts stand to benefit as well, with tens of millions in new property tax revenue projected over the coming decades.

Supporters argue that the benefits go beyond jobs and revenue. Solar power helps insulate residents from the rising costs of natural gas and other fossil fuels while delivering cleaner air. ""There's no pollution. There is no off-gassing or anything of that nature. There [are] no compressor stations or anything of that nature,"" said Louie Miller of the Mississippi Sierra Club. ""Solar is not anything to be worried about.""

Other solar sites in Mississippi have already shown what's possible. In Forrest County, for instance, property values near an existing farm nearly doubled over seven years, while tax revenue from the site grew more than tenfold. Similar gains are now within reach for communities across the state.

For homeowners, the clean energy revolution doesn't have to stop at the grid. Adding solar panels to your home can slash monthly electricity bills (potentially to as little as zero) and make it easier to operate other energy-efficient appliances, such as heat pumps. Tools like EnergySage can help you compare vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installation.

That’s the message Energy Secretary Chris Wright routinely delivers as the former chief of fracking firm Liberty Energy barnstorms media outlets and industrial sites alike to champion fossil fuels.

Wright has emerged as a key spokesperson and emissary for the Trump administration’s oil, gas and coal agenda. In any setting, he rattles off a laundry list of data-centric talking points to downplay the rise of clean energy and threat of warming temperatures.

He speaks with on-camera poise and an arcane knowledge of the energy sector that comes from decades in the field. Wright also peppers in culture war messaging and unwavering support for President Donald Trump alongside the data he cites. He often says Trump administration energy policy “is getting rid of nonsense and bringing back common sense.” Recently, he’s said Trump deserves a “hero of the climate award.”

Meanwhile, his argument that renewables and batteries provide no real value to the electricity grid is applauded by fossil fuel supporters and decried by clean energy advocates.

“They raise the system cost of electricity,” Wright said at a New York Times event in September. “If they could deliver reliably at peak demand times, they’d be value added.”

His comments often win support on social media from conservatives like Alex Epstein, the head of a think tank promoting fossil fuels who pushed for cutting wind and solar subsidies on Capitol Hill.

DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich told POLITICO’s E&E News that wind and solar have “only increased costs and made the energy grid less reliable.” He added that “the production of dispatchable energy sources such as coal, oil, gas and nuclear have been hindered by regulations, costly permitting burdens, and environmental activism.”

Wright has drawn fire from climate advocates for arguing that hurricanes are not increasing in intensity, Arctic sea coverage loss is no big deal and winters aren’t windy. Critics say his numbers on renewables are wrong or misleading.

Wright “seems to have a really loose grasp of the facts … and a clear bias toward fossil fuels,” said John Rogers, associate director of Energy Analytics at the environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists.

Here are fact checks for four of Wright’s core electricity arguments:

‘We can deliver AI and stop the rise in electricity prices’

Wright made this statement last week on CNBC.

“The ultimate impact of AI should be able to make our grid more secure and actually lower the average delivery cost,” he said.

Electricity prices have risen more than 6 percent since last year. And many experts say higher U.S. electricity prices are all but guaranteed in the foreseeable future, driven in large part by surging demand from data centers that are likely to use eye-popping amounts of electricity to power artificial intelligence computing.

A recent report from the widely respected consultancy Rhodium Group says data centers could use roughly one-seventh of all U.S. electricity demand in 2040. That’s roughly triple the current data center demand in the U.S.

Ben King, a director at Rhodium’s Energy and Climate practice and lead author on the report, said “generationally high levels of demand growth,” along with cuts to renewable tax credits and deregulation at EPA, is likely to push up electricity bills 3-6 percent annually through the end of this decade.

That’s a stark contrast to falling electricity bills that the group forecast prior to the Trump administration.

“Over the past three or four years, additions of wind, solar, and batteries have been somewhere between 85 and 95 percent of new stuff on the grid,” King said. “As you look at meeting capacity needs, the clearest place to do that is by adding these resources that are already in the pipeline.

“The policy actions [under Trump] have made it more difficult to build that stuff,” he said.

Meanwhile, a new report from the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis, a think tank, says electric and gas utility bills in data-center-heavy Virginia could rise by more than $1,100 on average by 2040.

Mike Jacobs, a senior manager for energy at Union of Concerned Scientists, said rising gas prices, along with coal plant bailouts and higher construction costs in part due to tariffs, are fueling higher electricity bills.

“The growth in demand from data centers driven by AI is growth the industry has not seen in anybody’s career,” Jacobs said. “The supply chain and the ability to build new power plants to keep up with that growth won’t be sufficient to lower prices and most likely will not keep up.

“Unfettered data center growth will raise prices,” he said.

But Wright also has defenders. Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and an administration official in Trump’s first term, said renewable subsidies, state-level renewable portfolio standards, sluggish permitting and other factors have created a “toxic stew that is killing investment in the power sources that we need.”

Like Wright, Loyola says the U.S. needs more coal and gas plants to produce electricity reliably and cheaply.

“It’s pretty clear that the leadership at the Department of Energy understands what the problem is,” he said. “It will take some time for the interagency process to produce a strong, whole-of-government approach.”

‘There are not oil and gas subsidies’

Wright says the Trump administration opposes renewables because it opposes subsidies. “The wind subsidies and solar subsidies are 33 years old, so it’s about time for industries to walk on their own,” he told the New York Times event.

But do fossil fuels get subsidies? Wright doesn’t think so.

“There are not oil and gas subsidies,” he said. “You can rapidly expense your drilling costs, which you can for all manufacturing.”

Wright was likely referring to a tax perk for “intangible drilling costs,” or IDCs. It’s one of many fossil fuel subsidies outlined in a recent report by the environmental group Oil Change International.

The report says the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republican legislation that cut short renewable subsidies, plussed up subsidies for fossil fuels, including through a bigger IDC deduction. The law’s expansion of the 45Q carbon capture tax credit for enhanced oil recovery will cost taxpayers more than $1.4 billion annually, the report says.

All told, the report says fossil fuels get at least $30 billion annually in U.S. federal subsidies.

Collin Rees, U.S. program manager at Oil Change International and author of the report, said Wright is denying fossil fuel subsidies exist to sidestep “a debate on the merits.”

“He’s now out there attacking this entire idea,” Rees said. “Fossil fuel subsidies are designed to, and do in actuality, flow to increase the profits of the biggest oil and gas companies on the planet, and they have for over 100 years.”

A report from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, dated 2014, says the IDC carve-out is more than just a typical expense for businesses.

“In fact IDC deduction is not the same, or designed with the same purpose, as the [research and experimental] deduction available to other industries,” it says. “At this point in the technological development of the industry, the IDC deduction only serves to subsidize the business generally by allowing certain taxpayers to avoid the capitalization rules applying to other taxpayers.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is implementing a wide range of policies to boost coal production and use through direct grants and new tax cuts.

The OBBB provided a new 2.5 percent tax credit for metallurgical coal. Just five days after speaking at the New York Times event, Wright announced $625 million in DOE grants to keep coal plants running with new pollution controls — or even to reboot closed plants.

Rees says those policies are subsidies. Others say they’re just some money to help coal after years of strict coal regulations under recent Democratic presidents.

“Given that both the Obama and Biden administrations imposed massive costs on the coal industry as part of this kind of religious movement in opposition to coal and greenhouse gas emissions, this is a partial offset for that,” said Benjamin Zycher, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “So I wouldn’t call it a subsidy. I call it a reduction in a negative subsidy.”

Critics of the fossil fuel subsidy argument also say it’s a red herring. That’s because renewables get a lot more help from the government.

“It’s really renewables [and] unconventional energy that get massive subsidies,” Zycher said. “The argument of fossil fuel subsidies is really a way to distract attention from the massive subsidies that renewables get and the distortions those produce for the electric power system.”

A 2023 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the data-crunching arm of DOE, said 46 percent of all energy subsidies were tied to renewable energy, while 35 percent of all energy subsidies were for consumption, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

Renewables provided ‘2.6% of global energy last year’

Wright has touted the statistic in arguing that wind and solar subsidies should be eliminated.

“$5 trillion of … subsidized and mandated expenditures on wind, solar and batteries. Congratulations. 2.6 percent of global energy last year,” he said in late September duringa Foreign Press Centers briefing in New York.

Wright also cites the statistic in claiming that renewables are expensive and unreliable — an assertion challenged by the industry. “The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand,” Wright wrote in the New York Post in June.

Conservatives often point to warnings, including from the U.S. grid monitor, that fossil fuel plant retirements are threatening the grid.

It is true that wind and solar accounted for roughly 3 percent of U.S. primary energy consumption last year, according to the EIA. That’s partly because transportation, which is dominated by oil, is a significant portion of energy use.

But with delivered energy — which counts energy that reaches an end user — solar’s share rises to roughly 7 percent.

In the electricity sector, wind and solar provided roughly 17 percent of U.S. power in 2024 after a decade of growth. And electricity is projected to constitute a growing share of U.S. energy because of electric vehicles and other factors, according to data analysis firm Ember.

There also are many documented cases of wind and solar helping keep power on during peak demand periods with support from linked batteries.

In one example, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator serving most of the state, said in June that solar growth made this summer “uneventful” for the grid, an improvement from the past when officials warned about outages during peak demand.

“Rising solar and battery output in ERCOT clearly enabled a summer of triple-digit heat without the close calls of previous summers and with lower prices to boot,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas wrote in a research note in January about similar effects from solar and batteries in summer 2024.

Unsubsidized renewables are now the most cost-competitive form of generation, particularly as new gas plants face a shortage of turbines, according to a June report from Lazard.

The levelized cost of electricity — the focus of Lazard’s analysis — has been criticized as not providing a full picture of costs to back up renewables. But federal data shows that the top four states producing wind and solar power are among the cheapest states for electricity. A POLITICO analysis found the majority of states tapping high amounts of renewables had electricity prices below the national average.

The Solar Energy Industries Association, which has accused Wright of lying on social media, says every dollar of federal subsidy for the industry saves Americans almost $3, because of lower electricity costs and federal and state tax revenue. Solar can be brought online faster than new gas and nuclear plants to meet AI demand, industry supporters say.

“When Sec. Burgum and Sec. Wright choke off supply, they’re the ones responsible for raising Americans’ energy prices. Every time a family sees that spike on their utility bill, they’ll know exactly who is to blame,” SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in an emailed statement.

‘People that live near wind farms don’t like them’

Wright has argued this point in explaining why the Trump administration has targeted wind power, including by reducing funding at the DOE and blocking Biden-era projects approved by the Interior Department.

“Wind is the opposite of natural gas. People that live near wind farms don’t like them. People that live far away, love them … people that live in oil fields, love it. People that live far away, hate it,” he said at an event hosted by The New York Times in September.

Wright added that opposition in rural communities to wind power is at a “fever pitch,” citing project cancellations and local bans on wind.

The secretary is correct that opposition to wind power locally has been growing, according to some analyses. A report from Columbia University’s law school in June found that 459 counties and municipalities in 44 states had adopted “severe” local restrictions on siting renewables by the end of last year, a 16 percent increase from 2023.

“While 2024 was a year of record-breaking success for the deployment of utility-scale renewables in the United States … recent studies suggest that installations could have been significantly higher absent restrictive zoning and local opposition,” the school’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law said.

However, oil and gas projects have also garnered local opposition in recent years, including protests against the Mountain Valley pipeline and outcry against hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania. In Colorado, many local officials have rejected fossil fuel development, including for a planned gasoline storage facility near an elementary school that prompted parents to threaten lawsuits.

Additionally, some polling suggests that public opposition to oil and gas development overall may be greater than for renewables.

The Pew Research Center reported this June that Americans’ support for wind and solar power is higher than for any other resource, even though support for renewables has dropped among Republicans since Trump’s first term. The same survey found majority support for development of offshore wind farms, including among GOP or GOP-leaning adults.

Other polling organizations, including Gallup, have similarly found that more Americans support development of renewables and alternative energy than production of oil, gas and coal.

“The public’s continued general preference for developing alternative energy may help explain its tepid support for fracking and offshore drilling,” Gallup said in April.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/10/97/dbeb6f4d4ae599fe3ceadaedc6ab/u-s-congress-70265.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 08:00:42.285239

Ammonia is one of the world’s ‘big four’ chemical products. It is the main feedstock for nitrogen-based fertilisers and it is also used in refrigeration, explosives, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Its production accounts for about 1.5% of total-energy related emissions and the vast majority is currently made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen in the Haber-Bosch process.

According to the International Energy Agency, ammonia is one of the most emissions-intensive commodities produced by heavy industry, nearly twice as emission intensive as crude steel production and four times as intensive as that of cement on a direct emissions basis,

To fully decarbonise its production, companies are also exploring green ammonia. However this comes with its own challenges including high production costs, infrastructure gaps, and a lack of economic incentives.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/shutterstock_2297911471.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 09:57:57.756238

PALMER, Mass. — On a recent hot autumn day, a dozen black cows took respite in the shade cast by a 10-foot-tall series of solar panels set above 13 acres of hayfields at Burgundy Brook Farm.

Farm owner Tom Roberts grazes cattle and grows timothy and other forage grasses beneath the solar array. Roberts receives rent from the developer and owner of the solar project, but doesn’t tap into the solar energy produced by the two-megawatt (MW) system, himself. Half of the electricity generated by the panels on his family’s property is sold through renewable energy credits to roughly 175 low-income homes while a hospital buys the other half.

“The cash flow keeps the farm progressing in the right direction,” said Roberts, whose western Massachusetts farm spans more than 400 acres.

The community solar system on Roberts’ farm is one of 20,691 solar arrays, both residential and commercial, now operating in Massachusetts, where policy makers have established the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target, (SMART) program to encourage solar expansion. Through the program, the state compensates homeowners and businesses for producing solar electricity.

Massachusetts has recently revamped and expanded incentives under the SMART program, now dubbed SMART 3.0, to keep the solar market growing even in the face of moves by the Trump administration discouraging solar and other renewable energy expansion. The state said it will be accepting applications for new SMART projects starting Oct. 15.

State leaders have vowed to invest $1 billion over 10 years in new technologies to mitigate harmful climate change. Massachusetts additionally passed legislation at the end of last year to promote non-gas heating, expand access to electric vehicles, tackle rising energy costs, and other measures favoring renewable energy growth.

Massachusetts is one of many states nationwide with programs that encourage renewable energy development to meet robust greenhouse gas reduction goals. And like Massachusetts, many other states are sharpening their clean energy strategies to navigate the anti-renewable energy policies of the Trump administration.

In just the first several months since taking office, Trump’s White House has moved to cancel billions of dollars allotted to clean energy projects, frozen permitting for wind projects and gutted vital federal tax credits incentivizing renewable energy projects. The federal tax credits – a tool often used to spur development of new technologies – have been instrumental in reducing the upfront costs of building new clean energy projects.

An analysis by Rhodium Group, an independent research provider, estimated that under a worst-case or high-emissions scenario, clean energy deployment would be half what was expected under the Biden administration through 2035.

“States are recognizing … we need to step up and fill this void of leadership to make sure that we’re meeting energy demand and doing so in a way that’s environmentally responsible but moreover more affordable,” said Jacob Weinberg, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association.

“Hungry for solutions”

Electricity prices are rising at more than double the rate of inflation, and prices are only forecast to keep climbing as power-sucking new technologies leave states “hungry for solutions”, according to Kelly Trombley, senior director of state policy at the nonprofit Ceres, which works with businesses to advocate for clean energy policies.

“State governments recognize the political liability of high energy prices, and they also see the projected loads coming from not just data centers, but increased manufacturing and [vehicle] electrification,” she said.

The Trump administration has said it sees US coal plants as a partial solution, recently announcing $625 million in investments to reinvigorate and expand the US coal industry. But many state leaders are not in agreement, and neither are energy analysts.

The governors of Arizona and North Carolina have each issued recent executive orders creating task forces to determine how their states will keep utility costs affordable, maintain clean energy leadership, and meet economic development and environmental goals.

California, meanwhile, passed a six-bill package addressing affordability, including authorizing the state to participate in a regional western energy market and public financing for transmission infrastructure, as well as for expediting renewable energy on to the grid.

“State governments recognize the political liability of high energy prices, and they also see the projected loads coming from not just data centers, but increased manufacturing and [vehicle] electrification.” – Kelly Trombley, Ceres

Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, wrote to US Department of Interior (DOI) Secretary Doug Burgum in August expressing concern that federal policies were preventing or delaying major solar energy projects.

The governors’ office has since had “productive discussions” with DOI officials, “and it is clear that the administration is attentive to Nevada’s commitment” to advancing these projects, said John Meny, the governor’s press secretary.

“If you want new power resources, renewables are the answer. They are also the most cost-effective,” Dennis Wamsted, energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said. Investment bank Lazard released a report in June which found that unsubsidized wind and solar are the lowest cost sources of energy generation.

“Solar and wind are still going to get built because you can’t build anything else right now,” he continued, noting there’s a five to seven year wait for natural gas turbines because of manufacturing bottlenecks.

“What reality looks like”

For the first half of 2025, solar and battery storage accounted for 82% of all new power generation added to the grid, as developers raced to qualify for tax credits before they expire on December 31. While battery storage devices do not generate their own energy, they amplify wind and solar energy by storing it and releasing it later, including when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.

Solar developer BlueWave, which installed the solar system on the Burgundy Brook Farm, owns and operates nine solar arrays on a variety of vegetable, fruit, hay and livestock farms in the Northeast. Through the “dual-use” systems, farmers can continue to grow crops and graze livestock on land where elevated solar panels work to generate power.

Dual use solar provides additional benefits Roberts said he wasn’t anticipating. “By giving the hay crop underneath it some periodic shade throughout the day, we’ve seen an increase in the quality and the quantity of the grass, because it doesn’t seem to get burned out as quick by the hot sun,” he said.

BlueWave plans to build 10 to 20 more in the state over the next few years.

Last year, the company projected to build 60 such systems across the Northeast and Illinois, but now is hesitant to forecast how many will move forward.

“We’re still trying to figure out what reality looks like from here on out,” said Gabrielle Hayes, sustainable solar development manager at BlueWave.

The Burgundy Brook Farm solar array took five years to become operational, largely because of the wait for grid connection, Hayes said. Insufficient transmission capacity often leads to delays that also drive up soft costs.

While new transmission systems are costly and take a long time to build, new technologies—like high performance conductors—can greatly expand the existing capacity of transmissions systems, and therefore hasten clean energy deployment, according to Trombley.

“That’s helpful, because we have all of this clean energy waiting in the interconnection queue,” she said. State legislation requiring utilities to evaluate the costs and benefits of grid enhancement technologies was a “big trend this year that we fully expect to see this coming year,” she added.

New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia and Massachusetts were among states passing such legislation in the past year.

Similarly, battery storage can expand clean energy transmission by storing solar and wind energy and releasing it when the power is most needed.

Federal tax credits, albeit reduced, will remain for storage for another 10 years, and states are moving to take advantage of them. This year, Massachusetts and New Jersey became the latest of more than a dozen states to announce storage procurement plans. Massachusetts will add an initial 1,500 MW of battery storage this year and ultimately 5,000 MW by 2030, while New Jersey will add 1,000 MW by 2030.

“Storage and basically anything that increases flexibility, like grid enhancement, can really support clean energy and affordability,” Trombley said.

Battle in the courts

Just how much state level action and market forces can overcome anti-renewable federal policies remains to be seen. Progress will likely vary by state or region – and by the governor’s political affiliation. The Trump administration recently cut an additional $7.6 billion for clean energy projects, but only in states led by Democratic governors.

“We’re still trying to figure out what reality looks like from here on out.” – Gabrielle Hayes, BlueWave

Massachusetts is taking many steps to keep the ball moving, but offshore wind, now stymied by the Trump administration’s special animus for wind power, is a cornerstone of the state’s net zero plan.

While the state has taken a “thoughtful approach to balancing renewable energy and land conservation,” with SMART and permitting and siting revisions, “I think we were really hopeful about the energy supply that was going to come from offshore wind,” said Vick Mohanka, chapter director of the Massachusetts Sierra Club.

“In the big picture, we also see a world where we have diesel generators fueling data centers. We see natural gas peaker plants. We see a [federal] bipartisan acceptance of an all of the above energy approach,” that is perpetuating fossil fuels, he said.

Just how much clean energy will be added to the grid after the federal tax credits sunset in December will also be determined by how hard state leaders fight the administration’s anti-renewable agenda, Mohanka and other advocates said.

At least 19 states have filed multiple lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s renewable energy policies, including a lawsuit against the administration’s freeze on wind.

And on Oct. 6, a group of labor unions, nonprofits and solar companies sued the Trump administration over its cancellation of grants aimed at expanding solar energy to low-income communities.

“The battle here is going to have to be in the courts,” said Larry Chretien, executive director at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

Back on Burgundy Brook Farm, Roberts said he is so happy with the solar project that he is considering adding another to additional farm property he owns in a neighboring town.

“It’s been a very good fit,” Roberts said. “Nobody wants fossil fuel and coal and nuclear, and solar seemed like a pretty green way to go about it.”

Coal ash at the site is contaminating nearby groundwater at levels exceeding protection standards, and federal rules require any utilities facing such a situation to formulate plans to clean up the problem. The investor-owned utility recently released an updated third-party assessment that details various ways AES can correctly manage the waste and comply with federal regulations.

Groundwater monitoring beginning in 2019 at the site’s coal ash ponds found high levels of arsenic, lithium and molybdenum at levels that require corrective actions. The pollutants must be cleaned up, but the report by Ohio-based firm Haley Aldrich says they pose “no adverse impacts on human health or the environment.”

While the report outlines many potential solutions, some environmental advocates say there is no silver bullet and that each potential solution will have some drawbacks.

“The bottom line is that we need to stop groundwater contamination and make sure the coal ash is secured the next time the White River floods,” Indra Frank, coal ash advisor with Hoosier Environmental Council, said.

Cleaning up coal ash

AES officials say the company will use certain criteria to determine the most effective way to clean up the coal ash. Potential remedies must protect human health and the environment, protect groundwater, reduce or eliminate future releases of contaminants, and remove the existing contamination.

Once AES identifies solutions that meet the above criteria, it will then evaluate them on their short- and long-term effectiveness as well as how easy each solution will be to implement.

The Haley Aldrich report outlines potential solutions AES can choose from, such as capping the ponds with cement or building walls in the ponds to contain the contaminants and water treatment systems.

AES, as a requirement under the federal coal ash rule, opened up a public comment period so residents and stakeholders can submit their opinions on the proposed solutions. These comments will be considered before the utility chooses what to do.

One option that Frank supports but which does not appear in the report would be containing all the coal ash into one wall-lined pond rather than putting it into multiple ponds as is currently being done.

Coal ash at Harding Street

The Harding Street station began coal-burning operations in 1931 and continued through February 2016 when the facility stopped burning coal. However the ash from the prior decades of burning remains on site.

That ash, also called coal combustion residuals, is stored in multiple ponds, or watery impoundments to the south of the main plant. Coal ash contains, among other things, contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and arsenic that can contaminate waterways, groundwater, drinking water and the air.

The ash stored at Harding Street is deeper than the water table in some places, mixing with the groundwater. The depth of the pond means contaminants in the coal ash are able to mix with the groundwater.

The assessment will help AES focus on two main goals. The first is preventing any more coal ash pollution from reaching the groundwater. The second involves determining what to do with the groundwater that is already contaminated.

AES has created an online portal for the public to write their comments on the coal ash clean up plan. Comments can entered at aesindiana.com/harding-street-cma-meeting or emailed to aesindianapuvlicaffairs@aes.com.

In 2024, renewable power capacity globally rose by about 15% year on year, reaching almost 4,500 gigawatts.

The bulk of that growth came in Asia where China remains the powerhouse of renewable energy investment, pushing huge scale in both capacity additions and grid modernisation.

In the first half of 2025 alone, China added 268 gigawatts of renewable capacity (for context the total electricity generating capacity from all sources on the island of Ireland is approximately 17 gigawatts).

Europe was the second largest contributor to renewable energy growth in 2024 adding 12.3% capacity year on year with Germany, Spain, France and Italy leading the way.

Business Bulletin

There is clear evidence from these case studies that countries and regions with strong access to financing, streamlined regulatory frameworks and investment incentives are those who are achieving most success in the green transition.

Ireland & carbon targets

Ireland is forecast to fall well below its 2030 target of a 51% reduction in carbon emissions and clearly needs to act faster to meet both National and EU targets.

Tax policy and tax incentives can play an important role in incentivising investment into green projects and reducing carbon emissions.

In the past, we have used tax policy to regenerate urban and rural areas, create financial services and manufacturing hubs, build hotels and student accommodation, and reduce the consumption of plastic bags.

When used appropriately, tax policy can drive investment quickly into the right sectors of the economy and change social behaviours overnight.

Inflation Reduction Act & the European Green Deal

Although the sitting US president is busy dismantling the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) measures introduced by the Biden administration, after the IRA was introduced into law in 2022, there was clear evidence that it was driving clean energy investment in the US.

Groups like Audi, ENEL and BMW had all announced plans to invest in manufacturing facilities in the US and cited the IRA and its incentives to foster domestic production of clean energy equipment as the catalyst for these decisions.

The European Green Deal (seen as the EU’s version of the IRA) has introduced pro green tax measures (such as plastic taxes and the carbon border adjustment mechanism) and in July 2025, the Commission recommended the use of tax incentives such as accelerated depreciation and targeted tax credits to promote investment in clean technologies, renewable energy and energy-efficient machinery.

The evidence is out there that these types of tax policy can foster investment, and the EU Commission is clearly promoting the use of tax policy to aid the green transition.

Our pre-Budget recommendations

Under the banner of supporting the green transition, the following recommendations for Budget 2026 were included in KPMG’s pre-budget submission:

Increases to the tax-free lump sum payable on retirement when some or all of the lump sum is derived from approved ESG funds.

The introduction of a tax exemption for interest earned by individuals on “green” bonds.

The reintroduction of a tax deduction to companies who invested their own cash in renewable energy projects and a broadening of the relief to include investments in energy-efficiency projects such as retrofitting of commercial buildings.

Increases in the R&D tax credit rate for expenditure incurred on R&D carried out on green technologies.

The introduction of a super-deduction (for instance 150% of expenditure incurred) on energy-efficient equipment, EV charging stations and onsite renewable energy installations.

Changes to BIK and VAT rules to ensure that individuals are motivated to buy electric vehicles and use bicycles or public transport where possible.

Meeting EU targets

Although we welcome the changes announced in this year’s Budget, we would encourage the Department of Finance to consider what new measures can be introduced, as given our current trajectory, we are unlikely to meet our EU targets.

While there are costs associated with the introduction of new tax reliefs, those costs must be measured against the financial penalties that would be imposed if EU-mandated targets are not met in the future.

A report issued by the Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council in March of this year estimated those costs to be between €8bn and €26bn.

These costs (and the other costs for businesses and individuals of climate change) should not be ignored in arriving at a balanced budget.

Many conservative states have learned limiting energy sources doesn't make sense. Wind accounted for around 59% of electricity generation in Iowa in 2023 and renewable energy accounts for around 30% of electricity generation in Texas.

The cost of electricity is lower in those states than in Indiana, where only 16.1% of utility-scale net electricity generation in Indiana is renewable.

Companies looking to expand or relocate also increasingly demand clean, affordable energy access. If we can’t supply the resources for that demand, those businesses will choose a state that can supply such energy, like Illinois or Michigan.

Including more choices of energy sources is not just a solid strategy — it’s common sense.

Letters: Pro-development Republicans are Indiana's real extremists

Across Indiana, renewable projects are already lowering consumer costs, attracting new businesses and creating jobs.

As with all newer technologies, the cost of renewable energy production continues to fall. Economies of scale, automation and the use of more efficient materials in both wind and solar manufacturing continue to lower the cost of production.

Building renewable energy, though, is not about replacing other forms of energy. It is about building a balanced, diversified portfolio that ensures Indiana families and businesses can depend on affordable, reliable power for decades to come.

Just as no savvy investor puts all their money into a single stock, no wise state puts all its energy bets into a small number of sources.

Opinion: Solar belongs on rooftops, not Indiana farmland

With that, we must determine the proper balance between individual property rights and community development. A cornerstone of both our democracy and our economy is that an individual owns his or her land and may develop it as they desire, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others.

A personal bias against renewables does not constitute infringement, yet many counties have passed severe restrictions against renewable energy development.

Our state is better when we embrace innovation while staying true to our values. We must commit to building a grid capable of meeting today’s demands that is ready for tomorrow’s opportunities.

That means modernizing infrastructure, supporting innovation and scaling up our energy development through renewables.

By providing reliable internet access powered by clean energy, we anticipate improvements in educational outcomes as students gain access to online learning resources. This enhanced connectivity will also support local businesses by enabling e-commerce opportunities and facilitating communication with customers beyond the islands.

Moreover, the project will contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The transition to renewable energy sources aligns with global efforts to combat climate change while promoting economic resilience within local communities. Ultimately, this project aims to create a more connected and sustainable future for the residents of Palau.

Partnerships and Collaborations with Local Stakeholders

Collaboration with local stakeholders is essential for the success of the Clean Energy for Digital Connectivity Project. We plan to partner with local government agencies, educational institutions, and community organizations to ensure that our efforts align with existing initiatives and address community needs effectively. These partnerships will facilitate knowledge sharing and resource mobilization.

Additionally, we aim to engage local businesses in supporting the project through sponsorships or in-kind contributions. By fostering a sense of ownership among community members and stakeholders, we can enhance project sustainability and ensure that its benefits are felt long after implementation is complete.

Monitoring and Evaluation Plan for the Project

A robust monitoring and evaluation plan will be established to assess the effectiveness of the Clean Energy for Digital Connectivity Project throughout its implementation. Key performance indicators (KPIs) will be identified to measure progress toward project objectives, including metrics related to energy production, internet connectivity rates, and community engagement levels. Regular progress reports will be generated to provide updates on project milestones and outcomes.

Feedback from community members will also be collected through surveys and focus group discussions to gauge satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement. This iterative approach will allow us to make data-driven decisions that enhance project effectiveness.

Sustainability and Long-Term Plans for the Clean Energy Project

Sustainability is a core principle of the Clean Energy for Digital Connectivity Project. To ensure long-term viability, we will establish a maintenance plan that includes training local technicians to manage and repair solar PV systems. This capacity-building approach empowers community members with valuable skills while reducing dependence on external support.

Furthermore, we will explore opportunities for integrating renewable energy solutions into local economic development strategies. By promoting entrepreneurship in clean energy technologies, we can create jobs while fostering a culture of sustainability within the Palau Islands.

Conclusion and Next Steps for the Grant Proposal

In conclusion, the Clean Energy for Digital Connectivity Project presents a unique opportunity to address critical challenges faced by remote communities in the Palau Islands. By implementing clean energy technologies that enhance digital connectivity, we can empower residents with access to education, economic opportunities, and sustainable living practices.

For anyone who hasn’t been taking refuge under a rock, world trade is going through some serious convulsions.
Times have certainly changed as the EU now prepares to dive into the same protectionist waters.
The coming years will see the EU grow increasingly protectionist – which will bring knock-on effects, such as making the Union’s diversification drive on trade harder.
His work centres on European industrial policy, digital infrastructure, competition, trade and EU/China relations.","In a bid to prop up the bloc’s crisis-stricken steel industry, the European Commission on Tuesday proposed heavy tariffs on non-EU steel imports – levies that will kick in much earlier, as the quota for foreign steel is almost halved.

The measure smacks of Trumpism. True to its open trade leanings, the Commission’s proposal includes nods to free trade agreement partners and promises to clear the proposal with the World Trade Organization. But there’s no disguising that at its heart, it is a protectionist play to safeguard a vital European industry. What’s more, it’s not the only one.

For anyone who hasn’t been taking refuge under a rock, world trade is going through some serious convulsions. Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies have cast the international commercial system as we know it into existential doubt.

This is serious business for the EU. The Union is highly dependent on trade for its economic welfare, and the US is the most important export market for EU businesses. In fact, the EU-US trade relationship is the largest in the world.

Unleashing a flood of sectoral and across-the-board tariffs, Trump has struck at the core of the relationship, driving fear into the hearts of export-leading industries in Europe.

At the same time, Europe is facing increasing import competition from cheap Chinese goods. The long-held fears of Chinese manufacturing overcapacity are reaching “fever pitch” as goods that are shut out of the US through steep tariffs start landing on EU shores instead.

This reality is leading to a fundamental rethink in EU economic and trade circles. Rather than maintain its free trade course, Europe must protect its home market from distortions from abroad, goes the thinking. The new trade measure on steel products is the latest, and starkest, proof of this.

In the same vein, the Commission is planning a stronger emphasis on “Made in Europe” requirements for public procurements in the bloc, as championed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union speech.

Not long ago, the Union vehemently opposed similar “Made in the US” requirements for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, with European politicians blasting them as protectionist. Times have certainly changed as the EU now prepares to dive into the same protectionist waters.

Taken in isolation, these measures may be welcomed by EU industry. The bloc’s steel sector really is on its knees, shedding almost 100.000 jobs in the last 15 years. Building EU-made preference into public contracts can also boost the competitiveness of European firms and secure more resilient homegrown value chains.

But these measures are also splintering the global economy. As visualised by a downward spiral by the US economist Charles Kindleberger, it was the tit-for-tat responses to the protectionist policies of others that sunk the global economy in the inter-war years of the last century.

One nation starts the ball rolling – in the 1930s, the US led by Herbert Hoover – and the rest respond with measures of their own. While the world has mostly refrained from responding to Trump’s trade fire with fire of their own, the latest EU measure is something new and marks a fundamental change in how the bloc views trade and market access.

The coming years will see the EU grow increasingly protectionist – which will bring knock-on effects, such as making the Union’s diversification drive on trade harder.

Friendly third countries, such as Korea, Japan and South Africa, and their industries, naturally view the policy shift in the Union with apprehension. What are the benefits to closer commercial ties with the EU if the Union narrows access to the Single Market? Even close allies and geographical neighbours like Norway and Iceland are left unscathed. They dread the sting of another upcoming trade wall, this one on ferro alloys, an input in the steel value chain.

Rebalancing who’s able to trade freely in the Single Market and under what conditions is necessary in the name of economic security. But the EU should be mindful of contributing to, and possibly exacerbating, the fracturing of the world economy. It surely will not lead to anything good.

A new report titled North America Range Cooker Market (2025-2033) revealed key insights highlighting market trends for induction range cookers. According to the findings, the compound annual growth rate for induction cookers is ""expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 8.5% from 2025 to 2033.""

Grand View Research noted numerous factors contributing to the significant growth, highlighting advancements in smart and energy-efficient kitchen appliances. As a result, induction range cookers are not only appealing due to their power savings but also due to their health benefits. Unlike gas stovetops, induction ranges do not emit any harmful indoor pollutants.

Another reason homeowners are opting for induction stoves is their speed. Induction stoves heat up faster than gas ranges, making cooking times more efficient. The flat burners also make for easier cleanup, saving you time in the kitchen.

Switching to an induction stovetop can be affordable. Homeowners can get up to $840 off the cost of an induction range thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. While many of the tax credits under the IRA are expiring by the end of 2025, the rebates for induction stoves are still available. Thus, taking advantage of these tax credits sooner rather than later can be the difference between saving thousands of dollars on home upgrades.

For renters or homeowners who may not want a major kitchen renovation, there are still ways to bring induction burners into your home. A plug-in induction burner, for example, is a great, inexpensive option for avoiding the hazards of gas stoves. Starting at just $50, a plug-in burner is also a simple way to try out induction for the first time.

Other ways you can electrify your home and save money include installing solar panels and upgrading your HVAC system. Switching to solar energy can bring your energy bills down to $0 or nearly $0.

For homeowners looking to go solar, EnergySage provides a free service that allows you to compare quotes from local installers, saving you up to $10,000 on your installation.

If purchasing panels isn't in your budget, you can still go solar by leasing panels. Palmetto's LightReach solar panel leasing program lets you install panels for no money down, allowing customers to lock in low energy rates.

Another way to improve your home's energy efficiency and save money is by upgrading your HVAC to a heat pump. On average, households can save nearly $400 per year on energy costs thanks to a heat pump. If you're looking to make the switch, Mitsubishi can help you find an affordable option for your home.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kitchen.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:02:03.409590

“The PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025 ensures oversight of the pipeline system is governed by appropriate, data-driven, and cost-effective standards.
Congress last reauthorized PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs through fiscal year 2023, meaning PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs have been without an authorization for two years.

The bipartisan pipeline safety reauthorization bill will help ensure the continued safe and secure movement of American energy.

The bill reauthorizes the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s (PHMSA) pipeline safety program for five years and authorizes $1.65 billion in funding. The legislation includes key measures to reduce pipeline-related fatalities and injuries, advance the development of new pipeline safety technologies, enhance safety inspections and enforcement efforts, and promote education for local communities on PHMSA’s work.

The PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025 also requires PHMSA to update parts of its regulations to account for new pipeline materials, gases, and operating practices. The bill also takes precautions against cybersecurity vulnerabilities that threaten America’s energy infrastructure integrity.

“America’s energy independence requires a strong and secure pipeline infrastructure,” said Senator Young. “The PIPES Act will reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to ensure our pipeline ecosystem is safe and efficient, allowing the U.S. to meet our energy demands of today and tomorrow.”

“Americans have made it clear that they need safe, affordable, and dependable energy. PHMSA has no small task, overseeing over 3 million miles of oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquid pipelines across this country, a significant portion of which are located in Texas. As the energy capital of the world, millions of jobs in Texas depend on the safe and reliable movement of energy,” said Senator Cruz. “The PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025 ensures oversight of the pipeline system is governed by appropriate, data-driven, and cost-effective standards. I am proud to partner with Ranking Member Cantwell and Senators Young and Peters on this bipartisan effort and hope to see it become law.”

“We just had the deadliest two-year period in pipeline safety since 2015. Clearly, we need a more proactive approach to the safe transportation of our nation’s energy products, including the 46,000 miles of pipeline in Washington state,” said Senator Cantwell. “This bill does just that by increasing civil penalties by 50 percent, eliminating gaps in hydrogen and carbon dioxide pipeline requirements, and requiring permanent cybersecurity standards for pipeline operators.”

“Pipeline safety is critical to protecting both our environment and our economy,” said Senator Peters. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan bill to strengthen the safety and security of our nation’s pipelines and help prevent accidents before they occur.”

PHMSA is responsible for overseeing the safe transportation of oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquids by pipelines across the United States. Congress last reauthorized PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs through fiscal year 2023, meaning PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs have been without an authorization for two years.

This is driven by a deceptive narrative that invents an energy crisis, scapegoats artificial intelligence data centers and demands a continued reliance on fossil fuels and coal plants. However, the facts are now coming to light — and they tell a much different story.

A calculated disinformation campaign is trying to sell us a crisis that doesn’t exist. Let’s be clear: There is no national energy emergency, no electricity capacity crisis and no critical reliance on foreign energy. Politicians and the media can repeat slogans such as “Drill baby, drill” and “beautiful, clean coal,” but that doesn’t make them real. The truth is that America produces more energy than it uses, and is the world’s largest oil and natural gas producer and the top exporter of gasoline and natural gas. The emergency is pure fiction.

So, why the hype? It’s a tool to justify gutting the federal rules that protect our families. The guise of a fake emergency has been used to weaken dozens of clean air and water regulations. These changes include limiting the ability of federal agencies to track pollution and climate data, and discontinuing a new database for predicting extreme precipitation. These actions present a contradiction: While the stated goal is to provide the “cleanest air and water on the planet,” championing “beautiful, clean coal” is a claim as absurd as a doctor prescribing cigarettes for your health.

This isn’t just a debate in Washington, D.C. It’s an assault on our communities — a fiction that creates so-called “sacrifice zones” across America’s heartland. A map of toxic pollution from coal plants reveals a grim truth: The highest concentration of harm is right here in Missouri, Kansas, across the Midwest and down to Texas. It’s been well documented that these plants pump mercury, acid gases and carcinogens into our air, leading to higher rates of asthma, developmental problems in children and increased cancer risk for everyone living nearby.

Unprecedented storms, dangerous heat

While some local progress has been made, the Kansas City area remains flanked by massive polluters in two states, including Evergy’s Iatan plant in Missouri and the La Cygne Generating Station in Kansas. Together, these aging facilities contribute to premature deaths and illnesses across the region annually. Meanwhile, utilities in both Missouri and Kansas consistently lobby regulators to pass the high maintenance costs of these aging plants onto customers. Nationally, pollution from coal-fired power plants was responsible for approximately 460,000 premature deaths in the U.S. between 1999 and 2020. The hidden societal cost of this pollution is just as staggering, totaling up to $500 billion each year.

Compounding this, the heartland is grappling with unprecedented weather and storms every year, feeling the direct impact of a destabilized climate. The immense climate costs hit home and are now a year-round threat, demonstrated by the intense storms of summer 2024 and 2025 that caused repeated flash flooding across the Kansas City metropolitan are, the powerful derecho of 2023 that left thousands without power, and the dangerous heat domes that regularly push temperatures to life-threatening levels. The year 2025 has also seen a series of catastrophic events nationwide, from deadly floods across the Midwest and South to devastating flash floods in Texas that killed more than 100 people.

This policy of sacrificing public health is mirrored by one of intentional ignorance, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Billion-Dollar Disasters database — which documents nearly $3 trillion in escalating damages — is being retired and key federal scientists are being laid off. This dismantling of data and expertise comes as a catastrophic toll ravages the heartland, bringing loss of life, adverse health impacts, destroyed homes, flooded cropland and contaminated water supplies. Such devastation demands critical access to scientific information, urgent upgrades to our buildings and infrastructure, and an unwavering commitment to phasing out all remaining coal plants.

Quiet revolution of innovation, sustainability

But there is good news that directly refutes this narrative of fear. Since 2005, a quiet revolution has been unfolding in the U.S. building sector and architecture, design and planning communities — a story of efficiency, innovation and sustainability that goes largely unrecognized. The U.S. building sector has cut its electricity use by an impressive 10.7%, even while adding 70 billion square feet of new buildings. This sector includes America’s massive digital infrastructure, with 5,426 data centers — 10 times the number in China — and about half of the world’s largest hyperscale computing facilities. To grasp the scale of this achievement: It’s like building 44 new cities the size of Chicago yet still cutting the building sector’s power consumption.

This isn’t magic. It’s the result of better architecture and planning, building codes, smarter renovations, and improved equipment and appliances. This trend is especially important in the Kansas City region, which spans two states and has become a major national hub for energy-intensive data centers. According to the Energy Information Administration’s State Energy Data System, total energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings declined a stunning 22% in Kansas and 12% in Missouri from 2005 to 2023. While the states lack clean energy mandates, Kansas City has set its own goal to be carbon-neutral by 2040.

The evidence reveals a clear path forward. Our aging, expensive coal plants are not just a liability — they are an opportunity. Instead of spending billions propping up these polluting relics, we can transform their sites, along with their vital grid and infrastructure connections, into hubs of American innovation, powered by renewable energy farms.

This defines the heartland’s future: a win-win-win that turns sacrifice zones into innovative enterprise zones with high-paying jobs in technology and construction, lower energy bills for families and businesses and cleaner air for our children. The choice, then, is simple: We can cling to a past built on fear and fiction, or we can embrace a future built on facts and innovation.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles expired on Sept. 30, ending a $7,500 subsidy that had made cleaner cars more accessible to American buyers for more than a decade.

Introduced in 2008, the tax credits were meant to bridge the cost difference between gasoline and electric powered vehicles. The policy was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act until 2032, until the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” terminated it seven years early.

The termination arrives at a critical moment for the global automotive industry. China has surged ahead in battery production and electric vehicle, or EV, sales, while the European Union nations have established strict emission standards. Without similar federal commitments, the United States may lose ground in an industry expected to dominate transportation and energy markets.

In the final months of the subsidy, dealerships reported record sales as Americans rushed to secure credits before they disappeared. July and August marked the strongest months in U.S. history for EV sales, underscoring how tightly adoption has been linked to financial incentives. With the program ended, growth is expected to slow, raising concerns about both climate goals and industrial competitiveness.

“The loss of the tax credits for electric vehicles is likely to slow down the uptake of electric vehicles across the United States, and it is disappointing for those who want the U.S. to continue to move toward a clean energy future,” Daniel Esty LAW ’86, a professor of environmental law and policy at Yale Law School, said.

Esty, who previously served as commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, emphasized that states will now carry greater responsibility. States such as California, New York and Connecticut have already announced independent EV incentive programs, while others have adopted zero-emissions vehicle mandates. But Esty warned that without federal coordination, state-by-state efforts risk producing uneven results.

He said European governments are pursuing coordinated approaches that combine subsidies with renewable energy mandates. In Asia, China has paired consumer rebates with industrial policy, giving domestic automakers a dominant share of the global EV market. These strategies contrast sharply with U.S. retrenchment at the federal level.

American automakers, meanwhile, face increasing uncertainty. Shifting regulations and tariffs under the Trump administration have left other manufacturing policies open to reversals. Without confidence in expected demand, manufacturers may cut back on innovation or shift investment overseas.

“It’s very clear that U.S. automakers are disappointed by the administration’s policies broadly. They’re disappointed by the loss of the tax credits for electric vehicles. They’re unhappy with the tariffs that have been put in place,” Esty said.

EV incentives have had measurable effects on consumer behavior. Electric vehicles still carry higher upfront costs than gasoline-powered cars, and credits helped close that affordability gap for households.

Sales data from Autovista Group confirms the link. In the months before expiration, EVs accounted for more than 12 percent of new car purchases, a record high for the U.S. market. Much of that surge is attributed to consumers seeking to benefit from the subsidy before it disappeared.

“There’s evidence that a meaningful share, from 10 percent to 30 percent, of the EVs that were being sold were purchased because of the incentives,” Stephanie Weber, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Colorado Boulder, said.

Weber explained that automakers are already adjusting. Honda canceled a planned electric SUV this summer, citing reduced expectations for U.S. demand. General Motors and Volkswagen have similarly scaled back production schedules. Esty said that these decisions suggest that American companies are bracing for a weaker market than international competitors, who continue to expand under stronger government support.

Policy differences extend beyond subsidies. California has retained its right to impose stricter vehicle emissions standards, a move joined by 11 other states. But the elimination of federal penalties for failing to meet national efficiency standards has diluted the pressure on automakers at the national level.

Industry observers note that the absence of a unified policy creates uncertainty, which can chill investment. While international rivals benefit from stability, U.S. firms face a stop-and-start approach that complicates planning.

“We are going to see fewer new products than we might have otherwise,” Weber said. “Some automakers have actually canceled EV models that they had previously announced. For example, Honda canceled plans for a large electric SUV in July, anticipating a decrease in U.S. demand.”

Kenneth Gillingham, a Yale professor of environmental and energy economics, emphasized that the impact of EV subsidies cannot be understood in isolation. His research shows that in coal-heavy regions, EV adoption can actually prolong fossil fuel reliance unless accompanied by electricity-sector reforms. Consequently, subsidies alone are not enough to maximize climate benefits.

“This means a few things. One is that we should plan on carbon pricing at the social cost of carbon if that is at all possible politically. It also means that if we want EV adoption to reduce emissions as much as possible, we also need policies reducing emissions from the electricity sector,” Gillingham said.

He added that the repeal of subsidies may deepen divides in access to cleaner transportation. States that maintain their own programs or have cleaner grids are positioned to benefit first, leaving households in coal-heavy regions with fewer options and higher emissions. The result is that clean air and cost savings may increasingly be concentrated among wealthier communities.

Looking ahead, Gillingham stressed that policy uncertainty has broader implications beyond emissions. Automakers, utilities and investors rely on predictable signals when deciding where to put resources. Without them, the U.S. risks losing momentum in both innovation and industrial leadership at a time when international competitors are moving decisively.

Gillingham noted that consumer interest in EVs will persist. Battery prices are continuing to fall, operating costs remain lower than gasoline vehicles, and states are introducing new subsidy programs. Still, without federal backing, the pace of adoption is likely to flatten, leaving the United States less prepared for a transportation sector that is rapidly electrifying worldwide.

“It is always the case in energy and environmental policy that incentives matter,” Esty said. “And when an important incentive, like the tax credits that were in place, disappears, it slows down the progress for getting people to consider electric vehicles.”",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EVtaxcred_tk_AlexHong_contributing-photog-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 03:58:31.711357

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -

The U.S. government is considering cancelling billions of dollars in funding for clean energy programs, including awards for auto manufacturing and carbon capture, according to a list of targeted projects seen by Reuters.

Projects on the list include two major direct air capture hubs that received billion-dollar awards from former President Joe Biden's administration, including one that involves oil company Occidental .

Semafor reported the list earlier and said it could impact $12 billion in projects.

Also on the list is $500 million awarded last year to General Motors to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan to EVs; $335 million for Stellantis to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois to build mid-size electric trucks; and $250 million for Stellantis to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to produce EV components.

Last week, the Department of Energy announced plans to cancel $7.56 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects it said would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

The Energy Department is also considering rescinding a $32 million award to Hyundai Mobis which operates a Stellantis supplier in Ohio to produce plug-in hybrid components and battery packs and $89 million for Harley-Davidson expand its York, Pennsylvania plant for EV motorcycle manufacturing.

Also on the list is a $80 million award for Blue Bird to convert a former Georgia plant to build electric school buses; and $75 million to engine company Cummins to convert part of an existing Indiana plant to make zero-emission components and electric powertrain systems.

The DOE also is considering cutting $208 million for the Volvo Group to upgrade plants in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania to increase EV production capacity.

The Energy Department said in a statement it ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.""

Occidental, GM, Harley-Davidson and Stellantis declined or did not immediately comment.

The total sum of the grants in question was uncertain. The list included some projects that DOE said in May it canceled.

The previous cancellations included $331 million at an olefins plant carbon reduction at Exxon's Baytown, Texas refinery; $500 million to Heidelberg Materials, US in Louisiana; and $375 million to Eastman Chemical Company in Texas

Dive Brief:

Bosch has started volume production of hydrogen fuel cell modules for commercial trucks, the company said Thursday.

Electric truck maker Nikola Corp will be the pilot customer for the fuel cell modules.

Bosch is planning to invest nearly $2.8 billion in fuel cell development and manufacturing from 2021 to 2026.

Dive Insight:

Hydrogen-powered fuel cells are a viable alternative power source for electric commercial trucks, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Fully-electric trucks, on the other hand, require a large, heavy battery with long charge times, making them less ideal for commercial use, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

By 2030, Bosch expects one in five new trucks weighing six tons or more globally to feature a fuel-cell powertrain.

The first fuel cell modules produced by Bosch in Germany will be used for the Nikola Tre FCEV Class 8 truck. Bosch also plans to manufacture fuel cell stacks in China and eventually at its U.S. factory in Anderson, South Carolina.

Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electric power, so electric trucks can be equipped with a much smaller battery that provides additional power during acceleration in conjunction with the fuel stack. Additional energy is stored in the battery via regenerative braking, just like in an electric car.

Unlike diesel-powered trucks, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles also produce zero tailpipe emissions. Water is the only byproduct of a fuel-cell vehicle.

“A hydrogen engine can do everything a diesel engine does, but on top of that, it is carbon neutral. It also allows a fast and cost-effective entry into hydrogen-based mobility,” Bosch Mobility Chair Markus Heyn said in a statement.

Nikola’s hydrogen fuel cell Class 8 truck will have a max range of 500 miles and produce 536 horsepower, according to the company. The fuel cell modules in the Nikola Tre FCEV deliver 200 kW of power when combined with a 164 kWh battery pack. The liquid hydrogen is stored onboard in pressurized tanks, and refilling the tanks takes about 20 minutes.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gXv4Pcs5LmNcCF6A9UM4PzYrylsaR_jPgfeFIGMRNFw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9uaWtvbGEucG5n.webp,N,,2025-10-08 04:59:25.070287

Destroying chargers is a common form of EV vandalism.
EV vandalism can deter people from making their next car an electric vehicle, and they'll miss out on the benefits an EV has to offer.
Since gas-powered cars constantly release planet-warming gases, gas cars will never be able to pay off their production debt.
Commenters were frustrated with the rise of EV vandalism and the lack of consequences.","A Redditor found a public electric vehicle charger destroyed and shared the concerning scene on r/Elektroautos, simply asking, ""Why?""

This unfortunate discovery can be day-ruining for EV drivers.

The charging station's cords have been sliced off the machine, rendering it useless. For drivers, this can be a big inconvenience, and for the charger's owner, it's a financial burden to replace.

Destroying chargers is a common form of EV vandalism. While some vandals may be motivated by the valuable copper in chargers, others have a negative perception of EVs. This anti-EV sentiment can manifest as someone with a gas-powered vehicle parking in EV-designated spots, keying cars, or slashing tires.

EV vandalism can deter people from making their next car an electric vehicle, and they'll miss out on the benefits an EV has to offer.

Charging an EV costs far less than gas — EV drivers save ""up to $2,200 a year for a fully electric vehicle, and $1,500 for a hybrid electric vehicle,"" according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Regular maintenance is also more cost-effective, as EVs typically don't require oil changes, spark plug replacements, and other repairs that gas-powered cars need.

Not only are EVs better for your wallet, but they're also far more sustainable than their gas-powered counterparts. While a gas-powered car releases around five tons of carbon dioxide each year, EVs produce no tailpipe pollution at all.

This helps the EV pay off its lifetime carbon debt (the pollution released during production). Since gas-powered cars constantly release planet-warming gases, gas cars will never be able to pay off their production debt.

Charging at home is even better than charging at public stations — even if you don't have solar panels for free electricity — since it can be done more cheaply and overnight while you sleep. While all EVs and plug-in hybrids come with a Level 1 charging adapter that works on a standard wall outlet for about 30-40 miles of charge overnight, Qmerit is a great place to look if you want to upgrade to a fast Level 2 charger that can get you from empty to 80% in four to 10 hours.

Commenters were frustrated with the rise of EV vandalism and the lack of consequences.

Dick Urquhart, the founding father and first club president at CCNC, called the land on which the club is located the Royal Dornoch Golf Village.
“The connection that Pinehurst and the area and CCNC have to Donald Ross and Dornoch Scotland means a lot,"" said Sutton.
Royal Dornoch captain Gary Bethune took the loss with a large dose of sportsmanship.
“It’s something we want to build on,” said Royal Dornoch General Manager Neil Hampton.","On the heels of a contentious Ryder Cup, a different scenario played out recently at The Country Club of North Carolina (CCNC). The focus for the American and European amateur golfers on hand in the Sandhills of Pinehurst was instead on fun and friendship.

Two teams of 12 players played a Ryder Cup format match over three days at the Dogwood and Cardinal Courses of CCNC as part of the annual competition between The Country Club of North Carolina – one of the top private clubs in an area known as the “Home of American Golf” -- and Royal Dornoch, the heralded Scottish club home to a course that sits No. 2 in Golf Digest’s ranking of courses outside the United States. The matches have been contested, home and away, since 2011.

CCNC, which opened in 1963, is the only club in the U.S. with a reciprocal relationship with Royal Dornoch Golf Club, the birthplace and home of legendary golf architect Donald Ross, whose work is embraced by golfers throughout the Pinehurst region – from a handful of courses at the Pinehurst Resort to popular facilities like Mid Pines and Pine Needles. Dick Urquhart, the founding father and first club president at CCNC, called the land on which the club is located the Royal Dornoch Golf Village.

On the wall of CCNC’s Dornoch Grill, a prominently displayed framed scroll reads: ‘With this message of greeting goes our hope that Dornoch, Sutherland and Dornoch, North Carolina may continue to have close and increasingly friendly relations for many years to come.’ It was signed and sealed by Royal Dornoch GC captain W.B. Alford in 1971, and the annual match is a byproduct of that lasting relationship.

CCNC General Manager and Chief Operating Officer Jim Sutton said the competition is an important tradition that goes back to the vision of the founders of the club.

“The connection that Pinehurst and the area and CCNC have to Donald Ross and Dornoch Scotland means a lot,"" said Sutton. ""What’s fun each year is the camaraderie. It’s really just all about golf. It’s been great to host these guys. The connection with Donald Ross having been born in Dornoch and then coming here to the States to work (and) doing a lot of his best work in Pinehurst. There's a fraternal connection and, even though we are separated by a lot of distance, the spirit of the game is alive in both destinations.”

The eagerly anticipated match between CCNC and Royal Dornoch didn’t finish with a final score as close as the at-times contentious and controversial Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York. The team from CCNC won the match prize, the Roly Bluck Putter, on their home turf by a score of 18.5 to 6.5.

Royal Dornoch captain Gary Bethune took the loss with a large dose of sportsmanship.

“It is played in the friendliest manner you could imagine,” he said. “There's a lot of banter. There's some alcohol involved, which can fuel the banter. Each match just gets better and better. The camaraderie amongst the guys is lovely.""

But he also offered some words of caution, with a laugh, about next year’s match at Royal Dornoch: ""They have a chance, but it’s a small one.”

The event is one of many around the U.S. that’s played in the spirit and format of the Ryder Cup – a team golf competition intended to foster rivalry and camaraderie.

But perhaps none have ties that run quite as deep in the golf world as the CCNC-Royal Dornoch matches. Some connections are even tangential. Consider, for example, that the designer of CCNC’s Dogwood Course, prominent North Carolina golf architect Ellis Maples, is the son of Frank Maples, who served as Donald Ross’ course construction supervisor and was superintendent of Pinehurst No. 2.

The historical ties are why the team from Royal Dornoch isn’t just eager to try and reclaim the title in the U.K. in 2026 but to return to the U.S. and Pinehurst region in 2027.

“It’s something we want to build on,” said Royal Dornoch General Manager Neil Hampton. “We've got so many players that want to be part of it. Not just to come to CCNC, which is one of mainstays but Pinehurst itself and soak up the atmosphere here and see what golf means to everybody in America and what Donald Ross has given everybody in America. We are so happy that we share Mr. Ross with everybody, and he's left his legacy that we can come and enjoy too.""",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68e5c59200f7944e0e7efeff/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-08 04:59:30.569504

The Section 32 and 33 Mines includes an area of former mining operations and surrounding contaminated areas in the Eastern Abandoned Uranium Mine Region of the Navajo Nation. In 2012, mine waste from the Section 32 portion of the site was collected and covered in a 15-acre on-site fenced repository.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working with the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency (NNEPA) to oversee investigation and cleanup at the site while pursuing enforcement efforts with potentially responsible parties.

Background

Section 32 and 33 Mines is an inactive uranium mine located north of Prewitt, New Mexico. Commercial exploration, development, and mining of uranium at Section 32 and 33 Mines site began in 1960 by the Kerr-McGee Corporation (Kerr-McGee), a predecessor of Tronox. Both mines are reported to be last operated by the Cobb Nuclear Company.

The Section 32 Mine is within Navajo Allotment Land, and the Section 33 Mine is privately owned. Mining at Section 32 and 33 Mines occurred between 1960 and 1969, producing a total of 24,360 tons of ore, 20,117 tons from Section 32 Mine and 4,243 tons from Section 33 Mine. The mines were deep, dry underground mines accessed by vertical mine shafts.

Ore from the mines was moved to the Section 32 and 33 Mines Transfer Station south of the main mining area, and then hauled off site on the unpaved road to the west to County Route 19. Ore was transported approximately 50 miles from the site to the Ambrosia Lake uranium mill located to the east and north of Grants, New Mexico.

The mines were “dry mines,” meaning that the mined ore was above the water table and did not require water to be pumped out.

Cleanup Results to Date

In 2009 and 2012, EPA conducted assessments of the site, and then in 2012 completed a “removal action” and reclamation work at the Section 32 portion of the site, including the Section 32 and 33 Mines Transfer Station. The work consolidated all the waste from Section 32 in an on-site repository that remains covered and fenced. In 2019, EPA conducted a Removal Site Evaluation field investigation and report later that same year. In 2022 EPA collected additional data at the Section 32 and 33 Mines site, the haul road, and the former transfer station to aid the development of the Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis (EE/CA).

Action Memorandum: Selection of the Removal Action

On September 30, 2025, the EPA Region 9 Superfund Director signed the Action Memorandum for the Section 32 and 33 Mines site. The selected removal action involves excavating waste from the Site and disposing of it off-site in a planned mine waste repository at the Red Rocks Landfill property near Thoreau, New Mexico. The repository will be permitted by the State of New Mexico to permanently hold the uranium mine waste rock so that human and environmental health are protected. This action meets the goals laid out in the Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines Ten-Year Plan.

Next Steps: Permitting, Design, and Removal

The removal action selected in the Action Memorandum will remove about 70,000 cubic yards of waste from the Section 32 and 33 Mines site. To complete this selected action, the Northwest New Mexico Regional Solid Waste Authority, the Red Rocks Landfill operator, will work with the State of New Mexico to obtain the necessary permits to operate and permanently manage a mine waste rock repository on their property. Once the permits are obtained from the State, the removal work will begin. Excavation and transport of waste could take up to 18 months, with the entire removal action process estimated to take 3-6 years, including permitting, construction, operation, and closure of the new repository at the Red Rocks Landfill property.

Community Involvement

Community members have an opportunity to become involved in the cleanup activities and help shape cleanup decisions. EPA and NNEPA meet regularly, in coordination with chapter officials, with residents and other community members about work at the Section 32 and 33 Mines site.

Who is the Community?

The community includes people in both rural areas and more populated areas around Prewitt, Casamero Lake, Smith Lake, and Borrego Pass. Many people graze livestock near mine sites. The Section 32 and 33 Mines are located in the Casamero Lake chapter.

EPA and NNEPA Community Involvement Activities

EPA and NNEPA works with community leaders such as the council delegates, chapter, grazing and land board officials, responsible company liaisons, as well as community members for all outreach activities and information sessions which are conducted with cultural sensitivity. To keep the community informed, EPA and NNEPA has done the following:

Developed fact sheets and flyers

Conducted interviews for a Community Involvement Plan

Attend chapter meetings to share information on cleanup progress

Held open house meetings and workshops to share and receive input on cleanup alternatives

Worked with chapter officials and family members to gain access to mine sites

Attended local chapter meetings to share site investigation information

Partnerships

EPA and NNEPA continue to work and strengthen relationships with a number of organizations focused on uranium and radiation, including:

Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Lands Program

Indian Health Service Community Uranium Exposure-Journey to Healing

Indian Health Service Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program

Office of Navajo Uranium Workers

Navajo Birth Cohort Study

Navajo Nation Department of Health Community Health Representatives

Bureau of Indian Affairs

Indian Health Service

Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Department of Energy

University of New Mexico

Northern Arizona University

Others as suggested by community members and local officials

Cleanup Progress Timeline

Before 2009, the buildings and aboveground structures were removed prior to EPA’s initial assessment, presumably by the owners/operators.

2025

On September 30, 2025, EPA Region 9 signed the Action Memorandum for the Section32 and 33 Mines site. The cleanup plan selected in the Action Memorandum entails removing uranium mine waste rock from areas on Navajo Nation and private land adjacent to Navajo communities and transporting it to a newly created off-site repository at the Red Rocks Landfill property east of Thoreau, New Mexico. This action will remove about 70,000 cubic yards of waste from the mine sites.

2024

Develop Community Involvement Plan for Section 32 and Section 33 mine sites.

2012

Section 32 mine was backfilled and 3 mine shafts were closed

A total of 34,686 cubic yards of waste from 15 areas on-site were combined into a stockpile on Section 32 mine including:

The Indiana Citizen

October 7, 2025

State Rep. Pat Boy, a Michigan City Democrat who championed social, economic and environmental justice, has announced that she will be retiring from the Indiana General Assembly on Oct. 17, after serving three terms.

Boy was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in November 2018. She won the Democratic Party nomination in a three-way primary battle that year and then swept her Republican opponent, Dan Granquist, in the general election with 60% of the vote. However, in subsequent elections, GOP challengers ate into her winning margins with Boy winning just 51% of the vote in the November 2024 contest against Republican Joel Florek.

Prior to becoming a state legislator, Boy served on the Michigan City Common Council for nearly 15 years.

In a press release from the Indiana House Democratic Caucus, Boy said she had made the “bittersweet decision” to retire and focus on her family.

“Although I am stepping away from elected office, my heart will always be with the people I had the privilege to serve,” Boy said in her statement. “I wish my colleagues in the General Assembly continued success and thank them for their friendship and partnership throughout the years. I will be spending more time with my family and my cat, tending to my long-neglected garden and staying engaged in the community that has given me so much.”

In the Indiana House, Boy served on the Environmental Affairs Committee and the Elections and Apportionment Committee, and was the ranking Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee. Her work in helping Michigan City residents protect a wetland inspired her successful run for a seat on the common council in 2004 at the encouragement of many of her neighbors.

Boy authored several unsuccessful bills focused on the environment, including legislation requiring the reporting of certain spills into bodies of water, allowing a property tax deduction for maintaining a qualified wetlands area, and establishing a grant program for greenhouse gas emissions inventory and regulating coal combustion residuals. She also filed bills which sought to require lead testing in schoolchildren, increase the minimum wage, mandate all elections be conducted by mail, and repeal the state’s right to work law.

None of the legislation Boy introduced was passed into law until the 2025 session, when two of her bills were signed by Republican Gov. Mike Braun. Her bill expanding the definition of emergency medication to include overdose reversal drugs and removing the supplemental registration fee for electric vehicles from motor driven cycles passed with strong bipartisan support.

“This work has been both challenging and deeply rewarding,” Boy said in her statement. “I am especially proud of the work we have done together to protect Indiana’s natural environment, strengthen public health and safety, and give a voice to those who too often go unheard. Sometimes those attempts were unsuccessful, but they called attention to those issues. Getting two of my bills signed into law this past session, HEA 1376 and HEA 1380, was a milestone that reminded me how collaboration and persistence can lead to real results for our communities.”

House Democratic leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, credited Boy with “creating a better state” for all Hoosiers.

“It has been a pleasure to work alongside Rep. Boy for the past seven years,” GiaQuinta said in a statement. “During that time, she fought for vulnerable Hoosiers, worked to protect Indiana’s environment and enhanced public health and safety throughout our state.”

Boy, a college graduate with a bachelor’s degree in English, has been a strong proponent of education, believing “education is never wasted,” according to her biography. She was a union worker and, with her husband, owned a small secretarial/data management business from 1988 until just after his death in 2016.

The experience of caring for her husband, who became a quadriplegic after a car accident, taught Boy about the “desperate need” for Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, according to her biography. She credited the Affordable Care Act with helping her and her husband manage his medical bills and keep them from declaring bankruptcy.

Boy is a member of the League of Women Voters and the LaPorte County Chapter of the NAACP.

In contrast to recent years, Boy has so far been the only state lawmaker to leave the General Assembly in 2025.

Last year, three lawmakers – Democratic Reps. David Vinzant and Wendy Dant Chesser, and Democratic Sen. La Keisha Jackson – were elected in a party caucus to fill the vacant seats of former legislators. Vinzant was defeated in the November 2024 election by his caucus opponent, Mark Spencer. In 2023, five lawmakers – Republican Reps. Lori Goss-Reaves and Alex Zimmerman, and Republican Sens. Randy Maxwell, Greg Goode and Cyndi Carrasco – were caucused into the legislature.

Also, three representatives did not run for re-election in 2024. Republicans Randy Lyness, of West Harrison, and Denny Zent, of Angola, retired last year after their terms ended while Democrat Ryan Hatfield, D-Evansville, decided to forgo another run for the legislature in order to enter the race for Vanderburgh County Circuit Court Judge, which he won.

The process and date for selecting an individual to serve the remainder of Boy’s term has not been announced.

DOE maintains that these decisions are driven by a new internal policy launched in May 2025. The policy, “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance”, requires case-by-case reviews, additional documentation from awardees, and stricter economic viability standards.

The optics of cutting direct air capture and carbon capture projects may create tension with the fossil fuel sector’s interest in carbon reinjection and enhanced oil recovery. DAC projects, in particular, have found support from oil and gas companies, because captured CO? can be channeled into existing fields.

About the Lawsuit

Dow and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

On July 24, 2025, the Company disclosed a 2Q 2025 non-GAAP loss per share of $0.42, much larger than the approximate $0.17 to $0.18 per share loss expected by analysts, and net sales of $10.1 billion, representing a 7.3% year-over-year decline and missing consensus estimates by $130 million, “reflecting declines in all operating segments” due in part to “the lower-for-longer earnings environment that our industry is facing, amplified by recent trade and tariff uncertainties.” Further, the Company disclosed that it was cutting its dividend in half, from $0.70 per share to only $0.35 per share, citing the need for “financial flexibility amidst a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment.”

On this news, the price of Dow’s shares fell $5.30 per share, or 17.45%, to close at $25.07 per share on July 24, 2025.

The case is Sarti v. Dow Inc., No. 25-cv-12744.

,North Carolina and Evs,2025-10-08 01:01:04+00:00,News From The States,Kansas town embraces 'generation worth of improvements' as Panasonic ramps up production,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kansas-town-embraces-generation-worth-improvements-panasonic-ramps-production,"DE SOTO — This small town is moving forward with plans for major developments even though Panasonic may delay full production at its new electric vehicle battery plant.

Martin Boyda, a resident of Kansas City, Kansas, said he has concerns about the water and electricity usage necessary for a data center.","DE SOTO — This small town is moving forward with plans for major developments even though Panasonic may delay full production at its new electric vehicle battery plant.

The newest developments include plans for hundreds of housing options with apartments, homes and a hotel, in addition to the opening of a data center and an expansion to Merck Animal Health’s facility.

De Soto is a town of about 6,500 people, so the planned hiring of 4,000 people at Panasonic, in addition to new housing and other businesses coming to town, means at least an additional 60% of people spending time at local businesses and using roads and other town infrastructure. Some residents are coping with the changes to the town’s character and desire for more information about environmental impacts from new development.

De Soto Mayor Rick Walker said he is confident Panasonic will meet its obligations and this his opinion about the project hasn’t changed.

“It was good for the city when we first saw it. It’s still good for the city,” he said. “I mean, it’s a generation worth of improvements that were built in a span of three years, and that’s just completely unimaginable that we would have been able to do that. But it’s happened and it’s here and no regrets, no second thoughts.”

The $4 billion Panasonic plant was expected to reach full production by March 2027 but reports suggest that goal has been delayed due to the dropping electric car sales and federal policies that don’t support green energy.

Sarah King, Panasonic Energy chief people officer, and Panasonic spokesperson Alison Klooster did not respond directly to questions about when full production would begin but said they are still planning to reach the original planned output.

“I think it’s something similar to how we opened in July, like yeah, I believe our initial goal was quarter one of 2025. It was a few months later, but we did open and we’re up and running,” Klooster said.

Many factors are at play, making it difficult to provide a specific timeline, she said. Hiring sustainability and construction timing are some of those factors, Klooster added.

She said the plant just sent out its millionth battery last month.

“People want things to happen on different timelines sometimes, but it’s happening on the timeline that we can sustain in the community and make sure that we make a lasting, positive impact,” Klooster said.

The factory has hired just over 1,200 employees, including production workers and support staff, and is still on track for 4,000 total employees, King said.

It’s also dependent on apprenticeship programs and time needed to get workers ready, she said.

“We’re finding that these programs are so strong that people are able to actually come in and get to work faster than what we really thought that they were going to be,” she said.

King said employees are still being hired from within a 50-mile radius of De Soto.

Panasonic’s impact

De Soto’s 2023 Panasonic development agreement included a tax increment financing district for the company, which uses property tax collected from the increased value of the development to pay for costs associated with needed infrastructure improvements.

The agreement provided about $229 million for public infrastructure projects like roadway construction, water treatment storage, sewer treatment and fire safety projects.

Most of the infrastructure projects included in the agreement are either almost done or will be done in early 2026, Walker said.

The agreement also noted that in order to receive the tax increment financing funding, Panasonic must invest at least $1 billion and operate the facility that employs 2,500 full-time employees.

Walker said he’s spoken with Lt. Governor David Toland and others from the Kansas Department of Commerce about what De Soto projects mean for the greater Kansas economy. De Soto remains a key part in attracting business to Kansas, he said.

“When you’re sitting on the sidelines and you’ve adjusted maybe to Panasonic coming and then another big project comes, that seems like whiplash,” Walker said. “But these projects have been a long time coming.”

De Soto City Council President Rob Daniels said community response to all the developments is mixed, but most residents acknowledge that change was coming.

Development on the former Sunflower Ammunition Plant was going to happen with or without Panasonic, Daniels said.

“You don’t spend a billion dollars or more cleaning up a site for it to sit and be nothing,” he said.

He said the development is good for the community, and also noted that EV sales slowing doesn’t mean the industry is dying off.

All these projects are to the benefit of the community, whether it’s getting a new community center without having to raise taxes or continuing to lower the city’s portion of property tax bills, he said.

Future data center

The city council recently approved a development agreement with Mount Sunflower LLC for a $3.1 billion data center at Flint Commerce Center south of Kansas Highway 10, which runs through De Soto’s south side.

The four buildings would total approximately 1.14 million square feet with construction targeted to start this spring, Walker said. The project won’t be completed until around 2035.

The project will use industrial revenue bonds, which enable property tax abatements and construction sales tax exemptions.

The center itself won’t bring a lot of jobs, but construction will bring workers to the area, which will increase retail activity, Walker said.

The city will also receive franchise fees from the center’s electricity use once it is up and running, he said.

Walker said that although data centers are not the right fit for everywhere, this spot was already appropriately zoned and will be a “less intense use” than previously envisioned. Originally, the plan was to have another 8 million square feet in addition to the already existing building, with possibly 1,000 employees and truck docks, he said.

The data center will ultimately be around 100 employees and will have significantly less traffic and noise impacts than previously planned for, he said.

Residents spoke at a city council meeting in August expressing concerns about the project’s environmental impacts, especially water use.

Martin Boyda, a resident of Kansas City, Kansas, said he has concerns about the water and electricity usage necessary for a data center.

He said he has wondered if the city has the infrastructure necessary to make this center possible. He also said he is an avid user of the river and has concerns about ecological impacts of increased water being pulled from it.

“We hear about the millions of gallons a day that these data centers use, and that brings concern to me, and it would be nice to get some information about whether we have the capacity ecologically to support a situation like this,” he said.

Walker said Kansas is one of the greener power producing states in the country, making it a better place for this type of center. He also said this project would have less storm water runoff because of less impervious surfaces with this development. The city will work with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the process to ensure they are abiding by state environmental standards, Walker said.

“Data centers are a necessary part of the infrastructure,” Walker said. “There are environmental issues associated with it, but it’s true for any development, and I think that given what this project brings, the environmental concerns can be planned in the process, mitigated. We rely on our planning process, along with KDHE and their permitting to ensure that we’re not creating an adverse impact for our community.”

Residents have shared concerns about the electricity and water needed for the data center, but the facility will not make residents’ bills higher, he said.

Walker said the city will work to make sure the facility is using best practice for efficient water use, but also said it is in their best interest to use less in order to spend less.

Evergy has planned for the power necessary, and the Kansas Corporation Commission has instituted rules that say heavy users that put strains on the system will pay more, Walker said.

The city has the capacity to provide the water necessary without causing adverse impacts on the area, he said.

De Soto resident Dally Holloway said with all the growth in De Soto, many residents feel as if they weren’t getting clear answers about what was happening. More people started wanting more information about development, she said.

“They don’t seem to like the idea of a multibillion dollar corporation that we don’t even know who it is receiving what citizens feel is tax-free opportunities to build on land without citizen input,” Holloway said.

Pam and Doug Ebert, De Soto residents and owners of the Cedar Lane Bed and Breakfast, described their feelings toward recent development as “cautiously pleased.”

More people and more businesses coming to town is a plus, but there’s a way to expand while keeping the small town-feel and keeping any strain off the existing community, they said.

Doug Ebert said he is glad to see other industries go into the area in case EV sales slow. His other concerns are about increased traffic in town, but said the additional money for road upkeep and other ancillary businesses coming to town are a positive.

“Well, when you’ve got more people working in an area, the infrastructure around that area does get built up,” he said.

Other development

Merck Animal Health announced earlier this year a $895 million expansion with plans to create 200 new jobs.

Merck will invest $860 million in its existing facility and another $35 million its research and development lab. It’ll be about 200,000 square feet once expanded.

Walker said Merck has submitted construction documents to city staff for them to review and seem to be on track to get permits completed for construction to start in the spring, he said.

De Soto is also continuing to plan for GRATA Development’s Limestone project. The mixed-use project has gone through the first step after the city council approved an incentive package and new zoning for the area.

The project includes a new hotel with 75% tax abatement for 10 years, and around 100 homes part of a reinvestment housing incentive district. The additional homes will help with the city’s limited housing supply, Walker said. The project also includes a 350-unit multifamily residential development that will also receive 75% tax abatement for 10 years, according to the meeting agenda.

De Soto resident Toni Caldwell said she tries to look at development from both sides — but ultimately is sad to see the changes coming to town. She also has concerns about transparency surrounding the projects, traffic and tax abatements, she said.

Caldwell said she knew the town was struggling economically, and had problems keeping up with infrastructure needs. That’s something that Panasonic has helped with, she said, but she still has concerns about its environmental impacts.

She said it’s disappointing to see changes to the community she’s lived in for so long but that she knows change was inevitable with the open land.

“You really have to look at both sides of it, and it’s hard to do when it’s a community you love and it’s changing, and so it makes it very difficult,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_0135-1024x5631759844938.jpg?h=69549390&itok=_KiExzUG,N,,2025-10-07 22:02:42.307873

Nightpeak Energy’s 150-MW Bocanova Power battery array in Brazoria County achieved commercial operation late this summer. The battery project is capable of two-hour duration and helping respond to the Houston area’s peak capacity needs.

""This battery storage project will enhance grid reliability in the Alvin area while continuing to support integrating renewable energy,” Cary Perrin, president and CEO of the Northern Brazoria County Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “I believe we need energy storage now more than ever for its pivotal role in reducing strain on the grid while meeting fast-growing power demand in Texas and Brazoria County.""

The project uses Tesla's Megapack 2 XL battery storage systems manufactured in Lathrop, California. The facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment grade power purchaser.

Texas is the nation’s leader in new battery storage and has tripled its installed capacity to more than 9 GW in just the past two years, according to reports. Energy storage helps balance the intermittency of renewable energy assets on the grid and offers added dispatchable power on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system, which has been vulnerable to outages and peak demand challenges in the past.

“Unprecedented AI data center and manufacturing growth has only accelerated the need for dispatchable capacity resources,” said Paris Hays, Co-founder and CEO/CDO, Nightpeak Energy. “Nightpeak now owns and operates 240 MW of battery storage and natural gas generation facilities, with more energy infrastructure projects on the way in Texas and in the Western U.S.""

Nord/LB and MUFG Bank served as co-lead arrangers on the debt financing which included a tax equity bridge loan, construction to term loan, and letters of credit.

The News

The Trump administration’s recent decision to rescind nearly $8 billion in funding for innovative energy projects could drive tech and fossil fuel companies to look outside the US for technologies both industries are keen to make use of.

The cuts affected more than 300 projects that received funding from the Department of Energy under the Biden administration, and overwhelmingly targeted projects located in majority-Democrat states.

One of the major casualties of the cuts was carbon removal: About $50 million in funding was rescinded for a range of projects tinkering with different methods for pulling CO2 from the atmosphere. That may come as little surprise, given President Donald Trump’s clear disinterest in mitigating climate change. But while the administration may be skeptical about the merits of such projects for their climate bona fides, carbon removal is nonetheless a growing global industry, driven in large part by interest from high-emissions industries like tech and oil. If the US no longer welcomes it, the carbon removal companies involved seem willing and able to look for a home elsewhere.

One company affected by the cuts was the California startup CarbonCapture Inc., which saw about $16 million withdrawn from three carbon removal projects it was involved in. CarbonCapture was an early beneficiary of the race by tech companies to buy carbon removal credits as a way of erasing their historic emissions, signing a deal with Microsoft back in 2023. But without the federal funding, those three projects — one each in California, Illinois, and Louisiana — are now “dead,” CEO Adrian Corless told Semafor. Even before the cuts, because of the Trump administration’s volatile approach to energy policy, Corless had already made a decision to relocate the company’s biggest-ever pilot plant from Arizona to Canada.

“What happened last week reinforced that we made the right decision and that for the foreseeable future, the US isn’t going to be where we focus our business,” he said. “The US developed itself into, by far, the leader in carbon removal over the past eight or so years. Now it would appear that [the Trump administration] is quite comfortable ceding that leadership role and just stepping away from it.”

Tim’s view

The DOE funding cuts are the latest sign the administration is willing to put its animosity toward Democrats and anything that smacks of climate action above opportunities to lead in promising new industries.

Wind and solar energy were targeted early on, along with electric vehicles. The latest cuts go further, yanking support for low-carbon hydrogen, virtual power plants, and electric grid improvements in addition to carbon removal. The VPP and grid cuts will work against the administration’s goal of lowering retail power prices. And the hydrogen and carbon removal cuts will hurt nascent technologies that serve the long-term interests of the oil and gas industry. Capturing, transporting, and storing carbon are natural extensions of oil companies’ traditional engineering skillsets. Captured carbon can also be used to push more oil out of wells.

AD

Tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have committed to buying millions of dollars in carbon removal credits as a cornerstone of their climate strategies, which haven’t changed despite the shifting political winds in the US. Carbon removal is also one of the few corners of cleantech where China has yet to dominate, Corless said, leaving an opening for other countries to seize. Altogether, carbon removal could evolve into a $1.2 trillion industry by 2050, according to a McKinsey forecast.

“What’s most at stake with these funding cuts is American competitiveness, and the economic benefits that come with being a leader in carbon management,” said Ben Rubin, executive director of the Carbon Business Council, an advocacy group. “An increasing number of companies are looking to other regions to deploy.”

Room for Disagreement

The administration didn’t offer a rationale for how it chose the specific projects to have their funding canceled, but it’s reasonable to be skeptical of how much of a climate benefit carbon removal will be able to make. Out of roughly 9 billion tons of CO2 that need to be removed annually from the atmosphere until 2050 to keep temperatures in line with the Paris Agreement, only about 2 billion are currently being removed, mostly by nature-based solutions like reforestation. Tech-heavy approaches like direct air capture, the method employed by CarbonCapture Inc., account for well below 1 million tons per year. One high-profile DAC project currently produces more CO2 than it captures.

And although Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that more project cancellations are forthcoming, for now some of the carbon removal projects most closely linked to Big Oil, including projects being run by Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, haven’t faced the ax. And the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture was actually expanded, not eliminated, in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Notable

The Trump administration’s interference with wind projects is “very damaging,” the head of Shell’s US division said. “However far the pendulum swings one way, it’s likely that it’s going to swing just as far the other way,” Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, told the Financial Times.

The World

at a Glance

The price of gold topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday, a reflection of the unease plaguing both investors and central banks.

Gold is widely seen as a safe haven asset during turbulent times, and analysts attribute the latest surge to a desire among financiers to move away from US assets, even as stocks have hit new highs: The country’s government shutdown, delaying the release of official government economic data, has particularly heightened anxiety. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio compared the current environment to the inflation-heavy early 1970s, calling gold an “excellent diversifier,” although Bank of America warned of “uptrend exhaustion.”

Jewelry companies have begun raising the alarm over possible price increases afflicting already-weary consumers.

This year has been defined by global trade turbulence, yet more goods are set to move across borders in 2025 than in 2024, according to new World Trade Organization estimates.

After US President Donald Trump unveiled sky-high tariffs in April, the WTO forecast that global trade would contract by 0.2%; but many duties have since come down, while purchases of AI-related equipment — semiconductors, computers, cloud servers — have propped up cross-border commerce.

The world’s trading system “has been knocked, it’s been battered, but it is showing very strong resilience at the core,” WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said at a recent Semafor event. Still, the organization slashed its 2026 outlook, forecasting the world’s economy will cool.

Israel marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that triggered the conflict that has reshaped the Middle East.

The country has won since major victories against regional enemies, including Iran and Hezbollah, but at a huge cost: 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, famine has taken hold in Gaza, and Israel is increasingly isolated.

Other countries’ politics have been affected, too. Zohran Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor of New York City in large part because of his support for Palestinian rights, while governments across Europe have accelerated support for a Palestinian state.

A truce may finally be close, with Israeli and Hamas leaders nearing a ceasefire at talks brokered by US President Donald Trump.

US President Donald Trump met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, with the countries at loggerheads over trade and Trump’s comments about annexing the country’s northern neighbor.

Canada is the only G7 country not to have reached a trade deal with the US this year; a North American free trade agreement protects Ottawa from some tariffs, but it is still subject to punishing steel duties, among others.

Carney promised to be tough on Trump but Canadian firms are shedding jobs and exports are down. The Canadian leader must walk a tightrope: Trump is deeply unpopular north of the border after repeatedly suggesting making Canada the “51st state.” Polls found that 60% of Canadians say they can never fully trust the US again.

AI-powered science is advancing so quickly that it may soon make a discovery worthy of a Nobel Prize without human intervention, scientists predicted.

The Nobel Turing Challenge was established in 2016 to offer a prize for a machine that can achieve a discovery equivalent to the most cutting-edge human research. For a discovery to count, the AI has to oversee the entire project, from hypothesis generation to experiment design to data analysis. Machines are already assisting human researchers in almost every step of that process, but being truly autonomous is still a leap forward.

“It’s almost certain” that AI will reach that level eventually, one researcher told Nature: “The question is if it will take 50 years or 10.”

The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for research that showed the impact of quantum mechanics on everyday-sized objects.

Quantum effects were known at the level of atoms, but in the 1980s John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis showed that at very low temperatures, the strange behavior — such as particles moving directly through apparently impassable barriers — could be demonstrated in objects large enough to be held in the hand.

The discovery paved the way for quantum computing and other quantum technologies, and opened the door to several multi-billion-dollar industries. One winner of yesterday’s Physiology prize is yet to be contacted, as he is off the grid, “living his best life” hiking in Idaho.

US President Donald Trump agreed to meet his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after a “very good” call, marking a thaw in relations that were at their worst in decades.

Trump slapped a 50% tariff on Brasília — despite the US having a trade surplus with Brazil — over what he called a “witch hunt” against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally convicted over a coup plot. Analysts said the call pointed at Trump breaking with Bolsonaro, who doesn’t have a clear path back to the presidency.

Lula welcomed the shift, calling on former spats to be forgotten: “Neither the American nor the Brazilian people can suffer because of our mistakes,” he told TV Mirante.

A Sudanese militia leader was found guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region 20 years ago, in a conflict that became a prelude to the country’s present-day disaster.

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman was a leader of the Janjaweed militia, which killed hundreds of thousands of members of Darfur’s non-Arab population in the early 2000s, sparking one of the world’s gravest and most enduring humanitarian crises.

After the war, many Janjaweed fighters joined the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring parties in Sudan’s current civil war. The RSF is once again besieging Darfur, putting millions of lives at risk, with the conflict sparking the first declaration of famine globally in years.

Renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s primary source of electricity in the first half of 2025, according to new data from the energy think tank Ember. Solar power led the charge, covering 83% of the increase in electricity demand.

Ember described the moment as a “crucial turning point,” whereby clean power can keep pace with rapidly growing energy needs, particularly as the world faces the huge increase in power necessary to fuel the AI boom.

However, the think tank warned that there are significant regional differences behind the numbers; new data from the International Energy Agency revised renewable energy growth in the US by 2030 down by half. It also suggested that the pace of renewables adoption in China — the current largest renewables growth market globally — could temper, the Financial Times reported.

Renewables are expected to boom elsewhere, however: Pakistan imported enough solar panels in 2024 to generate around a third of the country’s current power generation capacity, the BBC said. And in Africa, solar panel imports are up 60% in the year to June compared with the same period last year.

OpenAI inked a deal with chip designer AMD to collaborate on AI data centers, in a challenge to semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The deal, which caused AMD’s stock to soar, reflects the tech sector’s intensifying quest for computing power and ultimately banks on a “near-limitless demand for AI,” WIRED wrote: Running AMD’s processors will match the energy needs of 5 million American homes. The US has become “one big bet on AI,” as optimism over the sector props up the economy, one analyst wrote.

Driving that bet is OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has proven to be a prolific dealmaker. The company also has agreements with firms including Nvidia and Oracle — pacts that have raised fears of an AI bubble.

Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations through Arab mediators in Egypt Monday on a Gaza peace plan, raising the possibility of a potential end to the brutal war on the eve of its two-year anniversary.

Hamas said it agrees to parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including the release of all remaining Israeli hostages, but has not acknowledged other demands, including full disarmament and its permanent exclusion from governing the enclave.

Though US President Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt its attacks, it continued to pound Gaza Monday. Trump has also threatened “complete obliteration” of Hamas if it insists on staying in power.

Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks to take credit for the emerging deal, it has become clear that Trump was “the one calling the shots,” The New York Times wrote. On Sunday night, the president exhorted negotiators to “MOVE FAST,” adding that he expected the first phase of the deal to unfold this week.

A US judge blocked the government from deploying troops to Oregon state, spotlighting the growing role of the courts in the country’s politics.

The latest order, issued late on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration looks to deploy military forces to Democrat-led cities nationwide: The White House says they are necessary to combat alleged lawlessness; Democrats argue their constituents are being targeted.

The latest decision came on the eve of the Supreme Court beginning a new term that analysts say will include significant new tests of presidential power, including over the administration’s use of tariffs, attempted curbs on birthright citizenship, and efforts to fire officials from independent government agencies.

France’s prime minister resigned less than a month after taking office, plunging the country deeper into a seemingly intractable political crisis.

Sébastien Lecornu — President Emmanuel Macron’s seventh premier — quit following widespread criticism over his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from that of the prior government.

His departure showcases the short-term challenge facing Macron’s ministers, who have repeatedly failed to pass a budget in the face of far-right and far-left opposition, and the longer-term fear over the rise of the country’s main nationalist, anti-immigration party, which is topping opinion polls.

The impasse has left investors wary: A recent Deutsche Bank survey pegged France as the country most likely to face a government bond crisis.

Japanese stocks surged after the country’s ruling party chose its next leader — and likely next prime minister — amid growing investor buoyancy over prospects for one of the world’s largest economies.

The LDP, which has ruled Japan largely uninterrupted since World War II, put Sanae Takaichi on track to be the country’s first female prime minister.

She inherits a dizzying array of challenges, including a fast-aging population and worries over Chinese aggression. Yet economists note the country has removed major barriers to business, manufacturers are feeling more upbeat, and monetary policy is normalizing: The Nikkei 225 index hit a record following Takaichi’s selection. “We are bullish on Japan,” Apollo’s chief economist wrote.

China and India agreed to restart direct flights after a five-year hiatus, the latest sign of thawing relations between the world’s most populous nations. New Delhi said flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou would restart this month for the first time since border clashes in 2020.

The decision comes just months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first visit to Beijing in seven years, with the countries’ leaders drawing closer, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, upending what had been a burgeoning bilateral partnership. Those levies were “one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got,” an expert said, forcing New Delhi to seek new allies.

Discoveries about how our immune systems avoid attacking our own bodies — research which helped create new pathways for treating autoimmune diseases — won the 2025 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

T-cells are designed to attack proteins in pathogens, but those proteins are often similar to our body’s own proteins. Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that the immune system has “self-tolerance” safeguards which prevent it from attacking our own cells.

Crucially, the findings also helped create new cancer treatments: Cancer cells use the body’s self-tolerance to hide, and immunotherapy is designed to take the brakes off and allow the immune system to attack those cells.

Japan is on track to have its first female prime minister.

A former economic security minister who cites Margaret Thatcher as her hero, Sanae Takaichi was elected to lead Japan’s governing LDP, which has ruled the country almost continuously since World War II but is mired in an array of crises.

Among her top priorities is tackling inflation — a relatively new problem given Japan’s decades of falling prices — making her selection a worrying one for investors: Takaichi will likely push for aggressive spending and looser monetary policy in a bid to boost the economy.

She will also pull Japan’s politics further to the right, mirroring a trend of resurgent populist conservatism worldwide, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

The world’s major oil producers agreed to raise output again, a move that raised fears of a supply glut and could further dampen prices.

OPEC+ is looking to reclaim market share lost to US shale producers and maintain discipline within the group — some members stand accused of violating quotas — while the group’s heavyweight member, Saudi Arabia, is likely hoping that lower prices will please US President Donald Trump.

Still, the increase was a relatively small one, a careful step taken “after witnessing how nervous the market had become,” one analyst said.

“The real test will come when fundamentals and politics shift again.” High geopolitical volatility makes predicting the market’s future even more difficult than usual, a Reuters columnist argued.

US President Donald Trump is considering a bailout of at least $10 billion to help the country’s soybean farmers survive a boycott from China.

The humble soybean has become a flashpoint in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies after Beijing ceased all purchases from the US.

The possible aid from Washington reflects China’s leverage in talks with the US, similar to how Beijing used rare-earth export curbs to extract trade concessions from Washington, analysts said.

China is now reportedly pushing for the White House to roll back national-security restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.

Birds of different species can understand each other’s alarm calls warning of cuckoos.

Brood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, tricking the hosts into caring for their offspring at the expense of their own.

Research found that 21 bird species across four continents all make similar “whining” vocalizations when they spot a brood parasite, and when played recordings of other species’ calls, they all recognize them and react by mobbing the invader.

One researcher told New Scientist that the calls, referring to external objects in the world rather than internal states such as fear or excitement, “could be the first stepping stone towards language” and that animal communication and human language were on a spectrum.

A controversial musical depicting the Spanish conquest of Mexico has ignited a transatlantic debate over Latin American history and identity.

Centering on conquistador Hernán Cortés and his Nahuatl translator, Malinche ostensibly celebrates mestizaje, or racial mixing, but has been accused of promoting “outdated, racist notions” regarding Aztec rituals, and the idea that colonization benefited indigenous people.

Foreign Policy called the show, currently playing in Mexico City, an “obscenely romanticized” “anti-Hamilton,” while conservatives complained that a historical priest was initially portrayed in drag.

Malinche’s producer, for his part, hoped the debate would “bring people to come and judge” for themselves.

The brouhaha points to real wounds: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined to invite Spain’s king to her inauguration after he failed to apologize for the conquest.

The US military struck another alleged narcotics vessel off the coast of Venezuela Friday, killing four, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.

The strike — at least the fourth such attack — brings the total number of alleged smugglers killed by the US in recent weeks to at least 18.

Hegseth wrote on X that he directed the lethal strike, carried out in international waters, on a “vessel transporting substantial amounts of narcotics — headed to America to poison our people.”

It came after the White House informed Congress this week that the country was engaged in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which the administration has designated as terrorist organizations, The New York Times reported.

The strikes have raised tensions with Caracas, which fears a full-scale invasion, as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs strikes inside the country.

Critics have questioned the legality of the campaign, with one commentator accusing Trump of emulating “the worst excesses” of US policy in Latin America.

Hamas said it agreed to release all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza under a framework proposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that it “affirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations” to discuss the details.

Earlier on Friday, Trump set a new weekend deadline for Hamas to agree to a peace deal on the enclave’s future, calling it the militant group’s “last chance.” Hamas’ statement suggested the group is seeking changes to the proposal, however, and that a deal has not yet been agreed to.

If no deal is reached by 6:00 pm Sunday Eastern time, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote in a social media post earlier on Friday.

The Trump administration’s 20-point plan, backed by Israel, demands an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the disarmament of Hamas — a condition the group has previously rejected. Hamas said on Wednesday that it was reviewing the proposal.

The plan also provides for a transitional authority run by an international group chaired by Trump, with members including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Venezuela said it had detected five US fighter jets flying near its Caribbean coast, which Caracas said amounted to “provocation,” in the latest clash between the countries.

Tensions have been rising between the US and Venezuela for months, and Washington recently struck alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Fears are growing among Venezuela’s leadership that the true goal of the US deployment is toppling the autocratic regime of President Nicolás Maduro, though some warn a military intervention could further destabilize the country. “Anyone who cares about democracy and human rights wants the Maduro dictatorship to end,” an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations said, but this strategy is “very unlikely” to make that happen.

Japan will on Saturday elect its new leader, with a millennial minister poised to become prime minister of the rapidly aging nation.

Shinjiro Koizumi, who at 44 would become Japan’s youngest leader in a century, is competing with four other candidates to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party — which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years — after the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba following two major election losses. Agriculture minister Koizumi, who bills himself a consensus builder, faces his toughest challenge in Sanae Takaichi, a conservative hardliner who would become the country’s first female ruler if she wins. But experts fear neither candidate offers Japan a clear vision to solve an array of challenges at home and abroad.

Munich airport shut down overnight after a series of drone sightings, the latest disruption to European airspace after similar events in Oslo and Copenhagen.

Thousands of passengers on dozens of flights were affected, with some having to sleep in the airport. The sightings follow a series of Russian incursions into NATO airspace, but Moscow denied responsibility for the Munich drones. Still, European leaders suggested the Kremlin was behind earlier drone sightings, and called for strengthened defenses.

Russia appears to be stepping up its hybrid warfare: British officials said Moscow-backed cyberattacks and sabotage were on the rise, and the Kremlin regularly targets UK satellites. A former British intelligence chief said this week that Britain may be “already at war with Russia.”

A woman was named Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in the role’s 1,400-year history.

Sarah Mullally will become the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church in January, a year after her predecessor resigned in a safeguarding scandal.

The first archbishop was appointed in 597 AD, but the role took on extra significance when Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534.

While Anglicanism is on the decline in Britain, it is growing worldwide — nearly 60% of adherents are in Africa, where followers are much more religiously conservative than in Britain.

The communion, already tested by divisions over attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, will be strained further by Mullally’s appointment: Many African Anglican churches refuse to ordain female priests.

Taylor Swift released her 12th original album, The Life of a Showgirl, which is expected to break new records to further cement the pop queen’s dominance.

Swift has been “pop’s alpha figure for more than a decade,” The New York Times noted, and in the 18 months since her last release, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has reached new heights of success — and fame. Her Eras Tour was the most lucrative in history, she bought back ownership of her early albums’ master recordings, and she got engaged.

Anticipation for Showgirl has been “off the charts,” Forbes reported, with more than 5 million pre-saves on Spotify — the most ever — and it is “almost a foregone conclusion” that Swift will become the first female artist to break 100 million career album sales.

Two people have died and three others are in a serious condition after a car ramming and knife attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, UK, on Thursday. The suspect is also believed to have been killed after being shot by police, the BBC reported.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer returned early from a meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen to chair the government’s emergency response group, saying that he was “appalled” by the incident. Security is being stepped up at Jewish sites across the country.

The attack, which took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, comes amid a sharp rise in anti-Semitic assaults in the US and Europe as the Israel-Hamas war nears the two-year mark.

France and Germany have seen a surge in incidents, while two staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot dead in May, and an attack injured 12 in Colorado weeks later.

Israeli naval ships intercepted a flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza and detained several activists, including Greta Thunberg.

The “Global Sumud Flotilla” of more than 40 vessels set sail in September, intending to breach Israel’s naval blockade of the enclave, where the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is underway. Israel said several vessels were taken to port, citing what it called a violation of a “lawful naval blockade,” but flotilla organizers said their boats had been illegally boarded and targeted with water cannon and drones.

The boats have become an international cause célèbre: They were escorted part-way by Italian and Spanish naval ships, and their interception has been met by protests in several European countries.","https://img.semafor.com/33dc6ed1c78c4801bde04c54a95e9011937726c0-12288x8192.jpg?rect=0,871,12288,6451&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-08 00:59:06.992378

Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Oct. 3 introduced the Stop the Trump Electricity Price Hikes Act, legislation to reverse the Department of Energy’s action that announced the mass termination of clean energy awards on Oct.1. The cancellations, which target Democrat-led states, are a blatantly partisan and illegal attempt by Donald Trump to go after Democrat-led states during the Republicans’ government shutdown.

The bill would reinstate all financial assistance awards terminated by the Department of Energy (DOE) under the Trump Administration’s political purge of over 300 clean energy projects. These cancellations total more than $7.5 billion in funding that was lawfully approved by Congress and threaten thousands of jobs across the country.

“Trump’s Administration is gutting clean energy projects, eliminating good-paying jobs, and driving up electricity costs for families already struggling with higher bills,” said Rep. Barragán. “Electricity prices have already soared this year from the Administration’s attacks on clean energy. Instead of working to lower costs, this Administration is pulling the plug on projects that would deliver cheaper, cleaner power for households. This is a direct attack on working American families and our clean energy future.”

The bill responds directly to DOE’s Oct. 1 action, which terminated funding for projects across 16 states — including grid reliability and modernization initiatives, solar energy development, advanced battery technologies, major hydrogen hubs, and university-led research and innovation programs.

Among the projects targeted is the ARCHES Hydrogen Hub in California, an initiative for clean hydrogen development that was expected to create thousands of union jobs and reduce pollution from the Port of Los Angeles.

Conrad Schneider, Senior Director, U.S., at Clean Air Task Force said:

“DOE is slashing funding to American companies, investors, and communities across the U.S.

“Over the last several years, the U.S. has rightly invested in innovative energy projects that have supported economic growth and workforce development, strengthened global leadership, catalyzed additional investment in local economies, while positioning the country to meet rising energy demands and lowering electricity bills for consumers and businesses. Today’s move jeopardizes the investments and benefits that companies and investors have made. These sweeping funding cuts will have far-reaching consequences – with virtually no region unscathed.

“The federal government plays an essential role in addressing gaps that stall the commercialization of energy breakthroughs by providing grants and loans to accelerate innovative projects. By abruptly canceling funding for several hundred energy projects, the U.S. risks ceding American energy leadership and signals that U.S. innovation is not a priority.”

The awards cited by DOE were issued by the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Fossil Energy (FE).

The tax credit created as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act “allowed homeowners to upgrade their electric fuse boxes as well as put solar panels on their roof, and it was a sort of uncapped tax credit of up to 30%,” said Quentin Scott, federal policy director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
He said the tax credit will expire Dec. 31.
But, Scott said, the passage of the legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by President Donald Trump will phase out the tax credit by the end of the year.

He said the tax credit will expire Dec. 31.

For homeowners who were on the fence about converting to solar, “that really cut down their initial cost by one third, which was exciting,” Scott said.

But, Scott said, the passage of the legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by President Donald Trump will phase out the tax credit by the end of the year.

So his advice to homeowners is to make the move — and fast.

“As long as they are able to get a contractor to start the work and complete that work before the end of this calendar year, they are able to file for this tax credit and get those discounts,” he said.

One caveat, Scott said, is that projects “have to be 100% completed and placed in service,” to qualify for the credit.

Scott said one impact of the expiration of incentives like the one for solar installation for homeowners is that “energy costs are going to go up because there’s less diverse energy being added to the grid.”

Another reason that homeowners would want to act quickly is the concern over potential delays in the supply chain, as well as the availability of contractors when it comes to scheduling and completing the work.

NEW YORK — In a year marked by withdrawals from global climate agreements, funding suspensions for clean energy projects and other measures that reverse the United States’ federal climate policy, sustainable investors are trying to find a way forward with Republicans steering both Congress and the White House.

Last month, sustainability nonprofit Ceres used Climate Week NYC as an opportunity to help find potential areas of bipartisan collaboration on investors’ environmental concerns and ability to consider ESG risks. Looking to find areas of common ground around protecting investors’ “freedom to invest” their funds, Ceres hosted a Sept. 24 mainstage session at the Nest Climate Campus, with bipartisan and center-right business advisories and advocacy groups.

Andrea Strimling Yodsampa, CEO of bipartisan climate nonprofit Deploy/US, said that climate and clean energy “have been misbranded as progressive issues,” but there is an opportunity to engage center-right groups and Congressional leaders, as well as investors and business leaders, who can help engage the current administration on the issue.

“There is no path to durable policy without bipartisan support,” Yodsampa said on one of the panels. “It has been a fact for a while, and I think that the environmental movement — which I come from — is starting to really wake up to that in a different way right now, given the current realities, and that’s a really good thing.”

Ceres CEO Mindy Lubber said “the risk has never been so clear,” as the U.S. is seeing climate impacts on insurance markets, water shortages and heat waves and severe weather events causing billion dollar impacts at increasing frequency.

However, Lubber added that there are also opportunities in this time. Former Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo, now principal at advisory firm Vocero, said that the conversation on climate risks has focused too much on the concept of “sacrifice” and what people would have to give up to support the climate fight. “As the conversation has become more about opportunity, it has become so much easier for conservatives and Republicans to embrace these issues,” Curbelo said.

“Over the years, we’ve learned that this can, and really should be, a conversation about opportunity,” Curbelo said on another Ceres-hosted panel. “And if we really embrace that and understand that what we’re talking about is making people safer, making people more prosperous, giving people more personal agency and independence.”

Brandon Arnold, executive vice president of center-right think tank the National Taxpayers Union, said laws that ban financial institutions from participating in state markets based on their ESG considerations have cost taxpayers in Oklahoma and Texas.

A federal judge issued a permanent injunction on Oklahoma’s Energy Discrimination Elimination Act last year, after groups within the state had begun flagging rising municipal borrowing costs as a result.

More than 100 anti-ESG bills were introduced in state legislatures this year, but only 11 passed through June. A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction on one of them, a Texas law targeting proxy advisers, after Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis — the world’s largest proxy advisers — sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to halt its implementation.

“People should be free to engage in ESG investing as individuals, as private companies and so forth, [and] they shouldn’t be forced to do so as a pension recipient,” Arnold said. “We need to kind of take the government’s thumb off the scales here, allow markets to function properly, allow individuals and businesses to operate as they see fit.”

State finance officials on both sides of the aisle were accused by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, of “politicizing” the management of public pension funds, after Republican and Democrat officials sent dueling letters to U.S. financial institutions over the summer. Republican officials urged BlackRock and 24 other institutions to stop framing climate change as a long-term risk, while Democrat officials called for the firm and 17 other institutions to reaffirm their commitment to managing climate and other long-term risks.

Under SB 221, state agencies must conduct a greenhouse gas assessment for all fossil fuel projects, as well as for projects involving stationary combustion devices, construction and mobile engine operation, and ecological functions.
The draft document defines greenhouse gas emissions as gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases that are released into the atmosphere.
It also provides for how agencies should calculate emissions from a project based on size and project type, as well as providing both qualitative and quantitative perspectives on the secondary impacts that greenhouse gas emissions would have on the human environment.

The effort comes out of Senate Bill 221, which directed the Department of Environmental Quality to develop new guidance on greenhouse gas emission assessments in a way that prevents industry and development from becoming bogged down in regulation and litigation.

Signed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, SB 221 was carried by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, and drew bipartisan support from both chambers.

“Our next steps will be to develop that guidance document that will outline exactly how we will do greenhouse gas assessments for fossil fuel activities, as well as what parameters we’ll look at for non-fossil fuel activities,” Sonja Nowakowski, director of DEQ, said when the bill was signed. “These will be very open and transparent processes, and we look forward to engaging with the public and getting everyone’s input as we move forward.”

In 2025, the bill was among a suite of laws the Montana Legislature passed in response to the state Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a youth-led constitutional lawsuit that found the state could not limit analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during the environmental review process.

In a 6-1 decision in Held v. Montana, the Supreme Court affirmed the Lewis and Clark District Court order that Montana’s constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” includes a stable climate system.

The ruling was widely panned by Republican officials across Montana. Legislative leaders told the courts to “buckle up” in response to the decision, and brought a number of bills aimed at changing the judicial system as well as addressing the Held decision and reforming the Montana Environmental Policy Act.

“In the Held v. Montana court case, they tried to twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development,” House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said at a signing ceremony of legislation in response to Held on May 1. “With the signing of this MEPA reform package, we’re making it clear that Montana’s environmental policy is about reform decision making, not weaponizing and litigation.”

The department published its draft guidance document on Oct. 1 and is now seeking “substantive public comments” through the end of the month.

Agencies will use the document as a framework for gathering and evaluating greenhouse gas emission data and potential impacts to Montana’s environment while conducting environmental assessments and environmental impact statements required by MEPA.

Under SB 221, state agencies must conduct a greenhouse gas assessment for all fossil fuel projects, as well as for projects involving stationary combustion devices, construction and mobile engine operation, and ecological functions.

Plaintiffs argued that Congress only permitted the EPA to repurpose uncommitted funds, not to revoke awards that had already been announced. Moreover, claimants asserted that program termination violated the Inflation Reduction and Administrative Procedure acts and sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the program.

Plaintiffs—Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Rhode Island Center for Justice, Solar United Neighbors, Sunpath Solar, 2KB Energy Services, Black Sun Light Sustainability, and a local homeowner—claimed the cancellation caused significant financial harm to communities and small businesses that had relied on promised grants.

In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $27 billion to the newly created Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). From the fund, the Act carved out $7 billion for competitive grants administered through the EPA “to enable low-income…communities to…benefit from zero-emission technologies, including distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and…other greenhouse gas emission reduction activities.”

The program become known as the Solar for All program, and in April 2024 the EPA announced awards that would reach over 900,000 low-income homes. However, the program came to an abrupt halt with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act in July 2025, which eliminated the GGRF and Solar for All.

Following the program’s termination, Zeldin wrote on social media:

In this episode, Louie sits down with Ben DeAngelo, Principal and Founder of Operation Future and former Director of the Office of Climate Adaptation and Sustainability at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Fresh from launching his new consultancy, Ben reflects on his decades-long federal career, as well as key milestones in the climate fight — from helping craft the landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding to coordinating the EPA’s first adaptation strategy.

He shares his fresh perspective from outside government, including why municipal bonds might be a sleeping giant for local adaptation finance, how non-federal actors are keeping the climate agenda alive despite political headwinds, and why private actors may have more latitude to innovate on climate then their peers in the public sector.

Plus, he unpacks what’s next for Operation Future — and how he plans to stay in the fight.

DOE itself has not confirmed the list’s authenticity; the office did not respond to a request for comment from Latitude Media.
The Grid Deployment Office was second-worst hit, at 45 awards totaling $3.3 billion, up from 25 awards on the initial list.
The Advanced Energy Research Projects for Energy Office — which Energy Secretary Chris Wright applauded at the department’s conference earlier this year — had just a single project on the smaller cancellation list last week.
The list does not include awards managed by the Office of Science, the Nuclear Energy Office, or the Loan Programs Office.","The Department of Energy may be planning to cancel even more awards, according to a leaked document reviewed today by Latitude Media.

Last week, the agency confirmed its plans to cancel 321 individual awards, totalling $7.5 billion and spanning six offices across the agency. But a spreadsheet currently circulating in Washington, D.C. shows 351 additional projects that the Trump administration has earmarked for termination, totaling just under $16 billion in funding.

There’s significant overlap between the two lists: 297 of last week’s 321 cancelled awards are also named in the new spreadsheet. The new list’s 647 awards total nearly $24 billion. However, there are 24 awards, mostly under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, that appear solely on the first list and not on the second.

Sources who spoke with Latitude Media said there’s ongoing confusion about the nature of this new list, and the status of the projects on it. Every project on the list has “terminate” in the “latest status” column. However, companies whose projects appear on the second list but not the first — such as those developing the biggest Direct Air Capture Hubs in the country — have told Latitude that they have not received official notice from the agency of a change in their project’s status, but were aware of the list.

DOE itself has not confirmed the list’s authenticity; the office did not respond to a request for comment from Latitude Media.

The new list greatly expands the impact across key offices — and the additional cuts target offices that got off fairly easy on the first list.

The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains saw the most dramatic increase in cuts, from six awards to 45 awards, totaling nearly $4.3 billion. The cuts span major manufacturing companies like Honeywell and General Motors, as well as smaller companies building much-needed materials for the energy transition, such as the advanced conductor company TS Conductor.

The Grid Deployment Office was second-worst hit, at 45 awards totaling $3.3 billion, up from 25 awards on the initial list. Many of the recipients of these awards are either major utilities — such as Southern California Edison and Exelon — or state and local organizations like the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Several of these are located in red states, such as the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority and the State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.

Meanwhile, the Office of Fossil Energy (formerly Fossil Energy and Carbon Management) will now cancel more funding than the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy: 151 FE awards totaling $2.1 billion, versus 340 EERE awards totaling $1.8 billion.

The Advanced Energy Research Projects for Energy Office — which Energy Secretary Chris Wright applauded at the department’s conference earlier this year — had just a single project on the smaller cancellation list last week. The wider list includes five ARPA-E awards, totalling more than $46 million.

The list does not include awards managed by the Office of Science, the Nuclear Energy Office, or the Loan Programs Office.

OCED in DOE’s cross-hairs

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was particularly hard hit. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $21 billion for the office over ten years. Around $12.3 billion worth of OCED awards are now on the cancellation list. Those include funding for some of the office’s largest projects, including the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs, which were on the first list, and many of the Direct Air Capture Hubs, which appear only on the second.

In an official statement, the Carbon Removal Alliance and the Carbon Business Council acknowledged the cancellation of the two largest DAC Hub awards — Project Cypress in Louisiana, and the South Texas DAC Hub, operated by Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive — which follow a handful of smaller awards that appeared on last week’s cancellation list.

However, companies on the list don’t appear to have been given forewarning. Vikrum Aiyer, Head of Global Policy at Heirloom, which is involved in Project Cypress, told Latitude this morning that the company is “not aware” of a decision from DOE. Heirloom continues to “productively engage with the administration in a project review,” he added.

Climeworks confirmed that the list was circulating, but said it had also not received any official notice from DOE. 1PointFive didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company is grappling with a series of challenges — from supply chain disruptions and the looming loss of US EV tax credits to an ongoing, nearly eight-month search for a new chief executive following Peter Rawlinson’s abrupt departure in February.

The broader EV market was also under pressure on early Tuesday.

Despite the wide rollout of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving version 14.1 and just hours before the unveiling of the cheaper Model Y variant, Tesla shares were down about 3% in early trading before pairing losses later in the session.

Rivian declined 1.3%, while Chinese EV maker Nio fell nearly 4%, extending a multi-day slide across the sector.

Lucid said on Monday it produced 3,891 vehicles and delivered 4,078 in the quarter, while more than 1,000 additional units were pre-produced and will soon be assembled at its Saudi Arabian assembly plant.

Those vehicles will be counted as fourth-quarter production. Analysts had expected stronger results, and the shortfall triggered fresh selling pressure.

According to a research note from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard and first obtained by PriceTarget, consensus for the July–September period was estimating 4,286 EVs delivered and 5,175 vehicles produced.

As reported earlier this Tuesday, Lucid recently began recruiting for a second production-shift team lead at its Arizona factory as part of efforts to increase output.

The company aims to meet its revised 2025 guidance of 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, cut in August from a prior 20,000-unit target.

To hit that range, the company would need to meaningfully raise production rates in the final months of the year.

The cheaper entry-level variant of the Lucid Gravity model is set to begin production before the year’s end at the Casa Grande, Arizona, plant.

Demand in Europe continues to remain minimal.

September registrations in Germany dropped to a new 18-month low, while sales figures in the Netherlands and Norway stood at three and zero, respectively.

As reported this week, Interim Chief Executive Officer Marc Winterhoff said recently that the company’s Gravity SUV has an average selling price of “about $120,000,” in the US.

The first units of the model are planned to be delivered in Europe in the first days of 2026. Production of European-focused has already begun, the management told EV and other media outlets in early September.

Winterhoff, who succeeded Peter Rawlinson in February, also said late last month that he is “not aware of any ambitions right now to take [Lucid] private,” addressing speculation about a potential buyout by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.

They waited patiently through the slide presentation by the four EPA representatives from Denver. The hearing was held to present the revised portion of the permit for the two wells on Jody and Bonnie Field's property west of Valier. At an earlier hearing, attendees had objected to the potential migration of the wastewater to the permit's quarter mile radius from the wells. The EPA took the objections back to the drawing board and revised the permit to expand migration of the wastewater to a 2.1-mile area. The short comment period first set by the EPA was expanded to October 13, at the request of Pondera County commissioners. A court reporter recorded the hearing and a transcription will be available at http://www.regulations.gov

At the end of the EPA presentation, attendees were given five minutes each to speak their mind. Thirty people exercised their right to free speech. Some came armed with facts, clear they had done their research. All spoke passionately and from their hearts. Water is a passionate subject. The three Pondera County commissioners – Zane Drishinski, Tom Kuka and Jim Morren, spoke against the permit. Members of the Golden Triangle Resource Council spoke against, as well as a representative of Glacier Two Medicine Alliance. They talked about failed injection wells in Texas, Florida and Ohio. Some people spoke about the possibility of earthquakes causing well failure. The mayor of Roundup asked that the EPA require a constant monitoring system of the wells in case of failure.

To their credit, the four EPA representatives listened intently. They were young, with expertise in their fields. They were not seasoned. And they had no idea about life in rural Montana. They used population numbers (600 within Valier town limits) to decide how much drinking water is needed in Pondera County and didn't take into account that livestock need water too. They claimed that the Madison Aquifer in this area is contaminated, thus the migration of wastewater really didn't matter in the long run. After all, at the rate of the migration flow, their calculations showed it would take 10,000 years to know if there was contamination. Several speakers denied the Madison aquifer is contaminated and listed towns south of Great Falls that have drilled into that aquifer for their drinking water. There are 70 EPA documents online with technical information and everyone is encouraged to read these. Find them at http://www.regulations.gov and search for EPA ro8-06-2025-0852. The large amounts of technical information there are beyond the scope and size of this article. Everyone is encouraged to take the time to read at least some, if not all of these documents.

The real question on everyone's minds was what's in the water. Montana Renewables claims the wastewater is wash water from grain, animal fat from rendering and ""other contaminants"" but is safer than what has been and is still being injected into the other 25 injection wells in Pondera County. Pondera County commissioners say: prove it! County Sanitarian Corrine Rose has asked Montana Renewables to allow her to take a sample and have it tested. Montana Renewables has refused, saying the wastewater content is proprietary. It's understandable that they would not want someone from another county dipping into their wastewater and taking it somewhere else to test. They would lose chain of custody, not knowing who would touch it and how it would be transported or what possible contamination could occur. In a reverse situation, it's probable that the City of Conrad would take the same stance if someone from another county proposed the same ask. However, it seems reasonable that Montana Renewables could provide test results of the wastewater and give it to Pondera County Commissioners after they signed a non-disclosure agreement that would safeguard the proprietary nature of the water. Neither side will budge on this issue. EPA's Frasier stated that the EPA has studied the chemistry of the wastewater, indicating they found no problem with it.

Another bone of contention is the probable expansion of injecting this wastewater into other wells in Pondera County, making these two wells the first of many. Two more permit requests have already been submitted by Montalban Oil and Gas Operations, the company doing the actual injecting.

Montana Renewables has received a $1.67 billion federal loan guarantee to build a water treatment plant. Several speakers asked why the plant wasn't already being built. Montana Renewables has stated that they plan to build a treatment plant, but using injection wells is the interim plan until that can happen. A preliminary engineering report is one of the first steps -- a two-year cycle. Next is a two-year cycle for grant applications, then securing an engineering firm, contractors, etc. There are a lot of federal and state regulations to satisfy before ground can be broken for a treatment plant. An Alderwoman from Belt spoke about the ten years it took for that city to complete their treatment plant.

After the Oct. 13 deadline for comments is past, the EPA will make its final decision on the permit and open its last public hearing on this matter.

NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla rolled out new, cheaper versions of two of its electric car models on Tuesday in hopes the offerings will help revive flagging sales but investors dumped its stock anyway.

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

This model faces stiff competition in the $40,000 range for EVs from vehicles including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5.

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

This model faces stiff competition in the $40,000 range for EVs from vehicles including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems.
EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.","Key Takeaways

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

According to Reuters, the DOE review is part of a larger evaluation of roughly $12 billion in federal awards that could be canceled or suspended as the government contends with a partial shutdown. These funds were part of the Biden administration’s broader push to modernize legacy auto plants and secure American leadership in EV production.

Background: The 2024 Retooling Initiative –

Back in July 2024, we reported the Biden administration announced an ambitious funding package through the DOE, aimed at converting “at-risk” combustion engine plants into EV manufacturing hubs. The goal was to help maintain union jobs, stimulate economic activity in long-time auto towns, and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base as EV demand continued to grow.

Under the plan, Stellantis was promised $585 million — including $335 million to convert its shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois into an EV assembly site and $250 million for its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to begin producing electric drive modules.

These projects were touted as central to preserving 15,000 existing jobs and creating roughly 3,000 new positions across eight states.

Why The Funding May Be Revoked –

On October 7, 2025, new reports indicated that the DOE is now reconsidering those 2024 awards. The potential revocation is tied to a wider reassessment of federal spending amid ongoing fiscal uncertainty in Washington, D.C. If rescinded, the decision could delay or derail critical plant modernization efforts in both Michigan and Illinois.

The timing is particularly challenging for Stellantis, which has begun shifting away from its aggressive all-electric roadmap in recent months. The automaker has canceled the all-electric Ram 1500 REV and its long-range REV XL, scrapped the all-electric Jeep® Compass (J4U) program, and repositioned the upcoming Chrysler C6X crossover as a hybrid instead of a full EV. Internal supplier sources have also suggested that the high-performance 800-volt Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee has been canceled, further underscoring Stellantis’ evolving EV strategy.

What’s At Stake –

If the DOE follows through with the revocation, both automakers could lose critical federal support at a time when the industry faces mounting costs, slower-than-expected EV adoption, and intense political scrutiny. The move could also undercut the Biden administration’s efforts to showcase its investment in clean energy manufacturing ahead of the 2026 election cycle.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MG_4425-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:01.302870

The report comes at a time when the federal government is cutting investment in energy efficiency and electricity demand is rising.
That confluence has sharpened the need for energy savings measures, experts say.
“Electric savings will help the region continue meeting a substantial portion of annual electric load via energy efficiency,” Acadia said.
“State energy efficiency programs make a major contribution to the energy system as a low-cost resource, yet face a pivotal juncture in the northeast region,” Dickerson said.","Energy efficiency efforts in six New England states and New York are saving customers billions of dollars on utility bills and reducing peak demand on the region’s electric grid, according to analysis published Monday by Acadia Center.

The report comes at a time when the federal government is cutting investment in energy efficiency and electricity demand is rising. That confluence has sharpened the need for energy savings measures, experts say.

A September report from conservation advocate CLASP highlighted the potential for efficiency to help meet global emissions targets, particularly appliance efficiency where improvements could deliver about 20% of the total reduction in energy demand required to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Acadia’s report focuses on investment levels and projected benefits from efficiency programs in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. And it calls for improvements to efficiency data reporting that could unlock further energy savings.

“It is more important than ever for policymakers, advocates, program administrators, and consumers to understand the value and evolving role of energy efficiency resource acquisition and shape the future trajectories of the programs to meet the emerging needs of the region,” Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean energy programs at Acadia, said in a statement.

The report examines data in each state’s three-year energy efficiency plan, annual program reports and other filings. Acadia’s analysis shows the seven states are poised to invest almost $10 billion in efficiency overall, with New England programs alone generating an estimated $19.3 billion in lifetime benefits. New England and New York expect to realize 700 trillion Btu in lifetime savings across all fuels, including 20 TWh of lifetime electricity savings from efficiency investments in New England.

“Electric savings will help the region continue meeting a substantial portion of annual electric load via energy efficiency,” Acadia said. “Combining both electricity and combustible fuel savings, the New England states are projected to avoid 368 TBtu of lifetime energy use, and this projected total rises to 703 TBtu with the inclusion of New York State.”

Despite the savings, Acadia warned efficiency investment is under pressure.

“State energy efficiency programs make a major contribution to the energy system as a low-cost resource, yet face a pivotal juncture in the northeast region,” Dickerson said. “Consumer affordability is front of mind for consumers and policymakers with rising energy prices. Other energy resources are rising in cost, yet cuts to ratepayer funded programs — which reduce system costs — have been threatened and implemented by leading states.”

Massachusetts will lose out on $1.49 billion in lifetime benefits following a February decision to cut $500 million from efficiency program budgets, Acadia said. Similarly, Rhode Island efficiency programs face possible cuts of 30% that would lose the state about $92 million in benefits, according to the report.

Looking ahead, Acadia recommended that the New England states and New York “come together to better standardize metrics utilized for program measurement, evaluation, and reporting.”

“Major differences in reporting data persist, and the overall power and impact of energy efficiency in the northeast is limited without that alignment,” according to the report. “With more universal reporting methodologies and benefit cost tests, programs in the region would collectively be more powerful, the ability to understand the value and design of programs would be substantially improved, and new opportunities for states to learn from one another would be unlocked.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YvXL1wURvG0koea-QwZu7pymwwzhXC5Sg82_RmVHSVQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9mcmlkZ2UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-07 22:01:43.516484

“the next Model T moment” – Ford Have regulatory changes lately benefited the auto industry?","A few years ago, the American auto industry dreamed of a fully electric future. After the administration rolled back some federal incentives for electric vehicles, talk of rapid full electrification unsettled and faded into the background.

The near-term outlook does not look very optimistic: analysts expect that the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit will lead to a sharp drop in sales in the coming quarters and perhaps years.

Meanwhile, the global auto industry keeps moving forward: manufacturers continue to invest in an electric future, even if it hasn’t aligned with earlier expectations. At the same time, regulatory prospects for gasoline-powered cars in the U.S. and abroad remain murky, and companies strive not to fall behind the growth of the Chinese EV market.

“They’ve softened their stance on a fully EV future. I truly believe that Ford, GM, Stellantis and many other manufacturers will still actively move toward EVs. But they are now pursuing this path more cautiously than a few years ago.”

– Daniel Ives, Wedbush Securities

Economic and Regulatory Challenges

In August, the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit led to a substantial spike in sales in the third quarter – the demand rushed to buy cars before the credit ended. Tesla, Ford and General Motors posted record EV sales volumes, with GM in the United States even showing a doubling compared with the previous year.

After the peak, demand, as analysts expect, will return to more moderate levels, and a recovery could take a long time.

Although EVs accounted for about 10% of total vehicle sales last quarter, Ford executives expect their share of the U.S. market to fall to around 5% from about 7% last year. GM’s Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson also noted that demand for EVs is likely to “decline sharply.”

“Demand for electric vehicles will decline sharply.”

– Paul Jacobson, GM

Nevertheless, despite pessimistic forecasts, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, calling it its “next Model T moment” – a nod to the historic turning point in the mass adoption of internal-combustion engine vehicles.

“the next Model T moment”

– Ford

Have regulatory changes lately benefited the auto industry? Partly. Changes in regulatory requirements have reduced the pressure: specifically, the July bill partially rolled back penalties for emissions-exceedance, and emissions-regulation requirements have become less stringent than in previous years.

California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – were crafting plans to limit sales of gasoline cars by 2035. Together that accounts for roughly a quarter of U.S. sales. However, Congress is considering the possibility of scrapping these requirements for individual states, which could face lawsuits and drag on for years. Europe and China are also pushing their own strict emission rules, adding further pressure on the EV market.

Manufacturers are looking to boost their stock prices with EV plans. Tesla maintains a significant advantage in market capitalization even as it produces fewer cars than other giants. And this isn’t new: investors continue to look to the future of technologies such as autonomous solutions and service-based models.

Instead of one full replacement of ICE, hybrids – combining electricity and the traditional engine – are increasingly discussed. Such trends allow manufacturers to retain their value proposition and continue to scale production without abandoning existing engines.

“There is still an aggressive impulse toward EV. But the internal combustion engine is not a four-letter word anymore.”

– Daniel Ives

Leaders of American manufacturers emphasize: we are returning to basics and understand that demand for gasoline cars may remain substantial even beyond rapid electrification. Regulatory steps and economic factors continue to shape the industry’s path – from full electrification to measured hybrid solutions.

GM notes that despite the $7,500 credit, customers do not always react as quickly as government programs expected. The company still expects long-term growth in demand for EVs and is working to meet it at a pace that will form over time.

“Let this play out and we’ll understand where natural demand for EVs will go and how to meet it.”

– Paul Jacobson, GM

EVs as a Future Prospect

Manufacturers see in electric vehicles not only an environmental step but also an economic one: EV production is less labor-intensive and less complex in terms of the engine, which could boost profitability. They also expect battery costs to fall, making electric vehicles more affordable for consumers.

Ford said it plans to offer an EV pickup at around $30,000 – a significantly lower price compared with models like the F-150 Lightning, which start around $55,000. The new line of affordable EV pickups is slated to arrive by 2027.

Ford executives emphasize that the world is gradually changing and that this is precisely the turning point for the company and the entire industry. It means manufacturers are weighing their path to electrification, preserving the ability to adapt to different demand scenarios and regulatory requirements.

Despite certain regulatory and economic hurdles, the industry continues to move forward: technological innovations, falling battery costs, and new affordable EV models form the foundation for broader EV adoption in the future.",https://mezha.net/eng/kd_image_generate/us-auto-industry-faces-ev-sales-decline-after-federal-tax-credit-ends/344016.jpg?ver=0.0.4,N,,2025-10-07 20:59:41.655513

But it would also be great if Landry placed just as much emphasis on holding Smitty’s Supply accountable instead of the kid glove treatment they’ve been afforded so far.","This story was originally published by the Louisiana Illuminator.

It’s downright mystifying at times the lengths some officials will go to paint a rosy picture in the most dire circumstances. Sure, there are times when a dose of positivity will help folks through a tough situation, but there comes a point when reality must be confronted.

That’s where Gov. Jeff Landry seemingly found himself last Sunday after new aerial drone video footage from photographer Eric McVicker revealed the sorry state of the cleanup at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Tangipahoa Parish – more than five weeks after the Aug. 22 explosion and fire. The video showed an adjacent large pond covered in petroleum products that leaked from the plant, and it pans over to show an oily slick extending into the nearby Tangipahoa River.

That petrochemical runoff has flowed some 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say that body of water has not been affected so far.

The governor was so moved by what he saw on McVicker’s footage that he posted his own video from the Governor’s Mansion to express his dissatisfaction with remediation efforts.

“They’re not going fast enough,” he said about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led effort.

Landry said he arranged a call with EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason, Louisiana Environmental Quality Secretary Courtney Burdette and state Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.

“Starting tomorrow morning, things are getting ready to start changing on the cleaning up of that site,” the governor said Sunday.

But when the governor led a news conference Wednesday in Tangipahoa Parish, his tone had softened considerably. In response to reporters’ questions about the enhanced response measures Landry had promised, he came to the EPA’s defense.

“While I know it’s real easy to throw popcorn from the stands and it’s easy to make criticisms when you’re not on the ground, I will tell you that this incident is a unique incident. It falls between regulatory bodies,” Landry said.

Questions aren’t criticism, governor. It’s what journalists do in situations when officials can’t or won’t provide information the public needs.

Case in point: The EPA withheld information about the hazardous product inventory at Smitty’s Supply for five weeks, saying it needed company clearance first. The agency made the info public a day after the Illuminator published a report revealing why it had been kept secret. So far, there’s been no explanation as to why it took so long to reveal what neighbors of the facility have been desperate to learn for health and safety reasons.

The lack of information from Smitty’s Supply since the explosion is conspicuous. No one from the company has taken part in news conferences, and they’ve not responded to our questions about its role in the cleanup.

The EPA said last month it has $39 million in environmental remediation funds available to respond to the disaster but that it will need more. Smitty’s Supply is not currently paying for the cleanup but will be responsible for the cost, according to federal officials.

Tangipahoa President Robby Miller told AN17 Local News Wednesday it’s been apparent for several weeks that more resources are needed to tackle the cleanup, and he said the EPA responded with more equipment in recent days.

“If I have a real complaint about the EPA, our federal government, it’s how long it takes them to get things done,” Miller said. “We all recognized three weeks ago that we needed more frac (pump) trucks, we needed more vacuum trucks. Then it took about a week to convince people to come see that we really did. Then it took about a week for them to get that all put together, and it all happened to kind of culminate … Monday. ”

“It was just good timing on the governor making that statement at the same time all that work was happening,” the parish president added.

The governor will want to take credit for getting the EPA to bring more forces to bear for Tangipahoa cleanup. That’s fine. It’s what politicians do, regardless of whether they actually deserve it.

But it would also be great if Landry placed just as much emphasis on holding Smitty’s Supply accountable instead of the kid glove treatment they’ve been afforded so far.",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8382.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:12.532805

(CNN) — The Trump administration is eyeing cutting funds for two major climate pollution projects in Texas and Louisiana, including one in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s district, according to a list of potential cuts obtained by CNN.

Days after announcing nearly $8 billion in cuts to federal energy funding, the Energy Department is considering billions more in reductions to federally funded energy projects, including two $50 million grants in Texas and Louisiana for direct air capture hubs — systems that could pull climate pollution out of the atmosphere like a vacuum.

One of the hubs, Project Cypress, is located in Johnson’s district.

It is unclear whether all the projects on the list will be terminated, or when the cuts will be officially announced. As of Tuesday, some companies involved in the projects hadn’t heard directly from the federal government.

“Market rumors have surfaced, but we have not received any official decision by DOE,” Christoph Gebald, co-CEO of the carbon removal company Climeworks, told CNN in a statement. Climeworks is one of the companies involved in the Cypress project.

Direct air capture uses chemicals to remove climate pollution from the air. Once removed, planet-warming CO2 can be stored underground or used in industrial materials like cement.

There has been a lot of work done on hubs to accelerate the development of technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere in states that are major producers of oil and gas, like Texas and Louisiana, with some viewing them as a lifeline for the polluting fossil fuel industry.

Louisiana’s Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has been supportive of the project, and state officials have urged Louisiana lawmakers on Capitol Hill to protect the projects from any cuts.

Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich didn’t directly comment on the individual projects or the future of their funding, but said the department’s review of projects is ongoing.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich told CNN in a statement. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

A spokesperson for Speaker Johnson did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Groups supporting the projects blasted the potential move, saying it could kill jobs and hurt US competitiveness in a rapidly growing industry.

“It’s a huge economic boon,” said Erin Burns, executive director of carbon removal group Carbon180.

“Local economies were poised to benefit from billions of dollars in economic investment and thousands of in-demand jobs, and in the face of potential cuts, state and local leaders worked to educate the Department of Energy on the negative impacts of withdrawing support for the DAC Hubs,” Giana Amador of the Carbon Removal Alliance and Ben Rubin of the Carbon Business Council said in a joint statement.

In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Energy Sec. Chris Wright said the Energy Department was considering cancelling federal grants for projects from both red and blue states — after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought suggested on X that the administration was cancelling projects in largely blue states.

Wright said the Energy Department’s funding cuts were not tied to the ongoing government shutdown, nor targeted at blue states.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before that in both red and blue states, and as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins.

“The projects are under review and most of the decisions have not been released yet,” Wright said, adding a full list would be released “in the next few weeks.”",https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2023/08/nc312-combined-commercial-slate-860x484.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:17.711753

In good news for California’s industrial sector, yesterday evening Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 1280 into law. Authored by Assemblymember Robert Garcia (D–Rancho Cucamonga), the bill will help modernize California’s manufacturing sector by expanding incentive programs for the deployment of clean industrial equipment through the California Energy Commission’s Industrial Decarbonization and Improvement of Grid Operations grant program (INDIGO) and the IBank’s Climate Catalyst Fund. The bill was sponsored by Industrious Labs and Earthjustice.

“We thank Governor Newsom for signing AB 1280 to help California manufacturers shift to zero-emissions equipment like heat pumps and thermal energy storage,” said Adrian Martinez, Director of Earthjustice’s Right To Zero campaign. “This legislation is a critical early step in modernizing California’s industrial sector — and next year, we hope to see Governor Newsom and the Legislature invest funds from cap and invest in the INDIGO program to ensure we keep pace with the rest of the world in the big shift to clean industrial equipment. In the end, it’ll deliver better health to Californians from the cradle to old age.”

“Investing in clean manufacturing is a golden opportunity for California,” said Teresa Cheng, California Director at Industrious Labs. “Industry is a major source of pollution, but it’s also a pillar of our economy, and it can be part of the solution. We have the tools to cut industrial pollution and keep manufacturing jobs here in the state. What’s missing is implementation — and AB 1280 delivers that. State investment is critical to keeping California’s manufacturing sector competitive and a leader in adopting clean technology.”

Today, California’s industrial sector emits one-fifth of the state’s climate pollution. But nearly half of all emissions from the manufacturing sector can be eliminated by replacing fossil-fueled equipment with more efficient zero-emissions equipment that is already commercially available. The legislation will make it easier for manufacturers to afford these upgrades by providing grants from INDIGO and loans through California’s Green Bank — an effort that finances projects that promote sustainability.

Manufacturers that receive funds through the program will be required to meet strong labor standards and the program will prioritize projects in areas that experience the worst industrial pollution. The legislation enjoyed especially robust support from labor in California.

“Governor Newsom’s signature on AB 1280 is a major win for working families,” said Vince Sugrue, State Legislative Director for Sheet Metal Workers Local Union No. 104. “This bill helps ensure that California continues to invest in high-road, middle-class careers while accelerating our state’s clean energy transition. By putting skilled labor at the center of the solution, we’re building a cleaner, fairer future that uplifts workers and communities alike.”

The bill’s twin benefits of modernizing manufacturing while cleaning California’s air earned it broad bipartisan support from manufacturers, environmental justice and climate groups, and the state building and construction trades.

California has the largest manufacturing sector in the United States. It’s a huge driver of the state’s economy — contributing about $400 billion annually in GDP — and it is also a major source of pollution. Despite the availability of proven clean industrial solutions, less than 1% of the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has gone to industrial decarbonization since 2014.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gettyimages-563616393_2k-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 18:02:36.392956

The startup had already self-funded its planned project in Arizona and built the modules for the site.
Because it didn’t rely on government funding for the project, it could have moved forward in the U.S.
Now, it’s planning to build its first full commercial project in Canada as well.
Direct air capture tech arguably hasn’t been hit quite as hard as other forms of climate tech, like offshore wind power.","At the beginning of this year, a climate tech startup called CarbonCapture was ready to break ground on its first commercial pilot at a site in Arizona.

But the project is now about to open 2,700 miles away, in Alberta, Canada. The company started considering new locations shortly after the inauguration, as the political climate around climate projects quickly changed.

“We were looking for regions where we felt we could get support for deployment,” says CarbonCapture CEO Adrian Corless. “Canada was an obvious choice given the existence of good government programs and incentives that are there.”

CarbonCapture makes modular direct air capture technology (DAC), units that remove CO2 from the air. In late March, reports came out that the Department of Energy (DOE) was considering cancelling grants for two other large DAC projects, including one in Louisiana that involved the company. By the end of May, by the time the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations announced that it was cancelling $3.7 billion in other grants, the startup had already signed an agreement with Deep Sky Alpha, a facility in Canada that is simultaneously deploying and testing multiple direct air capture projects to help the industry grow.

The startup had already self-funded its planned project in Arizona and built the modules for the site. Because it didn’t rely on government funding for the project, it could have moved forward in the U.S. But it saw that it would be harder to move from the pilot to later commercial projects in Arizona. Now, it’s planning to build its first full commercial project in Canada as well. (The company wouldn’t disclose the cost for either project.)

“We just didn’t see a pathway in the U.S. to be able to show that linkage between doing a commercial pilot, starting to generate [carbon dioxide removal] credits and selling them, and then being able to raise the capital for something that’s much larger,” Corless says.

Canada offers an investment tax credit of 60% for direct air capture equipment, plus an additional 12% for projects in Alberta, the heart of Canada’s oil and gas industry. The country also has strong support for R&D and first-of-a-kind deployments for early-stage companies, and multiple programs supporting climate tech specifically.

The Canada Growth Fund, for example, is a $15 billion fund designed to advance decarbonization. And while Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, has taken steps backward on climate policy, he’s also said that he wants the country to be the “world’s leading energy superpower” both for conventional energy and clean energy.

The situation in the U.S. is very different. Trump recently called climate change a “con job” in a speech to the United Nations. When Chris Wright, the energy secretary, recently canceled another $13 billion for renewable energy projects, he said, “if you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places,” despite the fact that fossil fuels have gotten subsidies from the U.S. for three times as long. Fossil fuel subsidies are now nearly $35 billion a year, or as much as $760 billion if you include health and environmental costs.

Direct air capture tech arguably hasn’t been hit quite as hard as other forms of climate tech, like offshore wind power. When the “One Big Beautiful Bill” gutted other funding, from tax credits for EVs to solar panels, it left in place some credits that facilities can earn for capturing carbon as they operate. But the Department of Energy recently cut multiple grants that would have helped new DAC projects get built. One of the large projects CarbonCapture was supporting—the Louisiana facility previously under review—lost funding, and the company just received official notice of its cancellation.

Corless says that the startup is still carefully watching what happens in D.C.—and the company still hasn’t made any announcements about whether it might move its whole company, not just particular projects. Right now, it’s headquartered in L.A. with around 50 employees. It also has a small factory for its equipment in Arizona, next to the site where it had planned to build its first carbon capture facility.

Moving the first project to Canada happened quickly. Five weeks ago, the site in Alberta was an empty field. Four weeks ago, the company shipped the modules it had built in Arizona to Canada. Construction crews have been finishing the final touches, and the company plans to begin commissioning the system next week. Deep Sky Alpha already had some key infrastructure in place, including access to solar power to run the equipment. The pilot will ultimately be able to capture 2,000 tons of CO2 a year, which will be buried underground.

It’s possible that other companies might follow CarbonCapture’s move. “I think that there definitely are going to be several companies that are looking at the same data that we’re looking at,” Corless says. “And I think that it’s not lost on the Canadian government that they have an opportunity as well to step up and potentially take a leadership role in this space, which the U.S. has really owned for the last five years.”

“The U.S. does have a real advantage, even without DOE support,” says Erin Burns, director at the nonprofit Carbon180. “But it’s very likely that uncertainty around DOE programs will weaken that edge. Some projects will move abroad. Some that might have thrived here will not. Others will achieve only a fraction of their potential. Each outcome is a setback on its own. Together they add up to millions, possibly billions, in lost investment and slower American innovation.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/10/03-91416600-climate-tech-startup.jpg",N,,2025-10-07 19:02:21.069165

One of the projects is located in the district where Mike Johnson’s words as Speaker of the House are heard.

Following the announcement of sweeping cuts to federal energy funding, the Department of Energy is weighing further multibillion-dollar reductions within the budget. Specifically, two $50 million grants for DAC hubs in Texas and Louisiana – systems that could pull greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, acting like a vacuum.

One such hub is Project Cypress, located in Johnson County.

It remains unclear whether all projects on the list will be shut down, or when the decision will be officially announced. As of now, some companies involved in the projects have not received direct notice from the federal government.

“There have been market rumors, but we have not received any official decision from the Department of Energy.”

– Christoph Gebald, co-founder of Climeworks

Direct air capture involves using chemical processes to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The captured CO2 can be stored underground or used in industrial materials, such as cement.

The DAC sector has already done much to advance CO2 removal technologies in states where oil and gas production is significant – notably Texas and Louisiana. Some observers see this as a path to preserving competitiveness in the transition to clean technologies, while others warn of potential risks to jobs and financial stability.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a Republican, expressed support for the project, and regional officials urged lawmakers to protect DAC hubs from potential cuts.

A Department of Energy spokesperson declined to comment on specific projects, but confirmed that the review is ongoing.

“No decisions have been made, other than what was previously announced,”

In a joint statement by the Carbon Removal Alliance and the Carbon Business Council, it was noted that regions were ready to receive billions of dollars in investments and thousands of jobs, and local leaders urged the government to clarify the negative consequences of withdrawing support for DAC hubs.

In an interview with our publication, the head of energy affairs said that the grant review concerns projects in various states, and the full list of decisions will be announced in the next several weeks.

Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation.
The real test is whether we can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers while continuing to improve emissions intensity throughout our energy system.
Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most.
Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources—and robust domestic energy supply—planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging.","Here’s a fundamental truth: there is no AI without energy. And as the technology grows, its demand for energy, and carbon footprint, may never again be as small as it is today.

Against this backdrop, debates over which energy source should power AI miss the point. AI’s appetite for energy—relative to what the grid has available today—will demand every tool available. Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation. The real test is whether we can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers while continuing to improve emissions intensity throughout our energy system.

Market participants are focused on how best to balance these considerations, and at a pace that will support America’s competitive advantages. Governments are also engaging. The U.S. will need new chip factories, new data centers, and, most critically, vast new sources of energy, along with the infrastructure to deliver where it’s needed. Recent reforms outlined in Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan aim to accelerate permitting and expedite infrastructure deployment, with the recognition that tomorrow’s energy system will look very different from the one we have today.

Bridging policy ambition with practical delivery requires companies capable of moving energy at scale, making infrastructure essential to the task. Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most. Its assets are strategically linked to major population hubs and positioned near the fast-growing data center clusters that will anchor the digital economy.

Being able to move the energy is only one part of the need. A diverse portfolio of energy businesses and capabilities—from natural gas transmission and storage, to gas utilities and renewable power operations—is crucial if we want to deliver a mix of energy sources that support clean energy ambitions while also ensuring continuous baseload power.

Here’s what that looks like in action: Earlier this year, Enbridge announced that it is developing and will be operating the 600 MW Clear Fork Solar project near San Antonio for a customer. On the Gulf Coast, advanced optimization projects, including a $50 million expansion of the Southeast Supply Header pipeline across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are meeting the growing power needs of a major electric utility serving data centers. There’s also the expansion of the Texas Eastern Transmission system to support Homer City Redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania, which, when fully operational, will be the largest natural gas-fired power plant in the U.S. dedicated entirely to data centers and AI.

This mix of energy sources and innovation will help to match immediate energy needs with long-term growth projections.

Our approach to the energy evolution must include lowering the emissions intensity of its operations, helping customers transition from higher-emitting fuels to lower-carbon options, and building more efficient and lower carbon infrastructure. Since 2020, Enbridge has reduced GHG emissions intensity from operations by 40%.

Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources—and robust domestic energy supply—planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging. Google recently offered data that punctuates this point: a median prompt to its Gemini model consumes 0.24 watt-hours—about the same as running a laptop for 17 seconds or a microwave for one second. In June, Sam Altman noted in a blog on AI’s growth that the average ChatGPT query consumes about 0.34 watt-hours of electricity, roughly what a high-efficiency lightbulb uses in a couple of minutes. Numbers like these sharpen public understanding of AI’s energy appetite, but they also expose Jevons paradox—the dynamic where gains in efficiency lower costs, only to spark even greater demand. For energy providers, that means data-driven planning and experience will be essential. Data centers will need partners that can deliver capacity, reliability and sustainability alike—baseload natural gas, renewables, storage and infrastructure built to meet real demand and support round-the-clock operations.

Dive Brief:

General Motors Co. is moving its electric BrightDrop commercial vans under the Chevrolet brand, the automaker announced in a press release Aug. 29.

The decision will make it more convenient for commercial customers to visit a Chevrolet dealer for sales, service and maintenance needs, according to GM.

GM launched BrightDrop in January 2021 with the goal of developing commercial EVs for logistics purposes and to help companies decarbonize their fleet operations. BrightDrop customers include FedEx, Ryder and DHL.

Dive Insight:

BrightDrop is similar to Ford Motor Co.’s new business unit Ford Pro. When it launched BrightDrop, GM initially planned for it to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary, while the company continued to develop commercial EVs and expand its logistics business offerings.

But in November 2023, GM announced that BrightDrop would become part of its commercial products and services unit Envolve, in order to bring together the automaker’s digital offerings to BrightDrop customers. Envolve serves thousands of commercial and government customers, according to GM.

“Integration into the Chevrolet portfolio will expand [BrightDrop’s] reach and accessibility and offer more customers additional tools to help achieve their productivity and carbon-neutral goals,” Sandor Piszar, vice president of GM Envolve, said in the release.

All Chevrolet dealers will have the opportunity to sell BrightDrop vans, as long as the dealers meet GM’s commercial EV requirements. Once certified, participating dealers can maintain and service BrightDrop EVs, creating an opportunity for additional revenue while allowing customers to keep their vehicles on the road.

“With the addition of BrightDrop to the Chevrolet lineup, we are combining advanced EV technology with the dependability and widespread accessibility that only Chevrolet can offer,” Chevrolet VP Scott Bell said in the release. “This move strengthens our EV offerings and reaffirms our role as a leading commercial brand that enables businesses large and small to get work done.”

Brightdrop currently offers two electric vans, the Zevo 400 and the Zevo 600, which offers additional cargo volume. The vans are built on GM’s Ultium EV platform. Both vans offer an estimated combined city and highway driving range of 272 miles. The vans are built at GM’s CAMI Assembly plant in Ingersoll, Ontario.

“This branding evolution is a testament to the potential GM and Chevrolet see for BrightDrop in the electric fleet market, and to CAMI’s production capabilities as Canada’s first large-scale EV manufacturer,” GM Canada President Kristian Aquilina said in the release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/dHtjDHUP5lpiL_HY35S5J_UPcRW8_Eke54JkFEKzymk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9icmlnaHRkcm9wLXpldm82MDAtemV2bzQwMC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-07 22:02:16.842370

The new terminations list also includes both of the largest direct air capture hub awards.
The $3.5 billion direct air capture hub program was intended to jump-start a domestic industry capable of vacuuming carbon dioxide from the sky.
The more expansive list would make major cuts to Republican states and districts, including through the hydrogen hub cancellations.
The Southern States Energy Board, which is composed largely of Republican states, would get hit with $100 million in grant cancellations, according to the list.","The Department of Energy is planning to cancel hundreds of additional clean energy grants authorized in the Biden administration, including the five remaining federally funded hydrogen hubs and two direct air capture projects, according to a list obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News that is circulating among lobbyists and Capitol Hill staff.

The compendium marks more than 600 grants totaling more than $20 billion as “terminate.” It appears to include all of the more than 300 grants canceled last week.

“I understand this is the full list that was sent to Office Management and Budget a few weeks ago,” said an energy lobbyist granted anonymity to speak freely. “Last week, they basically just pulled out most, if not all, the blue state projects, and that’s what they announced as cuts.”

“It shows the much bigger list, which will definitely impact a lot more states, … a lot more red states and red districts,” the lobbyist said.

Seven people familiar with internal operations at DOE confirmed the authenticity of the list, which also includes two dozen grants canceled earlier in the year.

DOE has not confirmed the list, and it’s unclear if the cancellations are final.

“The Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement. “No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.”

Last week, spurred on by an announcement from OMB Director Russ Vought, DOE scrapped $7.56 billion in financial awards, including for two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast and nearly half of the direct air capture awards approved by the Biden administration. Vought’s announcement noted states where the projects were located, all of which voted for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The new list includes more than $4.5 billion in canceled funding for the other five hydrogen hubs authorized by DOE under Biden. Those are the HyVelocity hub in the Gulf Coast; the Midwestern and mid-Atlantic hubs; an Appalachian hub known as ARCH 2; and the Heartland hub in the Dakotas, Montana, Wisconsin and Minnesota, which had backing from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum when he was governor of North Dakota before joining the Trump administration.

The hubs were intended to demonstrate production and transport of clean fuel around the country with funding from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

Unlike the nixed funding last week, the cancellations on the new list include hydrogen projects focused on natural gas tied to carbon capture that were backed by some Republicans. The Appalachian hub, for example, is backed by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).

Most of the hubs did not respond to requests for comment, but the Midwest hub — which was allocated $1 billion — said it has not received a notice of canceled funding.

The hydrogen developments were funded by DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, a new branch of the department that was launched by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and has since drawn the ire of Republicans.

The new terminations list also includes both of the largest direct air capture hub awards. The potential loss of some $500 million in matching funds for each hub could put at risk the developments by Occidental Petroleum in Texas and a Battelle-led consortium in the Louisiana congressional district of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Occidental and Battelle didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The $3.5 billion direct air capture hub program was intended to jump-start a domestic industry capable of vacuuming carbon dioxide from the sky. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists have concluded that the world will need to massively increase the deployment of direct air capture and other carbon removal technologies while also rapidly reducing new emissions from oil, gas and coal.

Trade associations representing the carbon removal industry slammed the Trump administration’s potential move to cut off funding for the Texas and Louisiana hubs, which would each be the world’s largest direct air capture projects.

The apparent decision would enable “other countries to take up leadership of the industry, and claim the job creation and economic benefits of carbon removal,” the Carbon Business Council and Carbon Removal Alliance said in a joint statement.

Following the cancellations last week, Wright said more would be coming.

“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he told CNN. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

The cuts last week targeted Democratic states but also hit some Republican House districts. The more expansive list would make major cuts to Republican states and districts, including through the hydrogen hub cancellations.

“The question is whether or not those red state projects are ‘safe,’ or if they’re just delaying killing the red state projects until after the budget fight is over,” said one energy lobbyist, granted anonymity to speak freely.

The Southern States Energy Board, which is composed largely of Republican states, would get hit with $100 million in grant cancellations, according to the list.

The new list also includes dozens of new cancellations for grants issued by the Grid Deployment Office, which aims to boost the U.S. electricity grid, and the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which funds new mineral projects. Grid expansion and U.S. mineral development are big priorities for the Trump administration.

Among the hundreds of new proposed cancellations, DOE also plans to cut a $28 million grant to Ford and several grants totaling roughly $565 million for General Motors, according to the list. Volvo would also see roughly $226 million in grants canceled, the list says.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6d/8a/53ed1190489a9217e8acadd93701/senate-energy-35474.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 18:02:44.593729

Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements.
The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.
“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release.
“Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.” The appeal from environmental groups was filed Oct. 3.","Environmental groups are appealing a federal court’s decision to uphold a rule exempting livestock and poultry operations from reporting significant releases of air pollutants.

The environmental groups allege the rule is unlawful and that exposure to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from these operations is responsible for more deaths annually than exposure to air pollution from coal plants.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which intervened in the case, celebrated the court ruling in its favor and said the rules were “onerous and unnecessary” by requiring producers to file “complex, overreaching reports.”

In August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the environmental groups’ request for summary judgment and instead granted judgment on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Cattlemen.

EPCRA and CERCLA

Two laws are at play in the case. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, which require certain entities to notify EPA and local officials of a “potentially dangerous” release of a hazardous substance, according to EPA.

EPA has attempted to change the rule, as it relates to animal waste at farms, in the past, according to the court’s filed memorandum of opinion. Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements.

In 2019, EPA filed a final rule to exempt animal waste emissions from EPCRA requirements in order to match the regulations to the recently changed CERCLA rules.

The environmental groups alleged EPA relied “unlawfully” on the congressional changes to CERCLA as justification for changing the rules in EPCRA that let “the industrial animal industry off the hook.”

The opinion from U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly said the EPA rule was “consistent with the best reading” of EPRCA regulations and provides an explanation for exempting animal waste air emissions.

Kelly wrote that to remain consistent with statutory text, EPA had “no leeway to consider the public’s right to access information” and “no discretion to consider environmental effects” when issuing the 2019 rule.

Environmental groups say reporting requirements protect communities

In a joint news release about the decision to appeal the federal court’s decision, the environmental groups said the pollution reporting requirements at hand “are designed to guarantee that communities and emergency responders have access to information necessary to protect themselves from harmful exposure to these extremely hazardous substances.”

A recent peer-reviewed study from the University Michigan found that communities with the highest concentrations of animal feeding operations, like cattle feedlots, dairy farms and hog farms, have elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter.

According to the study, fine particulate matter was 28% higher in census tracts with high concentrations of cattle feeding operations and 11% higher in census tracts with hog farms.

The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.

Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney at Waterkeeper Alliance, said people have a “right to know” when hazardous air pollution is released near their homes, schools or work.

“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release. “Its mandate is to protect human health and the environment, not to create loopholes that allow polluters to hide the truth and put communities and ecosystems at risk.”

In a news release about the court’s opinion, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said EPCRA and CERCLA regulations were intended to address “massive, severe” environmental contaminants and chemical spills. Instead, the association said, the laws were “weaponized” by animal rights groups targeting “family farms and ranchers.”

Kaitlynn Glover, the association’s executive director of natural resources, said the environmental laws should not “govern” cattle farmers.

“This decision affirms that family cattle producers should not have to file reports for a natural, biological process under a law meant for significant chemical contaminants,” Glover said in the release. “NCBA stepped up to protect family farms and ranches through this litigation and we are pleased that the federal district court has brought clarity to this decades-long discussion.”

Tarah Heinzen, the legal director for the involved environmental group Food & Water Watch, said the Trump Administration’s “see no evil approach will not stand in court.”

“Trump’s EPA is suppressing critical pollution data required to keep frontline communities safe and hold polluters accountable,” Heinzen said in the release. “Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.”

MONROE, La. – A recent economic impact study shows that the University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) is one of the largest economic drivers in Northeast Louisiana, contributing $617.6 million in added income each year to the region’s economy.

The study, conducted by Lightcast and reflecting FY 2023–24, highlights the significant role ULM plays in workforce development, community vitality, and long-term economic growth.

Key findings include:

10,464 jobs supported across the region, meaning 1 out of every 18 jobs in Northeast Louisiana is connected to ULM or its students.

$457.7 million in added income from alumni impact, as graduates’ higher earnings fuel local businesses and industries.

$108.2 million from university operations spending, equivalent to the purchase of 2,290 new cars each year.

$32 million from student spending, as students attracted to ULM invest directly into the local economy.

$16.6 million from spin-off companies launched by ULM-related entrepreneurship.

$1.8 million from visitor spending and $1.3 million from research activity, further diversifying regional economic benefits.

Beyond its measurable financial impact, the study found that ULM provides exceptional returns for all stakeholders:

Taxpayers gain $2.40 in added revenue and savings for every $1 invested.

Students gain $5.30 in lifetime earnings for every $1 invested in their ULM education.

Society gains $6.60 in added income and social savings for every $1 invested.

A Strong Return on Investment

The report also highlights ULM’s exceptional return for students, taxpayers, and society:

Students: For every $1 invested, students gain $5.30 in lifetime earnings, with an annual return rate of 20.7%.

Taxpayers: For every $1 of public funding, taxpayers receive $2.40 in added tax revenue and savings, an annual return of 6.1%.

Society: Louisiana gains $6.60 in added income and social benefits for every $1 invested in ULM, totaling more than $1.4 billion in long-term benefits

Beyond Economics

ULM also enhances quality of life through programs, outreach, and partnerships. For example, its Mobile Dental Hygiene Unit provides care to underserved rural communities while training future healthcare professionals, and its Visual and Performing Arts programs add cultural value through numerous musical performances, plays, and art shows and exhibits.

“The University of Louisiana Monroe is more than an educational institution—it is a powerful economic engine that sustains jobs, strengthens families, and builds the future of Northeast Louisiana,” said ULM President Dr. Carrie L. Castille. “This study underscores the vital role ULM plays not only in educating students, but in uplifting every community in the entire region.”

SEIA is the leading voice for a secure and resilient solar and storage industry.
In December, SEIA is hosting a half-day virtual symposium on cybersecurity and reliability for the solar and storage industry.","Solar and energy storage are the lowest-cost, fastest-to-build technologies available to help meet rising electricity demand. The market is quickly responding to this reality. Solar and storage accounted for 84% of new grid capacity additions in 2024, and according to SEIA’s and Wood Mackenzie’s latest Solar Market Insight Report, these technologies made up 82% of new capacity added in the first half of 2025.

Power demand is rising fast, and solar and storage will continue to dominate through 2030 because they are available right now, while new gas, nuclear, and other fuels are years away from making a dent.

As solar and battery storage become more prevalent and the grid becomes increasingly digitally connected, cybersecurity must be a top priority to defend against nation states, hacktivists, criminal organizations, and other threats from obtaining unauthorized access or launching disruptive attacks against critical energy systems.

SEIA is leading the way to ensure that the industry continuously develops and implements best practices, from manufacturing “smart from the start” to operating projects and systems securely.

Threats against critical infrastructure from both state and non-state cyber actors have become more frequent and increasingly sophisticated. Since 2021, Chinese advanced persistent threat groups are targeting critical infrastructure and critical service sectors, including the telecommunications, transportation, lodging, water, and power sectors. In addition, cyber actors attributed to Russia and Iran continue to target critical infrastructure, including the energy sector.

Threats to the solar and storage industry are not just theoretical. Past history of publicly disclosed cyberattacks against solar energy systems shows that the threat actors have the capability and interest in targeting these critical systems. There are emerging areas of vulnerability that the solar industry is working to address to mitigate financial, reputational, and operational risks to the energy sector.

Much like the rest of the energy sector, solar and storage supply chains were not originally designed with security in mind. With many global sources and complex interdependencies, components that enable remote connectivity and digital control must be reliable and secure. While details are still scarce, recent reporting on the potential presence of undocumented communications devices in solar and storage technologies sourced from China underscores the need for policy, technical, and organizational approaches to address the cybersecurity of our energy supply chains.

An important element of bolstering the security of the energy supply chain is to reshore more of it to the United States. Global supply chains not only create digital risks, but also geopolitical ones. Reshoring production of solar modules, inverters, and batteries offers a way to reduce exposure to potential foreign interference, while strengthening domestic jobs and energy independence.

Though cybersecurity is an ever-evolving practice, some protections are evergreen. These include changing default passwords and using strong, unique passwords, removing operational technology (OT) connections from the internet, securing remote access, properly segmenting critical OT systems from enterprise IT networks, implementing and exercising incident response plans, manual backups, and network monitoring, and using a risk-based approach to manage and mitigate vulnerabilities. As the need for strong cybersecurity measures for the electric sector has grown, industry, government, and other stakeholders have worked to develop and disseminate new resources and tools.

For instance, SEIA, along with partners at the North American Reliability Corporation (NERC), Sandia National Laboratories, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration, developed a comprehensive list of security recommendations for large-scale solar inverter-based resources and behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs) to support secure and reliable energy delivery.

Similarly, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) partnered with DOE to develop cybersecurity baselines for electric distribution systems and DERs. The baselines will be followed by Implementation Strategies and Adoption Guidelines to support distribution system stakeholders in developing cybersecurity requirements.

SEIA is the leading voice for a secure and resilient solar and storage industry.

Last month, community members, environmental leaders, and public officials boarded a bus for an unforgettable journey through San Antonio’s Southside—a place where pollution, policy failure, and resilience intersect. The Environmental Justice Bus Tour was more than a ride; it was a call to building partnerships for real solutions because it is way past time.

For decades, communities near the former Kelly Air Force Base have endured the long-term effects of environmental contamination. From toxic groundwater plumes to noise and air pollution from nearby industry, residents in the 78211 zip code face serious health risks and environmental hazards—often with little accountability or support.

This tour was designed to connect decision-makers directly to these frontline stories—so they could hear, see, and feel what residents experience daily. It was never about assigning blame—it was about truth-telling, witnessing, and honoring those who spent a lifetime trying to make that change.

What We Saw

Under the Overpass: Our first stop brought us into the noise and chaos of truck traffic, cement dust, and the voices of neighbors like Victor San Miguel, who spoke of day-to-day life amid industrial pollution. KSAT was there to cover the story.

Toxic Vapors in Homes: We examined homes built over a contaminated aquifer, where chemicals like TCE and PCE rise into living spaces—especially during Texas’s brutal heatwaves.

Air Quality Gaps: We reviewed maps that revealed the disturbing truth that air monitors are not located where pollution is situated.

The Impact of Industry: From metal shredders to silica sand dust, trains and fire-prone recycling centers, industrial facilities are pressing up against homes and playgrounds, often with tiny buffers or protection and little to no regulation to control the situation.

The Community Speaks

Along the way, residents and advocates told their stories inside a rented bus.

Diana Lopez, Debra Ponce, Sondra Garcia, and Victor San Miguel shared the history of grassroots organizing since the 1990s.

Cheyenne Rendon, Dee Dee Belmares, Sharron Brown, Judith Temple, and Larry Garcia gave voice to today’s fight against unregulated shredders, against more peaker plants, against the placement of diesel generators beside neighborhood homes, and for accountability.

We also heard from scientists, nonprofit leaders, and neighborhood association leaders who joined in the conversation, many of whom have worked unpaid for years to protect their communities.

Deceleration was also there to provide this coverage.

What We’re Asking For

A pause on new toxic or heavy industrial permits in this small, already impacted area. These neighborhoods have carried the burden of toxic industry for too long.

More vigorous enforcement of existing codes, fire safety, and emissions monitoring.

Long-term health protections and transparent cleanup plans for residents living near contaminated sites.

Inclusion of community voices in city and county planning processes that affect their future.

Hope in Action

The Environmental Justice Bus Tour highlighted not only the problems but also the powerful coalition rising to meet them. From UTSA’s air monitoring projects to City-led tree planting and grassroots-led code reform, the seeds of justice are already in the ground. Now we need to nurture them.

This Was Just the Beginning

Environmental justice isn’t a moment—it’s a movement. And after this tour, more people are paying attention. Our community is organized, and they are speaking for themselves. They are asking for a seat at the decision-making table that affects them, because the science is clear and the need is urgent.

Now we’re asking our leaders to take this information back with them—and use it to make better-informed decisions rooted in policy, investment, and courage. Our collective work will move forward because our community is counting on us to do so.

We're at the point now where renewable energy and energy efficiency are by far the cheapest forms of energy available,” Darin said.
According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, 91% of new renewable energy projects built in 2024 were cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.
Renewable energy investments Federal government investments into renewable energy will continue to take a hit, according to a report from E2, a nonpartisan business analysis group.
“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies.","Illinois officials pledged to take on new green energy projects and step away from fossil fuel reliance, but the state has hit a major roadblock in that pledge – the federal government.

In 2021, Illinois became the first state in the Midwest to pass legislation creating a roadmap for the state to ban coal and other fossil fuels, while dedicating over $1 billion to rapidly boost the state’s wind, solar and nuclear energy production.

By 2030, the state’s existing coal plants would have to emit zero carbon emissions or be shut down. By 2050, the state would mandate only clean energy sources for electricity.

""We can't outrun or hide from climate change – not to the north, where the Boundary Waters burn; not to the south, where [Hurricane] Ida swallows lives and livelihoods in the blink of an eye,"" Pritzker said in a statement when he signed the bill into law.

Four years and a new president later, hopes for a cleaner electrical grid in Illinois are looking darker.

Sierra Club Illinois Director Jack Darin said Illinois and the federal government have two different, conflicting energy goals, and the state will have to rely on itself to accomplish its green energy goals.

“We're doing what we can to attract those projects and those good jobs here to Illinois, but yes, it absolutely gets harder when the federal government is trying to chase them out of the country,” Darin said. “Illinois is on its own in building our clean energy future.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed much of the green energy work done under President Joe Biden. In June, Trump canceled nearly $250 million in grants going toward Illinois companies for green energy projects. Tax credits for installing solar panels or purchasing electric vehicles are set to be eliminated under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Environmental advocacy group Prairie Rivers Network’s Director of Energy and Community Resiliency Amanda Pankua said the federal government is making it harder to invest in clean energy for companies and consumers.

“We know that clean energy is the cheapest and often the quickest way to get new, clean, non-polluting, cheap electricity onto the grid. And this administration is rolling back incentives to make that happen,” Pankua said.

Trump’s cuts are also affecting state programs. Trump pulled around $130 million from Illinois’ Solar for All program, which helped low-income residents install rooftop solar panels and other related programs.

Pankua said tax credits like this are the “bread and butter” of transitioning people to green energy. She added without it, moving toward green energy will be harder.

While Illinois has pledged to shut down coal plants over the next several decades, the U.S. Department of Energy is looking to keep those same plants running longer.

The DOE announced last week a $625 million investment in recommissioning old coal plants, developing new wastewater management systems to extend the life of coal plants and funding coal plant technology improvements.

Reenergizing coal energy production will help save jobs and lower energy costs while being more reliable than green energy, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a press release.

“These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption,” Wright said in a press release.

The DOE hasn’t yet announced which projects will receive money and whether funding will be grants or loans.

Darin said the Trump administration has it backward and green energy is the cheaper, safer energy source, not coal.

“These steps would be a giant step backward on climate action, but also a huge increase in costs to consumers. We're at the point now where renewable energy and energy efficiency are by far the cheapest forms of energy available,” Darin said.

According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, 91% of new renewable energy projects built in 2024 were cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.

Renewable energy investments

Federal government investments into renewable energy will continue to take a hit, according to a report from E2, a nonpartisan business analysis group.

Over 10,000 jobs in clean energy and $14 billion in renewable energy investments have been canceled or downsized in the U.S. since January over uncertainty about changes to energy policy from the federal government, according to the report.

In Illinois, electric bus producer Lion Electric’s plans for a facility in Joliet and electric vehicle manufacturer Stellantis NV’s plan for a battery and large parts hub in Belvidere will be delayed for years.

E2 estimates the two projects’ cancellation and delays account for over $3 billion in investments lost and nearly 2,500 jobs lost.

With a loss of interest from the federal government, Illinois will have to fill the gaps left by the Trump administration.

“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies. However, we're not immune,” Darin said. “When Trump is raising rates to prop up fossil fuel companies in other states. It does have an impact on prices here in Illinois.”

Environmental activists hope Illinois can fill some of those gaps with legislation in the October veto session. On the negotiation table are bills investing in battery storage for the electrical grid to store electricity produced by renewable energy and creating new nuclear reactors across the state.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66a70c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+90/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F5d%2F7e8f2888440d832205b70f2ebf7b%2Felectricity-1330214-1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 20:01:39.370494

News that Entergy was set to power Meta’s flagship 2GW “Hyperion” data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, first broke late last year.
To power the data center, Entergy plans to construct three gas-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.26GW.
To serve the data center, Entergy will build several new transmission lines, including a $1.2 billion 100-mile 500kV project, slated for completion in December 2026.
According to Data Center Map, it has 23 operational facilities.","“We’re seeing interest in things as small as 100-plus megawatts all the way up to gigawatt-scale projects,” he said to Bloomberg. The company is engaged with a “fairly robust pipeline of other hyperscalers.” According to the utility, the interest is based on the region's ample land access, a willing government, and reduced hurricane risk compared to the Gulf Coast.

At present, Entergy, which supplies power to customers across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, has a data center pipeline of between five to 10GW. According to May, the utility is confident that it can meet the power demands of any interested hyperscaler. “As I like to say, ‘Use all you want, we’ll make more,’” he said.

News that Entergy was set to power Meta’s flagship 2GW “Hyperion” data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, first broke late last year. The campus is planned for construction on 2,250 acres between the municipalities of Rayville and Delhi, about 30 miles (48.2km) east of Monroe. Renderings of the campus suggest up to nine buildings are being planned, with construction expected to be completed in phases through 2030.

To power the data center, Entergy plans to construct three gas-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.26GW. The utility obtained approval to construct the facilities from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August.

Two of the units are expected to come online in 2028, with the third facility, built at Entergy Louisiana's existing Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, expected to commence operations in late 2029.

To serve the data center, Entergy will build several new transmission lines, including a $1.2 billion 100-mile 500kV project, slated for completion in December 2026. In addition, the utility will construct two substations, six customer-owned substations, and eight new 230kV transmission lines.

In June, the utility broke ground on the first substation. The Smalling Substation is being constructed in Richland Parish and will be entirely funded by Meta. When completed, it will span 55 acres and connect to high-voltage power lines that bring energy from across the region and deliver it to the Meta site. Meta has offered to offset most of the costs for Entergy's customers, with the company set to pay the full annual revenue for the plants for 15 years.

However, the project has faced opposition, with environmental groups arguing that Entergy did not follow the correct procedure when proposing the new gas-fired plants, which could result in significant costs for ratepayers.

At present, Louisiana is a relatively small data center market. According to Data Center Map, it has 23 operational facilities.

Infratil Newsletter – September 2025

Infratil Investor Day

We had a fantastic turnout from institutional investors and analysts at Infratil’s Investor Day in Sydney on 18 September. As Chair Alison Gerry said in her welcome, with Infratil now in the S&P/ASX 200 index and more than 40% of our investment portfolio in Australia, we are actively trying to grow our Australian shareholder base - which is part of the reason for hosting this event in Australia.

The theme of our Investor Day was ‘Portfolio Set for Growth’ with CEO Jason Boyes talking about our plans to prioritise further investment in the fast-growing digital and renewable energy sectors while simplifying our current portfolio.

You can watch Jason’s presentation, as well as those from four of our portfolio companies and the Morrison management team online at https://infratil.com/for-investors/investor-days/.

One of the key slides from Jason’s presentation sets out how we are thinking about the role of the various businesses within the ‘pillars’ of our portfolio and the potential to grow Infratil’s market cap to NZ$20 billion over the next five years.

We are prioritising capital towards assets that will drive long-term shareholder value and looking at divesting businesses unlikely to scale under our ownership. This is expected to result in a smaller number of larger, high conviction assets in in Pillar 1 & 2. Pillar 3 businesses are those that we will look to grow over the next three to five years.

On 18 September we announced a strategic review of Australian medical imaging business Qscan, with our 57% shareholding last valued at NZ$460 million. This follows on from our announcement in August that we had sold our 50% stake in RetireAustralia for NZ$328 million, with the transaction due to be completed by the end of 2025.

Further announcements are expected this financial year as we progress toward our $1 billion divestment target. Proceeds from divestments are expected to be reinvested into existing or new opportunities that align with our growth ambitions. CDC and Gurīn Energy’s Project Vanda are two existing candidates that we have noted for this potential reinvestment.

CDC confirms step-up in demand for future-proof capacity

CDC CEO Greg Boorer told our Sydney Investor Day audience that he hates going to sleep because it means he can’t be talking to someone about growing the business. “I’m more confident than ever that we can sell every megawatt that we can build”, he said, noting that global customers are tracking CDC’s build programme very closely.

On 24 September he proved that his customer focus is getting results, with CDC announcing it had secured approximately 100MW of new contracted capacity. To put this in context, this new demand equates to just over a quarter of CDC’s existing operating capacity in June. This keeps CDC on track to double its FY25 earnings by FY27, with approximately 95% of the required forecast lease revenues now under contract.

The announcement also underscores the strong, ongoing demand in the Australasian data centre market. CDC noted that contract sizes are getting larger with a “tsunami” of demand from hyperscale and AI customers. They are now CDC’s largest customer segment, contributing about three times the revenue they did just four years ago.

The contract announcement is hot on the heels of CDC confirming that it plans to build its first data centre in Western Australia. The new campus is to be built in Maddington, about 20 kilometres from central Perth. CDC said the decision to build in Western Australia reflects the region’s increasing importance for national and regional security, with its connectivity and proximity to Southeast Asia another potential benefit. The region also has an abundance of renewable energy.

Some of the technology trends that are helping differentiate CDC’s data centres from other providers are shown in the slide below. CDC’s data centres have been built to handle very high floor loadings, so even their oldest data centres can accommodate increasingly heavy computing technology. CDC recirculates water in a ‘closed loop’ for cooling purposes, which means minimal water use, and this is helping expedite consenting for new CDC sites in areas where water supply is limited.

Slide 19 – Infratil Investor Day: CDC Update

Longer tax credits for Longroad Energy

In mid-August Longroad Energy received updated regulatory guidance on when wind and solar projects qualify for tax credits in the United States. At our Sydney Investor Day, the Longroad team said they now had about 6GW of projects qualified, with scope to add more to this before July 2026. More importantly, about half of Longroad Energy’s current tax credits are for battery project spend, and these tax credits will continue to be available on battery investment into the 2030’s.

The other positive aspect of their presentation is the soaring demand for electricity, as shown on the slide below, with approximately 40GW of new capacity being added annually over the last five years and about 80GW per year forecast from 2025 to 2045. This growth is driven by new data centres, industrial growth and electrification. Longroad Energy is targeting growth in its operating portfolio from 5.5GW in 2025 to 10GW by 2028.

Longroad has just confirmed construction of their seventh renewable energy project in Texas, which is set to deliver energy for Meta. This is a clear example of the convergence between our two growth thematics: renewable energy and digital infrastructure.

Longroad Energy CEO Paul Gaynor said, “1000 Mile is Longroad’s largest solar project to date and its output will advance Meta’s target to support its data center operations with 100% clean energy.” It is estimated that the 1000 Mile project will reduce regional emissions by approximately 475,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually.

Slide 12 – Infratil Investor Day: Longroad Update

Gurīn Energy poised for growth

Gurīn Energy’s CEO Assaad Razzouk was recently recognised in Singapore’s The Peak magazine Power List for his efforts to drive energy transition in Asia. The potential demand for renewable energy across the region is estimated at more than 250GW by 2030, reflecting population and data centre demand growth, together with government net zero targets.

Gurīn Energy has already identified 8GW of mixed mid and late-stage projects in various Asian markets out to 2030, with 5.5GW owned by Gurīn Energy. Presenting at Infratil’s Investor Day, the Gurīn Energy team detailed their work to develop these solar and battery projects across the Philippines, Japan, South Korea and Singapore (see slide below). Each project requires consideration of varying local conditions as part of Gurīn Energy’s environmental and social screening framework.

The Vanda Solar and Battery Project would be among the largest planned solar-plus-storage projects in the world and is a joint venture between Gurīn Energy and Gentari International Renewables. The project has been granted an import licence from Singapore and the next key milestone is an export licence from Indonesia.

Gurīn Energy’s involvement in Project Vanda would be transformational for the business and financial close is expected in 2026. Construction would begin in 2027 with Phase 1 expected to be operational in 2028.To date, about 90% of the necessary land has been acquired and total capex is expected to be US$2-3 billion, with US$500 million of equity required.

AI agent and sustainability initiatives grab global attention for One NZ

Despite the wider challenges posed by the New Zealand economy, One NZ is continuing to deliver steady performance. One NZ CEO Jason Paris said “We are competing well and have good trading momentum. We are attracting and retaining high value customers through our differentiated One NZ Satellite and One Wallet propositions. Our IT modernisation programme is on track, and we continue to deploy AI across every part of our business.”

The team’s commitment to moving fast in trialling AI means One NZ is working together with global AI providers as a test bed for solutions. Following recent storms, for example, AI agents were monitoring the network and automatically reducing the power usage on cellsites in areas where power supply had been affected. AI is also being used to develop a customer experience score that identifies customers having network issues and how these can be resolved, all before the customer needs to contact One NZ.

One NZ is also making strong progress in sustainability, winning the ‘Medium Company of the Year Award’ in the Global Sustainability Awards in September.

New wings soar at Wellington Airport

Early August saw the unveiling of a new terminal centrepiece, a 15-metre artwork sculpture representing the local bird spirit Manu Muramura, in Wellington Airport.

Wellington’s international passengers have consistently tracked ahead of 2024 levels in recent months, with August numbers up more than 5% on last year. Monthly domestic passengers have also lifted in recent months, with August numbers down just 1% from last year despite a larger reduction in capacity.

International flights are set to get a further boost with Qantas’ plans to add more summer capacity into Wellington, including plans to introduce one of their new A220-300 aircraft on the Brisbane route from early next year. Wellington Airport is also working to open up new routes with a Memorandum of Understanding signed with China’s busiest airport in September. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport hosted more than 76 million passengers in 2024 and the new agreement includes a focus on developing the aviation market between the two regions.

Other recent developments

Infratil CEO Jason Boyes was interviewed by Australian stockbroking firm Bell Potter in early September. You can watch the interview on Bell Potter’s YouTube channel.

In September, Qscan announced the acquisition of ClinRad’s four clinics providing x-ray, CT and ultrasound services in Brisbane. This expands Qscan’s footprint to more areas with strong growth opportunities.

Auckland Radiology opened its new purpose-built flagship clinic in Remuera, Auckland, in August. With more space and advanced diagnostic imaging equipment, the clinic will help improve patient outcomes and reduce delays in treatment.

“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies.","Illinois officials pledged to take on new green energy projects and step away from fossil fuel reliance, but the state has hit a major roadblock in that pledge – the federal government.

In 2021, Illinois became the first state in the Midwest to pass legislation creating a roadmap for the state to ban coal and other fossil fuels, while dedicating over $1 billion to rapidly boost the state’s wind, solar and nuclear energy production.

By 2030, the state’s existing coal plants would have to emit zero carbon emissions or be shut down. By 2050, the state would mandate only clean energy sources for electricity.

""We can't outrun or hide from climate change – not to the north, where the Boundary Waters burn; not to the south, where [Hurricane] Ida swallows lives and livelihoods in the blink of an eye,"" Pritzker said in a statement when he signed the bill into law.

Four years and a new president later, hopes for a cleaner electrical grid in Illinois are looking darker.

Sierra Club Illinois Director Jack Darin said Illinois and the federal government have two different, conflicting energy goals, and the state will have to rely on itself to accomplish its green energy goals.

“We're doing what we can to attract those projects and those good jobs here to Illinois, but yes, it absolutely gets harder when the federal government is trying to chase them out of the country,” Darin said. “Illinois is on its own in building our clean energy future.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed much of the green energy work done under President Joe Biden. In June, Trump canceled nearly $250 million in grants going toward Illinois companies for green energy projects. Tax credits for installing solar panels or purchasing electric vehicles are set to be eliminated under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Environmental advocacy group Prairie Rivers Network’s Director of Energy and Community Resiliency Amanda Pankua said the federal government is making it harder to invest in clean energy for companies and consumers.

“We know that clean energy is the cheapest and often the quickest way to get new, clean, non-polluting, cheap electricity onto the grid. And this administration is rolling back incentives to make that happen,” Pankua said.

Trump’s cuts are also affecting state programs. Trump pulled around $130 million from Illinois’ Solar for All program, which helped low-income residents install rooftop solar panels and other related programs.

Pankua said tax credits like this are the “bread and butter” of transitioning people to green energy. She added without it, moving toward green energy will be harder.

While Illinois has pledged to shut down coal plants over the next several decades, the U.S. Department of Energy is looking to keep those same plants running longer.

The DOE announced last week a $625 million investment in recommissioning old coal plants, developing new wastewater management systems to extend the life of coal plants and funding coal plant technology improvements.

Reenergizing coal energy production will help save jobs and lower energy costs while being more reliable than green energy, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a press release.

“These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption,” Wright said in a press release.

The DOE hasn’t yet announced which projects will receive money and whether funding will be grants or loans.

Darin said the Trump administration has it backward and green energy is the cheaper, safer energy source, not coal.

“These steps would be a giant step backward on climate action, but also a huge increase in costs to consumers. We're at the point now where renewable energy and energy efficiency are by far the cheapest forms of energy available,” Darin said.

According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, 91% of new renewable energy projects built in 2024 were cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.

Renewable energy investments

Federal government investments into renewable energy will continue to take a hit, according to a report from E2, a nonpartisan business analysis group.

Over 10,000 jobs in clean energy and $14 billion in renewable energy investments have been canceled or downsized in the U.S. since January over uncertainty about changes to energy policy from the federal government, according to the report.

In Illinois, electric bus producer Lion Electric’s plans for a facility in Joliet and electric vehicle manufacturer Stellantis NV’s plan for a battery and large parts hub in Belvidere will be delayed for years.

E2 estimates the two projects’ cancellation and delays account for over $3 billion in investments lost and nearly 2,500 jobs lost.

With a loss of interest from the federal government, Illinois will have to fill the gaps left by the Trump administration.

“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies. However, we're not immune,” Darin said. “When Trump is raising rates to prop up fossil fuel companies in other states. It does have an impact on prices here in Illinois.”

Environmental activists hope Illinois can fill some of those gaps with legislation in the October veto session. On the negotiation table are bills investing in battery storage for the electrical grid to store electricity produced by renewable energy and creating new nuclear reactors across the state.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66a70c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+90/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb6%2F5d%2F7e8f2888440d832205b70f2ebf7b%2Felectricity-1330214-1280.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 18:02:59.977592

In certain states with additional incentives (like New York), buyers may see even lower prices, with the Model 3 Standard potentially dropping to $34,990 and the Model Y Standard to $37,990.
Meanwhile, the Model Y Standard comes with a slightly stronger 300-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and matches the same 321-mile estimated range.
For example, the Model Y Standard features a redesigned front look, smaller 18-inch wheels, and a simplified interior with cloth seats and manual seat adjustments.
Actually, the monthly lease for the Model Y increased to $529–$599, while Model 3 lease rates grew to $429–$759 to offset the loss of federal subsidies.","With the US ending tax benefits for electric cars, Tesla has launched more affordable versions of two of its most popular electric vehicles, the Model Y and Model 3, introducing the new ‘Standard’ models. In the United States, the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990 (~ 10% less expensive than the prior base model), while the Model 3 Standard begins at $36,990. In certain states with additional incentives (like New York), buyers may see even lower prices, with the Model 3 Standard potentially dropping to $34,990 and the Model Y Standard to $37,990. These models come after the federal $7,500 EV tax credit expired.

Despite the lower price tags, the company claims that the new Model 3 and Model Y retain strong performance and an impressive driving range. The Model 3 Standard is powered by a 286-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and offers an estimated range of 321 miles on a single charge when equipped with 18-inch wheels. Meanwhile, the Model Y Standard comes with a slightly stronger 300-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and matches the same 321-mile estimated range. Both vehicles use a 69.5 kWh battery pack and can charge at a maximum rate of 225 kW using Tesla’s Supercharger network.

However, to reach these lower prices, the Elon Musk-led EV giant has made several design and feature adjustments. For example, the Model Y Standard features a redesigned front look, smaller 18-inch wheels, and a simplified interior with cloth seats and manual seat adjustments. It also replaces the panoramic glass roof found in higher-priced models with a more standard closed roof. From a production point of view, the new Model Y is about 20% cheaper to make than the previous version, with the company expected to produce around 250,000 units annually in the US by 2026. Also, the Model 3 Standard has undergone similar changes, with some updates to the interior and exterior to keep costs down while maintaining the car’s core performance and range.

The timing of this launch is closely linked to the recent expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025. The change has already affected Tesla customers, with lease prices increasing by up to $120 per month for older models. Actually, the monthly lease for the Model Y increased to $529–$599, while Model 3 lease rates grew to $429–$759 to offset the loss of federal subsidies.

This latest effort becomes even more critical for the company, as it is facing a challenging year. Its stock has fallen about 25% since early 2025, with Q1 profits dropping 71% to $19.3 billion in revenue, and Q2 deliveries falling 13% to 384,122 vehicles. The company, which recently revealed a potential $1 trillion payout for Elon Musk, is continuing to face significant legal scrutiny. Tesla was recently sued by the family of a teenager killed in a crash involving the Cybertruck door design. Last month, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also launched a preliminary investigation into 174,000 Tesla Model Y cars from 2021 due to reported issues with their electronic door handles.",https://thetechportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tesla-new-model-y.webp,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:19.733396

Thank you for choosing reliability over rhetoric, production over pretense, and American energy over dependence.
Emily Arthun is President & CEO of the American Coal Council.","Every so often Washington makes a decision that isn’t about political buzzwords or rhetoric, instead it’s about whether the lights stay on and whether a paystub shows up on a Friday. This is one of those moments. The Department of Energy’s $625 million commitment to reinvigorate America’s coal fleet, paired with the Department of the Interior’s decision to open 13.1 million acres for coal leasing while streamlining approvals and right-sizing royalties, tells the country—plainly—that reliable, affordable, plentiful power is back at the center of national policy. On behalf of producers, transporters, suppliers, utilities, and the hundreds of thousands of men and women whose craft keeps America powered, the American Coal Council says: thank you.

For years, we were told that “something else” would seamlessly replace baseload power. But reality is a stubborn thing, and peak demand is unforgiving. During unrelenting summer heat or frigid winter snaps hard, press releases don’t turn turbines and hashtags don’t boil water. Actual baseload megawatts do. The Department of Energy’s investment recognizes this truth. By directing $350 million to recommission and retrofit coal units, DOE is turning near-term reliability from a talking point into dispatchable capacity. By targeting rural affordability and flexibility—funding wastewater upgrades that extend plant life and co-firing options that add operational agility, DOE is giving operators the tools they need to perform when the grid needs them most. This is not theory. It is steel, wire, boilers, and crews—standing ready at 6 p.m. on a windless January evening and at 3 p.m. on a hot August weekday when factories and data centers are pulling hard.

Interior’s action is the complementary half of the same common-sense equation. Power plants cannot run on optimism; they run on fuel secured through lawful leases, workable permits, and predictable timelines. Opening 13.1 million acres for coal leasing, guided by Executive Orders 14261 and 14241, moves coal from the “constrained input” column to the “accessible resource” column—exactly where it belongs in a nation intent on reindustrialization. When Secretary Doug Burgum signed the policy initiative to expand leasing, reduce the royalty rate to a market reality of 7%, and cut red tape on reviews, he sent an unmistakable message: we will produce energy here at home, with American workers and American standards, and we will do it on a schedule that aligns with real-world demand.

This is energy policy that respects the American worker. From Freedom and Falkirk in North Dakota to expansions at Warrior Met, Skyline, Spring Creek, and West Antelope III, Interior’s leasing posture translates into shifts on the mine plan, trains on the rail, barges on the river, and megawatts on the wire. It also translates into the morning routines of families whose livelihoods depend on this industry: lunches packed on a kitchen counter, kids on a bus, a mortgage paid, a pew filled on Sunday. When Washington gets energy right, it strengthens the very communities that anchor this country.

The administration’s emphasis on recovering critical minerals from mine waste is another example of practical stewardship. Through Secretary’s Order 3436, Interior’s push—with USGS and state partners—to map deposits and fast-track projects for uranium, zinc, germanium, tellurium, and rare earths recognizes that the future of defense, manufacturing, and energy security runs through American resourcefulness. Coal communities know the terrain, the geology, and the logistics better than anyone. Enlisting their expertise to extract additional value from legacy sites turns yesterday’s tailings into tomorrow’s strategic inputs—and it does so while remediating lands with the people who know them best.

We also welcome the clarity and regulatory certainty that come with streamlining approvals. Energy projects fail not because they are impossible but because the calendar gets weaponized. A maintenance upgrade that should take months becomes a multi-year odyssey; a routine expansion sinks under the weight of duplicative reviews and shifting standards. Interior’s move to accelerate leasing decisions and use commonsense approaches under NEPA is not a “giveaway.” It is an admission that the public interest is not served by paralysis. The public interest is served by good projects built well, observed by real inspectors, and delivered on time.

DOE’s investment framework mirrors that realism. Funding for wastewater systems is not glamorous, but it is the difference between a plant that limps toward retirement and a plant that earns another decade of dependable service. Support for dual-fuel retrofits and natural-gas co-firing does not “replace” coal; it gives operators the flexibility to meet the moment without walking away from the backbone of baseload. In short, the Department’s program honors the craft of the people who run these plants—the engineers who balance heat rates and emissions profiles, the maintenance crews who crawl boilers in August, the operators who manage frequency and voltage when the grid sways.

Americans have learned, the hard way, that you can’t command the weather, you can’t legislate inertia, and you cannot build an AI economy on wishful thinking. Algorithms sleep when the power fails. Semiconductor furnaces do not “wait” for wind. Hospitals cannot postpone a January night. The choice before us was never “old versus new.” It was “real versus rhetorical.” By aligning leasing, permitting, and investment with the grid we actually live on, DOI and DOE choose the real. That choice protects consumers from spiraling bills and rolling blackouts. It protects industry from the whiplash of scarcity pricing and curtailments. And it protects national security by anchoring energy in American hands.

To the men and women in hard hats and coveralls who make this all work: today’s actions are an affirmation of your place in America’s future. Miners in the high plains and the hollows, dispatchers in control rooms, electricians and mechanics who keep the systems tight and true—you have been told for a decade that you are the past. The truth is simpler: you are essential. You were essential when polar air snapped pipelines and coal carried the load. You were essential when a summer heat wave pushed reserve margins thin and coal units stood up and took the weight. You will be essential tomorrow as we build steel, pour concrete, and power the data centers that will define the next economy.

To our partners across the value chain—railroads and barge lines, port operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, and utilities—these decisions offer something we have been missing: predictability. Predictability is the hidden currency of capital planning. It lets a mine invest in a new section, a plant invest in a turbine overhaul, a utility file an integrated resource plan that treats firm power as more than a contingency. Predictability also strengthens environmental performance, because operators can adopt better technology on a timetable that makes sense instead of on a roulette wheel of delays and litigation.

We are grateful to Secretary Burgum and the Department of the Interior for opening the acreage, restoring competitiveness through a fair royalty rate, and cutting through the procedural fog that too often chokes good projects. We are grateful to Secretary Chris Wright and the Department of Energy for funding the practical, near-term upgrades that translate into reliability and affordability for families and businesses. And we appreciate the complementary work by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and DOE Undersecretary P. Wells Griffith to align policy across agencies so that producers, utilities, and communities get one clear message: America intends to produce energy—responsibly, abundantly, and at home.

The American Coal Council believes in an “all-that-works” strategy that earns its keep. Coal has carried the baseload for generations because it is engineered to do so—because it is stockpiled on site, resistant to weather shocks, and dispatchable when it counts. That truth does not erase other sources; it anchors them. It provides the firm foundation on which innovation stands. With DOE’s investment and DOI’s leasing action, that foundation just got stronger.

We measure policy not by the decibels of its announcement but by the steadiness of its results: bills that don’t wreck a family budget, factories that don’t idle on hot afternoons, winter nights that pass without incident, and small towns that hum with work. By that measure, these decisions are wins—wins for consumers, for workers, for national security, and for an American future that builds instead of imports, that competes instead of concedes, that keeps faith with the people who make and move the power that keeps us free.

So yes—thank you. Thank you for choosing reliability over rhetoric, production over pretense, and American energy over dependence. Now let’s get to work.

A major U.S. investment plan could mark the start of a new chapter for one of Detroit’s most storied automakers.","Stellantis is reportedly preparing a massive $10 billion investment plan, with a focus squarely on the United States — its most profitable and strategically vital market.

According to multiple reports, the automaker may soon announce about $5 billion in new investments, adding to a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year. The plan would target key manufacturing states, such as Michigan and Illinois, signaling a renewed commitment to domestic production, job creation, and product expansion after years of focusing on lower-cost markets.

Rebuilding the American Core –

Under CEO Antonio Filosa, who took over in May, Stellantis appears to be recalibrating its strategy to rebuild brand strength in the U.S. and reestablish its industrial footprint. The company is expected to channel the funds into reopening plants, launching new models, and expanding its workforce. The Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which has been idle since February 2023, is said to play a central role, with Stellantis already pledging to return roughly 1,500 employees to work there.

Filosa’s approach contrasts with that of former CEO Carlos Tavares, who aggressively relocated production and engineering operations to cost-efficient regions, such as Mexico, and heavily invested in Europe, where profitability remains weaker. Filosa’s new roadmap appears to prioritize the U.S., where demand for trucks, SUVs, and muscle cars continues to drive profits.

Reviving Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep® –

Sources indicate that Stellantis is intent on revitalizing the Jeep® brand — long considered the company’s crown jewel in America — after recent declines in market share. The Dodge brand could also see renewed attention, with whispers suggesting potential investment in a new HEMI®-powered Dodge Charger model to complement the all-electric Charger Daytona and upcoming twin-turbo HURRICANE Dodge Charger SIXPACK cars. Meanwhile, Chrysler may receive long-overdue product expansion, a move previously hinted at by CEO Christine Feuell at the Chrysler Carlisle Nationals earlier this year.

If realized, these efforts could reinvigorate Stellantis’ reputation among American consumers and restore confidence in the automaker’s domestic operations.

Political and Economic Timing –

The timing of this investment wave also aligns with broader industry trends. With President Donald Trump’s administration incentivizing U.S. manufacturing and threatening steep tariffs on imported vehicles, Stellantis’ move could help curry favor with the administration while safeguarding its North American supply chain.

Chairman John Elkann has reportedly met with President Trump to discuss U.S. manufacturing commitments, including plans for a new midsize pickup — potentially bound for Belvidere. That vehicle would likely compete in a red-hot segment dominated by the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.

Navigating Tariff Risks –

Stellantis is reportedly lobbying the government to ease proposed 25% tariffs that could impact its Ram Heavy Duty pickups, currently built in Mexico. Shifting some production back to the U.S. would not only mitigate that risk but also strengthen Stellantis’ “Made in America” image.

While the exact projects remain under review, one thing is clear — Stellantis is preparing to double down on its American roots.

“This demonstrates the critical role that vehicle batteries can play in powering the nation’s grid, accelerating American energy independence and dominance.
Their partnership launched last summer with vehicle-to-home (V2H) capability, a less-complicated function than sharing stored energy with the local grid.
The program marks a milestone for distributed power plants in America, demonstrating how large EV batteries can stabilize the grid, provide backup power to homes, and lower overall energy costs.
“Enabling customers to not only power their homes, but send power directly back to the grid in times of need, helps customers with financial incentives, utilities with more power capacity, and society through more grid reliability and sustainable energy practices.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Or, in this case, three pickup trucks.

Sunrun, the largest provider of residential solar, battery energy storage, and home-to-grid power plants in the United States, has activated the nation’s first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) distributed power plant in partnership with Maryland’s largest utility, Exelon subsidiary Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE).

Starting in July, enrolled Ford F-150 Lightning trucks (yes, all three!) dispatched energy to the grid during peak summer demand hours from 5 to 9 p.m. on weekdays. Participating customers received a payment based on the amount of energy shared, up to a maximum of $1,000 for the ‘dispatching season,’ which ran through the end of September.

“This demonstrates the critical role that vehicle batteries can play in powering the nation’s grid, accelerating American energy independence and dominance. It’s great to see our partnership with BGE and Ford move to this commercial stage,” observed Sunrun CEO Mary Powell. “In addition to showing how electric vehicles (EVs) can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers.”

While certainly small to start and slow to progress, the pilot promises incredible potential, as Powell recognizes, and could represent the future of resiliency, both for homeowners and electric utilities.

How We Got Here

BGE was awarded grant funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to create an EV virtual power plant (VPP) and partnered with Sunrun to develop and administer the program. Their partnership launched last summer with vehicle-to-home (V2H) capability, a less-complicated function than sharing stored energy with the local grid.

“This program is a significant proof of concept — no other market player has done this — and the goal is to expand these programs all around the country,” said Powell at the time. “This exciting partnership lays the foundation for the power grid of the future, where electric vehicle owners can contribute to grid resiliency and utility price stability for everyone.”

In June, Maryland’s Public Service Commission unanimously voted to adopt a comprehensive suite of V2G interconnection rules, becoming the first state to do so and paving the way for broader adoption. The rules were established by the Vehicle-Grid Integration Council (VGIC), an advocacy group dedicated to advancing EVs and associated technologies, including smart charging.

This summer, Ford and Sunrun pushed the envelope further in the name of pioneering V2G energy dispatch, activating the nation’s first residential bidirectional EV distributed power plant. Using the tandem’s co-developed Home Integration System, pilot participants sent energy from their all-electric pickup truck batteries to their homes and the grid. When paired with the Home Integration System and Sunrun’s Charge Station Pro, Ford’s F-150 Lightning can deliver up to 9.6 kW of power.

The program marks a milestone for distributed power plants in America, demonstrating how large EV batteries can stabilize the grid, provide backup power to homes, and lower overall energy costs.

“Vehicle-to-grid technology lets electric vehicles do more than just drive—they can actually help power our homes and communities,” confirmed Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at BGE. “By sharing stored energy with the grid when it is needed most, these vehicles make our energy system more reliable, more efficient, and even help lower electricity costs for customers.”

“When we enacted the DRIVE Act in 2024, it was exactly this type of innovation and collaboration that we hoped to unlock,” added Maryland State Delegate David Fraser-Hidalgo. “I am excited to see this milestone reached, as we hope to see these types of customer-centered solutions scale up to meet our state’s electricity needs.”

Overcoming Technological Hurdles

EVs have long been acknowledged as a potential ‘new’ power source for electric utilities. Researchers in the late 1990s theorized that compensation for dispatching to the grid would help offset ownership costs, and the EV’s battery life would not be noticeably impacted by such use. If only 25% of the United States adopted electric vehicles with bidirectional chargers, they found, grid operators would have access to a staggering 660 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.

It’s no surprise, then, that the vehicle-to-grid space has attracted attention from companies outside of Sunrun and Ford, including microinverter monolith Enphase, which has products participating in dozens of virtual power plants across the country.

“The battery in your car is 10 times the size of a normal stationary battery that you put on the side of the home. The value of that as a flexible asset to the grid is huge,” Andy Newbold, Enphase’s senior director of corporate communications, told Factor This.

Enphase recently unveiled its new IQ Bidirectional EV Charger architecture, featuring V2H and V2G capabilities. The charger connects to the EV’s direct current (DC) port, enabling homeowners to charge their vehicle, power their home, and share energy with the grid through the Enphase app. The offering has been a long time coming, slowed by the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards.

“The automakers needed to come together and set universal standards, otherwise you’d have to build a different charger for every car,” Enphase’s Newbold explained. “That happened over the past year. We’re not fully there yet, but it’s close. That’s why we [now] actually have demonstrated a product.”

“I think vehicle to home is a no-brainer. Makes a lot of sense, and it’s not something that would be happening every day,” he added. “When it comes to vehicle-to-grid, there are still things to figure out: the automaker standards, the utility standards, how these resources are allowed [to be used] on the grid, stuff like that.”

Newbold expects to see much of the mess sorted out over the next six to eight months.

“And then I think a lot of really compelling products will hit the market, and homeowners are gonna have their minds blown, to be honest.”

Customer Adoption

With most technological roadblocks cleared, customer adoption remains the most formidable hurdle to a future powered by car batteries. Participation in a program like the one between BGE, Sunrun, and Ford, for example, asks an awful lot of the consumer: likely upgrading one’s home service to accommodate charging an EV, acquiring the vehicle and a bidirectional charger, downloading apps and enrolling, then actually following through with participation.

“You’ve got to meet them where they’re at,” recommended Ben Brown, chief executive officer of VPP and energy management platform Renew Home. “That means having a cool home and having your EV charged when it needs to be charged. These things are like non-negotiables.”

Brown envisions a future of what he calls ‘comfortable demand response,’ in which the needs of participating customers are met without worry.

“It’s really around delivering in the moments that matter most,” he continued. “Being able to make sure that when someone needs their EV charged by 9 am that it is absolutely charged by 9 am. It’s making sure that if there’s a moment in time we’re anticipating that [temperatures] might be getting uncomfortable, that you’re anticipating that before it actually happens.”

Bill Crider, the senior director of Ford’s global charging and energy services arm, suggests a customer’s wallet might be the quickest way to their hearts. Considering BGE is in PJM territory, home to some of the most headline-catching electricity price spikes in recent memory, he’s likely onto something.

“Educating customers that their electric vehicles have the potential to save—and even earn—them money all while parked at home is a game-changer,” Crider said. “Enabling customers to not only power their homes, but send power directly back to the grid in times of need, helps customers with financial incentives, utilities with more power capacity, and society through more grid reliability and sustainable energy practices. It’s a win-win for everyone.”

When will you benefit from all the winning? If you live outside BGE’s service area, it might be a minute, but pilots are popping up all over the place, and some are tapping into even bigger batteries.

The President’s FY26 budget claims that the important research funded by the USGS EMA is best supported by states.","Sen. Hirono: “If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urging him to reconsider the Trump Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA), which supports critical research that helps our country in facilitating conservation management, as well as understanding and responding to environmental threats. The USGS EMA funds research facilities that employ and serve communities in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific, including Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and American Samoa.

“By zeroing out funding for the EMA, the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal poses a direct threat to that critical science and the communities that depend on it,” wrote Senator Hirono. “In Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region, the USGS EMA funds a significant amount of research that advances our understanding of the natural environment, directly benefits our communities, and supports the next generation of scientists.”

In her letter, the Senator stressed the importance of Secretary Burgum’s support for the EMA facilities, citing uncertainty and chaos surrounding government funding that has ensued since Trump took office in January.

“We cannot rely on Congress alone to fix this problem,” continued Senator Hirono. “Even if Congress disagrees with the ‘savings’ that defunding EMA provides and appropriates funding, there is no guarantee that this Administration will follow the rule of law. Currently, this Administration is freezing funding for a variety of programs and agreements across the executive branch to align with the President’s priorities, sometimes providing funding that needs to be dispersed within weeks, and other times completely clawing back the funding that Congress has appropriated.”

Senator Hirono also listed examples of facilities in Hawaii and across the Pacific region that would be impacted by a reduction in EMA funding, including the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center (PI-CASC) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; the Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center (PIERC); and the Hawaii Cooperative Fishery Research Unit (HCFRU). The President’s budget would also eliminate eight other regional CASCs across the country, as well as the national CASC.

“These are just a few examples of how devastating these decisions are for Hawaii and the Pacific Region, but these impacts will play out in communities across the country,” concluded the Senator. “If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats.”

The full text of the letter is available here and below.

Dear Secretary Burgum:

I write to express my deep concerns about this Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA). This short-sighted decision will have a lasting negative impact on Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region. I urge you, as the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, to change course and fully support this mission area.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the EMA “provides science that directly benefits the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people by providing trusted and timely information to help address the Nation’s toughest management and conservation issues impacting public lands and the surrounding communities that benefit from them.” By zeroing out funding for the EMA, the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal poses a direct threat to that critical science and the communities that depend on it.

In Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region, the USGS EMA funds a significant amount of research that advances our understanding of the natural environment, directly benefits our communities, and supports the next generation of scientists. For example, the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center, or PI-CASC, is hosted at the University of Hawaii Manoa and is comprised of 13 federal and university staff and research fellows and, supports over 25 student researchers each year. This center, which serves Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and American Samoa, not only provides critical information to natural and cultural resource managers and decisionmakers on climate impacts but also supports students who will go on to become our country’s next generation of scientists. The President’s budget does away with the PI-CASC, eight other regional CASCs located throughout the country, and the national CASC. Further, for the first time since the CASCs were established in 2010, your department has failed to renew in a timely manner contracts with three of the regional centers that expire in 2025—the Northeast CASC, the South Central CASC, and PI-CASC.

Defunding USGS EMA will also result in the shuttering of the Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center, or PIERC. This center employs 26 people and 21 federally funded research staff and performs critical work to protect biological resources in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Islands. This work includes researching the brown tree snake to ensure it does not spread from Guam to other islands while also managing brown tree snake populations within Guam. PIERC staff are also working to save the remaining populations of Hawaiian native forest birds, which are critically important to native ecosystems and Hawaiian culture, as they face extinction. PIERC also serves as a lead organization in the fight to arrest addressing Rapid Ohia Death, which has killed millions of native Ohia trees throughout Hawaii. Finally, PIERC is aiding in the effort to restore ecosystems following increasingly frequent wildfire events throughout the Hawaiian Islands.

Other important USGS work in Hawaii that will abruptly end should EMA be eliminated includes the Hawaii Cooperative Fishery Research Unit (HCFRU), which supports 2 federal employees and 10-22 students each year to support the priorities of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). Specifically, HCFRU teaches and trains students and DLNR staff on monitoring non-commercial fisheries, managing fisheries, and protecting public health from fish poisoning. At a time when interest in increasing domestic food supply in Hawaii is so high, ending this federal support is inappropriate. Additionally, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Field Station in Honolulu, which is made up of 3 staff, specifically works with the Department of Defense and the State of Hawaii to control movement of marine and terrestrial invasive species in Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. Given the geopolitical significance of the region and the susceptibility of island ecosystems to invasive species, this loss of decades of expertise and experience would be detrimental to natural resource managers. It would also be a waste of $2 million, which was allocated in 2024 to complete state-of-the-art laboratory facilities to serve wildlife health needs for Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.

We cannot rely on Congress alone to fix this problem. Even if Congress disagrees with the “savings” that defunding EMA provides and appropriates funding, there is no guarantee that this Administration will follow the rule of law. Currently, this Administration is freezing funding for a variety of programs and agreements across the executive branch to align with the President’s priorities, sometimes providing funding that needs to be dispersed within weeks, and other times completely clawing back the funding that Congress has appropriated. There are reports that FY2025 Congressionally appropriated funds for USGS EMA programs will be rescinded. Furthermore, for the CASCs specifically, even if federal funding is provided by Congress and your department makes the funds available, the three regional centers with expired contracts will not be able to continue operations without signing new agreements. Your support for EMA and within this DOI mission areas like PIERC, PI-CASC, and the CFRUs is needed now.

These are just a few examples of how devastating these decisions are for Hawaii and the Pacific Region, but these impacts will play out in communities across the country. The President’s FY26 budget claims that the important research funded by the USGS EMA is best supported by states. With no plan in place for how states will successfully continue the work, one can assume gaps will form, setting our country back by years, if not decades, and making us vulnerable to competing foreign entities in the region. In the short term, resource managers will have less information on which to base decisions. Long-term, our pipeline of next generation scientists will be weakened reducing the United States’ standing as a global leader and eroding our nation’s influence.

If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats. I urge you to reverse these ill-conceived cuts and restore full funding and support for the EMA.

Sincerely,

Dive Brief:

A first-of-its-kind hydrogen- and battery-powered microgrid project is up and running in the remote California town of Calistoga, according to a Sept. 25 announcement by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Energy Vault.

The Calistoga Resiliency Center provides backup power to the town of 1,600 by using hydrogen fuel cells to charge lithium-ion batteries on a site that was too small to allow for wind or solar power generation, the companies said.

Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, said in an interview that interest in hydrogen fuel cells has grown over the past year or two as data centers and other large-load customers seek alternatives to diesel generators.

Dive Insight:

The community of Calistoga has yet to call on the resiliency center as backup, but tests show it can power the town for at least 48 hours, according to Jeremy Donnell, senior manager of microgrid strategy implementation at PG&E.

The company says it believes the hybrid system is the very first of its kind. The 293-MWh microgrid system replaced a diesel generator that PG&E deployed in Calistoga in 2019-2020 to provide backup generation in the event of a public safety power shutoff, Donnell said in an interview.

Developer Energy Vault came up with the hybrid battery/hydrogen fuel cell design in response to PG&E's request for a solution that could eliminate the diesel generator while occupying the same footprint and for no more than twice the cost.

The project mostly draws energy from on-site hydrogen fuel cells that are hooked up to a 130-foot liquid hydrogen storage tank, Donnell said. A third-party vendor refills the tank with hydrogen; the site lacks the space needed for hydrogen production or for wind or solar generation to charge batteries.

PG&E doesn't anticipate replacing its other diesel generators with fuel cells because the company isn't conducting as many broad-scale public safety power shutoffs as it used to, Donnell said. But the project yielded valuable information about how to connect similar projects to the company's grid, he added.

Wolak said large-load customers like data centers are exploring fuel cells as they seek reliable power solutions with greater duration than lithium-ion batteries and lower emissions than fossil fuel generators.

In addition to remote sites like Calistoga, fuel cells could also be used in urban settings where space is limited, and where nearby residents may object to diesel generator noise and emissions, he said.

Growing demand for natural gas has also, somewhat unexpectedly, driven new interest in fuel cells, Wolak said.

Many fuel cells can use natural gas in the place of hydrogen, and since the gas is not burned, it does not produce on-site emissions. Building out the nation's gas distribution systems means more sites could have access to natural gas and could use fuel cell technology without the need for relatively high-cost hydrogen fuel, he said.

Fuel cells also got a boost from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Wolak said. While the bill cut tax credits for many other sources of renewable generation, it preserved a tax credit for hydrogen storage infrastructure and renewed a fuel cell tax credit that had been set to expire.

Cost efficacy While Ivanpah represents a failure in cost effectiveness, solar PV is among the most cost-effective technologies available today.","From pv magazine USA

Headlines have been circulating major news outlets around the impending closure of the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, a $2.2 billion project that began construction in 2010 and has been providing electricity since 2014, dubbing the solar project a “failure” and a “boondoggle.”

At first reaction, the closure of the Ivanpah plant may appear a worrying signal for the cost efficacy of solar technologies. California utility Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary buyer of the plant’s output, announced early this year it would end its offtake agreement with the plant. Initially, PG&E was scheduled to buy power from Ivanpah through 2039, but it has pulled out due to a lack of cost efficacy.

“Ivanpah is yet another failed green energy boondoggle, much like Solyndra,” Jason Isaac, chief executive officer of the American Energy Institute, an American energy advocacy group, told Fox News.

The project was built with $1.6 billion of its construction cost backed by loan guarantees from the U.S. Department of Energy. Now shuttering operations more than a decade ahead of schedule, the project is no doubt a financial failure.

But Ivanpah’s struggles are not an indication of the lack of bankability of solar, and rather a testament to how rapidly clean energy technologies are advancing and becoming more efficient and cost-effective.

The important distinction here, which may be missed in the headlines, is that Ivanpah Solar facility is not solar photovoltaics, but rather a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, an entirely different technology with different costs for construction, operations and maintenance.

The Ivanpah facility is comprised of 173,500 software-controlled mirrors called heliostats, which direct sun rays into the facility’s three collection towers. The towers, over 400 feet in height each, contain liquid that is heated and converts to steam, pushing a turbine and creating electricity.

According to PG&E’s analysis, the CSP plant struggled from high operating costs and lower-than-expected production led the utility to withdraw from its agreement. The CSP plant also relied on natural gas to sustain operations, working against its progress toward decarbonizing the grid.

About 0.06% of the global fleet of solar technology is CSP, according to SolarPACES. The rest is photovoltaic (PV), the namesake of our publication. Unlike CSP, a PV plant directly converts sunlight into electricity by exciting electrons within a PV material, typically silicon, and collecting them in a conductive junction.

Since Ivanpah was installed in 2014, the cost of solar photovoltaics has fallen by more than 90%. Rapidly falling costs, fast project deployment cycles, emissions-free power and the ability to distribute solar into the built environment have all supported the staggering growth of PV.

In 2014, when Ivanpah began operations, solar PV was less than 1% of the US energy mix. Now, it leads among all technologies in terms of new-build capacity added each year and has grown to over 12% of the total energy mix. It is forecast by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to surpass wind as the top renewable energy source in 2025 and shortly after surpass coal as the second-highest capacity contributor to the US grid.

Cost efficacy

While Ivanpah represents a failure in cost effectiveness, solar PV is among the most cost-effective technologies available today. Analysis from Lazard found that solar and wind energy projects have a lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) than nearly all fossil fuel projects – even without subsidy (including the federal Investment Tax Credit).

LCOE is a measure of cost-efficiency of generation sources across technology types. The metric is based on lifetime costs divided by energy production and calculates the present value of the total cost of building and operating a power plant over an assumed lifetime.

Lazard’s analysis found that unsubsidized utility-scale solar, without tax credits, ranges from an LCOE of $0.038/kWh to $0.078/kWh. Utility-scale solar with energy storage co-located ranges from $0.05/kWh to $0.131/kWh, while natural gas peaker plants are far more expensive at $0.138/kWh to $0.262/kWh.

Lazard’s analysis found that utility-scale solar plats are cheaper than the lowest-cost marginal cost of fossil fuel, meaning that even the most cost-effective combined cycle natural gas plants that are already built and operating are more expensive electricity generators than new-build solar and wind.

What’s more, Lazard found that gas, coal and nuclear projects are more sensitive to the cost of capital, suggesting that the higher-for-longer interest rate environment further supports renewable energy investment.

“On an unsubsidized dollar per megawatt-hour basis, renewable energy remains the most cost-competitive form of generation. As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the US,” said the report. “This is particularly true in the current high power demand environment, where renewables stand out as both the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation resource.”

Under its previous plan, Duke projected it would shutter its remaining coal-fired power plants no later than 2035.
Some units at the Cliffside and Marshall plants would burn coal for an extra two years, until 2033 and 2034.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Duke Energy plans to burn coal for two to four years longer than previously estimated, which will result in millions of tons in additional greenhouse gases over the next decade when combined with other proposed changes to the utility’s fuel mix.

The utility would significantly increase battery storage—by 56 percent—but also deploy fewer renewables.

The details are laid out in more than 100 pages of the utility’s biennial Carbon Plan, released Oct. 1 and submitted to the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

Duke cited the state’s growing energy demand, driven by data centers and large manufacturers, coupled with the Trump administration’s fossil-fuel friendly energy policy as reasons for the changes. This includes the rollback of federal air regulations, increased support for the coal industry and the end of renewable power subsidies.

State policy, too, shaped the plan. Senate Bill 266, now law after the state legislature in late July overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, allowed Duke to eliminate its interim goal of a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035. Instead, the utility is only subject to a goal of net zero by 2050.

Under its previous plan, Duke projected it would shutter its remaining coal-fired power plants no later than 2035. Last year the utility retired the Allen Steam Station on Lake Wylie, where the first battery storage goes online next month.

But unfettered by the interim carbon reduction goal, several of those retirement dates have been extended to the mid-to-late 2030s, depending on the plant.

Belews Creek, in Stokes County, would burn coal as late as 2040, four years longer than planned, when Duke projects a small nuclear reactor could come online.

Belews Creek emitted 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carbon dioxide equivalent is a unit of measurement to evaluate the impact of different greenhouse gases.

Some units at the Cliffside and Marshall plants would burn coal for an extra two years, until 2033 and 2034.

These plants, and several others, can burn coal and natural gas, further increasing emissions of potent planet-warming gases, carbon dioxide and methane.

“We continue making progress on coal retirements while balancing regulatory approvals and increased load growth,” Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton said. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers prior to further coal plant retirements.”

CleanAIRE NC, a nonprofit environmental group based in Charlotte, issued a statement expressing “serious concerns about Duke Energy’s proposed plan, which continues to prioritize fossil fuel expansion, delays coal retirement, and lacks meaningful engagement with the communities most vulnerable to environmental and economic harm.”

Duke acknowledges that coal is risky. It is more expensive and considerably more polluting than natural gas. Nationwide, mining has declined, both in the number of workers and the amount of coal produced.

Even though the Trump administration is opening public lands in the western U.S. for coal mining, Duke has outfitted its plants to burn low-sulfur coal sourced from Central Appalachia, where production is waning.

Norton said Duke “continues to plan for an orderly retirement of coal as a necessary means to protect reliability in light of the increasing challenges in the operation of these end-of-life assets.”

The utility plans to continue to expand its natural gas fleet, which requires more than 100 miles of new pipeline in North Carolina. The pipelines, compressor stations and the plants themselves leak and emit tons of methane, a greenhouse gas that, while shorter-lived in the atmosphere, is 86 times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide over 20 years.

Meech Carter, clean energy campaigns director for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters Foundation, said gas infrastructure additions are “driven by the expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence, allowing big technology companies and Duke Energy to profit at ratepayers’ expense.”

The extent of data centers’ effects on energy demand remains unclear. Analysts with Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability posit that targeted, timed reductions in power demand could ease the strain on the grid without massive power-plant buildouts.

Duke has reined in its plans for solar power, compared to the previous Carbon Plan. It had originally projected to add 8,200 megawatts by 2031; the new proposal reduces the megawattage to 7,900 and extends the date to 2033.

The utility previously projected it would add 3,600 megawatts of onshore and offshore wind within the next decade. But the new energy mix eliminates wind power until at least 2040, reflecting President Donald Trump’s rejection of that energy source.

The Trump administration recently canceled $679 million for offshore wind projects. None were in North Carolina, but a nearby wind logistics port in Norfolk, Virginia, lost more than $39 million in federal funding.

Duke also plans to request permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to increase power and extend licenses for existing nuclear plants.

After a lengthy public hearing process, the state utilities commission must issue an order on the plan—approving it as is or requiring amendments—by Dec. 31, 2026.",https://cardinalpine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/shutterstock-787594231.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 15:04:51.051523

This project will create at least 101 new, full-time jobs over the next three years.

The company has entered into a 15-year lease at 33 Powell Avenue in Hazleton. Relocating into a larger facility will allow the company to increase production to meet demand while also providing enough space for the development of new, innovative products at the Hazleton facility.

“Pennsylvania is attracting companies from across the nation thanks to the work my Administration is doing to improve our business environment, build more shovel-ready sites, and invest in our communities — today’s announcement is another clear example of that,” said Governor Shapiro. “When companies want to grow, they look to our Commonwealth. With a strategic location near major markets, and a talented, skilled workforce, Pennsylvania has so much to offer and we remain committed to making strategic investments to further boost our economy and create more good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians.”

The Shapiro Administration has successfully won major deals and recruited businesses to move to Pennsylvania. Companies like Excelitas Technologies(opens in a new tab), which relocated its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh and will create at least 250 new jobs, and Adare Pharma(opens in a new tab), which is bringing 115 new jobs to its relocated headquarters in Northeast Philadelphia, are joining a growing list of businesses choosing Pennsylvania as the best place to expand and innovate.

Mint-X received a funding proposal from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) that includes a $300,000 Pennsylvania First Grant. The company also received a $1,592,686 Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) loan from DCED for the project.

“This project is boosting Luzerne County’s rich manufacturing industry, and creating over 100 new, good-paying jobs for the region,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger. “We’re thrilled Mint-X has chosen Pennsylvania to grow, and the Shapiro Administration will continue to support projects like this one that create more opportunities for Pennsylvanians and help revitalize communities.”

Mint-X, founded in 2008, manufactures and distributes the world’s only Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered and patented rodent-repellent trash bags. The company produces its branded Mint-X bags and also produces private label bags with its integrated Mint-X technology for Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Target, Costco, and Dollar General.

“We are very excited to move our operation to Northeastern Pennsylvania, and we’re grateful for the warm welcome we’ve already received from the Commonwealth,” said Jeff Dussich, CEO, Mint-X. “We spent more than a year searching for a new home for our manufacturing facility. The strong labor pool and strategic location near the intersection of I-80 and I-81 ultimately made Hazleton the perfect place for us.”

""NEPA Alliance is proud to partner with Mint-X on this strategic expansion into Luzerne County,"" said Stephen Ursich, Vice President, NEPA Alliance. ""By supporting innovative companies like Mint-X, we’re helping to bring high-quality jobs to our region and reinforcing NEPA’s role as a hub for industrial growth. We thank Governor Shapiro and DCED for their leadership in making projects like this possible.""

The government is a week into the first federal shutdown in seven years. Congressional negotiations remain at an impasse, and lawmakers have repeatedly failed to pass a stopgap spending bill despite the U.S. Senate holding repeated votes on the U.S. House of Representatives-passed continuing resolution (CR) and the CR proposed by Senate Democrats. Large portions of the federal government remain shuttered, and hundreds of thousands of workers have been furloughed. Senators returned to Washington, D.C., on Oct. 6, 2025, as discussion around a potential extension of the advanced premium tax credits (APTCs) under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continue to be the main sticking point. Democrats are pushing to tie ACA provisions to any CR, while Republicans insist policy talks wait until the government reopens.

Administrative Updates

Executive Order Updates

The Trump Administration has continued to release wide-ranging executive orders (EOs). For the latest updates, see our ""Trump's 2025 Executive Orders: Updates and Summaries"" tracking chart.

An EO titled ""Unlocking Cures for Pediatric Cancer with Artificial Intelligence,"" issued on Sept. 30, 2025, seeks to drive innovation in the prevention and treatment of childhood diseases. The EO directs the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission – in coordination with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (ASTP) and Special Advisor for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Crypto – to develop ways to incorporate the use of advanced technologies such as AI to support the improved diagnosis, treatment, cure and prevention of childhood cancer. The EO calls for an expansion of pediatric cancer research using existing federal funding for projects that prioritize improved data infrastructure, enhanced data analysis and improved clinical trial designs through incorporation of AI.

Regulatory Updates

VA Releases M-25-21 AI Compliance Plan

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has released its M-25-21 AI Compliance plan, becoming the first agency to make its plan public under the Trump Administration's management memo M-25-21, which required agencies to outline how they will govern and deploy AI by Oct. 1, 2025. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plans have not yet been released. The VA's plan says certain use cases, including AI tools for clinical documentation and predictive analytics, will inform adoption in its new electronic health record system. While all agencies were due to submit similar strategies, no other HHS agencies' plans have been publicly released so far.

ARPA-H Announces Funding Under POSEIDON Program

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) announced on Sept. 30, 2025, that four research and development teams would receive a total of $147 million in funding awards under its Platform Optimizing SynBio for Early Intervention and Detection in Oncology (POSEIDON) program. Funding will support the development of sensitive and specific first-in-class, at-home, over-the-counter, synthetic Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests to identify more than 30 stage 1 solid tumors using only breath or urine samples.

According to the National Cancer Institute, more than two million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2025. Currently, there is not a recommended screening test for nearly 60 percent of diagnosed cancers, such as brain, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Current multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests can't accurately identify stage 1 solid tumors, which is critical to effectively diagnosing and treating cancers. Additionally, the cost of late-stage, non-curative cancer treatment is two to three times higher than early-stage, potentially curative treatment. POSEIDON has the potential to make significant, lasting healthcare and economic contributions to the future of cancer care for all Americans.

If successful, the over-the-counter, at-home MCED test device kit will be fully integrated into clinical care through electronic health record and telemedicine-capabilities. The kit aims to ensure that individuals will connect with a healthcare professional via a telemedicine call within 96 hours and will receive their results either virtually or in-person at the clinician's discretion. In cases of a positive result (e.g., presence of cancer), individuals will be connected to the nearest medical center for an official diagnostic work-up and continued care.

POSEIDON's emphasis on translation and market penetration ensures the resulting tests will be available to all Americans if they so choose. Further, POSEIDON's commercial focus is reflected in each team's structure, which requires that all teams have a clearly defined commercial entity responsible for bringing these cutting-edge technologies to the market.

CMS Projects Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans Expected to Remain Stable in 2026

CMS announced on Sept. 26, 2025, that average premiums, benefits and plan choices for Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans are projected to remain stable in 2026. CMS released its projections in advance of the upcoming Medicare Open Enrollment Period, which begins Oct. 15, 2025, and runs through Dec. 7, 2025.

The average MA plan is expected to decrease from $16.40 to $14 in 2026, including MA plans that provide prescription drug coverage and special needs plans (SNPs). CMS projects that 34 million beneficiaries will be enrolled in an MA plan in 2026, a decrease from 34.9 million beneficiaries in 2025. MA enrollment is expected to represent about 48 percent of all individuals enrolled in Medicare. The total number of MA plans available nationwide will decrease from 5,633 in 2025 to 5,600 in 2026.

The average standalone Part D plan premium is projected to decrease from $38.31 in 2025 to $34.50 in 2026. The average Part D total premium for MA plans with prescription drug coverage is projected to decrease from $13.32 in 2025 to $11.50 in 2026.

CMS Releases IPAY 2028 Final Guidance

CMS released the final Initial Price Applicability Year (IPAY) 2028 guidance for the next round of Medicare drug price negotiation on Oct. 1, 2025. The guidance details the requirements and parameters for the third cycle of Medicare drug price negotiation. CMS will select up to 15 additional drugs under Part D or Part B that are eligible for drug price negotiation. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), IPAY 2028 will include drugs or biological products payable under Part B as eligible for negotiation.

Notably, CMS chose not to finalize changes related to fixed combination drugs that it had proposed in the draft IPAY 2028 guidance. However, CMS notes its ""intent to address this program's integrity risk and that it is continuing to consider the appropriate policy to implement in rulemaking beginning initial price applicability year 2029."" In the draft guidance, CMS proposed changing its interpretation of when a combination drug would qualify as a single source drug, which may have resulted in certain drug formulations being subject to Medicare negotiation, but CMS opted against finalizing the change in the final guidance.

DEA Proposes Adjusted Manufacturer Quotas for Certain Ingredients

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published a notice in the Federal Register on Oct. 1, 2025, outlining new proposed adjusted manufacturer quotas for 2025 for d-amphetamine and methylphenidate, two ingredients that can be used in the manufacturing of medications to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The current quota for d-amphetamine is 21,200,000 grams of anhydrous acid or base, and the adjusted quota is 26,450,000. The current quota for methylphenidate is 53,283,000, and the adjusted quota is 58,283,000. Each year, the DEA sets the annual production quotas (APQs) to set the quantities of certain ingredients of Schedule I and II substances that may be manufactured to meet research, clinical and industrial needs of the U.S.

FDA Expands Early Alert to Include All Medical Devices

FDA announced on Sept. 29, 2025, that it would expand the Early Alert communications for all medical devices following the completion of a successful pilot program announced on Nov. 21, 2024. The Early Alert communications seek to minimize the time between FDA being notified of potentially high-risk medical device removals or corrections and that notification being made publicly. The initial pilot focused on a limited number of device areas but has now been expanded to include all device areas. At this time, FDA has not announced further guidance on the process for Early Alerts being issued or what criteria must be met for inclusion.

FDA Requests Public Comment on Measuring and Evaluating AI-Enabled Medical Devices

FDA issued a request for public comment on Sept. 30, 2025, on measuring and evaluating AI-enabled medical device performance. The request intends to ""obtain comment and feedback from interested parties and the public on a series of questions related to the current, practical approaches to measuring and evaluating the performance of AI-enabled medical devices in the real-world, including strategies for identifying and managing performance drift, such as detecting changes in input and output."" The request seeks input on best practices, methodologies and approaches for measuring and evaluating the performance of AI-enabled medical devices. Comments are due by Dec. 30, 2025.

FDA Launches New Pilot Program For Faster Review of ANDAs

FDA announced a new pilot program on Oct. 3, 2025, for the review of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) to provide faster reviews, as well as spur and reward investment in drug manufacturing and research in the U.S. The announcement of the pilot program follows a hybrid event that FDA held regarding its new PreCheck program, which seeks to accelerate and prioritize new drug manufacturing facilities in the U.S. As part of the new pilot, ANDA applications that conduct required bioequivalence testing in the U.S. and make their products in the U.S. using exclusively domestic sources for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) will be eligible for priority ANDA application review.

President Trump, Major Pharmaceutical Company Make MFN Drug Pricing Announcement

President Donald Trump and a major pharmaceutical company announced on Sept. 30, 2025, the first agreement to provide prescription drugs to U.S. patients at a significantly reduced price. The announcement, which took place following President Trump's efforts to implement a most-favored-nations (MFN) drug pricing framework to align the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. with other developed nations, is expected to be the first of several as companies seek to meet key aims of the Trump Administration's drug pricing strategy. As part of the agreement, the company will offer prescription drugs within its portfolio at reduced prices through a direct-to-consumer platform to be called TrumpRx, with discounts as high as 85 percent off the list price. In addition, the company will price newly approved medications in the U.S. at a price point aligned with that of comparable markets around the world. The company also committed to spending an additional $70 billion to move manufacturing and production of pharmaceutical products back to the U.S. The Trump Administration, following the company's announcement, will not assess tariffs on the company's pharmaceutical imports for three years. The agreement will also ensure that state Medicaid programs may access MFN prices on products made by the manufacturer.

Separately, a trade association representing leading pharmaceutical manufacturers announced its members also plan to invest $500 billion in U.S. infrastructure over the next decade. The trade association will also create a website to highlight direct purchasing options available through individual companies.

Two Mandatory Payment Models at OMB: GLOBE and GUARD

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is currently reviewing two mandatory payment models focused on drug pricing: Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing (GLOBE) and Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD). These models would likely adjust how payments are made for prescription drugs under Medicare, with the goal of addressing costs and incentivizing value-based care. Specifics on methodology remain to be seen and it is currently unknown when additional information on the models may be released.

With the current federal government shutdown, the review process for these models has been halted. Until the shutdown ends, agencies and industry participants are essentially in a holding pattern regarding these two potential payment models. Further, the recent announcement of TrumpRx may factor into forward movement.

Federal Employee Unions Challenge Administration For Intent to Carry Out Additional Firings During the Government Shutdown

In a new lawsuit filed on Sept. 30, 2025, unions representing federal, state, county and municipal employees challenged the Trump Administration's threats to conduct additional RIFs while the federal government is shut down. The lawsuit, in part, centers upon guidance issued by the OMB in advance of the shutdown authorizing agency leaders to carry out additional firings of federal employees. The lawsuit seeks an injunction, with the unions claiming that the actions are ""contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious"" and arguing that the OMB has exceeded its statutory authority by authorizing the RIFs while the government is in a shutdown. The lawsuit also seeks to invalidate actions taken during the shutdown.

New Medication Abortion Case Filed

Legal efforts to limit access to medication abortion continue, with a new case being transferred from Texas to a federal court in Missouri. The case is the next step in a multi-year battle over access to mifepristone following the U.S. Supreme Court's previous decision that a group of physicians and medical organizations lacked legal standing to sue because they could not show they would be directly harmed by the policy. The case demands that the federal government restore previous restrictions on mifepristone and follows HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's announcement on Sept. 25, 2025, that HHS would open a new investigation into the safety of mifepristone.

The Scoop

The Trump administration is considering cancelling an additional $12 billion in funding for clean energy projects beyond what it announced last week, according to a list of targeted projects reviewed by Semafor.

The “kill list,” as it was described to Semafor by a source who reviewed it, would amount to an escalation of the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy. It’s also a signal that the Trump administration is using the government shutdown as a pretext for accelerating its broader policy agenda, as it looks to turn the page on the Biden era during which the US embraced green energy projects as a way to combat climate change.

The list includes major carbon removal and clean hydrogen efforts that had been approved by the Department of Energy under the Biden administration, such as projects led by major oil and gas companies like Chevron and Occidental.

The projects on this list, combined with a tranche of cancelled funding announced last week and an earlier group of cancelled projects announced in May, bring the total of DOE funding targeted for cuts to nearly $24 billion. However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the shutdown.

AD

As the government shutdown drags on, the US Office of Management and Budget has also threatened to withhold back pay for furloughed federal workers. An OMB spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

Know More

The new list of potential cancellations follows a pattern of cuts announced last week that especially took aim at the carbon removal industry. They risk undermining a nascent sector that, aside from its climate benefits, has drawn significant investment from the fossil fuel industry and tech companies.

“If confirmed, the elimination of the megaton carbon removal projects will be a massive setback for American climate and industrial policy,” Erin Burns, executive director of the advocacy group Carbon180, told Semafor. “These projects were never just about carbon — they were about jobs, investment, and the chance to lead in a global climate economy. Cutting them leaves communities in limbo and undermines years of progress.”

Notable

Projects being cut by the Department of Energy focus on Democrat-led states, but will cost jobs and income in Republican ones, too, according to Heatmap.

The World

at a Glance

Israel marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that triggered the conflict that has reshaped the Middle East.

The country has won since major victories against regional enemies, including Iran and Hezbollah, but at a huge cost: 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, famine has taken hold in Gaza, and Israel is increasingly isolated.

Other countries’ politics have been affected, too. Zohran Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor of New York City in large part because of his support for Palestinian rights, while governments across Europe have accelerated support for a Palestinian state.

A truce may finally be close, with Israeli and Hamas leaders nearing a ceasefire at talks brokered by US President Donald Trump.

US President Donald Trump met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, with the countries at loggerheads over trade and Trump’s comments about annexing the country’s northern neighbor.

Canada is the only G7 country not to have reached a trade deal with the US this year; a North American free trade agreement protects Ottawa from some tariffs, but it is still subject to punishing steel duties, among others.

Carney promised to be tough on Trump but Canadian firms are shedding jobs and exports are down. The Canadian leader must walk a tightrope: Trump is deeply unpopular north of the border after repeatedly suggesting making Canada the “51st state.” Polls found that 60% of Canadians say they can never fully trust the US again.

The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for research that showed the impact of quantum mechanics on everyday-sized objects.

Quantum effects were known at the level of atoms, but in the 1980s John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis showed that at very low temperatures, the strange behavior — such as particles moving directly through apparently impassable barriers — could be demonstrated in objects large enough to be held in the hand.

The discovery paved the way for quantum computing and other quantum technologies, and opened the door to several multi-billion-dollar industries. One winner of yesterday’s Physiology prize is yet to be contacted, as he is off the grid, “living his best life” hiking in Idaho.

US President Donald Trump agreed to meet his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after a “very good” call, marking a thaw in relations that were at their worst in decades.

Trump slapped a 50% tariff on Brasília — despite the US having a trade surplus with Brazil — over what he called a “witch hunt” against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally convicted over a coup plot. Analysts said the call pointed at Trump breaking with Bolsonaro, who doesn’t have a clear path back to the presidency.

Lula welcomed the shift, calling on former spats to be forgotten: “Neither the American nor the Brazilian people can suffer because of our mistakes,” he told TV Mirante.

A Sudanese militia leader was found guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region 20 years ago, in a conflict that became a prelude to the country’s present-day disaster.

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman was a leader of the Janjaweed militia, which killed hundreds of thousands of members of Darfur’s non-Arab population in the early 2000s, sparking one of the world’s gravest and most enduring humanitarian crises.

After the war, many Janjaweed fighters joined the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring parties in Sudan’s current civil war. The RSF is once again besieging Darfur, putting millions of lives at risk, with the conflict sparking the first declaration of famine globally in years.

Renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s primary source of electricity in the first half of 2025, according to new data from the energy think tank Ember. Solar power led the charge, covering 83% of the increase in electricity demand.

Ember described the moment as a “crucial turning point,” whereby clean power can keep pace with rapidly growing energy needs, particularly as the world faces the huge increase in power necessary to fuel the AI boom.

However, the think tank warned that there are significant regional differences behind the numbers; new data from the International Energy Agency revised renewable energy growth in the US by 2030 down by half. It also suggested that the pace of renewables adoption in China — the current largest renewables growth market globally — could temper, the Financial Times reported.

Renewables are expected to boom elsewhere, however: Pakistan imported enough solar panels in 2024 to generate around a third of the country’s current power generation capacity, the BBC said. And in Africa, solar panel imports are up 60% in the year to June compared with the same period last year.

OpenAI inked a deal with chip designer AMD to collaborate on AI data centers, in a challenge to semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The deal, which caused AMD’s stock to soar, reflects the tech sector’s intensifying quest for computing power and ultimately banks on a “near-limitless demand for AI,” WIRED wrote: Running AMD’s processors will match the energy needs of 5 million American homes. The US has become “one big bet on AI,” as optimism over the sector props up the economy, one analyst wrote.

Driving that bet is OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has proven to be a prolific dealmaker. The company also has agreements with firms including Nvidia and Oracle — pacts that have raised fears of an AI bubble.

Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations through Arab mediators in Egypt Monday on a Gaza peace plan, raising the possibility of a potential end to the brutal war on the eve of its two-year anniversary.

Hamas said it agrees to parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including the release of all remaining Israeli hostages, but has not acknowledged other demands, including full disarmament and its permanent exclusion from governing the enclave.

Though US President Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt its attacks, it continued to pound Gaza Monday. Trump has also threatened “complete obliteration” of Hamas if it insists on staying in power.

Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks to take credit for the emerging deal, it has become clear that Trump was “the one calling the shots,” The New York Times wrote. On Sunday night, the president exhorted negotiators to “MOVE FAST,” adding that he expected the first phase of the deal to unfold this week.

A US judge blocked the government from deploying troops to Oregon state, spotlighting the growing role of the courts in the country’s politics.

The latest order, issued late on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration looks to deploy military forces to Democrat-led cities nationwide: The White House says they are necessary to combat alleged lawlessness; Democrats argue their constituents are being targeted.

The latest decision came on the eve of the Supreme Court beginning a new term that analysts say will include significant new tests of presidential power, including over the administration’s use of tariffs, attempted curbs on birthright citizenship, and efforts to fire officials from independent government agencies.

France’s prime minister resigned less than a month after taking office, plunging the country deeper into a seemingly intractable political crisis.

Sébastien Lecornu — President Emmanuel Macron’s seventh premier — quit following widespread criticism over his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from that of the prior government.

His departure showcases the short-term challenge facing Macron’s ministers, who have repeatedly failed to pass a budget in the face of far-right and far-left opposition, and the longer-term fear over the rise of the country’s main nationalist, anti-immigration party, which is topping opinion polls.

The impasse has left investors wary: A recent Deutsche Bank survey pegged France as the country most likely to face a government bond crisis.

Japanese stocks surged after the country’s ruling party chose its next leader — and likely next prime minister — amid growing investor buoyancy over prospects for one of the world’s largest economies.

The LDP, which has ruled Japan largely uninterrupted since World War II, put Sanae Takaichi on track to be the country’s first female prime minister.

She inherits a dizzying array of challenges, including a fast-aging population and worries over Chinese aggression. Yet economists note the country has removed major barriers to business, manufacturers are feeling more upbeat, and monetary policy is normalizing: The Nikkei 225 index hit a record following Takaichi’s selection. “We are bullish on Japan,” Apollo’s chief economist wrote.

China and India agreed to restart direct flights after a five-year hiatus, the latest sign of thawing relations between the world’s most populous nations. New Delhi said flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou would restart this month for the first time since border clashes in 2020.

The decision comes just months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first visit to Beijing in seven years, with the countries’ leaders drawing closer, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, upending what had been a burgeoning bilateral partnership. Those levies were “one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got,” an expert said, forcing New Delhi to seek new allies.

Discoveries about how our immune systems avoid attacking our own bodies — research which helped create new pathways for treating autoimmune diseases — won the 2025 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

T-cells are designed to attack proteins in pathogens, but those proteins are often similar to our body’s own proteins. Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that the immune system has “self-tolerance” safeguards which prevent it from attacking our own cells.

Crucially, the findings also helped create new cancer treatments: Cancer cells use the body’s self-tolerance to hide, and immunotherapy is designed to take the brakes off and allow the immune system to attack those cells.

Japan is on track to have its first female prime minister.

A former economic security minister who cites Margaret Thatcher as her hero, Sanae Takaichi was elected to lead Japan’s governing LDP, which has ruled the country almost continuously since World War II but is mired in an array of crises.

Among her top priorities is tackling inflation — a relatively new problem given Japan’s decades of falling prices — making her selection a worrying one for investors: Takaichi will likely push for aggressive spending and looser monetary policy in a bid to boost the economy.

She will also pull Japan’s politics further to the right, mirroring a trend of resurgent populist conservatism worldwide, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

The world’s major oil producers agreed to raise output again, a move that raised fears of a supply glut and could further dampen prices.

OPEC+ is looking to reclaim market share lost to US shale producers and maintain discipline within the group — some members stand accused of violating quotas — while the group’s heavyweight member, Saudi Arabia, is likely hoping that lower prices will please US President Donald Trump.

Still, the increase was a relatively small one, a careful step taken “after witnessing how nervous the market had become,” one analyst said.

“The real test will come when fundamentals and politics shift again.” High geopolitical volatility makes predicting the market’s future even more difficult than usual, a Reuters columnist argued.

US President Donald Trump is considering a bailout of at least $10 billion to help the country’s soybean farmers survive a boycott from China.

The humble soybean has become a flashpoint in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies after Beijing ceased all purchases from the US.

The possible aid from Washington reflects China’s leverage in talks with the US, similar to how Beijing used rare-earth export curbs to extract trade concessions from Washington, analysts said.

China is now reportedly pushing for the White House to roll back national-security restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.

Birds of different species can understand each other’s alarm calls warning of cuckoos.

Brood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, tricking the hosts into caring for their offspring at the expense of their own.

Research found that 21 bird species across four continents all make similar “whining” vocalizations when they spot a brood parasite, and when played recordings of other species’ calls, they all recognize them and react by mobbing the invader.

One researcher told New Scientist that the calls, referring to external objects in the world rather than internal states such as fear or excitement, “could be the first stepping stone towards language” and that animal communication and human language were on a spectrum.

A controversial musical depicting the Spanish conquest of Mexico has ignited a transatlantic debate over Latin American history and identity.

Centering on conquistador Hernán Cortés and his Nahuatl translator, Malinche ostensibly celebrates mestizaje, or racial mixing, but has been accused of promoting “outdated, racist notions” regarding Aztec rituals, and the idea that colonization benefited indigenous people.

Foreign Policy called the show, currently playing in Mexico City, an “obscenely romanticized” “anti-Hamilton,” while conservatives complained that a historical priest was initially portrayed in drag.

Malinche’s producer, for his part, hoped the debate would “bring people to come and judge” for themselves.

The brouhaha points to real wounds: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined to invite Spain’s king to her inauguration after he failed to apologize for the conquest.

The US military struck another alleged narcotics vessel off the coast of Venezuela Friday, killing four, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.

The strike — at least the fourth such attack — brings the total number of alleged smugglers killed by the US in recent weeks to at least 18.

Hegseth wrote on X that he directed the lethal strike, carried out in international waters, on a “vessel transporting substantial amounts of narcotics — headed to America to poison our people.”

It came after the White House informed Congress this week that the country was engaged in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which the administration has designated as terrorist organizations, The New York Times reported.

The strikes have raised tensions with Caracas, which fears a full-scale invasion, as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs strikes inside the country.

Critics have questioned the legality of the campaign, with one commentator accusing Trump of emulating “the worst excesses” of US policy in Latin America.

Hamas said it agreed to release all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza under a framework proposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that it “affirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations” to discuss the details.

Earlier on Friday, Trump set a new weekend deadline for Hamas to agree to a peace deal on the enclave’s future, calling it the militant group’s “last chance.” Hamas’ statement suggested the group is seeking changes to the proposal, however, and that a deal has not yet been agreed to.

If no deal is reached by 6:00 pm Sunday Eastern time, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote in a social media post earlier on Friday.

The Trump administration’s 20-point plan, backed by Israel, demands an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the disarmament of Hamas — a condition the group has previously rejected. Hamas said on Wednesday that it was reviewing the proposal.

The plan also provides for a transitional authority run by an international group chaired by Trump, with members including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Venezuela said it had detected five US fighter jets flying near its Caribbean coast, which Caracas said amounted to “provocation,” in the latest clash between the countries.

Tensions have been rising between the US and Venezuela for months, and Washington recently struck alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Fears are growing among Venezuela’s leadership that the true goal of the US deployment is toppling the autocratic regime of President Nicolás Maduro, though some warn a military intervention could further destabilize the country. “Anyone who cares about democracy and human rights wants the Maduro dictatorship to end,” an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations said, but this strategy is “very unlikely” to make that happen.

Japan will on Saturday elect its new leader, with a millennial minister poised to become prime minister of the rapidly aging nation.

Shinjiro Koizumi, who at 44 would become Japan’s youngest leader in a century, is competing with four other candidates to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party — which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years — after the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba following two major election losses. Agriculture minister Koizumi, who bills himself a consensus builder, faces his toughest challenge in Sanae Takaichi, a conservative hardliner who would become the country’s first female ruler if she wins. But experts fear neither candidate offers Japan a clear vision to solve an array of challenges at home and abroad.

Munich airport shut down overnight after a series of drone sightings, the latest disruption to European airspace after similar events in Oslo and Copenhagen.

Thousands of passengers on dozens of flights were affected, with some having to sleep in the airport. The sightings follow a series of Russian incursions into NATO airspace, but Moscow denied responsibility for the Munich drones. Still, European leaders suggested the Kremlin was behind earlier drone sightings, and called for strengthened defenses.

Russia appears to be stepping up its hybrid warfare: British officials said Moscow-backed cyberattacks and sabotage were on the rise, and the Kremlin regularly targets UK satellites. A former British intelligence chief said this week that Britain may be “already at war with Russia.”

A woman was named Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in the role’s 1,400-year history.

Sarah Mullally will become the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church in January, a year after her predecessor resigned in a safeguarding scandal.

The first archbishop was appointed in 597 AD, but the role took on extra significance when Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534.

While Anglicanism is on the decline in Britain, it is growing worldwide — nearly 60% of adherents are in Africa, where followers are much more religiously conservative than in Britain.

The communion, already tested by divisions over attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, will be strained further by Mullally’s appointment: Many African Anglican churches refuse to ordain female priests.

South Africa secured investments from China and India to boost its car manufacturing in a bid to salvage one of the industries hardest hit by Washington’s steep tariffs.

US President Donald Trump imposed 30% levies on South African goods over what he claims are laws that discriminate against white South Africans. The rates have pummeled the auto sector, with US-bound exports dropping 90% in the second quarter compared to the previous year. Pretoria warned the sweeping tariffs could cost Africa’s most industrialized economy as many as 100,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, analysts warn that Washington’s levies, as well as the expiry of a sub-Saharan Africa-US free trade deal, will push African nations even closer to Beijing’s sphere of influence.

Taylor Swift released her 12th original album, The Life of a Showgirl, which is expected to break new records to further cement the pop queen’s dominance.

Swift has been “pop’s alpha figure for more than a decade,” The New York Times noted, and in the 18 months since her last release, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has reached new heights of success — and fame. Her Eras Tour was the most lucrative in history, she bought back ownership of her early albums’ master recordings, and she got engaged.

Anticipation for Showgirl has been “off the charts,” Forbes reported, with more than 5 million pre-saves on Spotify — the most ever — and it is “almost a foregone conclusion” that Swift will become the first female artist to break 100 million career album sales.

Two people have died and three others are in a serious condition after a car ramming and knife attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, UK, on Thursday. The suspect is also believed to have been killed after being shot by police, the BBC reported.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer returned early from a meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen to chair the government’s emergency response group, saying that he was “appalled” by the incident. Security is being stepped up at Jewish sites across the country.

The attack, which took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, comes amid a sharp rise in anti-Semitic assaults in the US and Europe as the Israel-Hamas war nears the two-year mark.

France and Germany have seen a surge in incidents, while two staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot dead in May, and an attack injured 12 in Colorado weeks later.

Israeli naval ships intercepted a flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza and detained several activists, including Greta Thunberg.

The “Global Sumud Flotilla” of more than 40 vessels set sail in September, intending to breach Israel’s naval blockade of the enclave, where the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is underway. Israel said several vessels were taken to port, citing what it called a violation of a “lawful naval blockade,” but flotilla organizers said their boats had been illegally boarded and targeted with water cannon and drones.

The boats have become an international cause célèbre: They were escorted part-way by Italian and Spanish naval ships, and their interception has been met by protests in several European countries.

At least two people died and dozens were arrested in Morocco, the latest site of Gen Z protests that have rocked countries worldwide.

Though the North African country has for years avoided mass demonstrations owing to the government’s ironfisted rule, protests have erupted in recent days over what demonstrators say is misplaced spending.

Rabat has prioritized readying the country to host matches for the 2030 Men’s soccer World Cup at the expense of greater investment in social services, demonstrators say. “The right to health, education and a dignified life is not an empty slogan,” the protest’s organizers said.

The demonstrations mirror recent Gen Z-led protests in Nepal and Madagascar that have forced rulers to resign.

European leaders backed a plan to build a so-called drone wall to bolster the continent’s defenses, aiming to send a clear message to Moscow after multiple Russian incursions into NATO airspace. The continent is scrambling to build the necessary capacities to defend against drones, highlighting not only its lagging technology but also how rapidly warfare has shifted to the use of unmanned aircraft. According to NATO, the Russian army is now capable of making drones for a few thousand dollars that Europe can only shoot down with missiles that cost millions of dollars apiece. Moscow’s ongoing hybrid war makes a drone wall necessary, Finland’s prime minister argued: “Russia will continue and we have to be ready.”

US President Donald Trump signed a NATO-like security guarantee for Qatar, part of efforts to reassure the emirate after an Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Doha last month.

The executive order pledges to take all measures, including US military support, to defend the Gulf state, though its legal and practical value is in question. Such agreements have historically required the approval of the US Senate, and the announcement was met with criticism from some of Trump’s conservative supporters.

The move was ostensibly made to reassure Washington’s Gulf allies following the Israeli strike — Saudi Arabia has already reached a mutual-defense pact with nuclear-armed Pakistan — but Politico nevertheless called it a “shocking departure from the administration’s America First approach.”","https://img.semafor.com/c6d61dd4ac81560309cef3da87e183fabb71b979-5582x4000.jpg?rect=0,535,5582,2931&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-07 15:03:37.375632

1. Global solar and wind generation overtake coal for the first time

Solar and wind outpaced the growth of global electricity demand in the first half of 2025, vaulting renewables toward overtaking coal worldwide for the first time on record, according to analysis published Tuesday by the research outfit Ember. This year’s growth resulted in a small overall decline in both coal and gas-fired power generation, with India and China seeing the most notable reductions, despite the United States and Europe ratcheting up fossil fuel usage. “We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember, said in a statement. “Solar and wind are now growing fast enough to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity. This marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth.”

Wind and solar installations matched 109% of new global demand for power in the first half of 2025.Ember

That growth is projected to continue. Later on Tuesday morning, the International Energy Agency released its own report forecasting that renewable capacity will double over the next five years. Solar is predicted to make up 80% of that growth. But, factoring in the Trump administration’s policies, the forecast roughly cut in half previous projections for U.S. growth. Domestic opposition to renewables runs beyond the White House, too. Exclusive data gathered by Heatmap Pro and published in July showed that a fifth of U.S. counties now restrict development of renewables.

2. Trump orders controversial Alaska mining road to move forward

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing federal agencies to push forward with a controversial 211-mile mining road in Alaska designed to facilitate production of copper, zinc, gallium, and other critical minerals. The project, which the Biden administration halted last year over concerns for permafrost in the fast-warming region, has been at the center of a decadeslong legal battle. As part of the deal, the U.S. government will invest $35.6 million in Alaska’s Ambler Mining District, including taking a 10% stake in the main developer, Trilogy Metals, that includes warrants to buy an additional 7.5% of the company. The road itself will be jointly owned by the state, the federal government, and Alaska Native villages. “It’s a very, very big deal from the standpoint of minerals and energy,” Trump said in the Oval Office.

It’s just the latest stake the Trump administration has taken in a mineral company. In July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder of MP Materials, the company producing rare earths in the U.S. at its Mountain Pass mine in California. The move, The Economist noted at the time, marked the biggest American experiment in direct government ownership since the nationalization of the railroads in World War I. Last week, the Department of Energy renegotiated a loan to Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project in Nevada to take a stake in what’s set to become the largest lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere when it comes online in the next few years. The White House’s mineral shopping spree isn’t over. On Friday, Reuters reported that the administration is considering buying shares in Critical Metals, the company looking to develop rare earths production in Greenland. In response to the news, shares in the Nasdaq-traded miner surged 62% on Monday. Partial nationalization isn’t the only approach the administration is taking to challenging China’s grip over global mineral supplies. Last month, as I reported for Heatmap, the Defense Logistics Agency awarded money to Xerion, an Ohio startup devising a novel way to process cobalt and gallium.

3. Tesla set to roll out a cheaper Model Y — plus a surprise

Tesla looks poised to unveil a cheaper, stripped-down version of its Model Y as early as today. In one of two short videos posted to CEO Elon Musk’s X social media site, the electric automaker showed the midsize SUV’s signature lights beaming through the dark. The design matches what InsideEVs noted were likely images of the prototype spotted on a test drive in Texas. The second teaser video showed what appears to be a fast-spinning, Tesla-branded fan. “Your guess is as good as ours as to what will be revealed,” InsideEVs’ Andrei Nedelea wrote Monday. “Our money is on the Roadster or a new vacuum cleaner design to take on Dyson.”

The new products come amid an historic slump for Tesla. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin reported, the company’s share of the U.S. electric vehicle sales sank to their lowest-ever level in August despite the surge in purchases as Americans rushed to use the federal tax credits before they expired thanks to Trump’s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill Act law. Yet Musk has managed to steer the automaker’s financial fate through an attention-grabbing maneuver. Last month, the world’s richest man bought $1 billion in Tesla shares in a show of self confidence that managed to rebound the company’s stock price. But Andrew Moseman argued in Heatmap that “the bullish stock market performance is divorced not only from the reality of the company’s electric car sales, but also from, well, everything else that’s happened lately.”

4. Heavy duty trucks come in for tariffs

On Monday, Trump warned that medium and heavy-duty trucks imported to the U.S. will face a 25% tariff starting on November 1. The president announced the trade levies in a post on Truth Social on the eve of a White House visit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country would feel the pinch of tariffs on imported trucks. As the Financial Times noted, Trump had threatened to impose 25% tariffs on some trucks in late September but “failed to implement them, raising questions about his commitment to the policy.”

5. Fusion faces serious supply chain challenges

Fusion startups make a lot of bold claims about how soon a technology long dismissed as the energy source of tomorrow will be able to produce commercial electrons. Though investors are betting that, as Heatmap’s Katie Brigham wrote last year, “it is finally, possibly, almost time for fusion,” a new report from the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy shows that supply chain challenges threaten to hold back the nascent industry even if it can bring laboratory breakthroughs to market. Tritium, one of two main fusion fuels, has a half life of just 12.3 years, meaning it does not exist in significant quantities in nature. Today, tritium is primarily produced by 30 pressurized heavy water fission reactors globally, but only at a total of 4 kilograms per year. As a result, “tritium availability could throttle fusion development,” the report found. That’s not the only bottleneck. “The fusion industry will require specialized components that don’t yet have well-established supply chains, like superconducting cables and the aforementioned advanced materials, and shortages of these components would delay development and inflate costs.”

THE KICKER

Scientists mapped the RNA — the molecules that carry out DNA’s instructions — of wheat and, for the first time, identified when certain genes are active. The discovery promises to accelerate plant breeders’ efforts to develop more resilient varieties of the world’s most widely cultivated crop that use less fertilizer, resist higher temperatures, and survive with less water as the climate changes. “We discovered how groups of genes work together as regulatory networks to control gene expression,” Rachel Rusholme-Pilcher, the study’s lead author and a researcher at Britain’s Earlham Institute, said in a statement. “Our research allowed us to look at how these network connections differ between wheat varieties, revealing new sources of genetic diversity that could be critical in boosting the resilience of wheat.”

Rather than trying to build a full-scale reactor that can produce net energy via a self-sustaining fusion reaction right off the bat, Shine uses a particle accelerator to drive a series of small-scale fusion reactions. When high-energy ions connect with fuels, such as tritium or deuterium, they undergo a fusion reaction that produces high-energy neutrons and specialized isotopes more often generated for use in industry via fission.

Piefer, who has a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, started up his company by making neutrons for materials testing in the aerospace and defense industries. Unlike other forms of radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons can penetrate dense materials such as metals, hydrogen-containing fuels, or ceramics, making it possible to spot hidden flaws. An otherwise invisible crack in a turbine blade, for example, could still block or scatter neutrons, while contamination from water or oil would absorb neutrons — making these faults clear in a radiographic image.

Scientists also use neutrons to test nuclear fission fuel by identifying contamination and verifying uranium enrichment levels. According to Piefer, Shine produces the neutrons used to test half of all fission fuel today. “Fusion actually already enables the production of 50% of the fission fuel in this country,” he told me.

My mind was blown. I didn’t understand how fusion — a famously expensive endeavor — could be an economically viable option for these applications.

Piefer understood. “I’ll sit here in one breath and I’ll tell you fusion is way too expensive to compete making electricity, and in another breath that it’s much cheaper than fission for making isotopes and doing testing,” he said. As Piefer went on to explain, if the goal isn’t net energy, you can strip the fusion reactor of a good deal of complexity — no superconducting magnets, complicated structures to produce tritium fuel, or control systems to keep the burning fusion plasma contained.

With a simplified system, Piefer told me, it’s much easier to produce a fusion reaction than a fission reaction. The latter, he explained, “operates on the razor’s edge of something called criticality” — a self-sustaining reaction that must be precisely balanced. If a fission reaction accelerates too quickly, power surges dangerously and you get a disaster like Chernobyl. If it slows, there’s simply no reaction at all. Plus, even after a fission reactor shuts down, it keeps producing heat, and thus must be actively cooled. But when it comes to fusion, there’s no danger of an out of control power surge, because, unlike fission, it’s not a chain reaction — if the input conditions change, fusion stops immediately. Furthermore, fusion produces no heat after the reaction stops.

Some of Shine’s customers include manufacturers of turbine blades and explosives such as the U.S. Army and GE Hitachi, as well as the biopharmaceutical companies Blue Earth Therapeutics and Telix Pharmaceuticals. Piefer told me that the company is now “on the verge of essentially breakeven” — no fusion pun intended — when it comes to its operating expenses. These days, it’s reinvesting much of its revenue to build out what Piefer says will be the largest isotope production facility in the world in Wisconsin. Isotopes are created when high energy neutrons strike stable elements, causing the nuclei to absorb the neutron and become radioactive. The isotope’s radioactive properties make them useful for targeting particular tissues, cells, or organs in medical imaging or focused therapies..

Shine’s in-progress facility will primarily produce molybdenum‑99, the most commonly used isotope for medical imaging. The company already operates one smaller isotope facility producing lutetium-177, which features in cutting-edge cancer therapies.

Compared to materials testing, producing medical isotopes has required Shine to increase the temperature and thus the efficiency of its fusion target. Subsequent applications will require greater efficiency still. The idea is that as Shine applies its tech to increasingly challenging and energy-intensive tasks, it will also move step by step toward a commercially viable, net-energy-generating fusion reactor. Piefer just doesn’t know what exactly those incremental improvements will look like.

The company hasn’t committed to any specific reactor design for its fusion energy device yet, and Piefer told me that at this stage, he doesn’t think it’s necessary to pick winners. “We don’t have to, and don’t want to,” he said. “We’ve got this flexible manufacturing platform that’s doing all the things you need to do to get really good at making fusion systems, regardless of technology.”

Fusion energy aside, the company doesn’t even know how it’s going to reach the heat and efficiency requirements needed to achieve its next target — recycling spent fission fuel. But Piefer told me that if Shine can get there, scientists do already understand the chemistry. First, Shine would separate out the long-lived, highly radioactive waste products from the spent fuel using much the same approach it uses for isolating medical isotopes, no fusion reaction needed. Then, Piefer told me, “fusion can turn those long-lived wastes into short-lived waste” by using high-energy fusion neutrons to alter the radioactive nuclei in ways that make them decay faster.

If the company pulls that off — a big if indeed — it would then move on to building an energy-generating reactor. Overall, Piefer guesses this final stage will wind up taking the fusion industry “more time and money than most people predict.” Perhaps, he said, investors will prove willing to bankroll buzzy fusion startups far longer than their ambitious timelines currently imply. But perhaps not. And in the meantime, he thinks many companies will end up turning to the very markets that Shine has been exploring for decades now.

“So we’re well positioned to work with them, well positioned to help create mutual success, or well positioned to use our position to move ourselves forward,” Piefer told me, hinting that the company would be interested in making acquisitions.

Indeed, some fusion companies are already following Shine’s lead, eyeing isotopes as an early — or primary — revenue generating opportunity. Microreactor company Avalanche Energy eventually wants to replace diesel generators, but in the meantime plans to produce radioisotopes for medical and energy applications. U.K.-based fusion company Astral Systems is also making desktop-sized reactors, but with the central aim of selling medical isotopes.

If too many companies break their promises or extend their timelines interminably, as Piefer thinks is likely, more and more will come around to the pragmatism of Shine’s approach, he said. “Near term applications are increasingly talked about,” Piefer told me. “They’re not the highlight of the show yet, but I’d say the voice is getting louder.”

So while he still doesn’t have any idea what the final form for Shine’s hypothetical fusion power plant will take, in his mind the company is leading the race. “I believe we’re actually on the fastest path to fusion commercialization for energy of anybody out there,” Piefer told me. “Because commercial is important to us, and it always has been.”

“It was definitely touch and go whether this was all going to come together,” Victoria Rome, the director of California government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “It was a lot of complicated policy to put forward in a relatively short time frame.”

The package reauthorizes California’s signature cap and trade program, rebranded as “cap and invest,” with a slight tweak that will help lower electricity bills. It clears a major hurdle to creating a more integrated Western electricity market that has the potential to deliver cleaner energy throughout the region at lower cost. It replenishes a rapidly diminishing wildfire fund that ensures utilities don’t go belly-up when they’re found liable for wildfires — and offsets the cost to customers by limiting how much of the cost of transmission upgrades utilities are allowed to pass on. And lastly — and most controversially — in an attempt to stabilize gasoline prices, it streamlines approval of new oil wells in Kern County, California.

Not everyone was happy with the compromise. The Center for Biological Diversity condemned the oil and gas bill, while environmental justice advocates were angry that lawmakers did not do more to protect low-income communities in the reform of cap and trade. It also remains to be seen how much the cost containment measures will help. Some of them, like the new Western electricity market, likely won’t pay off for many years. The cap and trade extension could ultimately exacerbate costs.

A few other groundbreaking climate-related bills are still sitting on Newsom’s desk, such as one that would set a safe maximum indoor temperature, requiring landlords to provide cooling to tenants, and another that would override local zoning rules to allow taller, denser housing to be built near public transit. He has until next Monday to sign them. But even without those, the package illustrates how California Democrats are at least trying to leverage the new politics of affordability to advance their climate goals, and the ways in which the two are difficult to align.

Here’s a breakdown of the major changes.

Cap and trade invest through 2045

California’s cap and trade program is the state’s centerpiece climate policy. It puts a price on pollution by requiring dirty industries to buy and retire state-auctioned “allowances” for every ton of carbon they emit, with a declining amount of allowances released into the market each year. Funds raised through allowance sales are funneled into utility bill credits for consumers as well as climate-friendly projects throughout the state.

Prior to last month’s legislation, the program was only authorized to continue through 2030, and the closer that date got, the greater the uncertainty became about whether it would continue. According to one analysis, that uncertainty cost the state $3.6 billion in revenues over the year ending in May 2025 as companies relied on allowances they’d stocked up on in previous years, when they were cheaper and more plentiful. If the program was going to expire in 2030, there was less incentive to collect more — or to invest in emission-reducing solutions like replacing their boilers with industrial heat pumps.

The legislature extended cap and trade through 2045, rebranding as “cap and invest” — a more politically resonant title originating in Washington State that highlights the revenue-raising aspect of the program. It also introduced several key reforms. By 2031, earnings from the program reserved for utility credits will go exclusively toward electric bill savings, i.e. it will no longer subsidize residential gas. “The general idea was that almost every gas customer is an electric customer,” Danny Cullenward, a California-based climate economist and lawyer, told me. “And so if you shift the same total dollars from gas and electric to just electric, you concentrate the benefits on the electric side, which supports building decarbonization, but you don’t take any dollars away from the customer.”

California has the highest electric rates in the continental U.S., and so right now, switching from using natural gas to all-electric appliances is not in everyone’s best interest. Providing more relief on the electric side will help with that — especially as the price of allowances increases in the coming years, translating into more revenue to fund bill credits. The legislation also directs electric utilities to apply the credits over the summer, when bills are highest, rather than on the twice-a-year schedule they used previously.

The other major reform has to do with the way carbon offsets are integrated into the program. Previously, companies could purchase offsets instead of allowances to account for a certain amount of their emissions, giving them a cheaper way to comply. Now, every time a company retires an offset instead of an allowance, the state will also retire an allowance. This is an implicit recognition by lawmakers that carbon offsets haven’t been effective at reducing emissions, Cullenward told me.

While he called the extension of cap and invest a “profound and important accomplishment,” Cullenward also raised major concerns about its future impacts on affordability. The program literally puts a price on carbon, after all, and that price is now set to rise, pervading much of California’s economy, from the pump to the cost of goods and services. “Outside of my hope that this will be a net benefit for electric utility ratepayers, which I think is a very good and positive thing, this is not an affordability bill,” he told me.

Lawmakers have done nothing to mitigate the program’s effect on gasoline and diesel costs, he pointed out. They also haven’t addressed the elephant in the room — a $95 price ceiling on allowances that, if they ever get there, may be politically untenable. (Right now prices are around $30.) State regulators now have a chance to revise the price ceiling, Cullenward said, ideally with an eye toward balancing ambition with consumer cost impacts. “That’s the main part of the work that is completely not yet done,” he said.

Toward the creation of a coordinated Western grid

Energy nerds throughout the West have been scheming to unite its disparate grids for years. Unlike the entire eastern half of the country, where utilities buy and sell energy across state lines in competitive markets on both a daily and realtime basis, and work together to plan transmission upgrades throughout their territories, most Western states do all of their energy trading through longer-term bilateral contracts.

After years of failed efforts to change that, lawmakers have finally given California’s grid operator their blessing to work with other states in the region on creating such a market. Proponents argue that more competition and coordination between utilities in the West will create efficiencies that save money, improve reliability, and accelerate decarbonization. For example, California, which often produces more solar energy than it can use during the day, would be able to sell more of that power to other states. When there’s a heat wave coming, it’ll have more supply to draw from.

To be clear, California was already working on all this prior to last month’s legislation. The state’s grid operator launched a realtime electricity trading market in 2014, which now has 21 utility participants throughout the West. Next year it will launch an extended day-ahead market, enabling utilities to buy power about a week in advance of when they’ll need it. That will initially have just two participants, PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric, with five others planning to join in later years.

But seven companies does not a competitive market make. To grow to its fullest potential, the day-ahead market will need many more participants. That was always going to be a tough sell so long as California was in charge, Vijay Satyal, the deputy director of regional markets at the nonprofit Western Resource Advocates, told me. CAISO, California’s grid operator, is overseen by a governor-appointed board, “which is one reason why the larger West never wanted to be part of CAISO, if the governance and decision making would be controlled by the governor of one state,” he said.

An effort is already underway between state officials, utilities, and other stakeholders, including those from California, to create an independently-governed Western Energy Market called the West-Wide Governance Pathways Initiative. The new legislation grants CAISO permission to transition governance of its realtime and day-ahead markets to the organization that comes out of that effort — as long as the group meets certain requirements around transparency and engagement with state leadership.

“Now there’s opportunity for all the utilities across the West to come together and for clean energy developers to be part of a larger market and be transparent, independent, and not controlled by one state’s policies,” Satyal told me. The other advantage of having this regional organization is that it can engage in more coordinated transmission planning — another potential cost-saving measure.

Some relief from wildfire costs

Wildfires have been a huge part of California’s electricity affordability crisis. Case in point: Since 2019, Californians have had to pay an extra fee on top of their electric bills that goes into a state Wildfire Fund to help utilities cover post-wildfire loss and damage claims — a sort of insurance mechanism to prevent utility insolvency.

This year, lawmakers were under pressure to add more money to the pot. Experts worried that without another infusion, payments related to January’s Eaton Fire in Los Angeles, which the U.S. Department of Justice alleges was caused by faulty utility equipment, would deplete much of what’s left.

The legislature extended the fee, adding $18 billion to the Wildfire Fund that will be split evenly between ratepayers and utility shareholders over the next decade. But it also passed several measures that will help offset that cost by minimizing future rate increases. First, utilities will be prohibited from earning a profit on the first $6 billion they spend on wildfire mitigation projects, such as burying power lines, starting next year. Companies will be required to finance this spending more cheaply through ratepayer-backed bonds rather than through equity, which commands a higher rate of return.

On top of that, the legislature directed the governor’s office to create a “Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator,” a program that will develop public financing options for new transmission lines, such as low-cost loans, revenue bonds, or even partial public ownership of the projects. The program will have a dedicated “Revolving Fund” that will be replenished each year with a portion of cap and invest revenue.

“It is the largest electricity affordability measure in the whole package,” Sam Uden, the co-founder and managing director for the nonprofit policy shop Net Zero California, told me — to the tune of $3 billion in savings per year once the new lines are constructed, according to an analysis his group commissioned.

More drilling

Gavin Newsom has not necessarily been a friend to the oil industry. He’s instituted distance requirements for new oil wells barring drilling near homes and schools, and given local jurisdictions more authority over drilling. But gasoline prices — ever a political issue in California — have tested his resolve. The price at the pump in California has averaged around a dollar higher than the rest of the U.S. for the past several years, and that margin has crept up closer to $1.30 this year. After two of the state’s refineries announced they would close this year and next, threatening to drive prices higher, Newsom backed a bill this session to increase oil production in Kern County.

Uden of Net Zero California justified the bill as a “short term measure.” The provisions that streamline drilling permits only apply through 2036. “We are really trying to grapple with what is a very difficult transition,” he told me. “We’ve got to phase down oil, but we can’t do it in a way that just spikes gas prices.”

It’s unclear, however, whether more drilling in Kern County will do much to address the problem — especially if the cap and invest program continues to drive up prices, as Cullenward fears. At least to date, the state’s high gasoline prices have not been caused by a lack of gasoline supply, according to University of California, Berkeley, economist Severin Borenstein. The bigger factors driving price increases are taxes and environmental fees and the special blend of gasoline required by the state’s air quality regulators.

What will drive prices up are refinery closures. Lawmakers are making a bet that increased in-state oil production will prevent further closures by giving refineries access to cheaper crude. But Borenstein notes that the state will continue to rely on crude imports, meaning the price of gasoline will still be tied to the global market. His preferred solution to keep prices in check is to remove barriers to importing more refined gasoline.

“The longer run challenge is to balance refining supply and demand, which oil production doesn’t address,” Borenstein wrote.

Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment, agreed on the urgency of opening a new import terminal. He told me he saw the Kern County bill as a way to buy time. “We’ve done the kind of stopgap measure. The increased permits will help stabilize Northern California refineries for probably a couple years,” he said. “But if we don’t use that couple of years in the right way, then we will be in big trouble.”

Wara also wasn’t too worried about the measure creating some kind of oil Renaissance. “Permits are one thing. The decision to actually drill a well is an economic decision that’s going to be driven by oil prices, which are pretty low right now. I don’t think anybody thinks that handing out more permits is going to stem the decline in that industry.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTcyMDg2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNjI2MDk5OX0.k-t2cnSZwYO8RZtSCfRund8J0kikIwEJZg5HRQKaV5A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-07 15:05:32.271239

As the Trump Administration recklessly slashes over $33 million from clean energy projects in his district and more than $608 million in critical investments across Colorado, Evans is nowhere to be found.

Evans’ silence is especially ironic considering that just last month, he:

Penned an op-ed arguing that “now, more than ever, we need to invest in… innovative energy technologies” and that “modernized grids are… part of the equation.” One of the now-cancelled grants – worth $27 million – would have helped “optimize” the grid in Evans’ rural district.

Held an energy roundtable where he “reiterated [his] commitment to increasing jobs and ensuring Weld County remained a top energy producer in the state.”

Visited with one of the companies now bracing for more than $6 million in cuts and noted how their “investment will help provide more reliable, safe, and affordable energy for #CO08.”

But now that D.C. Party Bosses have decided to gut these clean energy projects, it’s crickets from Gabe Evans.

REMINDER: After voting for the Big, Ugly Bill earlier this year, Evans admitted he was jeopardizing millions in investments and thousands of good-paying jobs in his district and begged Senate Republican leaders to “mitigate” the negative impacts of his own vote.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-10-07 17:49:37+00:00,AP News,"Solar and wind power has grown faster than electricity demand this year, report says","Alexa St. John, energy policy, breaking climate news, extreme weather. twitter mailto, apnews.com, alexa-st-john",,,,,https://apnews.com/article/climate-renewable-wind-solar-coal-electricity-demand-abf7b587b038bf7580de1baee6576bbc,"Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.
India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

Lithium-ion batteries have transformed the industry due to their high energy density, lightweight design, and long cycle life. However, as the battery industry expands, safety concerns have become a pressing issue. Incidents involving battery fires, thermal runaway, and improper transportation or disposal have highlighted the need for robust safety standards and risk mitigation strategies.

The battery industry is currently navigating a complex landscape of evolving safety regulations and standards, including those established by organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and the United Nations (UN), which apply to transportation and storage. These standards aim to address critical issues, including the prevention of overheating, proper labeling for hazardous materials, and safe recycling practices. Understanding where the industry stands today involves not only recognizing the advancements in battery technology but also acknowledging the challenges in ensuring compliance with these safety measures.

A group of more than 10 experts at the Battery Show North America provided insights during a workshop titled ""Battery Safety - A Comprehensive Risk Mitigation Plan."" These industry experts brought their unique viewpoints and expertise to the discussion, offering valuable commentary on the current state of the battery industry, emerging safety challenges, and the importance of compliance with evolving standards. A key focus of the discussion was the critical need for fire departments and first responders to understand how to effectively mitigate battery fires, particularly those involving lithium-ion batteries. Here are some of the insights from some of the panelists.

Bridging the gap between fire departments and battery technology

Caroline Rudacille, Fire Lieutenant at Baltimore County Fire Department, emphasized that battery fires are fundamentally different from traditional fires and require specialized techniques. She pointed out that battery fires are ""not a fire"" in the traditional sense; they are something entirely different that fire departments are struggling to understand and respond to effectively. Fire departments are ""behind"" the technology and rely heavily on industry expertise during incidents, stressing that collaboration between battery companies and local fire departments is essential. Firefighters encounter these incidents daily but often lack the specialized knowledge needed for a safe and effective response.

Addressing safety across the battery lifecycle

Dr. Veronika Wright, CEO and Founder of Electrification Academy, emphasizes the importance of understanding battery safety across the entire life cycle, not just after an incident occurs. She explained that battery fire incidents stem from multiple trigger categories, including thermal abuse (overheating), mechanical abuse (crashes or structural damage), and electrical abuse (overcharging).

However, she emphasized that the least understood triggers are internal defects and manufacturing defects that can develop over time. As she said, ""any fresh battery cells can go into a thermal runaway, because there could be internal defects, manufacturing defects. A battery cell, a lithium-ion battery cell, is so sensitive, in a way, it really reacts to the littlest, tiniest impurifications."" Wright noted that these defects may only manifest through aging processes, and the industry currently lacks proper tracking systems to understand when and where these incidents actually originate—whether at the cell level, system level, or within the battery management system (BMS). She advocated for better incident tracking and knowledge sharing across the battery lifecycle to learn from these events and improve safety measures.

Closing gaps in dangerous goods transportation

Elizabeth Gibbons Barber, Founder, Principal Consultant at Empower to Comply LLC identified critical gaps in the transportation of dangerous goods, emphasizing that the industry faces significant challenges as technology rapidly evolves. She said, “There are a lot of differences in how teams and organized organizations interpret what Damaged, Defective, Recalled (DDR) means because it's a qualitative determination. You have to talk with technical experts to determine your risk.""

She emphasized that compliance doesn't always equate to safety, highlighting concerns about regulatory requirements that may not adequately address real-world risks: ""It's important to audit beyond compliance and apply risk-based improvements."" She advocated for industry collaboration to address these gaps, saying, ""I encourage everyone to lean into the vulnerability, to just say, like, here are my questions, where vulnerability can be hard when you're representing your organization, and I get the liability point, but it's a good time for us to discuss with each other. Ultimately, Gibbons reminded the audience that ""incidents remind us to stay humble and keep learning. Regulations exist because of lessons paid in lives, property, and money, and every safer seat and every compliance shipment adds to that silent success story.""",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt70ddcd21313a2be2/68e42a6ea8e89107685f64d1/Battery_Safety_Workshop.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-07 16:02:12.544077

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO is lead plaintiff in the suit, filed in federal court in Providence.
The Solar for All program was projected by the Biden administration to help 900,000 households get access to solar power.
It would save Americans, the Biden administration said, $350 million a year in energy costs.
“This is like a one-two punch to the people of Rhode Island,” he said.","A major Rhode Island labor union and a coalition of homeowners, solar energy companies and nonprofits sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday, over its termination of $7 billion in grants meant to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels.

The suit concerns the Solar for All program, part of the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. The lawsuit accuses the EPA of illegally clawing-back funding without Congressional approval.

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO is lead plaintiff in the suit, filed in federal court in Providence. Patrick Crowley, the union’s president, said cancelling the program means losing hundreds of jobs in the state. Nationally, the program was projected to generate 200,000 new jobs.

“It’s going to limit the amount of work opportunities for the members that I represent to do solar installation,” Crowley said. “It’s going to lead to increased energy costs, because without solar energy as part of an ‘all of the above strategy,’ it means that Rhode Island is going to be subject to more turbulence in the electricity market, like we’ve seen over the last several winters.”

The plaintiffs are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Rhode Island Center for Justice and Lawyers for Good Government.

The Solar for All program was projected by the Biden administration to help 900,000 households get access to solar power. It would save Americans, the Biden administration said, $350 million a year in energy costs.

But EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called Solar for All “a boondoggle,” in a video on social media. Over the summer, it was one of several big renewable energy programs that saw funding clawed back by the Trump administration.

“This is just another example of the administration targeting programs that would help low-income, disadvantaged communities,” Crowley said, “but also the hurt states like Rhode Island that want to diversify our energy portfolio so that we can control costs.”

Rhode Island’s share of the $7 billion program amounted to more than $49 million.

The AFL-CIO’s Crowley said the cancellation of Solar for All will hurt that much more because of the abrupt cancellation of off-shore wind projects like Revolution Wind.

“This is like a one-two punch to the people of Rhode Island,” he said. “It’s going to hurt everyone’s pocketbook.”

Oh, and let’s not forget the Frankenfish and other mutant creatures horribly disfigured by coal ash poisoning.","Looking for a scary Halloween story? Well you’ve come to the right place for a tale that will chill your bones and leave you questioning all you once thought true. While your typical ghost story always has a spooky setting (an empty stretch of highway in a rainstorm, or a cemetery at midnight…), hinting at the presence of witches, monsters or zombies, this story could be happening in your own backyard. You, your family, your neighbors are all unsuspecting of the dangers lurking nearby.

I’m talking about coal ash, the toxic menace creeping across our landscape like The Blob, gobbling up hundreds of acres and looming over communities across America. The waste is truly a mad scientist’s brew of toxic heavy metals, pollutants and other power plant waste. Dumped in giant open lagoons, most of which are unlined and located directly along our favorite waterways, slowly poisoning rivers, lakes and streams. Across the Southeast there are over 450 of these dumps, at least 21 of these are real monsters earning them a high hazard rating from EPA. Unlike good old-fashioned monsters and ghouls that leap out to grab you, this hidden danger literally seeps into people’s lives; plaguing communities with mysterious illnesses, shattering people’s dreams and leaving ghost towns in its wake.

This is truly the stuff of nightmares and it’s happening more than any of us would like to think.

Take, for example a few particularly frightening tales from across our region. There’s the horror story going on in Juliette, Georgia; a picturesque rural town that’s served as the bucolic backdrop of several movies. Community members living near the Scherer Power Station started suffering from bizarre diseases with no explanation–rare forms of cancer, kidney disease and disfiguring hives. After years of medical tests they discovered their drinking water was poisoned with uranium and other heavy metals. It’s like finding out that the killer calling you is already in your house! Worse yet, there’s no way to get away from the horror; with their property values destroyed, Juliette residents are forced to live through a never-ending ordeal, afraid of the water that comes into their homes.

The community of Cane Run, Kentucky had been haunted by coal ash for years as Louisville Electric & Gas has piled the toxic trash into a mountain that looms over the community. A grey phantom hangs over nearby homes as toxic dust blows from the piles of ash, blanketing everything in its path and sending neighbors running into their homes for safety. The ash dust is fine as talc, and breathing it is making neighbors sick. Children are especially vulnerable to doses of mercury, lead, arsenic and other poisons in the ash and can ingest these toxics when they play outside. In the words of one Cane Run resident:

“You’ve got black soot everywhere…kids that have learning disabilities. There’s excessive amounts of ADHD. There’s excessive amounts of cancer, kidney disease. People are sick there constantly. They’re dying. I’m just sick and tired of it. I’ve lived there for 35 years and all I do is watch people die.”

These are only a few of the horrifying examples of communities threatened by coal ash — if you want to get really scared check out www.SoutheastCoalAsh.org to find out if ash lurks in the places you live, work and play. This waste can strike in other blood curdling ways, too. Sometimes, as happened in 2008 in the Kingston disaster, entire neighborhoods are wiped out in a single day by a billion gallon flood of toxic sludge.

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

Additional Topics on Which EPA Seeks Comment:

Data about which refrigerants are being considered or adopted in new refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses;

Data about the commercial availability and timeline for adoption of new refrigeration equipment using lower-GWP substitutes in remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses, as it relates to the proposed 2032 compliance dates for these subsectors;

Data about costs and savings resulting from the extension of compliance timelines for manufacturers and servicing companies, which are investing in U.S. production of new raw materials, refrigerants, equipment, and other technologies, intended to support companies’ transition and compliance, across the subsectors in this rule;

The proposed removal of the installation compliance date for residential and light commercial air conditioning systems, as well as whether an extension of the installation compliance date by one or more years would be appropriate, noting that EPA does not have information about the extent of equipment that may remain in inventory as of January 1, 2026, and account for any significant reliance interests in the final action as well as any significant reliance interests that should be accounted for in any final action; and

Information and data that may be used to inform future actions that could be taken by EPA or other parts of the federal government to address R-454B supply challenges.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15478_5804.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:02:56.176396

It currently assembles the R1S, R1T and Rivian Commercial Van (RCV), with the R2 SUV prepping for mass production next year.

For a startup factory, it’s a very busy place, as shown in a new video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything.

Rivian is still very much a startup, but its first factory in Normal, Illinois, is anything but a boring place. In fact, it’s quite busy, as shown in a new video from famous smartphone durability tester and EV enthusiast JerryRigEverything.

He got a chance to visit the place where the R1S, R1T and commercial van are being assembled, and it’s pretty cool to watch an entire vehicle being brought to life under a single roof.

It all starts with several giant Komatsu sheet metal stamping presses that were originally installed in the factory three decades ago. And no, Rivian was not around back then, but Mitsubishi was, and it used the same factory and presses to build cars like the Eclipse and Mirage, before closing the facility in 2016 and selling it to Rivian in 2017.

Now, dozens of robots are being used throughout the plant for precision tasks and tough jobs, including gluing the two sides of the hood together, wielding entire side profiles through the air and welding all sorts of metal parts.

Laser welding is widely used for a bunch of different sections, from body parts to battery packs. Speaking of batteries, Rivian assembles the packs for the R1T, R1S and electric delivery van in-house in Normal. The electric motors are also made in the same factory, and it’s pretty mesmerizing to see how they‘re put together.

Rivian uses liquid nitrogen to cool the motor’s rotator shaft to a chilling temperature of -321 degrees Fahrenheit (-196 degrees Celsius), while the rotator body is expanded using heat. The components are then press-fitted together, and after their temperatures normalize, the two are bonded.

Final assembly is handled by humans, using all sorts of tools, so that employees don’t break their backs.

It’s a busy place, with three models being assembled under the same roof. As someone who has had the chance to visit several car factories around the world, I can say that Rivian’s plant in Normal, Illinois, is a hybrid between traditional assembly plants and the factories of the future. There are a lot of robots handling high-precision repeatable jobs, as well as tasks that require heavy lifting, but people are also involved in the final steps of assembly.

Either way, it’s always fascinating to see a car being built, even if it’s through a YouTube video. Plus, even the golf carts and robots are painted in Rivian Blue, which is quite cool.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/W8762j/s1/rivian-factory-in-normal-illinois.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:30.467226

Our deposits in the city of Detroit have grown by close to $30 billion.
We see where we may need to sort of tweak the skills and the training, and Detroit at Work works with us.","Can you share a bit about the origin story of JPMorgan's investment in Detroit? Why Detroit?

After the financial crisis in 2009, we were really rethinking how we showed up in communities, because there was a lot of fair criticism that banks and others got bailed out of the crisis, and a lot of communities were left high and dry, and we began rethinking how we should approach our work in communities that we could support them within. And so we were in that process for a year or two, and then where it came together for me was in the summer of 2013.

Jamie Dimon, my boss, the CEO, I was summoned to his office, and he said, ""Are you following what's going on in Detroit?"" And frankly, I said, ""Not really."" And he said, ""They just entered the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the country, and I want you to go out there and see if there's anything we can do to help."" And that was literally how it got teed up.

He said, ""I'm not thinking about charity. Are there investments that we can make?""

And so we brought teams in to really identify areas that the community was focused on, that we thought we could help accelerate and catalyze and scale some of the solutions. Things like affordable housing, big focus on workforce skills and the gap. We focused, not as much initially, but eventually, on small business, neighborhood development, all the issues of blight, how you dealt with vacant and abandoned property.

So we identified a number of areas and when the mayor came into office, we then started engaging with him and said, ""Here are some of our ideas."" And Mayor Duggan had some of his own ideas and we continued to work together, and in May of 2014 we announced an initial $100 million dollar investment in the city.

Was that your first time in Detroit? What connections did you have to the city before this effort and what's your view of the city now?

I had certainly been to Detroit before, but had not spent a huge amount of time there, probably the last time I had really spent any time in Detroit before that was the late '80s.

When I first got to Detroit in the fall of 2013, you didn't want to walk around at night. Now, the streets are filled. It's hard to get restaurant reservations, there’s a great food scene, great night life. It's a vibrant, growing city. One of the things I love is the fact that a lot of young people are moving into the city and are sort of adding to it. So it's just a night and day difference.

When did you meet Mike Duggan for the first time? How did your relationship, which seems to be almost a partnership, grow?

The first time I met the mayor, it was early 2014, so he was probably only mayor for a few weeks at that point, and Jamie Dimon had called him and said that we had been looking at the city, and we were potentially interested in making some investments.

We sat down, and he — one of the things he did, I'll never forget — he pulled out maps of the city neighborhoods. One of the things I remember he said at that first meeting was that Detroit can't come back unless the neighborhoods come back. So this couldn't just be like, ""Let's bring back downtown."" And so we spent a lot of time looking at maps, talking about places like Corktown, where we now have a branch, and the potential there. It was really looking at, how do we, neighborhood by neighborhood, get the blight cleaned up and turn over vacant properties?

What surprised me, because I spent a lot of time talking to mayors, working with mayors, was the level of detail of what needed to be done, and a level of focus on how we could help. It's just been an extraordinary partnership for almost 12 years.

The last thing JPMorgan wanted to do is show up in a place like Detroit, or any place else, and say, ""Hey, we're the guys from Wall Street. We're here to fix all your problems."" We can only help accelerate and scale and bring some of our knowledge and expertise from other places, but it's got to be led by the city. And one of the main reasons, probably the most important reason, in making this investment was our confidence in the leadership of Mayor Duggan.

How did its Detroit push pay off for the company?

Our deposits in the city of Detroit have grown by close to $30 billion. Our book of loans has grown; our mortgage lending, and small business lending have all grown.

We really approached this and thought about it like we thought about a business investment, and I think the most important lesson, for us, was that if you want to create sustainable growth — and there's always a role for philanthropy, but if a city is completely reliant on philanthropy to grow, it's not going to work. It's not sustainable. The reality is, if you look at it, there were billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal government, from the state government, that went into Detroit over 20 years before it filed bankruptcy. But there were no sustainable business investments.

When you first go in, you want to make some part of what we call lower-cost capital, but now it's a vibrant market, and you've got others, other banks, other institutions, investing in the city. And that's what you want. You want to create this environment in which other investors see an opportunity, a long-term opportunity, and our decision and our announcement back in 2014 was a way of saying to the others, ""We believe in the long-term prospects of the city. We believe in the leadership of Mike Duggan. We see how he is bringing together, you know, the business community and the community organizations, civic organizations, they're not fighting with each other, you know, they're really focused on making it a better city."" It's something, frankly, we were really excited about and now very proud to be a partner.

What did JPMorgan learn from the experience of its ""virtual"" call center in Corktown that trained up Detroiters to do decent-paying telephone customer service work?

We're continuing to expand. We continue to grow in Detroit. We've continued to grow in Baltimore. We now have an Atlanta Virtual Call Center, and we also have a true virtual call center that we're actually employing military spouses, who often have to move around so they can have employment no matter where they go. We're actually getting the same or better quality calls at lower costs. From a business perspective, you couldn't ask for a better model, so we will continue to expand it, and it all started in Detroit.

We actually hired more than we anticipated, because there were so many well-qualified applicants, and Detroit at Work has been a really important partner to us throughout the time of this. We see where we may need to sort of tweak the skills and the training, and Detroit at Work works with us. And so we're seeing that it builds on the efficiency of the call center. So one of the most important lessons for us in creating these was to have the right partner, like we had in the mayor and in Detroit at work.

Throughout your career, you’ve been deeply involved in policy and politics. What's your view of the current global and U.S. situation and where we are going?

Politics right now has become this kind of blood sport, and if you pick a team, everything about your team is right and everything about the other team is wrong. I think this is what you saw in Detroit for a long time before Mayor Duggan was elected, and I think people are tired of the kind of partisan warfare that they're seeing. I saw a poll the other day about the shutdown, and people blamed both parties. I mean, people generally are saying, ""Whatever your issues are, it's not worth shutting down the government."" And you saw the same thing in Lansing.

To me, what Detroit represents is a sense that people want something different here. Here's a mayor who came in and said, ""We're not, I'm not going to do us versus them. That drove us into bankruptcy. I'm going to work with anyone who wants to be part of it. I'm going to work with Democrats. I'm going to work with Republicans. I’m going to work with the city council.""

And the fact that here's a white guy that gets elected in a predominantly Black city and gets reelected and is leaving office with an 84% approval rating, one of the things that says is, while people are stuck in this partisan grudge match, at some level, they don’t want it.

They want something different, and to see what the city has been able to accomplish by getting beyond that kind of politics and focusing on what really matters and creating jobs and training people and bringing in investment, to me, is a great example that I wish more people in Washington and other places around the country would look at and say, ""This is the kind of leadership people want.""

What's next for you? Do you see any future connection with Detroit?

Right now, I've been focused on retirement. I plan to stay actively engaged on several boards, and I care deeply about public policy, and I'm going to spend some time figuring out what's next for me.

I'll retire in the spring. I'll remain an advisor to Jamie throughout the year. I'm on several boards, and my family and I want to take some trips, and we'll see. There's still some gas in this tank, and we'll see where it leads me.

Offshore sand mining occurs in the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean and can have long term effects on benthic habitats.
Offshore sand resources that have been historically harvested include sandy shoals and rocky substrate habitats in the nearshore Atlantic important for supporting fisheries and marine birds.","The Delaware Estuary is one of the nation’s largest petrochemical centers, and the potential for spills is an ever-present threat to estuarine and wetland systems and the SGCN that rely on them. The port complex of the Delaware River and Bay is the second largest oil port in the United States, handling about 85% of the East Coast’s oil imports. The Athos I spill in 2004 near Philadelphia released some 265,000 gallons of heavy crude into the Delaware River. The cumulative effects of small spills are also of concern for SGCN.

Some of the largest direct threats from energy production in Delaware are associated with cooling water intakes and discharges (e.g., from power plants), pollution events, and other causes that are covered elsewhere in this chapter.

Renewable energy is not without risks to SGCN. There are many potential impacts of new energy development on wildlife within the Mid-Atlantic states, ranging from effects of hydraulic fracturing and offshore drilling on aquatic systems, the loss of habitat to biofuel production, the direct mortality of birds and bats from wind turbines along mountain and coastal flyways, and noise causing avoidance of marine life. Additionally, solar panels can be highly attractive traps for insects seeking to oviposit on the water’s surface, and design modifications are required to minimize this impact to groups like mayflies, and caddisflies (Horváth et al. 2010).

A Risk Assessment of Marine Birds in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean was completed through the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NALCC) and partners which developed a series of maps depicting the distribution, abundance and relative risk to marine birds from offshore activities (e.g., offshore drilling and wind energy development; NALCC 2015). This can help document and predict areas of frequent use and aggregations of birds and the relative risk to marine birds along the coast. Delaware is currently evaluating the potential effects of wind energy leases in Delaware, including the effects on fish, wildlife and key habitats.

An estimated 140,000 and 328,000 birds are killed annually by collisions with monopole turbines in the contiguous U.S., with an increase in mortality with increasing turbine hub height (Loss et al. 2013). Large populations of migrating shorebirds, waterfowl, raptors and songbirds make Delaware Bay and its shoreline a high-risk location for wind turbine siting (Jenkins and Clark n.d.).

Energy transmission infrastructure in Delaware results in direct mortality of some SGCN, estimating that between 12 and 64 million birds are killed each year at U.S. power lines, with between 8 and 57 million birds killed by collision and between 0.9 and 11.6 million birds killed by electrocution (Loss et al. 2014). Utility companies are actively taking steps to minimize these effects by installing preventive devices on transmission lines and infrastructure in areas heavily used by wildlife, especially birds.

Mining

Sand and gravel quarries are prevalent in Delaware and typically result in irreversible destruction of habitat if they are located in areas not previously developed. While some SGCN, such as Bank Swallow (Riparia riparia), use active sand and gravel pits for nesting, these modified habitats have limited value for most SGCN. Sand and gravel mines covered over 6,000 acres in Delaware as of 2009 (Mackenzie 2009). Offshore sand mining occurs in the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean and can have long term effects on benthic habitats. Offshore sand resources that have been historically harvested include sandy shoals and rocky substrate habitats in the nearshore Atlantic important for supporting fisheries and marine birds. Potential direct impacts to SGCN, including sturgeon, sea turtles, and sharks, are also of concern.",https://dnrec.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/1280px-Barrow_Offshore_wind_turbines_edit1.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:01:25.045001

What does the Marine Mammal Protection Act do?
But, because of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are legally protected from being killed by industries.
What does a weaker Marine Mammal Protection Act mean for whales?
Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed in 1972, species like sea otters, whales, seals and more have recovered from population loss.","Out among the crashing ocean surf, half a dozen dolphins leap out of the water together in perfect sync. A humpback whale dives into the depths, flipping its iconic tail. Sea otters bob and float on a bed of kelp, holding paws.

Seeing these ocean animals swimming in the wild waves would fill your heart with wonder.

But a new bill in Congress would weaken the Mammal Protection Act, gutting protections for all sea creatures, including dolphins, sea otters, manatees, seals, sea lions and endangered whales.

For some of these species, especially many whale species on the brink of extinction, threats to the Marine Mammal Protection Act could be a threat to their very existence.

What does the Marine Mammal Protection Act do?

Since 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act’s goal has been to restore and maintain healthy populations of species in America’s oceans by banning the harassment, hunting, capturing and killing of marine mammals.

And, it’s been incredibly successful. This law has helped to stop the decline of humpback whales, gray seals and California sea lions, to name a few.

These creatures still face threats like vessel collisions, which are reducing the populations of whale species. But, because of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are legally protected from being killed by industries.

What does a weaker Marine Mammal Protection Act mean for whales?

The proposed change would allow industries to kill and harm more marine mammals, and make it more difficult for government agencies to react to early indications of a species in decline.

Take the North Atlantic Right whale for example. With an estimated 370 Right whales alive today, they’re teetering too close to extinction as it is. Allowing more Right whales to be killed could wipe them out forever.

Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed in 1972, species like sea otters, whales, seals and more have recovered from population loss. But if we weaken protections, all the progress we’ve made for these species could be reversed.

What can we do to save whales?

We’re working to raise awareness about the challenges whales are facing. And, we’re urging Congress not to reverse the progress sea creatures, particularly whales, have made.

Now is the time to speak up for whales, before the protections vanish and our precious wildlife suffers and disappears. Before it’s too late.

The best way you can help protect whales right now is by sending a message to your legislator to encourage them not to reverse the progress we’ve made together on conservation.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_1218839440.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:02:50.800274

Other features focus on debt capital offerings, which can also fund these energy projects.","About six months after raising $50 million, climate technology startup Crux is acquiring an AI-powered due diligence platform to enhance its own tools.

Crux announced today it will purchase the Boston firm Daedaline. Founded in 2023, Crux is building software to make the systems related to investment in clean energy projects more efficient.

The company’s platform will repurpose Daedaline’s software to streamline due diligence in financing, per Crux’s DC-based CEO and cofounder Alfred Johnson. That refers to the process of verifying information and assessing potential risks before a significant transaction. Johnson believes that undertaking is the most arduous part of getting energy infrastructure investment.

“People just want to do these deals as well and as quickly as possible,” Johnson told Technical.ly in an exclusive interview, “and they want to use whatever tools are best available to them to do it.”

Johnson, whose company’s prior funders include Lowercarbon Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, declined to disclose the financial details of the deal and Crux’s valuation.

The Daedaline brand will be subsumed into Crux with no layoffs, he said. Instead, the New York-headquartered startup’s staff is set to grow from its current near-60 headcount to between 80 and 90 employees by the end of 2025.

Crux provides tools for negotiating terms sheets and due diligence in its “data room,” a term for its secure portal for sensitive business documents. Crux relaunched the feature in March for its 1,000 developers and investors using the platform, and jumped from 20% to 80% adoption, per Johnson.

This acquisition does not mean an expansion of products or services, but Johnson hopes Daedaline’s software will make associated procedures faster. Crux was considering developing software similar to the Boston startup’s, and Johnson was drawn to Daedaline’s expertise and staff.

Expected success despite political headwinds

Crux’s first product — a marketplace for financial institutions, clean energy developers and tax credit buyers to sell and transfer tax credits‚— was spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Despite President Donald Trump’s efforts to cancel clean energy projects across the country, including targeting states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Johnson is confident Crux will continue to be successful. The administration has taken specific aim at wind and solar, but is looking to nuclear to address skyrocketing power needs.

The startup also offers more than tax credit-focused tools. Other features focus on debt capital offerings, which can also fund these energy projects.

“The real driver of that market is the fact that electricity prices have gone up, and energy demand is higher than it’s ever been,” said Johnson, who previously worked in the Department of the Treasury during the Biden presidency. “So, a ton of manufacturing infrastructure is still required.”

Economic benefits for streamlined diligence

A typical tax credit transaction can take three-to-12 weeks of diligence, hundreds of hours and thousands in cash, Johnson explained. That’s why this acquisition is important.

“The more we can help [clients] with that process, extract information, deliver insights, support it with context,” Johnson said, “the better decisions they can make the more rapidly.”

The AI software will extract context and key information for users, he said. For example, in deal documents, the technology can provide guidance like recommendations to swap out clauses.

This by no means replaces lawyers, he explained.

“People are still going to do their diligence,” per Johnson. “This is to support that being as efficient and intelligent as possible.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alfred-Johnson-speaking-at-Nasdaq-Sept-22-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:04:57.882736

(October 7th, 2025) — U.S. Congressmen Sean Casten (IL-06) and Mike Levin (CA-49), co-chairs of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) Clean Energy Deployment Task Force, led 163 House Democrats in a letter to Department of Energy (DOE) Secretary Chris Wright condemning the termination of $8 billion of projects that were set to lower electricity costs for Americans and increase grid reliability.

On October 2nd, DOE announced it would terminate 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects, in 136 Congressional districts, including 108 represented by Democrats and 28 represented by Republicans, accounting for approximately $8 billion. The terminated projects were intended to lower energy costs for consumers, improve grid reliability, create jobs, and strengthen the United States' global leadership in energy innovation.

Dear Secretary Wright,

We write to condemn the Department of Energy’s (DOE) termination of 321 financial awards, supporting 223 projects supporting energy resilience across the country. We are deeply concerned about your Department’s attempt to rebrand the elimination of U.S. clean energy as “$7.56 billion in savings” to taxpayers and the potential political motivations behind the targeting of projects in Democratic-leaning states

This decision is a reversal of properly awarded projects that will harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge. This Administration’s decision to play political games will result in genuine harm at a time when millions of American families are already struggling to pay their electricity bills amidst the everrising cost of living. These blatantly partisan cancellations must immediately be reversed.

The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation. Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.

Your press statement claims these projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment.” That is a pretext for cancellations that track political talking points, not facts. Many of these awards had already passed rigorous review, and many of those had already been processed. Companies hired workers, signed contracts, broke ground, and put up private capital in reliance on DOE commitments. Calling that “savings” ignores stranded equipment orders, canceled subcontracts, and layoffs—real costs that ripple through American supply chains. Instead of executing Congress’s direction to build U.S. energy leadership and grid reliability, DOE is moving the goalposts while terminating the very projects that would deliver results.

The consequences of these actions are significant: cancellations will shutter facilities, kill jobs, and stall critical domestic manufacturing. They also inject avoidable uncertainty into energy markets—forcing investors to consider political risks that you have created, which raises financing costs. Terminating grid and manufacturing projects locks in congestion and supplychain bottlenecks, which will lead to higher long-term electricity prices for households and businesses.

We are at a moment of unprecedented growth in electricity demand, which is expected to increase by 25% by 2030. At a time when more energy supply is needed than ever, these cuts will only exacerbate upward pressure on electricity prices by stranding low-cost supply, delaying grid expansion, and increasing reliance on higher-cost imports. In your confirmation hearing, you pledged to pursue “all sources of affordable, reliable energy” to meet these challenges. By terminating awards for cheap energy solutions and those that strengthen the grid, you are going against your word and worsening the very problem you promised to help solve.

Eliminating the Grid Deployment Office and Office of Clean Energy Deployment projects delays transmission and weakens grid resilience, a shortsighted decision that threatens even steeper increasing costs to American consumers and businesses in the future. Additionally, these socalled “savings” waste sunk federal and state dollars and betray disadvantaged communities by erasing critical work to reduce pollution and improve energy affordability.

Fifteen years ago, China generated less electricity than the United States. Today, China generates more than twice as much as we do —and the gap continues to grow. As China and other nations continue to innovate and build the energy technologies of the future, this is precisely the wrong time for the U.S. to back out and cede our technological leadership. The rest of the world will continue to innovate with or without us, and these grant terminations will only set our innovation back at a pivotal time.

It is difficult for us to believe that these project terminations were anything but a partisan targeting of states that are not politically aligned with this Administration. These terminations undermine the spirit of competitive, merit-based awards and throw into question the fairness of the award process under this Administration.

As such, we demand that DOE take the following immediate actions by Tuesday, October 14, 2025:

Suspend all terminations and de-obligations and reinstate the projects.

Provide a complete list of affected awards (office, recipient, state, award number, selection date, federal obligation, non-federal cost share, milestone status) along with the project-specific written justification for termination.

Identify the specific statutory and regulatory authorities relied upon for these mass postaward terminations.

Preserve and provide all Department of Energy records, memoranda, and communications related to the review and termination of these awards, including those resulting from the May 2025 Secretarial memorandum “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance.”

Describe DOE’s process for recipient appeals and dispute resolution, including timelines, decision-makers, and whether interim funding will be permitted to avoid waste while appeals are pending.

Dismantling America’s advanced-energy buildout under the banner of “savings” does not protect taxpayers—it subsidizes our competitors. It means higher bills and fewer American jobs. We will utilize every oversight and legislative tool available to ensure the DOE follows the law, honors congressional intent, and keeps the United States at the forefront of the global energy race.

Sincerely,

This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap, clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.”

District 7 released a statement criticizing the Donald Trump administration’s plan to terminate millions in clean energy infrastructure grants, including one for the Indianapolis International Airport.

According to a news release from Carson’s office, Carson said he was notified that the Federal Aviation Administration is planning to terminate a grant for the Indianapolis airport that would help fund a solar power battery storage facility at the site. The FAA said that the grant did “not align with the (Trump) administration’s priorities.”

The Indianapolis International Airport received federal funds in July 2023 that officials said they would use to construct energy-efficient infrastructure and the installation of solar panels. At the time, airport officials said that the grant was for $22.58 million for the project and “a huge win for the Indy airport, our environment and our community.”

In Carson’s release, he said the Trump administration’s plan is to terminate almost $37 million in clean energy infrastructure plants, including a $6.7 million grant for the airport.

In the statement, Carson said that Trump is “taking money away from Indianapolis to score cheap political points in Washington.” Carson said this is a “blow to the hardworking aviation professionals” at the Indianapolis airport.

“Republicans and Democrats have long supported this project because it is economically viable and environmentally intelligent,” Carson said. “It provides renewable energy to the electric grid, lowers emissions, improves air quality, and lowers the airport’s operating costs… Infrastructure should not be partisan. There are no Democratic or Republican bridges, roads, or airports. Clean solar energy serves everyone, especially through the Indianapolis Airport solar farm.”

According to previous reports, the funding was expected to help fund the first 25% of a multi-phased project to transition the airport terminal’s electricity consumption to renewable energy generated onsite.

In a statement from the Indianapolis International Airport, officials said:

We can confirm that we no longer have the commitment by the federal government of this clean energy grant. The Indianapolis Airport Authority did not receive the dollars associated with this project and had not begun nominal work on it yet. We remain in good financial stability, and, with this news, we are adjusting our priorities for critical infrastructure projects. We continue to be committed to working with the Federal Aviation Administration and our elected officials, like Congressman André Carson, on future funding opportunities when they become available.

The new base Model Y is what Tesla started teasing in social media posts over the weekend, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The cheaper vehicle will lack certain features and use less premium materials to offset the loss of the up to $7,500 federal tax credit that the US stopped offering as of this month, the people said.

Tesla representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment. The company’s posts on X helped send its shares up 5.4% on Monday. The stock has risen 12% this year.

Tesla executives said during the company’s most recent earnings call that while production of a more affordable model started in June, they decided to put off ramping up output until after the US phased out tax credits. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja and Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, were cryptic about what the car will be before Elon Musk let loose.

“It’s the Model Y,” Musk said, joking that he would “let the cat out of the bag.”

“The desire to buy the car is very high, it’s just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it,” Musk continued. “So, the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

Tesla managed to engineer cost out of the Model Y in part by focusing on the battery pack and motor, the people said.

The company announced last week that it delivered 497,099 vehicles worldwide from July through September, a record quarterly total. While the tax credit expiration boosted sales, the pull-forward effect could undermine EV demand in the months to come. Musk himself warned in July that Tesla could be in for “a few rough quarters” after US incentives end.

Indianapolis

With over 22 years of experience in the commercial real estate industry, Michael Weishaar, SIOR, Vice Chair at Cushman & Wakefield’s Indianapolis office, has established himself as a preeminent leader in the industrial sector. His career is marked by significant milestones, unwavering dedication, and a deep commitment to his community—qualities that define a Hall of Fame honoree.

In the past eight years alone, Weishaar and his team have completed nearly 900 leasing and investment sale transactions, totaling over $7 billion in value. Their work spans more than 111.5 million square feet of industrial property, serving some of the most respected names in real estate, third-party logistics, and corporate America, including Prologis, Hines, DRA, Becknell Industrial, Red Rock Developments, and LXP.

Weishaar’s success stems from his passion for the dynamic nature of the industry.

“What I find most enjoyable is the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, big and small,” he said.

For him, the appeal lies in the variety and constant challenge the commercial real estate world offers.

“Every day is different,” Weishaar said, emphasizing the entrepreneurial opportunities that come with the business.

A key turning point in Weishaar’s career was mastering the art of focus.

“Early on, you want to say yes to everything,” he said. “But over time, you learn to delegate and recognize when an opportunity doesn’t align with your expertise.”

This ability to prioritize and streamline efforts has been instrumental in Weishaar’s sustained success.

Balancing professional demands with personal life is another challenge he has navigated throughout his career.

“Real estate is a business without a clock,” Weishaar said.

The shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic further blurred the lines between work and home life. While he acknowledges that achieving the perfect work-life balance is an elusive goal, setting boundaries has been crucial in managing both worlds.

Outside of work, Weishaar is deeply involved in giving back to his community. He has served in leadership roles within his church and the Carmel Dads’ Club, a youth sports program where he coached basketball and baseball. He also serves as an advisor to the Indiana chapter of NAIOP and supports the Lambda Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity at Indiana University. His philanthropic efforts have earned him the Civilian Patriotic Service Award from the U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs for his contributions to the Department of Defense.

Weishaar’s personal life is rooted in family. He enjoys spending time with his wife, Tabatha, and their two children, Landon and Lainey. Together, they explore national parks, embark on ski trips, and relax at their lake house.

“We’re also huge Indiana University basketball and football fans,” he said. “Go Hoosiers!”

Reflecting on his journey, Weishaar credits mentorship as a cornerstone of his career.

“When I started, I told my mentor, Jeff Castell, and leaders like Pat Lindley and John Huguenard, that I’d bring a strong work ethic and a can-do attitude every day, but I’d need their help learning the real estate side of things,” he said.

On Friday the EPA said in a notice that it was withdrawing the delay because the policy wouldn’t create compliance problems for industry after all.
At another U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., a six-month average of emissions of chromium were twice as high as the California standard, EIP said.
U.S. Steel criticized the EPA’s withdrawal of the compliance deadline and said it would consider its next steps.
Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” the company said in a statement.","Public health advocates pushed back when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it planned to delay for two years a requirement that steel companies monitor air quality at the perimeters of their 11 coke plants in Western Pennsylvania and across the country. Two groups sued.

Now, the EPA has reversed course.

The deadline to begin so-called fenceline monitoring for emissions of benzene, chromium and other toxic contaminants, set by the Biden administration, had been in July. On July 8, the Trump EPA extended the deadline until July 2027 in an interim final rule , saying there wasn’t enough time to seek, compile and respond to public comments, potentially forcing some companies into violation.

On Friday the EPA said in a notice that it was withdrawing the delay because the policy wouldn’t create compliance problems for industry after all.

“EPA does not believe that the currently available information supports a conclusion that regulated parties would face significant immediate compliance challenges,” the agency wrote after the nonprofits Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice sued over the matter.

The environmentalists’ lawsuit challenged the rule on the grounds that it deprived people in nearby communities of protection against toxic air pollution. Rather than defend the interim final rule in court, the environmental groups said in a statement, the EPA affirmed its prior finding that coke ovens are fully capable of complying with the rule, “thereby acknowledging that the delay of compliance dates was never needed.”

“We’re glad that EPA recognizes the harm coke oven plants cause to communities and that it is more than reasonable for these facilities to meet emissions standards now,” Adrienne Lee, a senior Earthjustice attorney, said in a statement. “The health and wellbeing of impacted communities should not come at the cost of giving corporate polluters a pass.”

An August report from the Environmental Integrity Project examined preliminary testing the Biden administration required steel and coke plants to conduct. EIP found that emissions of benzene, a carcinogen, from U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works near Pittsburgh were up to eight times higher than a California standard, which the group used as a national benchmark because many states don’t have ambient air-quality standards. At another U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., a six-month average of emissions of chromium were twice as high as the California standard, EIP said.

Two people died and 10 were injured in an explosion at the Clairton plant in August. The facility has been fined more than $10 million by the EPA for environmental violations in the last three years, more than any other plant on a list of 20 surveyed by EIP.

U.S. Steel criticized the EPA’s withdrawal of the compliance deadline and said it would consider its next steps.

“U. S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law, and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts.

Nuclear energy is gaining recognition as a vital solution to meet the world’s increasing electricity needs while supporting the transition to cleaner energy sources. Unlike solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions, nuclear power offers a stable and reliable supply of carbon-free energy throughout the year. The restart of a previously shuttered U.S. nuclear plant underscores the technology’s renewed momentum and the rising investor interest in nuclear energy stocks.

The Nuclear industry is benefiting from the new regulatory reforms, ongoing research and development work, leading to the development of microreactors and small modular reactors. The 24x7 immense clean power requirements from the AI-based new data centers and the reshoring of some industries are creating fresh demand. The government is also working to increase the domestic supply of uranium, a fuel essential to power the nuclear plants.

With this increasing importance, nuclear energy-related stocks, such as BWX Technologies (BWXT), Dominion Energy (D) and Duke Energy (DUK), are becoming attractive investment options. Unlike other clean energy sources affected by intermittency, nuclear power plants provide a consistent and stable energy output, operating around the clock except during planned maintenance intervals.

Demand for clean energy is rising, and as per the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), energy supply from nuclear power is expected to nearly double between 2020 and 2050, helping utilities meet the rising demand for clean energy. The IEA also highlights that while large nuclear reactors will dominate overall power generation, small modular reactors (SMRs) are projected to experience significant expansion.

Compared with other clean energy sources, nuclear power plants use far less land to produce an equivalent amount of clean electricity. Moreover, while all conventional energy sources generate waste, nuclear energy is unique in its systematic and secure management and storage of that waste. Increasing adoption of electric vehicles, rising demand from the power grids and development of large artificial intelligence-powered data centers.

As the production of clean energy is expected to rise from nuclear plants, a continuous supply of high-quality uranium is essential to keep the nuclear units running. Companies like Uranium Energy (UEC) and BHP Group Limited (BHP) produce large volumes of uranium and can benefit from the surging demand from nuclear power plants.

Nuclear Energy stocks have a huge potential in the energy space and can offer significant growth opportunities for investors. Our Nuclear Energy Screen makes it easier for investors to locate high-potential stocks at any given time. Apart from the stocks mentioned above, investors can also explore stocks like The Southern Company (SO) and NextEra Energy (NEE) for further growth in the nuclear energy space.

These advanced systems could be instrumental in helping Dominion Energy meet its environmental objectives by delivering a reliable and clean power supply to support growing electricity demand from sectors like electric vehicles and data-driven industries.

Nuclear energy remains a cornerstone of Dominion Energy’s strategy to deliver power that is dependable, affordable and environmentally responsible. As the company moves toward its goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, nuclear power provides a steady, carbon-free foundation that complements renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. This Zacks Rank #2 company is investing in innovative technologies and is working to ensure a resilient and low-carbon energy system for the future.

Duke Energy operates 11 nuclear units across six sites in North Carolina and South Carolina, collectively capable of producing nearly 10,700 megawatts (MW) of clean electricity. Nuclear power plays a critical role in Duke Energy’s generation mix, accounting for 27.5% of the company’s total electricity output in 2024. It is also the only clean energy source that provides continuous, around-the-clock availability. Duke Energy is also exploring the idea of using SMR technology to produce electricity.

Duke Energy recently received approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate its 2,500 MW Oconee Nuclear Station for another 20 years. The company has also submitted a license renewal application for the 759 MW Robinson Nuclear Plant and intends to pursue subsequent license renewals for all its reactors to ensure continued long-term operation. Duke Energy is also actively pursuing nuclear energy expansion as part of its long-term clean energy strategy, particularly in the Carolinas.

This Zacks Rank #2 company intends to invest $87 billion during the 2025-2029 period to fund the company's generation fleet transition and grid modernization, and expand its zero-carbon generation portfolio.

Legal experts, however, are doubtful that this current lawsuit will have a similar outcome. Recently, the Energy Department canceled an additional $7.5 billion for renewable energy projects, primarily affecting states led by Democrats.

Share issue helps wind developer Ørsted raise $9.35 billion

As the Trump administration continues to shut down renewable and climate-focused projects across the U.S., sustainable companies are feeling the pressure. Danish wind energy company Ørsted has raised 59.56 billion Danish krones ($9.35 billion) in a share issue amid uncertainty surrounding U.S. projects. The price of the shares was 66.6 krones ($10.40), significantly down from the previous day’s 122.35 krones. Rasmus Errboe, the CEO of Ørsted, said, “The rights issue strengthens Orsted’s financial foundation, allowing us to focus on delivering our six offshore wind farms under construction, continue to handle the regulatory uncertainty in the US, and strengthen our position as a market leader in offshore wind.” Corporations can use ESG solutions to navigate shifting geopolitical uncertainties.

Renewable sources generate more energy than coal worldwide

Global think tank Ember released a report Tuesday stating that renewable energy has surpassed coal in energy generation for the first time. This is largely due to the rapid growth of the renewable sector in China and India. According to the report, China increased its solar energy output by 43% and wind power generation by 26%, resulting in a 2% decrease in fossil fuel use. Similarly, India increased its solar energy output by 31% and wind power generation by 29%, resulting in a 3.1% reduction in fossil fuel use. In the first half of 2025, coal supplied 4,896 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy, while renewables exceeded that with 5,072 TWh. Despite this positive growth in renewables around the world, the EU and the U.S. increased coal generation by 1.1% and 17%, respectively.

NiSource Investment Narrative Recap

To be a NiSource shareholder, you need to believe in the company’s ability to capture accelerating electricity demand, particularly from large data center clients, while maintaining regulatory support to fund major capital investments. The approval of GenCo’s declination petition directly addresses a key short-term catalyst by unlocking a pathway to meet new load growth, though the risk of high capital expenditure still looms and could influence margins and future dividends. For now, the regulatory win may help support near-term outlook, but won’t eliminate longer-term headwinds around future gas demand or leverage.

Among recent announcements, the steady quarterly dividend declaration, US$0.28 per share in August, stands out because dividend sustainability is closely tied to cost management and regulatory clarity, both of which GenCo’s approval is designed to reinforce. How effectively GenCo delivers on its “financial stability” pillar will directly impact free cash flow and NiSource’s ability to balance growth investments with investor returns. In contrast, investors should be aware that substantial capital needs for GenCo and grid modernization may still constrain...

NiSource's outlook anticipates $6.8 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion in earnings by 2028. This projection is based on a 3.5% annual revenue growth rate and represents an increase of $215.4 million in earnings from the current $884.6 million.

Though the EPA plans to defend the CERCLA Rule to provide more regulatory certainty, the EPA intends to develop a CERCLA Section 102(a) Framework Rule governing future CERCLA hazardous substance designations.
First, the EPA plans on finalizing the following actions: Listing of Specific PFAS as Hazardous Constituents Under RCRA.
Next, the EPA plans to clarify the following actions: PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Rulemaking.
Finally, the EPA is spearheading the following new actions: PFAS Requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Applications.","As the Trump Administration rolls back Biden-era regulations, all eyes have been on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as it determines if and how it will enforce the Biden Administration's regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The Trump Administration has offered insight into its direction through responses to ongoing litigation against the rules. (See previous Holland & Knight alert, ""The PFAS Drinking Water Rule Under the Second Trump Administration,"" April 16, 2025.)

Now, the EPA has released their most definitive guidance to date with the announcement that it will retain the Biden-era designation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund).

The EPA's broader regulatory trajectory is detailed in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) recently released Unified Regulatory Agenda, which outlines seven upcoming PFAS-related actions at varying stages in the rulemaking process and utilizes a broad range of legislative authorities. These actions span multiple environmental statutes, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and Clean Water Act (CWA). The rulemakings provide further insight into the Trump Administration's trajectory on PFAS regulations.

CERCLA Designation

The EPA announced on Sept. 17, 2025, that it would retain the Biden-era designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA with the intention of ""holding polluters accountable"" for cleanup costs. The EPA has opted to defend the Biden EPA's final rule in ongoing litigation. In tandem with their announcement, the EPA submitted an unopposed motion to lift the ongoing abeyance, as the agency has completed its review of the rule and made a decision to keep it in place, which was allowed on Oct. 2, 2025, and set a deadline of Dec. 5, 2025, for final briefs.

Though the EPA plans to defend the CERCLA Rule to provide more regulatory certainty, the EPA intends to develop a CERCLA Section 102(a) Framework Rule governing future CERCLA hazardous substance designations. This rule will instill a uniform approach to designations and require the EPA to consider the costs of proposed designations. In addition to this regulatory fix, the EPA called on Congress to take further action to protect passive receivers from liability through statutory action guided by technical assistance from the EPA. At least one bill has been introduced that would provide liability protection for water utilities. The prospects for legislative relief for other large categories of passive receivers – such as farmers who apply biosolids – remain unclear.

Regulatory Unified Agenda

Earlier in September 2025, the OMB released its biannual Regulatory Unified Agenda. This agenda provides insight into the Trump Administration's upcoming regulatory activities, including a timeline for their release, and revealing a coordinated, multi-statute strategy to require reporting and/or limit PFAS discharges under CWA, RCRA, TSCA and SDWA.

The Regulatory Unified Agenda features seven upcoming PFAS actions, many of which finalize or clarify actions initiated during the Biden Administration, but the EPA also includes two new actions to further regulate PFAS.

First, the EPA plans on finalizing the following actions:

Listing of Specific PFAS as Hazardous Constituents Under RCRA. In April 2026, the EPA plans to finalize the proposed rule designating nine PFAS compounds, their salts and structural isomers to the list of hazardous constituents under RCRA. This will require corrective action for releases of these substances. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Proposes RCRA Corrective Action Expansions Targeting PFAS,"" Feb. 14, 2024.) The EPA did not hint at any potential revisions of the rule, only stating it is considering public comments as it develops the final version of the rule. EPA also plans to finalize (potentially at the same time as this listing) its proposed rule clarifying that RCRA's statutory definition of ""hazardous waste"" applies to corrective actions at solid waste management units. As a practical matter, this clarification would apply RCRA's corrective action authorities not only to PFAS chemicals listed as hazardous constituents but to any PFAS chemical that meets the broader statutory definition of ""hazardous waste.""

Addition of Certain PFAS to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). In February 2026, the EPA plans to finalize a rule to add individual PFAS and PFAS categories to the TRI and finalize the criteria needed for PFAS to be automatically added to the TRI. In the meantime, the EPA announced on Oct. 7, 2025, the addition of the chemical perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS-Na) to the list of substances subject to TRI reporting, bringing the total number of PFAS subject to TRI reporting to 206.

Clarification to Supplier Notification Provision Due to Automatic Additions of PFAS to the TRI. In November 2025, the EPA plans to finalize edits to the TRI guidelines to align supplier notification provisions with the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act's (NDAA) requirement for the EPA to annually add new PFAS compounds to the TRI. These revisions would explicitly require covered suppliers to notify customers receiving products containing chemicals newly added to the TRI, namely PFAS compounds, of their presence as soon as these compounds are added to the list on Jan. 1 of each year. In practice, this means suppliers will be required to notify customers of the presence of these compounds as early as the first shipment of each calendar year.

Next, the EPA plans to clarify the following actions:

PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Rulemaking. In October 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rule to extend the deadline for public water systems to comply with the April 2024 National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) setting Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFAS. Additionally, this action will solidify the revisions announced in May 2025, which would narrow the regulation to only applying to PFOS and PFOA. This revision eliminates perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) (commonly known as GenX), along with the Hazard Index mixture of these three PFAS plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), from the original reporting and mitigation requirements. This revision significantly reduces the number of PFAS compounds subject to monitoring and mitigation, potentially easing compliance burdens for public water systems.

PFAS Data Reporting and Recordkeeping under TSCA. In December 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rule to revise an October 2023 final rule requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS to report data about their usage of such substances between 2011 and 2022 under TSCA. The upcoming action, which is currently undergoing interagency review, is likely to create exemptions for certain uses and modify the scope of reporting. Based on previous EPA actions to extend the data submission deadline for manufacturers granting further leniency for small manufacturers reporting as article importers, it is likely that the EPA will create exemptions for these importers. The EPA has also opened additional opportunities for public comment on the October 2023 action, stressing a need for critical feedback on data collection software and desired guidance. Manufacturers and importers should monitor this rulemaking closely, particularly if they qualify as small entities or import PFAS-containing articles, as exemptions may reduce reporting obligations.

Finally, the EPA is spearheading the following new actions:

PFAS Requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Applications. In November 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rulemaking to update NPDES to require permit applications to include monitoring and reporting for PFAS discharges. Facilities in the plastics, chemical and synthetic fiber sectors should prepare for expanded monitoring and discharge limitations under these forthcoming rules.

PFAS Requirements in Effluent Limitation Guidelines. Following through on Effluent Guidelines Plan 15, in January 2026, the EPA plans to propose a rulemaking to revise the Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards to address PFAS discharges from manufacturing facilities.

Next Steps

The fate of other recent PFAS-related EPA actions – including the proposed 2026 Multi-Sector General Permit (which included PFAS monitoring requirements for certain sectors), draft recommended ambient water quality criteria for PFOA, PFOS and PFBS, and draft risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS in biosolids – remain unclear.

Industries across the supply chain should anticipate heightened scrutiny as EPA advances rulemakings that will expand monitoring, reporting and corrective action requirements for PFAS, particularly in manufacturing, water treatment and waste management sectors. Regulatory uncertainty persists around several key federal initiatives, including PFAS-related permit requirements and biosolids risk assessments. Moreover, states continue to promulgate PFAS measures of their own, adding to this uncertainty.

Enova stated that it has revised its requirements to open funding for ammonia- and hydrogen-propulsion retrofit projects. The maritime industry is crucial to the global economy as 90% of the world’s goods are transported by sea.

The Viking nation has plans to completely revolutionize the maritime industry

The maritime sector plays an integral role in the global supply chain. Nearly every sector in the world relies on the vast shipping industry to transport goods to every corner of the planet.

Taking that into account, the large shipping vessels that transport our goods use massive amounts of fuel, and as such, produce vast amounts of harmful greenhouse gases. So it became evidently clear that something had to be done to shift the maritime industry towards the growing renewable energy sector.

Norwegian state-owned Enova has delivered a potential solution to the problem. It recently announced that, from next year, existing vessels scheduled for retrofits with ammonia or hydrogen-capable primary propulsion will be eligible for funding. Even those who do not operate the fuel continuously will be eligible for financial support.

“The changes give more people the opportunity to seek support, Even vessels with a shorter lifespan can help cut emissions and build experience,” – Norwegian state-owned company, Enova

Enova has awarded approximately $75.5 million to projects developing hydrogen and ammonia-powered vessels

The move underscores the importance of transitioning the maritime sector to renewable energy usage. The reports coming out of Norway state that four companies that intend to construct hydrogen-powered ships will receive a total of $50.5 million, while the remaining $25 million is reserved for the construction of two ammonia-powered ships.

As part of the revision of the scheme, the greenhouse gas emission reduction quota required for new technology projects has been lowered from 100% to 55%. Additionally, Enova also stated that it has extended the application deadline for funding to build ammonia bunkering infrastructure along the Norwegian coast. In order to qualify, projects must include ammonia storage and refuelling facilities.

“The purpose of the program is to ensure that the bunkering facilities are realised in time for the first vessels to enter the water, probably during 2027,” – Enova

As the cooperative nature of the hydrogen sector fosters new and amazing alliances that have the potential to completely change the landscape of the renewable energy sector in Europe, the move by Enova has been welcomed by industry insiders.

“The technology is still new. Now we will support the industry in building experience. If we are going to succeed in cutting emissions from ocean transportation, we need to go for solutions that can grow in scale towards 2050.” – Nils Kristian Nakstad, Managing Director of Enova

U.S. sales of electric vehicles topped 1.3 million units in 2024, a 7.3% year-over-year increase, Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book said in a Jan. 13 press release.

Q4 sales set a best-ever quarterly sales mark with 365,824 units sold, a 15.2% YoY improvement, according to the release. Sales benefited from strong automaker incentives and leasing deals, as well as federal and state programs.

Cox Automotive’s report coincides with automakers’ Q4 sales numbers, with many reporting record-breaking domestic sales aided by surging demand for EVs.

While it’s been suggested that the incoming Trump administration may end EV tax credits, which could slow sales growth, Cox Automotive said it would take time for any changes to take effect and the possibility of lost incentives may boost sales in the short term.

With improving charging infrastructure and 15 additional EV models entering the market, sales growth is expected to continue in 2025 with EVs projected to represent nearly 10% of all U.S. vehicle sales this year, Cox Automotive said.

A slew of new EVs, including those from General Motors and Honda Motor Co., which together sold nearly 80,000 more EVs in 2024 than in 2023, provided a boost to last year’s sales, Cox Automotive said. Hyundai Motor Group and Ford Motor Co. also reported increased EV sales last year.

By volume, Tesla sales were estimated to be lower YoY by more than 37,000 units, which was roughly the volume GM added, Cox Automotive reported. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz also posted lower volumes in 2024 compared to 2023.

Cox Automotive said the U.S. EV market is comparably competitive to China and Europe. Of the 68 mainstream EV models tracked by Kelley Blue Book, 24 models saw YoY sales increases; 17 models were new to the market; and 27 decreased in volume, which included discontinued models such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Mazda MX-30.

The Tesla Model Y and Model 3 reigned as the two best-selling EVs in the U.S., though both aging models saw notable sales declines, Cox Automotive said. However, the Model Y and Model 3 still accounted for more than 40% of all EVs sold last year.

“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost,” the plaintiffs argued.

Dive Insight:

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs are solar installation companies Sunpath Solar and EIS Solar, nonprofits Solar United Neighbors and Black Sun Light Sustainability, environmental consultancy 2KB Energy Services, trade union Rhode Island AFL-CIO, the nonprofit Rhode Island Center for Justice, and Anh Nguyen, a member of Georgia BRIGHT’s Solar for All advisory board.

“Plaintiffs are not direct grantees under the Solar for All program, but rather they are its intended beneficiaries,” the lawsuit said. “They are a labor organization, an individual homeowner seeking access to solar energy to reduce costs, nonprofit organizations dedicated to assisting low-income families with affordable energy, and solar consultants and installers.”

The eight plaintiffs “should have benefited directly from the Solar for All program’s provision of new sources of energy throughout the nation and its electricity cost savings,” according to the lawsuit.

In an August statement posted on YouTube, Zeldin referred to Solar for All as a slush fund and said there was “massive dilution” of the program’s funding disbursements, “as many grants go through pass through after pass through after pass through after pass through, with all of the middlemen taking their own cut.”

An April 2024 announcement from the Biden administration said the program was intended to “deliver residential solar projects to over 900,000 households nationwide” by “[providing] funds to states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits across the country to develop long-lasting solar programs that enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy and benefit from distributed residential solar.”

The plaintiffs argue that the executive branch didn’t have the statutory authority to rescind the $7 billion in funding, even after Congress “repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund” in July, as it “did not repeal the Solar for All program retroactively.”

“Congress rescinded only ‘unobligated balances,’ which preserved all $7 billion of the obligated funding EPA already had awarded through its Solar for All grants,” the lawsuit said. “Instead of distributing the Solar for All funds as Congress directed, Defendants hastily and unlawfully terminated the Solar for All program,” an action the plaintiffs allege was illegal.

The plaintiffs said they are seeking an order “declaring the termination of the Solar for All program unlawful, setting it aside, and requiring Defendants to restore the program.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/qh6GL3DCArNzaWBVv6Ac1vAS5otgMC4-deJgdpsomMc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9yZXNpZGVudGlhbF9zb2xhci5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:11.019974

Coalitions of large energy users and environmental groups on Monday urged federal regulators to reject the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s proposal for paying for a coal-fired power plant that the U.S. Department of Energy ordered to run past its retirement date.

The issue centers on the 1,560-MW, coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan.

In late May, DOE said MISO faces an “energy emergency” and ordered the owners of the power plant to run it past a planned May 31 shutdown. DOE issued a second 90-day emergency order for the power plant that keeps it online until Nov. 19, with additional extensions possible.

Under the Federal Power Act, DOE can order power plants to operate for 90 days during emergencies. Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of groups, led by the Sierra Club and Earthjustice, have challenged the DOE order in court, saying there isn’t an emergency in the Midcontinent grid operator’s footprint.

In August, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved MISO’s preliminary outline for the Campbell power plant’s owners — Consumers Energy, Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative and the Michigan Public Power Agency — to recover their costs to comply with DOE’s orders.

Now, FERC is weighing the plan itself. The power plant’s owners haven’t asked to recover costs yet.

However, MISO’s cost recovery plan fails to meet the ratemaking principle that parties pay for the costs that they cause, according to filings at FERC.

FERC directed MISO to allocate the power plant’s costs across its central and northern zones on a demand basis, but the grid operator proposed recouping them on an energy basis, according to a coalition that is comprised of the Coalition of MISO Transmission Customers, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, the Midwest Large Energy Consumers and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers.

“Given that the Campbell units are being retained for capacity and resource adequacy purposes under the DOE Order, using an energy based load ratio share instead of a demand based load share deviates from cost causation principles and therefore, is unjust and unreasonable,” the groups said.

They pointed out that FERC has already approved a demand-based cost allocation method for a different plant — Constellation Energy’s Eddystone units in Pennsylvania, which also faces DOE emergency orders.

A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, filed a separate, more expansive challenge to MISO’s cost allocation plan.

The plan recovers costs from utilities across MISO’s northern and central zones — as FERC said it could do — instead of just from Michigan, the Environmental Law & Policy Center, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sustainable FERC Project said.

The DOE order and FERC’s approval of MISO’s cost recovery methodology failed to identify any evidence that utilities or ratepayers in MISO zones 1 through 7 will benefit from Campbell’s continued operation, according to the groups.

“Instead, the commission order relied wholly on the DOE’s unlawful emergency declaration both to determine the scope of cost allocation and as the sole basis for the conclusion that an emergency exists in Zones 1-7,” they said.

Also, MISO’s compliance filing goes beyond FERC’s order by establishing a permanent cost allocation provision that will apply to any future DOE orders affecting the Campbell facility, the groups said.

“While the commission order contemplates extensions of [the] DOE order, it did not give blanket approval to an allocation method where the scope of the … emergency and resulting beneficiaries no longer align with that allocation,” the groups said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aKadooqNDIUJRstwLymSNpanSKKMx30aXe93HMTQhB0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DTVNXZXN0T2xpdmVDYW1wYmVsbDA0MjAyMDE3LTEwNi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:06:40.041251

NYSEG presented the New York Public Service Commission with its ""Powering New York"" proposal in June, including plans to increase customer rates.

Starting May 1, 2026, the proposed increase could mean residential customers using about 600 kilowatt-hours would pay an additional $33.12. Commercial customers using 3,650 kilowatt-hours a month with a 25-kilowatt monthly demand could see an overall $155.37 bill increase. A total 10.9% bill increase for industrial customers could add $8,679.98.

Residential gas customers using 83 therms — the unit of measure for heat energy — could see $33.57 added to their overall bill that year.

NYSEG and RG&E Director of New York Communications Shelby Cohen said the rate increases cover needed upgrades.

Webb joined Assemblywoman Donna Lupardo and the Public Utility Law Project of NY Executive Director and General Counsel Laurie Wheelock on Oct. 1 to encourage residents to voice their concerns for the proposed rate increases at upcoming in-person and virtual hearings in the Southern Tier.

""People aren't just confused and concerned, they're worried,"" Lupardo said. ""They're worried about being able to keep their lights on. They're worried about what it means for their families. They're worried about what it means for them to stay housed.""

How NYSEG will use additional funds

Cohen said the ""Powering New York"" proposal would create 1,100 jobs across New York, including the recruitment of line workers she said would aid in storm costs and limit the use of outside contractors.

The more in-house line workers ""will eventually make storm cost decrease and lower cost in the future for our customers,"" she said.

NYSEG is also targeting investment in areas including energy demand, upgrading aging infrastructure and systems for reliability and customer service, storm/vegetation management expenses, wage requirements, federal and state pipeline safety mandates, and clean energy goals.

As part of addressing the energy demand and aging infrastructure, new transformers have to be made — the custom equipment takes four years to build. The ""skyrocketing"" energy demand, Cohen said, is being seen across the state and requires a grid expansion to keep up with the growing economic development.

In 2022, NYSEG received eight new power requests for the whole division in the Catskills. By 2024, that number jumped to 49 requests, which the company did not anticipate in its last rate case.

""There's a ton of new businesses coming. We've got to upgrade our infrastructure to serve them,"" Cohen said. ""The existing substations serving these areas can't handle that much more power running through them.""

What to know about rate approval process

Cohen said the data included in the proposal supports a five-year plan. In previous years, the multi-year agreement spanned three years, and was switched to five years for better planning.

""We have proposed a multi-year agreement so that we can spread the increases out over multiple years,"" Cohen said.

For example, a NYSEG customer could see the $33.12 applied to their bill in divided, monthly increments instead of one lump-sum fee.

The 11-month rate case process began in July. As of Oct. 1, the company is still in the negotiating stage. The PSC will decide whether the agreement will be approved for a one- or multi-year plan.

At the Oct. 1 event, Webb described the findings from audits and investigations conducted by the PSC as ""very challenging.""

An audit released in May 2025 found 128 corrective actions for NYSEG to address, including cost allocation simplification, revision of the Cost Allocation Manual, a third-party review of individual CEO metrics, new cybersecurity systems, implementation of an asset management system and upgrading customer service operations.

""We are saying NYSEG must get their house in order before asking for another rate hike that our constituents quite frankly can't afford, nor should flip the bill for,"" Webb said.

Oct. 8: 1, 6 p.m. Ithaca Town Hall, 215 Tioga St., Ithaca.

Electric Era helps C-stores and gas stations secure NEVI funding; adds Love's Travel Stops to list of customers.

Electric Era's path to growth is fueled by their patented battery-backed DC chargers that reduce operating costs up to 70% and cutting installation times from years to months. They've also leveraged their 98%+ guaranteed per-port uptime and start-to-finish project support to help their customers win 83% of the grant applications they've applied for over the past two years – for a total of $41 million worth of incentives.

With federal NEVI funding restored, available state and federal funding programs can cover up to half of charger deployment costs, allowing some retailers to reach positive ROI in less than two years from charging alone. Beyond selling electrons, however, Electric Era's customer-branded chargers with retail program integration add an entirely new revenue stream by turning EV charging into store revenue drivers.

Love's Travel Stops Chooses Electric Era

Love's Travel Stops recently commissioned an Electric Era charging station for their newest location in Buena Vista, Co. along U.S. Highway 24, which serves as a rural connector between Denver and Colorado Springs.

The deployment marks the 38th EV charging location for Love's, which now has more than 150 EV chargers across 15 states while offering refueling customers a wide range of food and beverages, along with Love's in-store Mobile-to-Go Zone, which retails consumer electronics accessories.

""As part of our commitment to sustainability, we're proud to bring this location online as we continue to bring more clean energy solutions to communities across Colorado,"" said Ryan Erickson, vice president of Love's Alternative Energy. ""This new location offers a seamless charging experience for travelers with weather protective canopies, and a variety of fresh food options and clean restrooms.""

Love's secured grant funding from the Colorado Energy Office Direct Current Fast-Charging Plazas program, which leverages both federal NEVI and Colorado state funding to deploy public DC fast charging systems in strategic and underserved areas.

The four-stall, 200 kW chargers are wrapped in Love's signature yellow and red heart brand graphics, feature both CCS1 (Combined Charging System) and NACS (North American Charging Standard) cables.

While lower total cost of ownership (TCO) was Love's initial driver, the long-term upside was compelling. Electric Era's retailer‑focused platform – with integrated brand experiences and loyalty program support – offers Love's the chance to not just break even faster, but to grow store traffic and non-fuel revenues.

""We work with a lot of customers who come to us with a variety of incentive options and business cases that strictly look at the cap-ex and op-ex in relation to the revenue from selling electrons, which is where we started at with Love's,"" said Electric Era Sr. Manager of Enterprise Sales, Brittany Kaplan.

""The best part of this engagement was helping Love's build a broader marketing and loyalty program that accelerates their revenue past break even, and sets them up to generate stronger returns for the long haul.""

Electric Era Full-Service Revenue Growth Experts

Electric Era's founder, Quincy Lee, a former SpaceX engineer, has leveraged innovation and first principles engineering to break down the barriers holding back the rapid growth of public EV charging in America. He recognized deployment complexity as a barrier holding back rapid adoption of EV charging, so he created an in-house deployment team to ""cut red tape"" on behalf of their retail customers.

His team includes project managers and engineers, government/sustainability experts and site selection specialists to help public and private entities navigate the maze of permits, regulations – plus state and federal funding programs, where applicable – to help manage the various stakeholders and applicants optimize incentive opportunities.

With $5 billion in federal NEVI funding restored with a greater emphasis on time-to-deployment, reliability and a focus on traditional refueling locations, more convenience store and fuel retailers are expected to take another look at EV charging to grow revenues today and future proof their businesses against a changing marketplace.

""Despite being grant agnostic, we've had a lot of success helping our customers who wanted to go the incentive route. Now that NEVI is back, we expect more companies like Love's to take a second look at EV charging to grow their businesses,"" Kaplan said. ""Fortunately for us, our solution and business model are aligned with the incentive program requirements for those looking to future proof their businesses.""

Without adequate insurance coverage, however, operators could lose their Oil Spill Financial Responsibility certification and be forced to suspend offshore operations.","(The Center Square) − Dismissal of offshore oil and gas policy litigation contradictory to the Trump administration’s goals are being sought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.

She’s made the request to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

In a letter sent Sept. 24, Murrill said the Department of Justice’s litigation under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has destabilized the insurance market that underpins offshore energy operations and placed Louisiana jobs and production at risk.

“The DOJ filed the lawsuit in question during the waning days of the Biden Administration and have directly harmed the Louisiana energy industry,” Murrill wrote. “The novel position taken by the DOJ is fundamentally contrary to well-settled insurance law and reverses decades of accepted, lawful interpretation and application of insurance policy coverage.”

At the center of the dispute is a lawsuit filed in 2024 that seeks to recover insurance payments related to the 2004 Taylor Energy spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Justice Department says multiple years of insurance coverage may apply to the long-running spill – an interpretation Murrill say upends long-standing industry norms.

According to the letter, the Biden administration’s reinterpretation of the term “incident” under OPA 90 could expose insurers to liability for policies that weren’t even in effect at the time of Hurricane Ivan, the storm that caused the original damage. Murrill warned the move has already prompted insurers to withdraw from the Oil Spill Financial Responsibility market or raise premiums to unsustainable levels.

Murrill emphasized Louisiana’s role as “the epicenter of America’s offshore oil and gas industry,” noting the sector supports more than 100,000 jobs and thousands of small businesses across the state. Production from the gulf has averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day, she said, and could increase with new high-tech projects coming online.

Without adequate insurance coverage, however, operators could lose their Oil Spill Financial Responsibility certification and be forced to suspend offshore operations. Murrill warned such an outcome would “result in job losses in Louisiana, energy market disruptions, and increased liability for the federal government.”

The letter invokes Trump’s January executive order directing federal agencies to encourage exploration and production on federal lands and waters. It also requires the Department of Justice to identify and address court actions inconsistent with the policy.

“Given the direct negative impacts on American energy dominance, we have been optimistic – and presumed – the DOJ would abandon its litigation and dismiss its lawsuits,” she wrote. “Louisiana continues to play a leadership role in driving the country forward with the infrastructure and investments to grow energy production consistent with the vision of President Trump.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/51/351bdf7d-db56-4ca1-99ae-505f247e385e/68d5cd74a892f.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 12:09:38.640808

The news coincides with a White House-imposed pressure campaign for Democratic members of Congress to stop the federal government shutdown. The energy cuts are part of a larger $26 billion funding freeze announced Oct. 1.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a Oct. 2 post on X that the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub “will create a clean hydrogen economy across our region.

“It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,” the Democrat continued. “We’re working with the Attorney General’s Office to fight this illegal action.”

McClatchy has reached out to the DOE and Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub for comment.

The state Office of the Attorney General is “absolutely considering our legal options here,” said spokesperson Mike Faulk. He said the latest news is emblematic of the Trump administration’s disregard for the rule of law.

“It also reflects their economic illiteracy with regard to energy production and unapologetic denial of the robust evidence that shows greenhouse gases are unsustainable for our planet,” Faulk continued. “Abundant renewable energy is key to economic growth as well as environmental protection.” WA Democrats blast Trump over canceled energy funding

U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat, noted in a Oct. 2 news release that the DOE yanked funding for 11 Washington energy and manufacturing projects, including the hydrogen hub.

DelBene slammed the president for going after states that didn’t vote for him.

“President Trump’s campaign of political retribution continues, and hardworking Washingtonians are now part of the collateral damage,” DelBene said. “This politically motivated claw back of funds will result in significant job losses and increased utility bills in our state.”

Russell Vought, chief of the Office of Management and Budget, teased DOE’s nearly $8 billion in cuts in a Oct. 1 post on X. The Trump ally listed states set to lose federal dollars for “Green New Scam” projects — all of which voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

This isn’t the first time that Trump and company have been accused of going after blue states. Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called out the administration in May over its plan to revoke hundreds of millions of dollars in construction-project funding in blue states.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that President Donald Trump has vowed to safeguard taxpayer money and expand the country’s supply of secure, affordable and dependable energy.

“Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Wright continued. “Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The DOE has said it would unravel 321 financial awards bolstering 223 projects.

U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier, a Washington Democrat, called the Trump administration’s decision to gut the $1 billion earmarked for the Pacific Northwest hub “senseless.”

She railed against the move as a “politically motivated attack” on a bipartisan project expected to generate billions of dollars in economy-strengthening investments and create thousands of good-wage jobs.

“At a time when rising prices are already squeezing families across the country, this action hits Washington consumers hard by increasing utility bills and kneecapping U.S. competitiveness in the global energy race,” she said in the Oct. 2 statement.

Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, has also previously praised the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which he said would create high-quality jobs in his state.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom blasted the Trump administration for nixing $1.2 billion meant for the hydrogen hub in California.

“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Newsom said in a statement.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/themes/columbian2/static/img/og/default-2022.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:40.048353

However, policies supporting critical minerals value chains are largely bipartisan, evidenced by the administration's expansion of financings begun during the Biden administration.
The administration's approach has therefore fused security and geopolitical interests with critical minerals policy domestically, and abroad to secure investment and supply.","In nine months, the Trump administration's policy of energy dominance has reshaped the competitive landscape for the mining & metals sector in the US and beyond. American policy has pivoted from a focus on tax credits for critical minerals projects and preferences built around free trade agreements to a focus on expanding domestic mined and refined supply. Among other things, US government-backed financing aligned to geopolitical priorities is to be used to secure supply in the US and abroad.

While projects can take years, even decades, to move from exploration to production, the administration's supportive approach to the industry shows promise in moving capital toward miners and processors. But partial shutdowns during the US government budget impasse are pushing out the window in which projects can secure permissions and financing. Even if the shutdown is short-lived, mining projects need to plan for a window that may shut within 12 to 24 months, after which renewed political uncertainty could stymie further progress. If a project isn't shovel-ready, miners and processors must get it ready as fast as possible, before this window closes.

The administration's approach can be divided into three buckets. First, the use of administrative interventions such as deregulation, accelerated permitting processes and the executive authority invested in the National Energy Dominance Council to direct all-of-government efforts to accelerate project development; second, the use of existing funding authorities and offtake powers delegated to the Department of Defense and other federal bodies to finance and support projects deemed critical to national security; and third, the application of tariffs and negotiation of investment agreements linked to geopolitical and diplomatic initiatives, namely the critical minerals investment agreement with the Ukrainian government, a peace deal between the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, a memorandum of cooperation regarding critical minerals with Saudi Arabia, and an agreement to co-invest into critical minerals value chains with the UAE.

Taken together, the current policy mix is a more supportive environment for investment into the mining & metals value chain in the US or in partnership with US allies elsewhere. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is supportive in the near-term, allowing companies building manufacturing projects before 2029 to deduct 100 percent of the eligible property's cost in its first year of operations as long as it's in service before January 1, 2031. On paper, this should support greenfield processing, refining and smelting projects in the US. However, potential constraints on labor, a more inflationary economic environment, and uncertainty over investment, the cost of capital and economic growth may challenge projects, especially those dependent on private sector demand instead of publicly backed offtake support.

Racing for critical mineral dominance

Seeking to onshore the extraction and/or processing of those critical minerals vital to national security, manufacturing and tech giants undertaking huge AI-driven investment into datacenters and associated utilities, the administration has launched a dramatic reform effort to accelerate permitting. Begun with the Unleashing American Energy executive order (EO) on January 20, 2025 and continued with additional EOs since, the administration's highest priority has been reducing the immensely long, arduous lead times to receive permission to build mines. Additionally, the administration has also designated copper a critical mineral, extending access to policy support.

The National Energy Dominance Council formed in February 2025, a cabinet-level coordinating body chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, is explicitly tasked with improving permitting and accelerating projects deemed vital for national security. Acting on its mandate, the Council's deliberations and parallel action from the White House rescinded existing regulatory burdens imposed by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) on June 30, 2025. The EO delegates more authority to each department to narrowly apply the law for NEPA reviews, impose review page limits, and eases the process of establishing exclusions from the review process. These regulatory rollbacks potentially come at the expense of environmental outcomes, a legitimate cause for concern that poses legal risks after the Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron Deference doctrine.

Existing projects stuck in limbo have benefited from designation under FAST-41, a federal designation for projects to accelerate decisions on outstanding permit applications. The largest project among them—the Rio Tinto–led Resolution Copper in Arizona—received an expedited environmental impact statement and decision from the US Forest Service in June. Resolution Copper could provide up to 400,000 tons of copper production, equivalent to approximately 25 percent of US demand and enough to significantly reduce dependence on refined copper imports as smelting and refining capacity comes online. Resolution Copper still faces a legal injunction on a necessary land swap to build the mine, but the federal government continues to support a faster development timeline.

Please see the list of the FAST-41 Transparency Projects here.

With or without FAST-41 status, copper, rare earths, uranium and gold projects are the likeliest to benefit most in the near term. Persistent fears of large copper concentrates deficits after 2030 dovetail with greater demand growth linked to electrification. China's export controls on light and heavy rare earths have left defense and automotive manufacturers exposed to supply chain concentration. A significant expansion of domestic uranium mining and processing similarly would support the administration's efforts to kickstart a nuclear power renaissance.

Designation for faster review doesn't guarantee success. The administration is blocking the development of Northern Dynasty's Pebble Mine project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of the world's largest undeveloped gold and copper prospects, fearing environmental impacts on the Bay's salmon fisheries. As officials begin reviewing projects with significant environmental impacts—Orla Mining's Dark Star Mine near Elko, Nevada is the first open-pit mine receiving an accelerated review—market participants will learn more about the relative importance assigned to local concerns.

Despite some uncertainty about degree, there is a definitive change and expansion of what's considered a permissible tradeoff between development, environmental concerns and national needs. Newfound support for research, exploration and international leadership for offshore deep sea mining projects highlights this shift, though the lack of an established regulatory framework remains troublesome.

Show me the money

Alongside aggressive coordination efforts fast-tracking permissions, policymakers are expanding support for strategically important projects. The Department of Energy's loan program office is having its remit expanded to include traditional fossil fuel infrastructure, while backing away from its past mandate to lend to projects aiding emissions reduction like battery gigafactories requiring lithium and other metals offtakes. Make More in America (MMIA) supports a broad range of U.S. manufacturing and production projects that strengthen American competitiveness. While EXIM financing has included projects in the critical minerals sector, with environmental statements posted for mining projects, MMIA is not limited to mining. It is important to note that MMIA applies only to domestic U.S. projects. Separately, EXIM provides international export financing through its traditional programs under a distinct statutory framework. Additional lending authorities through the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of War have become a vehicle to secure critical minerals value chains.

The concentration of rare earths mining and refining in China poses significant national security risks exposed by China's implementation of export license controls on a widening array of rare earths and battery metals since 2023. In the spring, western OEMs and defense manufacturers panicked over any sudden halt to trade flows from a lack of large inventories. But breaking into the mining and processing of rare earths has been notoriously difficult because of the low price points at which Chinese producers can operate and their advantages from existing economies of scale.

By considering equity stakes and supporting profitability through price interventions, the administration is prioritizing onshoring production of key inputs, particularly for existing brownfield assets. Current policy also aims to leverage the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).

By taking on equity and guaranteeing profitability through price interventions, the administration is prioritizing onshoring production of key inputs where possible with greater influence over investment decisions. Taking equity positions in exchange for financial support has become a vote of confidence for investors and an implicit promise of support when market conditions deteriorate. DFC has in place commitments to support the Lobito Corridor, a rail route linking the Angolan port to the Copperbelt in the DRC and Zambia. In September, the agency announced a US$75 million equity commitment to seed the US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that will provide seed capital to jumpstart the fund's investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons and related infrastructure in Ukraine. Other initiatives to combine the DFC's efforts with private funding, in some cases, and sovereign wealth, in others, may be explored with a particular focus on investments in critical minerals. A significant increase in the DFC's investment capacity is also under consideration in a congressional reauthorization hoping to take place in November 2025. But with many staff of both DFC and EXIM currently furloughed and both looking for congressional reauthorization in the coming months, a speedy resolution to the budget impasse may be critical for them to maintain momentum to finance mining projects during the window described above.

Carrots and sticks

Trade policy has expanded into an instrument organizing industrial policy through a broad array of carrots and sticks. Since 2018, tariffs have been featured as a tool to protect domestic steel and aluminum production under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The Trump administration expanded the use of Section 232 in 2025, increasing the steel tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent, and the aluminum tariffs from 10 percent to 50 percent. On August 1, 2025, 50 percent of Section 232 tariffs were also levied on imports of semi-refined copper products, a move meant to foster more investment into domestic smelting and refining. Officials are still considering a 15 to 30 percent general copper import tariff for 2027 that will be reviewed next year. A similar investigation is ongoing for a broad range of processed critical minerals and derivative products, including rare earths and uranium, with a report and policy recommendations scheduled for delivery to the President in October.

Each shift in the tariff regime alters domestic project economics—higher import costs can offset higher construction, labor and operational costs for US projects. But their application by executive order also creates the potential for negotiated exemptions with foreign partners in line with diplomatic and geopolitical initiatives. Conversely, the Republican majorities in Congress's unwillingness so far to challenge the Trump administration's tariffs in regulating trade or establishing these priorities beyond budget allocations can create longer-term risks from shifts in policy. However, policies supporting critical minerals value chains are largely bipartisan, evidenced by the administration's expansion of financings begun during the Biden administration.

Two major diplomatic initiatives have produced intergovernmental framework agreements for mining and metals projects—attempts to broker peace and post-war stability in Ukraine and the DRC. Responding to Ukrainian concerns that the US might disengage from military and security support, the US government negotiated the creation of a joint fund for exploration and early-stage development. All projects' equity will be split between the two governments. Since much of Ukraine's critical mineral wealth currently sits in occupied territory, the agreement provides a longer-term basis for US involvement.

More pressing for metals markets, the Trump administration brokered the Washington Accord between the governments of the DRC and Rwanda, which risked threatening mining operations. While the agreement only begins implementation in October, and did not include M23, which continues to fight against the Congolese government in Kinshasa, the DFC has begun underwriting exploration agreements in the region. To date, there is no systematic process for US firms to invest, and a durable peace deal has yet to be reached.

Finally, the administration has brokered a memorandum of cooperation with the Saudi government to collaborate securing critical minerals and an agreement with the UAE to co-invest into relevant projects. These agreements build on both countries' existing critical minerals strategies acquiring strategic stakes in mining businesses and projects internationally. The administration's approach has therefore fused security and geopolitical interests with critical minerals policy domestically, and abroad to secure investment and supply. These efforts can also create headwinds for US firms and opportunities for miners based in Europe. Tensions between the governments of Greenland and Denmark with Washington over talk of incorporating Greenland into the United States opened the door to more agreements with European companies. The unintended consequences of transactional minerals diplomacy can create opportunities in Europe and elsewhere too.

Macro-economic road bumps

Miners and investors attempting to capitalize on these shifts in policy face demand uncertainty and structural constraints that will likely elevate project costs. The repeal of most tax credit provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act in the OBBB creates a headwind for the uptake of electric vehicles on the US market. Coupled with the slowdown in federal permissions for clean energy and battery storage, the demand outlook for domestic lithium projects faces uncertainty. Among the major US automakers, Ford is the only company committing to aggressive EV production targets and investment timelines.

More broadly, current policies create risks of significant increases in the cost base for projects. A more restrictive immigration policy has begun to pose a challenge for the construction sector. Projects requiring significant infrastructure investment and development will likely cost more as a result. But labor shortages are most pronounced for more senior expertise because new mines haven't been developed at scale in the US for a generation. Tariffs and the lack of a large domestic industrial base for mining & metals kits pose additional cost pressures. In the years ahead, electricity will also become a cost pressure point driven by rapidly growing demands on power grids, for AI data centers, and balancing supply between baseload, renewables and batteries.

Finally, greater uncertainty about future economic growth may challenge the economics of some proposed mines. For instance, copper prices and demand correlate strongly to GDP growth, a relationship strengthening from electrification. But the present policy mix creates headwinds for growth, even as it encourages domestic investment into mining & metals. By contrast, the demand for gold often correlates to uncertainty, inflation and the value of the US dollar, which has depreciated against other major currencies at near historic levels for the past 50 years.

These challenges will not stop investment into the sector, nor will they necessarily last. Miners like Ivanhoe Electric, which concluded its preliminary feasibility study for the Santa Cruz copper project in Arizona in June, can lock in the benefit of more accommodative policy. But the current policy environment creates a market landscape with two tiers. Miners chiefly serving private sector demand and making use of expedited permitting alone face greater risks than miners receiving financial support from the US government. Both groups enjoy an accommodative policy environment, but the latter also enjoys financial support that may be unavailable in commercial markets.

Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed.","The plan sounded like a magic bullet from the future to solve one of the world’s most vexing environmental waste problems.

In Rohnert Park, just north of San Francisco, a startup company called Resynergi planned to use a form of “advanced recycling” to reuse plastic. Its process would chemically transform old plastic, blasting bits of it with microwaves until they turned into an oil that could then be used to make new plastic.

But the process – known as pyrolysis – was a hard sell to Sonoma County neighbors, who protested so much that the company withdrew its application and now plans to move out of state.

The fight that boiled over in Rohnert Park in recent months is a window into the tensions ahead for California as the state overhauls nation-leading regulations governing plastic pollution and packaging. (CalRecycle, formally known as the Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling, will hold a public hearing about those rules Oct. 7.)

While California is establishing some of the most forward-thinking plastic responsibility and recycling rules in the country, a dirty secret is that most plastic recycling methods are ineffective at best and illusory at worst.

Millions of tons of plastic go to the state’s landfills each year, and millions more are shipped to Southeast Asia, where plastic is rarely recycled. Instead it is illegally dumped, and often burned.

Last year, Attorney General Rob Bonta brought suit against ExxonMobil for “perpetuating the myth … that you can recycle plastics, including single use plastics, and that it’s sustainable and good for the environment … It’s not true. It’s a lie.” ExxonMobil has since countersued Bonta for defamation.

California’s regulators, meanwhile, are working to implement a 2022 state law that moves the state toward a circular economy for plastic – by making companies that produce packaging and single-use plastic items responsible for what happens to them after people throw them away. Those companies, along with environmental groups, have been weighing in as CalRecycle has been writing regulations, now years in the making.

Recent comments by Gov. Gavin Newsom suggest the state is aiming to strike a balance, finding a way to encourage recycling companies while hitting the state’s goals – all while avoiding more air pollution or other environmental impacts.

As for Resynergi, local and environmental advocates say that the way local, county, and regional regulators handled the company points up the challenges the state will face as it regulates plastic and defines whether and how it can be recycled.

“It does make me nervous, since it took seven years to get any enforcement on a facility that’s a two hour drive from the Capitol,” said Nick Lapis, advocacy director for Californians Against Waste.

A credible solution to plastic waste?

Resynergi’s departure came as Sonoma County officials began to ask more serious questions about its operations, almost a decade after the company first arrived.

In 2017, company founder Brian Bauer chose Rohnert Park, a small, middle-class community surrounded by farmland, to develop and test his process.

He set up shop in a development called SOMO Village – a 200-acre neighborhood with homes, a high school, and commercial space. Developers market it as a climate-conscious place, built to be carbon-neutral, which Bauer said was a draw for Resynergi.

In early conversations, according to Bauer, Sonoma County officials “suggested” his business could follow simpler recycling guidelines. Sheri Cardo, a spokesperson for Sonoma County’s Department of Health Services, confirmed the department had talked with Bauer about its operations as a recycling research and development site, and that his characterization was accurate.

In 2023, when Bauer sought to expand operations, he approached the city of Rohnert Park’s planning division for permits.

Officials told Bauer his facility was considered a heavy manufacturing site, and that Resynergi’s location – 600 feet from a school – demanded an environmental review, according to documents obtained by residents through a public records request. In a response late last year, Resynergi argued that such a review could take too long, and moving quickly “could make or break substantial investment from a large strategic investor.”

Within a month, planning officials had flipped and were now siding with Resynergi, granting it a more flexible, less burdensome administrative use permit. The decision avoided additional public review.

But to operate legally, Resynergi had to secure approval from county officials and the regional air district.

In California, pyrolysis is classified as a type of incineration, associated with toxic and hazardous waste. Businesses must obtain a solid waste permit from local authorities, who enforce the state’s public resources code. In the past, three facilities have received permits to use pyrolysis, two for the purpose of destroying medical waste. All are now closed, according to CalRecycle.

California counties issue waste permits on behalf of CalRecycle. The Bay Area Regional Air Quality Management District permits and controls pollution that microwaving plastic could produce.

County officials started looking into the company when they realized Resynergi’s plans would make the company a fully operational and “fixed component in the county’s waste system,” said Cardo, the county spokesperson.

“Although your facility might be considered a recycling facility in vernacular language, it is not under state law,” wrote Christine Sosko, Sonoma County’s director of environmental health.

CalRecycle spokesman Lance Klug said in an email that Sonoma County’s response followed state standards.

But environmental advocates say the way city and county officials handled Resynergi reflects regulators’ confusion about the processes for advanced recycling – confusion fueled by the plastic industry.

Jane Williams, director of California Communities Against Toxics, argues that federal and state law make it clear that pyrolysis facilities have to follow rules as incinerators. “It’s really interesting for me to see, having worked on these incinerators for so long, how these guys pulled strings,” Williams said. “They pulled whatever out of their pockets so they could convince people this is a recycling facility.”

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group supporting the plastic industry, disagrees. And Resynergi’s Bauer said he doesn’t think his company’s process counts as incineration.

“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community. “This city has the chance to lead by example.”

Community fears toxic air pollution

People living in and near SOMO Village found out that Resynergi planned to burn plastic on a larger scale when the Bay Area Air Quality Management District notified the public of the company’s permit application.

The community protested, filling city council rooms at each meeting and waving signs depicting polluting smoke stacks. Some parents spoke through tears to their city leaders. “Our air is not your experiment,” one poster read.

Among the local opponents of Resynergi was Stephanie Lennox. She lives about 20 minutes from Rohnert Park in rural Forestville, but her two daughters go to Credo High School right next to the facility. She wondered about emissions and the risk of an explosion.

“My Lord, don’t we need a solution to our global plastic pollution,” Lennox said. “But my daughters’ lungs are not part of your beta testing phase for your ‘world’s global plastic solution.’”

Local organizers said they wanted city and county leaders to follow state law and the federal Clean Air Act.

When plastic is burned, additives like flame retardants or other chemicals that don’t break down can create toxic emissions, said Veena Singla, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco.

Resynergi applied to the regional air district to obtain a permit for pollution control equipment in April, after the company had already begun operating their technology.

In August, the air district issued three notices of violation to Resynergi for constructing and operating without a permit.

Bauer admitted to operating the equipment without a permit. The company never burned plastic in Rohnert Park he said; it did burn plastic at “prototype levels” in Santa Rosa.

But, Bauer added, Resynergi was trying to follow the rules as he understood them. As a startup, he said, “you don’t even know if you will get a prototype to work. You’re also trying to figure out how the permitting process works.”

Millions spent to sway regulations

Resynergi’s departure wasn’t because of a community outcry, Bauer said. The turning point, he said, was “the pull from other states; how they treated climate technologies such as ours …combined with the overall culture of accepting what we’re doing.”

Plastics manufacturers and industry advocates like the American Chemistry Council have campaigned to redefine terms and loosen environmental regulations for the process Resynergi is developing. After the lobbying, 27 states have reclassified pyrolysis as manufacturing instead of solid waste operations, said Davis Allen, a researcher for the Center for Climate Integrity. That classification helps operators get around federal air requirements, he added.

Resynergi’s Bauer told CalMatters that “one of those (states) is a candidate,” and that the company will move out by the end of the year.

An analysis by the climate accountability newsletter HEATED found the chemistry council and groups aligned with it have spent as much as $30 million to promote the concept of advanced recycling as a mainstream and established one. That language aims to sway not just state laws, but federal clean air policy as well.

Between 2021 and 2022, when lawmakers were discussing plastic producer legislation, the American Chemistry Council spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying state legislators, according to publicly available data published by the Secretary of State.

The American Chemistry Council’s Ross Eisenberg says that pyrolysis and other chemical recycling processes do work. These processes turn “hard-to-recycle plastics into the raw materials for high-quality products while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and fossil energy use during production compared with virgin production,” he said.

“America’s plastic makers are investing billions of dollars to modernize and expand recycling capacity and improve efficiency,” Eisenberg said, adding that the companies are “advocating for smart policies that enhance collection and sorting so more plastics can be remade into new products.”

This year, the Environmental Protection Agency said it isn’t taking further action on the matter, but industry representatives said they’ll continue to lobby at the federal level.

Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic

California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed. Within seven years, state law seeks to reduce plastic packaging by 25%, make single-use plastic packaging 100% recyclable or compostable, and divert most of that packaging into recycling.

Allen, from the Center for Climate Integrity, says laws like this can be a good idea – as long as regulators focus more on reducing plastics and less on recycling them.

“Almost any solution that is based on the idea that plastics can widely be recycled just isn’t really going to work,” Allen said. “There just aren’t easily available solutions to a lot of the problems that limit the effectiveness of recycling.”

But in March, regulations aimed at achieving the state’s goals were dealt a setback after two years of hearings. The day they were due, Gov. Newsom directed CalRecycle to start the regulatory process over.

The governor asked for changes “to minimize costs for small businesses and families – while ensuring California’s bold recycling law can achieve the critical goal of cutting plastic pollution,” said Daniel Villaseñor, a spokesperson for the governor, in an email to CalMatters.

The Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council hailed the governor’s announcement as an opportunity. “We believe California’s regulations should be clear, technology-neutral, and performance-based,” said the council’s Ross Eisenberg.

According to Klug, the CalRecycle spokesman, the state “remains committed to fostering business innovation that promotes a safe and clean future for all Californians.”

But environmental organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Surfrider called the decision disappointing.

Williams, the California Communities Against Toxics activist, said she’s concerned that more recent draft language may encourage pyrolysis facilities like Resynergi, which, she says, don’t belong in the state.

If California “rolls out the red carpet,” she said, “The only thing that will stop a whole new fleet of incinerators being built in California now is open, persistent community opposition.”

Resynergi also took part in CalRecycle workshops for the regulations. The company’s departure announcement praised the “innovative spirit of California … instrumental in the company’s growth.”

Brian Bauer said he’s hopeful the state plastic regulations will ease regulations for companies like his, but he plans to return to California either way.

“So it might be a couple years,” Bauer said. “We’ll be back to California in due time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082725_Rohnert-Park-Incinerator_CS_CM_06.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:20.154567

45,000 jobs will be supported thanks to investment commitments made into the strategy’s key growth driving sectors.

Figures reinforce the government’s commitment to driving growth in communities all across the UK as it delivers on the Plan for Change.

Since July, the Government has secured over £250 billion of investment into the IS-8 sectors, supporting 45,000 high-quality jobs in communities across the UK.

These achievements mark a significant milestone since the launch of the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy in June, reinforcing the Government’s commitment to long-term economic growth, innovation, and national resilience.

From advanced manufacturing to clean energy, creative industries to defence and digital technologies, the strategy is already delivering tangible results — unlocking private investment, creating high-quality jobs, and positioning the UK as a global leader in future-facing sectors.

These achievements – summarised in the first Quarterly Update, published today – are just the beginning of a long-term plan to build a more productive, innovative, and resilient economy. The Industrial Strategy is not just a vision — it is a delivery programme, already shaping the UK’s economic future.

Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said:

Our Industrial Strategy has hit the ground running — securing over £250 billion in investment and supporting 45,000 jobs in just a few months. This shows our strategy is not just working — it’s transforming communities and industries across the country as we deliver on our Plan for Change.

From pioneering clean energy to scaling up advanced manufacturing and digital innovation, we’re backing the sectors that will define the future. This strategy is about delivery, not just ambition — and it’s already laying the foundations for a stronger, more resilient economy that works for everyone.

Advanced Manufacturing

The newly launched DRIVE35 programme is injecting £2.5 billion into the automotive sector, supporting capital investment and R&D. A £650 million electric vehicle grant scheme is already accelerating consumer adoption, while over 50 cutting-edge auto projects have secured £70 million in innovation funding.

Clean Energy Industries

The UK’s clean energy ambitions are advancing at pace. The Contracts for Difference Allocation Round 7 has opened with a £544 million budget, while ten hydrogen projects from Allocation Round 1 are now moving forward — creating over 700 jobs. Two new Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) projects will join the HyNet cluster, supporting nearly 3,000 jobs across North Wales and the North West.

Creative Industries

The government is investing in the UK’s world-class creative industries, with £150 million from the Creative Places Growth Fund allocated to regions including the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. New higher technical qualifications and a Creative Careers Programme are being developed to inspire the next generation of talent.

Defence

An £182 million Defence Skills package will establish five new Defence Technical Excellence Colleges, while £220 million is being invested in test and evaluation capabilities through the Defence Tech Scaler. A further £65 million is supporting SMEs and exporters in the defence sector.

Digital and Technologies

In digital tech, the creation of a new AI Growth Zone in the North East is expected to generate over 5,000 jobs and attract more than £30 billion in private investment. The UK-US Tech Prosperity Agreement is also unlocking new opportunities in AI, quantum, and digital trade.

Financial Services

The UK is sharpening its competitive edge in financial services with the launch of a new Office for Investment concierge service this October, designed to streamline support for firms and attract global capital. A bold consultation on regulatory reform is underway, including plans to merge the Payment System Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority—a move set to simplify oversight and boost innovation.

Life Sciences

The UK is cementing its position as a global life sciences powerhouse with the launch of Europe’s first Biofoundry for mRNA manufacturing in Darlington, backed by £30 million in government support. A £50 million Transformational R&D Investment Fund Pilot is now live, alongside the opening of Moderna’s Innovation and Technology Centre, part of a landmark £1 billion, 10-year partnership. To supercharge research, a new body has been created to deliver a £600 million Health Data Research Service, offering secure, streamlined access to NHS data through a single gateway.

Professional and Business Services

The UK’s professional services sector is gearing up for a digital-first future. A new Made Smarter delivery model is being co-developed with Mayoral Strategic Authorities, ready for rollout in 2026 to boost productivity and innovation. Meanwhile, the ‘Made in the UK, Sold to the World’ roadshow landed in Edinburgh, connecting small businesses with global trade opportunities and showcasing the best of British enterprise on the international stage.

At the same time, legislation known as the Green New Deal was gaining popularity among progressives and climate activists. The Green New Deal legislation put forward a top-down, public-sector approach to addressing climate change. While the exact parameters of the Green New Deal were vague, it emphasized massive-scale federal investment in climate-related infrastructure projects, invoking FDR’s New Deal. The climate activists downplayed or even dismissed carbon taxes—fees on greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel use and other economic activity—as both regressive and inadequate to achieving their goals.

While the Green New Deal was not a serious legislative proposal, the Biden administration’s approach to addressing climate change was closer to the Green New Deal approach than it was to carbon pricing. The resulting Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) relied heavily on subsidies for green technologies, whether zero-emission electricity generation or electric vehicles. The Biden administration also pursued emissions reduction through regulation.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2025, cut the IRA green energy subsidies substantially, although it stopped short of full repeal. With the IRA subsidies gutted and deficits elevated, carbon taxes may be worth another look.

The case for carbon taxes.

A tax on socially harmful behavior is known as a Pigouvian tax, named for the British economist Arthur Pigou, who introduced the concept in 1920. The basic case for such a tax is that some economic activity imposes costs on third parties not involved in those transactions. Those costs are also known as externalities. A Pigouvian tax forces economic actors to factor in these social costs. Taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are the two most prominent historical examples of Pigouvian taxes. The idea is to find the social cost of an activity, such as the climate impacts of carbon emissions, and impose a tax at the rate that aligns the costs from producing emissions with the benefits.

The straightforward advantage of this policy in the context of climate change is that it leaves the decision of which emissions to reduce, and by how much, to the market. It may be cheap to reduce emissions in some sectors, but expensive in others. Under a broad carbon price, firms would undertake the least expensive approaches possible to reducing emissions. Depending on the context, that might mean more incremental changes, like improvements in energy efficiency or replacing coal-fired electricity generation with natural gas, or it might mean more radical decarbonization involving the full-scale adoption of zero-emission technology in electricity generation, passenger cars, or even other more difficult areas like industrial processes.

The U.S. has not implemented a significant carbon tax at the national level. Carbon taxes have been introduced in plenty of other developed countries, such as Sweden, Norway, France, and the United Kingdom. Carbon taxes (and cap-and-trade systems, which are similar) have expanded around the world in the past two decades. The most notable setback came in Canada this year, when new Prime Minister Mark Carney repealed the federal carbon tax that had been a signature achievement of Justin Trudeau’s premiership.

Critiques of carbon pricing.

Critiques of the simple “Econ 101” case for a carbon tax abound. They’re worth addressing, but none of them defeat the underlying logic of the basic approach.

1. The social cost of carbon is a flawed metric.

To get to the social cost of carbon, you need to first model the damage from carbon emissions, a difficult process in itself. But then you must choose a discount rate (in short, how much to value future costs relative to present costs), and whether to consider the global costs of emissions or just the domestic costs.

Reasonable assumptions about discount rates and global versus domestic costs can produce wildly different estimates of the social cost of carbon, from under $10 to almost $200. Because methodological differences produce dramatically different estimates of the social cost of carbon,

just about any carbon tax policy could plausibly be argued to either overprice or underprice emissions. However, this issue is not exclusive to carbon pricing. When considering a regulation on power plant emissions or the size of subsidies for green energy investment, policymakers also must make judgment calls on how to value potential future costs of climate change.

There is no objectively correct, scientific answer to how much we should worry about climate change. However, given that we will implement climate policy in some form, and given that carbon emissions do have a social cost, a carbon tax is still the best option in the toolkit. In simple terms, we have agreed on the premise; now we’re just negotiating the price.

2. Carbon taxes distract from pro-innovation policy that will lower the cost of green energy.

Carbon taxes should drive clean energy innovation, and that is especially true in the United States. The pattern of “induced innovation,” where energy innovation accelerates when energy prices are higher, suggests a carbon tax would spur innovation in lower-emission technology. That’s truer in the U.S. because we are a massive market. A carbon tax in, say, Luxembourg probably won't drive emissions reduction through technological innovation because Luxembourg is not a big market for innovators to pursue. The United States is.

A carbon tax and government support for new technological development are not mutually exclusive. Even with a carbon tax, there is a case for government support for energy research, just like there is a role for government support for basic research in other fields.

The challenges to broader technological transformation apply regardless of a carbon price or innovation subsidy approach. If the main constraint to more transformative decarbonization is, say, permitting, then that is going to be a challenge whether the primary financial lever for supporting clean energy investments is a tax subsidy for new technology or a tax on carbon emissions.

3. Carbon taxes don’t go far enough.

A carbon price is not the same as a net-zero-emissions policy, and that's a good thing. Fossil fuels are tremendously useful technologies, even if they have downsides. A carbon tax would make private actors take the environmental costs of burning fossil fuels into consideration, but in many cases no viable alternatives to fossil fuels exist (and there may not be for a long time). A carbon tax lets market actors—you and me—decide if certain activities are worth their environmental costs.

4. Carbon taxes disproportionately burden low-income households.

While there is some truth to this critique, the same can be said of other climate policies too. Green energy credits, whether consumer-facing ones for electric vehicles or business-side ones for electricity generation or other green energy tech, disproportionately flow to high-income households and big businesses and must ultimately be offset by other sources of tax revenue or spending cuts.

The economic burden of command-and-control regulation of fuel use also falls disproportionately on low-income households. Most of the economic literature shows carbon taxes are less regressive than these alternatives.

The other factor to consider here: Carbon taxes produce revenue. Converting all, or even some, of the carbon tax revenue to universal flat cash transfer payments could more than offset the economic burden of the tax for lower- and middle-income households.

The big picture.

In implementing a carbon tax, an additional consideration is the need for deficit reduction. Revenue will have to be part of the conversation. In a situation where policymakers are looking to bring deficits down, a climate policy approach like a carbon tax that reduces the deficit has a lot more appeal than an approach like green subsidies that increases it.

Carbon taxes justifiably have their critics; translating the simple model of a Pigouvian tax to climate change involves a lot of judgment calls worthy of debate. Nonetheless, most of the objections to a carbon tax as a policy mechanism apply to other climate policies too, and the core structural advantages of a carbon tax still hold relative to the alternatives.",https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-528822404.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:02.721699

The US Environmental Protection Agency is under fire for cancelling a USD 7 billion solar-power programme...

The US Environmental Protection Agency is under fire for cancelling a USD 7 billion solar-power programme despite already guaranteeing that funds would be forthcoming.

A coalition of trades unions, environmental campaigners, businesses and individual homeowners has filed a lawsuit in the District of Rhode Island against the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its administrator Lee Zeldin, challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the USD 7 billion ‘Solar for All’ programme. The complaint, lodged yesterday (6 October), argues that the EPA acted unlawfully in cancelling a scheme designed to bring solar power to more than 900,000 low-income households nationwide. The claimants contend that Congress had already guaranteed the funds, meaning they were legally preserved even after lawmakers repealed parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund earlier this year.

The case is being brought by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO (a federation of trades unions), the Rhode Island Center for Justice, Solar United Neighbors, Sunpath Consulting, 2KB Energy Services, Energy Independent Solutions, Black Sun Light Sustainability and individual homeowner Anh Nguyen of Atlanta, Georgia.

The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the US Constitution, particularly the separation of powers. Claimants argue that by rescinding funds that Congress had already obligated, the executive branch unlawfully usurped Congress’s “power of the purse”.

HUGE MISTAKE

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All. This popular programme was poised to bring more solar to our communities, provide jobs for the small businesses installing those projects, and help families get cheap, clean power,” said Nick Torrey, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center, in an online statement. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

The 47-page filing emphasises the scale of reliance on the programme. Rhode Island AFL-CIO had invested heavily in apprenticeship and workforce planning, anticipating hundreds of new union jobs. The Rhode Island Center for Justice expanded staff and entered formal agreements with state agencies to deliver affordable solar power to disadvantaged households. Solar United Neighbors hired staff in Florida, Texas and Indiana and had already begun projects such as ‘Hub Homes’ in Harris County, designed to provide backup power to communities during blackouts.

BUSINESSES’ DIRECT LOSSES

Georgia-based Sunpath Solar reported more than USD 30,000 in out-of-pocket costs for vehicles, USD 18,000 in annual software expenses and more than USD 100,000 in staff commitments tied to Solar for All contracts. 2KB Energy Services, also in Georgia, estimated nearly USD 2 million in lost revenue over the contract period and said it had been forced to lay off staff after purchasing compliance tools and project software specifically for the scheme. Black Sun Light Sustainability lost a USD 29.9 million sub-award in Indiana that was to fund five energy cooperatives, 50 resilience hubs and 200 rooftop projects.

MAKING AMERICANS PAY

Environmental groups have not held back in their criticism of the programme’s termination. “EPA’s termination […] is a betrayal against a million American families and communities who need access to clean, affordable energy,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government. “By terminating the Solar for All programme while simultaneously ending clean air protections, this administration is sending a clear message: they will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry. We will not allow this administration to trample the legal rights of Americans, and we will keep fighting for a clean, affordable future for the people and the planet.”

Amy Romero, chief legal counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, added: “Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy. EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this programme.”

The legal arguments rest heavily on statutory interpretation. Claimants point to the July 2025 legislation, which repealed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and rescinded only “unobligated balances”. By September 2024, the EPA had already awarded and allocated the full USD 7 billion, and the claimants argue that the repeal could not retroactively extinguish those grants.

BOONDOGGLE

Administrator Zeldin has defended the decision, writing on social media that the “EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle [or wasteful project] alive”. The EPA subsequently issued termination letters to grantees on 7 August, claiming that without statutory authorisation and administrative appropriations, it could not lawfully continue the scheme.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement: “The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All programme is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families. This programme would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat. Stripping those benefits away is unlawful and betrays communities. We will not let it stand.”",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/coalition-sues-epa-over-termination-of-solar-for-all-plan_0_QEQo8ZxbOn5sKlxTLPjHAbdg8pL30IuL4nAnEXd3.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:06.448375

The airline plans to retire six diesel belt loaders, leaving it with about a dozen diesels still in use at RDU, according to the airline.

Each year, the state awards grants to reduce pollution from diesel-powered “mobile sources,” including trucks, buses, lawnmowers and construction equipment. The money comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program, created by Congress in 2005.

Altogether, the state awarded $1.14 million in grants this year. Other recipients include the town of Carrboro, which received $6,951 to replace a utility terrain vehicle with an electric model.

With each grant award, the Division of Air Quality lists the estimated amount of pollution it will prevent. In the case of Delta’s belt loaders, the state estimates emissions reductions over the liftime of the machines of 1,316 tons of carbon dioxide, 3.36 tons of nitrogen oxides and 560 pounds of small particulates.

Delta has bought more than 2,000 electric belt loaders, bag tractors and other ground equipment across its network since 2020, according to Jesse Miers, Delta’s director of fleet operations. About 39% of core ground support equipment is now electric, Miers said.

The transition to electric will help the company achieve its goal of producing net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Miers said. The state grant helps accelerate that process at RDU, he said.

Last year, the company received $132,420 from the same grant program to help replace four pieces of diesel equipment at RDU with electric ones.

Talarico's speech, delivered while standing on a flatbed truck in front of a church, is inspiring, profound and unique for a Democrat.
His message has the potential to transcend party lines — and perhaps even transform American politics.
A turn-the-other-cheek Christian candidate would appear too weak or out of touch to lead a party or a nation.
From memory, Talarico quoted Catholic Worker Movement co-founder Dorothy Day: ""You really only love God as much as you love the person you love the least.""","Religion and politics dramatically intertwined when thousands of people attended Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's memorial service on Sept. 21. The loud gathering exemplified the rise of Christian nationalism within the Republican Party — and the call to a quasi-spiritual, quasi-political battle between good and evil.

In contrast, more quietly, days earlier, a 36-year-old Democrat studying to be a Presbyterian minister launched a bid for the U.S. Senate in Texas. State Rep. James Talarico's announcement was substantially different from the Kirk memorial's apocalyptic message.

""My granddad was a Baptist preacher in South Texas,"" he said. ""He taught me that we follow a barefoot rabbi who gave two commandments: love God and love neighbor. Because there is no love of God without love of neighbor.""

Talarico's speech, delivered while standing on a flatbed truck in front of a church, is inspiring, profound and unique for a Democrat. His message has the potential to transcend party lines — and perhaps even transform American politics. This three-minute clip offers one of the clearest, compelling examples in decades of a public official linking hopeful Christianity to our national public discourse.

Unlike Talarico, many Democratic candidates dodge the topic of religion in politics, while Republicans have embraced the religious right, politically benefitting from the modern reality that ""all politics is influenced by identity [including religion],"" as Ezra Klein writes in his excellent book, Why We're Polarized.

For decades, I worked in government and politics at all levels, including senior positions in three Democratic presidential campaigns. I've seen candidates and the party struggle to connect with religious voters, fearing that ""God talk"" only benefits Republicans and stirs culture war issues.

Talarico masterfully accepts this challenge and isn't shy about sharing Christian teaching as a unifying message. ""Every single person bears the image of the sacred,"" he said. ""Every single person is holy, not just my neighbors who look like me, or pray like me, or vote like me.""

But equally significant, Talarico understands that we live in combative times. A turn-the-other-cheek Christian candidate would appear too weak or out of touch to lead a party or a nation. But this candidate emphasizes how Jesus was not just a revolutionary figure but a true rebel in his time.

""Two thousand years ago, when the powerful few rigged the system, that barefoot rabbi walked into the seat of power and flipped over the tables of injustice,"" said Talarico. ""To those who love this state, to those who love this country, to those who love our neighbors, it's time to start flipping tables.""

And he is straightforward about what he means. His campaign video starts with a declaration: ""The biggest divide in our country is not left versus right, it's top versus bottom."" Billionaires, Talarico goes on to say, want people to look left and right at each other, ""so that we're not looking up at them.""

His understanding of justice and moral courage provides a lens through which he approaches real-world politics, shaping the decisions that have defined his short but impressive political career. Talarico is a relative newcomer to politics. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2018 and recently entered the U.S. Senate Democratic primary against a better-known candidate.

He attracted national attention earlier this year by leading the debate against a bill that required Texas public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Talarico argued that the bill was not only unconstitutional and un-American but also ""deeply un-Christian."" He pointed out that the bill imposed one religious tradition over others, violating the principle of religious freedom. The bill eventually passed, but Talarico's calm, thoughtful arguments impressed people on both sides of the aisle, leading to some notable media attention.

In July, his message found a national platform on the popular Joe Rogan podcast. During that two-and-a-half-hour conversation, which has received over 1 million views so far, Talarico impressively discussed a wide range of political, religious and historical issues.

Talarico said that ""this idea that there is a set Christian orthodoxy on the issue of abortion is just not rooted in Scripture."" But he welcomed ""honest debate."" He said that if Pope Francis were to come back to life and express his pro-life, anti-abortion stance, Talarico would listen to and respect the pope's theological argument. Ultimately, Talarico said that he wanted pro-choice Christians who respect women's bodily autonomy to be given the space to make their theological arguments.

From memory, Talarico quoted Catholic Worker Movement co-founder Dorothy Day: ""You really only love God as much as you love the person you love the least."" Rogan told Talarico that he's the type of good person who should be in public office — and concluded that the Texan should run for president.

The Rogan conversation revealed Talarico's intellectual range. Then, in August, his appearance on Chris Cuomo's podcast clarified his political philosophy more precisely.

Talarico described himself as theologically conservative and politically progressive. ""That's the long-term bet I'm making,"" he said. ""That love and compassion are going to win in the long run."" Cuomo likened Talarico to his late father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the last nationally prominent Catholic to openly discuss how religious faith influences public service.

Talarico's approach demonstrates that faith can drive politics without weaponizing it — a model that feels both urgent and overdue in our current moment. His vision stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric on display at Charlie Kirk's memorial service, where President Donald Trump declared: ""I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them.""

Where Trump and the Christian nationalist movement frame politics as spiritual warfare, demanding the defeat of enemies, Talarico invites Americans into a Christian tradition that sees the sacred in every person and justice as an expression of love.

Whether his Senate bid succeeds or not, his message represents the potential for transformative realignment. He's showing Democrats how to reclaim a moral vocabulary without compromising pluralism.

And he's reminding Christians that our tradition offers a pathway for healing rather than deepening our national divisions.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-10/Election_2026_Texas_Senate_Redistricting_25228782289806.jpg?h=8b9c984c&itok=CZrsXNxG,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:55.935669

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

Additional Topics on Which EPA Seeks Comment:

Data about which refrigerants are being considered or adopted in new refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses;

Data about the commercial availability and timeline for adoption of new refrigeration equipment using lower-GWP substitutes in remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses, as it relates to the proposed 2032 compliance dates for these subsectors;

Data about costs and savings resulting from the extension of compliance timelines for manufacturers and servicing companies, which are investing in U.S. production of new raw materials, refrigerants, equipment, and other technologies, intended to support companies’ transition and compliance, across the subsectors in this rule;

The proposed removal of the installation compliance date for residential and light commercial air conditioning systems, as well as whether an extension of the installation compliance date by one or more years would be appropriate, noting that EPA does not have information about the extent of equipment that may remain in inventory as of January 1, 2026, and account for any significant reliance interests in the final action as well as any significant reliance interests that should be accounted for in any final action; and

Information and data that may be used to inform future actions that could be taken by EPA or other parts of the federal government to address R-454B supply challenges.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1328050223-default-social-share-social-sharing-image-23107.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:15.450727

Scientific Consensus Grows Stronger Scientific support for the 2009 finding has not weakened.
In Sept., the National Academies of Sciences released a fast-track review reaffirming that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, welfare, and climate stability.","NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming has joined a coalition of state financial officers that are part of a national conservative movement supporting the Environmental Protection Agency’s July 29 decision to rescind the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, a landmark climate ruling adopted after extensive scientific research concluded that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases harm human health and the environment. The rule had given the federal government authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.

The group, which includes 12 members of the State Financial Officers Foundation and four researchers from the American Institute for Economic Research, argues that the rule has imposed costly and unnecessary regulations on manufacturers and consumers while overstepping the EPA’s legal authority.

The 2009 finding gave the agency the power to set national vehicle-emission standards and other limits on greenhouse gases. Environmental groups have credited the policy with driving cleaner technologies and helping the U.S. reduce emissions, but opponents say it unnecessarily expanded federal reach. Fleming and his colleagues said the decision “triggered a wave of regulatory expansion without sufficient congressional oversight. It has imposed significant costs on consumers and manufacturers while failing to demonstrate meaningful environmental benefits.”

Economic Framing by State Financial Officers

Although the Endangerment Finding is an environmental and public-health determination, members of the State Financial Officers Foundation say the resulting regulations carry major financial consequences for state economies. The group contends that stricter federal climate rules increase production and energy costs, affecting industries, tax revenues, and public investment portfolios.

By weighing in, state treasurers argue they are defending fiscal stability and consumer affordability, not simply taking an environmental position. Critics, however, say the foundation’s members are stretching their role as financial stewards to advance a political agenda against climate action.

National Debate Over the EPA Proposal

On July 29, the Environmental Protection Agency formally rescinded the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, ending the agency’s determination that greenhouse gas emissions harm human health and the environment.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the change would lift what he called “hidden taxes” on businesses and consumers, while environmental and public health groups warned the move would gut the federal government’s ability to regulate climate pollution.

Following the announcement, scientists and advocacy organizations denounced the decision as a direct challenge to the Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling, which held that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, vowed to challenge the rollback in court, arguing that the EPA is legally obligated to regulate pollutants that endanger public health.

Scientific Consensus Grows Stronger

Scientific support for the 2009 finding has not weakened. If anything, it has grown stronger. Yet Fleming, a medical doctor, is challenging the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases to serious risks for human health and the environment.

In Sept., the National Academies of Sciences released a fast-track review reaffirming that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, welfare, and climate stability. The report concluded that the 2009 finding “was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” It noted that research since 2009 has expanded observational records and identified new health impacts linked to rising temperatures and pollution.

The National Academies’ report detailed a range of threats tied to greenhouse-gas-driven climate change, including increased heat-related illness and mortality, degraded air quality from ozone and particulate pollution, and more frequent floods and wildfires. The authors said evidence of harm has deepened across nearly every measure, and that “new evidence is developing about additional health impacts of climate-related exposures” not yet recognized in 2009.

That conclusion directly challenges claims by proponents of repeal who argue that current science is weaker or more uncertain than it was in 2009. Major research institutions, including the U.S. National Climate Assessment and international medical journals such as The Lancet, have likewise found that climate change is already contributing to worsening air quality, expanding disease risk, and causing thousands of premature deaths in the United States each year.

Federal Limits and State Authority

The push comes as recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have placed new limits on federal agencies, requiring clearer congressional authorization for major regulatory actions. Fleming said those decisions strengthen the case for revisiting the EPA’s climate authority.

“Revoking the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding will be a constructive move toward restoring a more balanced federal approach, one that aligns with the principles of competitive federalism,” Fleming said in a statement. “This shift will empower states to lead with innovative, tailored solutions to energy and climate challenges, fostering healthy competition among state governments and returning federal policy to its rightful, limited role.”

The State Financial Officers Foundation

The State Financial Officers Foundation is a nonprofit alliance of Republican state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers that advocates for what it calls “free-market” financial and energy policies.

Based in Kansas, the group has become a key player in national conservative efforts to challenge federal regulations and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment standards. Its members say they seek to protect taxpayers and promote fiscal responsibility, while critics describe the foundation as part of a broader political push to roll back climate and corporate accountability measures.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/10/State-Treasurer-Supports-Roll-Back-of-EPA-Climate-Regulations.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:20.948285

Mercedes’ new platform supports EVs and internal combustion.

BMW is ditching bloated grilles for a slim look with its iX3 EV.

Electric vehicle developments from German automakers made news at Europe’s first auto shows of the fall.

Mercedes and BMW teased new architectures that will spin off multiple vehicles, Porsche embraced a new charging technology, VW showed four very small vehicles and Audi revealed its new face at Germany’s IAA show, now held in Munich after decades in Frankfurt.

Two new Mercedes EVs coming to USA

After initially saddling its EVs with confusing names like EQE sedan and EQE SUV, Mercedes is moving its electric vehicles to familiar model names.

The Mercedes-Benz’s compact GLC SUV and CLA sedan inaugurate the change with varying levels of grace.

Both vehicles offer 800-volt/350 kWh fast-charging capability to shorten stops. Arriving in the U.S. later this year, the CLA has a two-speed automatic transmission. Most EVs thus far operate with single-speed transmissions. Mercedes says its unit “combines dynamic performance with high efficiency for all driving situations.”

The sleek CLA will launch as an EV, with a hybrid coming for the 2027 model year.

The CLA EVs are identified by “with EQ technology” badging, proving Mercedes isn’t done with clumsy EV designations yet: The CLA 250+ with technology and all-wheel drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ technology.

What I’d give to be Mercedes’s chrome supplier.

The SUV ― likely to sell better, because, America ― is simply called GLC.

Arriving in the second half of 2026, the GLC SUV will tow 5,291 pounds and offer features including adaptive air suspension and four-wheel steering .

Porsche embraces wireless EV charging

Porsche has backed away from its schedule to cease using internal combustion engines, but the company’s march to electrification continues.

The electrically powered turbocharger that lit up the 911 GTS earlier this year does double duty in the 911 Turbo S twin-turbo, which accelerates to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds, reaches 124 mph in 8.4 seconds and tops out at 200 mph. The all-wheel drive Turbo S develops 701 hp.

For its purely electric vehicles, Porsche is adding wireless charging.

The system debuts in Europe next year. Other regions will get it later.

Porsche says its “one box” design eliminates the wall unit common to Level 2 240 volt home chargers.

The system will debut on the electric Cayenne, which will be shown later in 2025.

BMW ‘new class’ to underpin dozens of vehicles

Arriving in U.S. dealerships in 2026, BMW’s iX3 electric SUV is the first of what BMW promises “nearly 40 new models and model updates arriving between now and 2027” using the architecture and technologies in its Neue Klasse, or new class, engineering program.

The iX3 features a welcome departure from the cartoonishly inflated grilles on recent BMWs. The slimmed down double kidney grille gets optional lighting and returns to the vertical orientation BMW used in the 1960s and ‘70s.

At 188.3 inches, the iX3 is about an inch longer than the current X3.

Notable features include 800 volt charging that can accommodate even high levels for brief peaks. BMW promises up to 175 miles range in 10 minutes and 10%-80% charging as quick as 21 minutes.

Also of note:

Standard 20-inch wheels

Full-width, Lincoln Navigator-style instrument display

Touch screen controls

All-wheel drive

Up to 463 hp and 476 pound-feet of torque

48.1/51.6 front/rear weight distribution

Estimated 4.7 seconds 0-60 mph

Production begins in Debrecen, Hungary, early next year.

VW’s shows 4 very small EVs

Volkswagen pulled out all the stops with four small EVs slated for production starting in 2026. All are likely too small for U.S. sale.

For instance, the ID Cross SUV — at first glance the concept best suited to American tastes — is just 163.8 inches long.

That’s 15 inches shorter than the subcompact Chevrolet Trax, eight inches shorter than a Nissan Kicks.

The ID Cross uses a single electric motor for front-wheel drive and has a top speed of 108 mph, but it can tow more that 2,600 pounds up an 8% grade.

VW’s other EV concepts were a pair of subcompact cars, including one with bearing the popular GTI performance badge, and the “entry-level” ID Every1. The Every1 appears to be even smaller than the subcompact ID Polo and ID Polo GTI.

Audi's future face

Audi previewed an electric replacement for the discontinued TT sport coupe.

The two-seat Concept C features a retractable hardtop, ground-hugging bodywork, a long hood and short rear deck.

It’s intended to set the direction for an upcoming generation of Audi production vehicles. Audi’s weighing names for a production car based on the Concept C. TT is in the running, but the concept is considerably bigger than that model.

I have a small position in Rivian, and I'm willing to wait out this rough patch to see what happens with the company, but expecting Rivian stock to mint millionaires doesn't look like a good bet.","Rivian (RIVN 0.30%) is gearing up for its launch of a new electric vehicle model next year, and is coming off a year in which it met gross profit milestones that unlocked additional funding from its partnership with Volkswagen.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that Rivian narrowed its vehicle delivery guidance for the year, the electric vehicle industry just had its federal tax credits axed, and the company reported a gross loss again in the most recent quarter.

To say Rivian's challenges are increasing would be an understatement. Here's why Rivian stock likely won't make you a millionaire anytime soon.

Rivian's slow but steady progress

They say it's always best to start with the good news, so here's what Rivian has going for it right now, starting with the company's upcoming cheaper models. Rivian will begin selling its smaller R2 SUV next year and R3 crossover in 2027. The former will start at just $45,000 while the latter has an estimated price tag of around $40,000.

Those are important price points because they're below the average price of a new EV, which is currently around $57,000. Potential EV buyers often cite cost as a concern when considering an electric vehicle, and for EVs to gain ground in the market, their prices need to come down. You can't buy a new Rivian vehicle for less than $71,000 right now, so the upcoming lower-priced models could potentially spark interest among more budget-conscious buyers.

What's more, Rivian has proved that it can run an efficient EV business after reporting two consecutive quarters of positive gross profit. Management set a goal to achieve that, and it did so, in part, by retooling and reengineering its manufacturing process last year -- cutting up to 35% in material costs for some vehicles. Achieving that goal also unlocked $1 billion in additional funding from its partner, Volkswagen, which was another win for Rivian.

Unfortunately, even after notching these wins, Rivian is still in uncharted territory.

The road to success is long, winding, and uncertain

Despite Rivian's successes and its pipeline of new models, the company is facing an arduous path. First, the federal government ending the EV tax credits is a blow to the industry. Rivian's vehicles didn't qualify for the credit because they're too expensive, but the company was able to take advantage of a leasing loophole that helped lower costs for some customers.

Making matters worse for Rivian is that after two consecutive quarters of positive gross profit, the company slipped back into the red in the second quarter. That may not have been such a big deal if everything else was humming along for the company, but it came just ahead of Rivian's management narrowing its full-year vehicle guidance.

Rivian now expects deliveries between 41,500 to 43,500 -- lower than its previous midpoint guidance by about 500 vehicles. That's the company's second revision this year. When Rivian started its production year, it first estimated deliveries of up to 51,000.

What's especially disappointing is that deliveries for Q3 were actually up by 32% from the year-ago quarter, but the company's revised full-year delivery guidance was adjusted down, likely due to the federal tax incentives being eliminated and tariff uncertainty. While some of the delivery increases were likely due to customers signing up for leases before the tax credits expired, there's no getting around the fact that the current 2025 estimates are nearly 18% lower than 2024's deliveries.

Is Rivian a millionaire maker?

For the reasons listed above, I don't think Rivian stock is a millionaire maker. I have a small position in Rivian, and I'm willing to wait out this rough patch to see what happens with the company, but expecting Rivian stock to mint millionaires doesn't look like a good bet.

That doesn't mean Rivian isn't a good company or won't be a good long-term investment, but investors should know that the EV industry is facing significant headwinds and Rivian will likely face more hurdles ahead as it tries to build its EV future.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/836210/r1s_woods.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 09:59:18.125289

Rivian founder and CEO R.J Scaringe, who has been called the “anti-Elon” by some, is excited to launch the electric vehicle manufacturer’s more affordable R2, which he calls “insanely good.”

“I've never been more confident in the company than I am today,” Scaringe said during an Automotive Press Association event at the company's development, prototyping and testing facility in Plymouth Township, Michigan.

He’s not concerned about the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit and he says he’s aligned with the Trump administration, which is advocating for more U.S. production.

Rivian assembles all its vehicles in Normal, Illinois, is building a plant in Georgia, and will source batteries for R2 from Arizona after LG Energy Solution launches production there in mid-2026.

The Rivian R2 remains on track for a $45,000 starting price -- lower than the average -- with production beginning in the first half of 2026.

“The R2 isn't just a great EV, it's an incredible vehicle,” he says. “It offers acceleration; it’s like a sports car that can go off-road.”

Scaringe predicts about two-thirds of customers will elect to buy the R2 rather than lease it, and that two-thirds of the vehicles cross-shopped with the R2 will not be EVs.

“I'm highly biased, but I can't imagine not buying this,” Scaringe says. “For the longest time, the electrified space, there's been a singular set of great choices. There's been the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3. They are great cars. They're highly compelling. They're well executed. But it's remarkable that they've maintained such extraordinary market share that they control about 50% of the sales in the United States.”

While many of the automaker’s employees have shifted to its California facilities, Rivian still has about 1,000 employees in Michigan.

The historic space, designed by noted industrial architect Albert Kahn, includes a call center for customers to access experts, vehicle testing, virtual reality manufacturing station layout review and 3D printing for prototype parts and tools.

After the Q&A with Scaringe, media members were invited on a tour and given a 3D printed plastic R2 model, which they said took about 20 minutes to print (see photo below.) The building has a very Rivian vibe, including a neon sign that reads “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few are dirt.”

Scaringe, who knew at age 10 he wanted to start a car company, is a serious environmentalist -- and the building reflects that. There are trash containers throughout that offer the choice of compost, mixed recycling or landfill. The continental breakfast served before the talk was served on compostable dinnerware.

Speaking to BBC North East & Cumbria, she said: “They are destroying more jobs than they are creating. We are bankrupting our economy. Oil and gas is disappearing, manufacturing is disappearing.”

Badenoch argued that current net zero targets were driving businesses abroad due to high energy costs. “I’ve heard businesses all around the country say we can’t afford the energy prices here and it is because of a lot of the decisions we are taking on net zero,” she said.

Her comments drew criticism from industry and opposition parties.

Energy UK, which represents most power generators and suppliers, warned the move would damage investor confidence.

Chief executive Dhara Vyas said: “Treating the Climate Change Act as a political football is a sure fire way to scare off investors. Pulling out the rug from under these critical investments will do nothing to lower energy bills.”

Labour’s Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland MP Luke Myer said the plan would risk “thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of investment” in Teesside and beyond.

Chief Executive Elon Musk for years has promised mass market vehicles, though last year he canceled plans to build an all-new $25,000 EV, Reuters first reported. The car expected this week is an ""affordable"" vehicle based on current manufacturing and design platforms.

Tesla posted two clips on X over the weekend, igniting excitement among Tesla fans. One video shows headlights peering out of the dark and another shows what looks like a wheel spinning for a few seconds, followed by ""10/7"", the US format for the date October 7.

Neither Tesla nor influencers have indicated that an in-person event is in the works, in contrast to previous major Tesla launches. Still, analysts, investors and fans expect the company to make some kind of announcement.

Major questions include the car's price, driving range and efforts to strip down costs. Late last year, Musk said the vehicle would be priced below the ""key threshold"" of $30,000 including US EV tax credits.

In the United States, prices effectively rose by $7,500 at the end of last month, when the credit ended. That helped goose quarterly sales to a record, but expectations are that they will slow down for the rest of the year, unless the affordable car comes to the rescue.

""The desire to buy the car is very high. (It's) just (that) people don't have enough money in the bank account to buy it,"" Musk said in July during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call. ""So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.""

Musk initially promised that production of the vehicle would start by the end of June. But Tesla only made what it called ""first builds"" of the car, it said in July, adding that it would be available for customers sometime in the last three months of the year.

Tesla has already been grappling with slowing sales of its aging lineup as competition has grown rapidly, especially in China and Europe, where Musk's far-right political views also have undermined brand loyalty.

Earlier this year, Tesla launched a refreshed version of the Model Y with improvements including new light bars and a rear touchscreen.

Musk has been pivoting the company toward artificial intelligence, focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla has said it will launch more affordable vehicles in its lineup but has not provided details.

In the U.S. and the E.U., however, clean power growth did not keep up with power demand and fossil generation ticked upward.
""So, this clean energy growth is really cleaning up other sectors.""
Clean energy expert Mark Jacobson is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Atmosphere and Energy Program.
He used two leading clean energy states in the U.S., California and Texas, as an example of what's possible through efficiency.","The first half of 2025 brought a small but potentially significant tipping point in the global energy system, according to the independent clean energy research group Ember.

""Clean sources grew more than demand and therefore they displaced some fossil fuels,"" Ember's Senior Electricity Analyst Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka told Newsweek.

The remarkable growth in clean energy has, until now, been more about energy addition than energy transition, as the global growth in demand used up both the power from fossil fuels and new renewable sources.

In the first six months of this year, however, that appears to have shifted in what Wiatros-Motyka called ""the first signs of a crucial turning point"" where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth and beginning to muscle out fossil fuels.

""For the first time ever, we saw renewables overtaking coal generation globally,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.

Solar power alone met more than 80 percent of new electricity demand, she said, as solar deployment soared and prices for solar equipment continued to decline.

The Ember research found that fossil fuel generation fell in both China and India.

China is both the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions and by far the world's clean energy leader. China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, Ember found, and its fossil generation dropped by 2 percent compared to the previous year.

In India, renewable energy sources grew more than three times bigger than the country's growth in power demand in the first half of the year.

In the U.S. and the E.U., however, clean power growth did not keep up with power demand and fossil generation ticked upward. In the E.U., the report found, countries relied on more gas and coal power as the output from wind and hydro sources dipped.

""So, emerging markets are leading the way at the moment,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.

The Ember report covers only the global electricity sector, and no other energy uses such as transportation and industry where fossil fuels still dominate. However, Wiatros-Motyka pointed out, electricity is becoming a bigger part of the total energy picture with the rapid rise of EVs, the wider adoption of heat pumps and battery energy storage.

""We have electrification of a number of sectors now,"" she said. ""So, this clean energy growth is really cleaning up other sectors.""

Sam Kimmins, director of energy at the nonprofit Climate Group, told Newsweek via email that Ember's work ""highlights a new milestone"" in the economics of clean energy as companies demand the cheaper, faster power that renewables offer.

""Their purchasing power and influence is re-making the energy system,"" Kimmins said. ""Governments risk losing business to more competitive markets if they fail to act quickly to improve access to renewables.""

Brendan Pierpont directs electricity modeling at the independent energy think tank Energy Innovation. Pierpont said the growth of wind and solar globally shows that these are the ""cheapest sources of new electrons"" and are quickly becoming more competitive with coal and gas.

""Global renewable energy deployment keeps exceeding our expectations,"" Pierpont told Newsweek, as actual measures of wind and solar deployment outdo the forecasts from major monitoring organizations like the International Energy Agency.

""It's getting cheaper and easier to integrate these resources on grids as the cost of complementary resources like energy storage also falls in tandem,"" he said.

Clean energy expert Mark Jacobson is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Atmosphere and Energy Program. Jacobson told Newsweek via email that Ember research is ""positive news,"" but said he is not quite ready to declare a turning point in the energy transition until he sees a sustained trend in which ""fossil fuel use continues to drop while renewables rise over a two-year period.""

Jacobson said the Ember research also points to the potential gains from rooftop solar and energy efficiency improvements to further blunt demand for electricity from the grid.

He used two leading clean energy states in the U.S., California and Texas, as an example of what's possible through efficiency. While both states have added enormous amounts of wind, solar and battery storage, ""the average person in California uses 40 percent of the electricity as the average person in Texas"" due to energy efficiency measures for buildings and appliances, he said.

Jacobson said the U.S. could match or exceed the drop in fossil generation that China saw in the first half of this year if it pursued a more aggressive development of renewable energy. However, he said, the Trump administration's energy strategy is moving in the other direction, encouraging more use of gas and coal.

""The challenge is that the U.S. has now embarked on a policy to stop renewable growth and increase fossil fuel growth,"" Jacobson said, ""potentially slowing the world's efforts to reach a real turning point in the energy transition.""

Wiatros-Motyka said Ember's data indicates that the clean transition is ""unstoppable"" and the trend of fossil fuel displacement will continue.

""More than half the world's economies are already past the peak of fossil fuels,"" she said. ""So, there is no turning back now, I believe, from this moment.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2729096/clean-energy-growth-illustration.png,N,,2025-10-07 12:08:39.983564

Together, these universities represent one of the most research-intensive coalitions in the nation, uniquely positioned to address the complex challenges at the intersection of environment, economy, and community.

This year, RU4M launched the Liveable Futures Initiative, a platform designed to catalyze collaborative, cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive in the face of climate change, flooding, pollution, and other sustainability challenges. The initiative fosters partnerships, funds seed projects, and accelerates innovation aimed at making Michigan — and the Great Lakes region — a global hub for sustainable solutions.

As a sponsor of the Sustainable Urban Design Summit (SUDS), RU4M is amplifying this mission, bringing academic research into conversation with practitioners, policymakers, and community leaders. Detroitisit spoke with Dr. Britany Affolter-Caine, executive director of RU4M, and Vince Nystrom, program director, about the power of collaboration, the role of research universities in Michigan’s sustainability journey, and the opportunities ahead.

REGISTER FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN DESIGN SUMMIT 2025 , NOV, 6 AT NEWLAB DETROIT HERE.

How does RU4M’s collaborative model strengthen Michigan’s ability to tackle complex issues like climate resilience and sustainability?

Britany Affolter-Caine: Michigan is fortunate to have four of the nation’s highest-intensity research universities, and not every state can say that. Each brings deep expertise, but when we connect them, align agendas, and foster collaboration, the impact multiplies. Sustainability challenges — from climate change to clean water access — are too big for any single institution to solve alone.

That’s why we launched the Liveable Futures Initiative. It’s designed to seed and support collaborative research across institutions that directly addresses the issues shaping Michigan’s future: flooding, water quality, microplastics, algae blooms, and infrastructure resilience. It’s about creating solutions that make this state not just livable, but thriving, for generations to come.

How do you align the unique strengths of Michigan State, Michigan Tech, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State toward common goals?

Vince Nystrom: We start by mapping the research landscape in detail — tracking projects, funding, and outputs across institutions. Over the last five years, these universities have generated more than a billion dollars in sustainability research. By aggregating that data, we can see where expertise already overlaps and where it can be complementary.

For example, some universities are deeply invested in hydrogen research as a clean energy source, while others focus on water infrastructure or materials science. RU4M’s role is to connect these dots, highlight opportunities for collaboration, and make sure the state and industry partners know how to tap into this expertise when real-world challenges arise.

There’s often tension between environmental stewardship and economic growth. How does RU4M view this balance?

Affolter-Caine: For us, it’s not “either/or” — it’s the power of and. Sustainability and economic growth can reinforce one another if approached strategically. Take mobility: when new facilities are being built, like the Los Alamos-linked AI center in Ypsilanti Township, the conversation isn’t just about technology. It’s also about environmental standards, community impact, and long-term resilience.

Nystrom: At the research level, we see this duality all the time. Michigan State is testing bioreactors to reduce farm runoff. Michigan Tech is advancing natural resource management alongside engineering solutions. These projects protect the environment while building new industries, jobs, and opportunities.

Water is central to Michigan’s identity. What do you see as the most pressing water-related challenges, and how are universities helping address them?

Affolter-Caine: Flooding is a major one. Detroit has seen catastrophic flooding in recent years, and the Midland dam failure was another wake-up call. We need smarter infrastructure and policy solutions, and our universities are leading research on both fronts.

Microplastics are another urgent issue. Bills are moving through the Michigan Senate right now, and researchers are at the table providing science-based guidance. That’s where our role is so critical — connecting cutting-edge science with policy and practice.

Nystrom: Beyond urban flooding and water quality, there’s also a huge economic and ecological dimension. From rebuilding the Soo Locks to protecting outdoor recreation, water drives both industry and community life here. Universities are advancing technologies for oil spill prevention, fresh water protection, and agricultural water efficiency.

From your vantage point, what role will AI and advanced manufacturing play in tackling sustainability challenges?

Britany Affolter-Caine: AI is one of our verticals, and we’re seeing it play two roles. On the one hand, researchers are advancing AI itself as a technology. On the other, more and more teams are using AI as a tool to accelerate their own work. For example, when we faced the challenge of PFAS contamination, AI helped identify and map the many different compounds — short- and long-chain variants — much faster than traditional methods. That kind of pattern recognition and data processing makes it possible to reach solutions more quickly.

Vince Nystrom: What’s powerful about AI is that it operates both as a standalone sector and as an enabler across every other sector. Whether it’s mobility, clean energy, or water, AI is being embedded into research and development as a force multiplier. Advanced manufacturing works in much the same way — it provides the tools and methods that make scaling these innovations possible.

How are students being prepared to enter careers at this intersection of science, sustainability, and economic development?

Affolter-Caine: RU4M acts as a conduit, ensuring industry needs are reflected in university programs. We ask employers what skills they’re looking for, feed that information back into curricula, and track how students are graduating into these critical fields.

Nystrom: The entrepreneurial piece is also growing. Each university has accelerators, incubators, and programs that encourage students to build their own ventures. We’ve already seen spinouts ranging from advanced materials to clean-tech startups. In fact, one in five of our alumni become entrepreneurs — and many are now tackling sustainability challenges directly.

When you look ahead, where can Michigan lead most strongly in the global sustainability conversation?

Affolter-Caine: Water is where we have unmatched potential. Few regions in the world can rival Michigan’s freshwater resources or the scale of expertise we’ve built around them. At the same time, energy storage and clean mobility will be critical. But water innovation — quality, management, resilience — is where we can truly lead.

Nystrom: Michigan gets called the “Saudi Arabia of water.” That abundance comes with responsibility. If we manage it wisely, Michigan can set the standard globally for how water is protected, leveraged, and sustained for both economy and environment.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-9.12.54-AM-1024x722.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:33.556476

The launch of a new renewable natural gas facility marks a major clean energy milestone in South Jersey.

A partnership among Opal Fuels, South Jersey Industries and the Atlantic County Utilities Authority developed the project. According to an Oct. 6 announcement, the RNG facility is now fully operational at the ACUA landfill in Egg Harbor Township. It marks a first-of-its-kind renewable energy development for the region.

Located on ACUA’s solid waste landfill site, the facility captures methane gas generated from decomposing waste and refines it into renewable natural gas. It not only cuts greenhouse gas emissions but also turns what was once waste into a sustainable source of local energy.

The facility has a nameplate capacity of 2,500 standard cubic feet per minute of landfill gas. It is expected to produce more than 650,000 MMBtu annually — the equivalent of more than 4.6 million gallons of gasoline each year. The facility will distribute the fuel into the South Jersey Gas pipeline system, a subsidiary of SJI.

This marks the company’s first RNG project to deliver renewable fuel directly into its network.

First, not last

“We are thrilled to cut the ribbon on this project, which signifies another significant milestone for SJI,” said Chet Benham, president of SJI Renewable Energy Ventures.

“The launch of this facility marks an important milestone in Opal Fuels’ mission of turning waste into clean, domestic energy,” said Opal Fuels co-CEO Adam Comora. “This project reduces emissions, improves local air quality, creates jobs, and strengthens American energy independence.”

“ACUA is proud to continue its long history of innovation by becoming the first public solid waste facility in New Jersey to host an RNG project,” said ACUA President Matthew DeNafo. “Because of the shared environmental leadership among OPAL, SJI and ACUA, landfill gas is now a renewable energy source for our community.”

Benham added, “This project underscores our commitment to innovation and continuing efforts in renewable energy solutions.”

U.S. light-vehicle sales rose 3.5% year-over-year in September, reaching a 16.4 million SAAR.

BEVs reached a record 11.8% market share as buyers took advantage of expiring tax credits.

Industry forecasts now project 15.9 million total light-vehicle sales for 2025.

New light-vehicle sales in the United States climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.4 million units in September 2025, up 3.5% from a year earlier, as buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. According to the NADA’s September Market Beat report, the strong performance was driven in part by “pull-ahead” demand ahead of the credit deadline.

Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales reached a record 11.8% of all new vehicles sold, nearly two percentage points higher than in August. BEVs also recorded a 24.1% year-over-year increase in the third quarter and accounted for 8.4% of total new vehicle sales through the first nine months of 2025, up 0.7 percentage points from the same period last year. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) models, which were also eligible for the federal incentive, maintained a flat 1.7% monthly market share and 1.8% year-to-date share.

Analysts said the strong September performance reflected consumers rushing to take advantage of the final days of the tax credit. The surge helped offset slowing growth earlier in the quarter as automakers faced tariff pressures and rising production costs.

According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per new vehicle rose slightly from August to $3,116, with more funds directed toward EVs. Incentive spending represented 6.1% of the average vehicle’s sticker price, compared with 4.8% for non-EVs.

Inventory levels also showed modest improvement. Combined dealer and in-transit light-vehicle inventory reached 2.65 million units by the end of September, up 6.2% from August but still 5.9% below the same period last year.

Automakers, including GM, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Honda, and Tesla, all gained market share through September, while Nissan and Volkswagen reported declines. Crossovers continued to dominate the market with a 49.2% share, followed by pickups at 18.7%.

Despite ongoing concerns about tariffs and upcoming model-year price hikes, industry analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Given the stronger-than-expected performance through the third quarter, the full-year 2025 light-vehicle sales forecast has been raised to 15.9 million units.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10072025-NADA-Market-Beat-Sept-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 09:59:27.202822

“Australian households and small businesses have already embraced rooftop solar in record numbers, with more than 4.2 million having made the switch, and 800,000 of those from Victoria, while large-scale renewable developers are building utility solar at pace,” said Con Hristodoulidis, general manager – distributed energy, Clean Energy Council.

Under the program, a 200kW solar system generating around 600kWh per day could reduce energy costs, improving cash flow for businesses while lowering emissions and operating expenses.

According to Hristodoulidis, the commercial and industrial sector – long seen as the “missing middle” between household and utility-scale renewables – stands to benefit significantly from the initiative. He noted that large rooftops, such as those on warehouses and supermarkets, offer strong potential for solar generation, reducing payback periods and easing energy costs for both businesses and consumers.

The IEA’s expectations for U.S. renewable capacity growth are now aligned with unfavorable policies for clean energy this decade.

In its annual Renewables 2025 report out on Tuesday, the agency slashed its growth forecasts for clean energy capacity extensions by 45% compared to the growth of about 500 gigawatts (GW) expected last year.

“The forecast for the United States is revised down by almost 50%,” the IEA said.

“This reflects several policy changes, including the earlier phase out of federal tax credits, new import restrictions, the suspension of new offshore wind leasing and restricting the permitting of onshore wind and solar PV projects on federal land.”

Last month, the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) quarterly report showed that the clean power development pipeline showed virtually no growth, expanding by less than 100 MW to 184.5 GW, solar installations slumped by 23% in the first half of 2025, and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) plummeted. These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” ACP said.

“Federal policy actions from nearly every department and an unstable tariff environment have led to a drop in clean power purchasing and planning for the future—despite skyrocketing demand nationwide,” the association added.

U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy has estimated that almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled since President Trump took office.

The IEA’s expectations for U.S. renewable capacity growth are now aligned with unfavorable policies for clean energy this decade. But the Paris-based agency strongly promoting renewables has also cut its growth projections for global additions and for additions in China, the world’s biggest renewables market.

Growth estimates for the world and in China were revised down by 5% each compared to the 2024 forecast.

“China’s shift from fixed tariffs to auctions is impacting project economics and lowering growth expectations,” the IEA said.

The upcoming model is expected to be based on existing manufacturing and design platforms, making it more accessible without requiring a complete redesign.
Tesla has faced slowing demand for its ageing line-up, while rivals in China and Europe continue to gain ground.
Even so, Tesla reported a rise in sales across several European countries in September.
Earlier this year, the company launched a refreshed Model Y featuring new light bars and a rear touchscreen.","Tesla is expected to unveil a more affordable version of its best-selling Model Y SUV on Tuesday, aiming to reverse declining sales and shrinking market share amid increasing global competition. CEO Elon Musk has long promised mass-market electric vehicles, although plans for a new $25,000 EV were scrapped last year.

The upcoming model is expected to be based on existing manufacturing and design platforms, making it more accessible without requiring a complete redesign.

Over the weekend, Tesla stirred anticipation by posting teaser clips on social media showing headlights and a spinning wheel alongside the date “10/7”, the US format for October 7. Unlike previous major launches, there is no indication of an in-person event, but analysts, investors, and fans are expecting an announcement.

Key details such as price, driving range, and cost-cutting measures remain uncertain. Last year, Musk indicated the vehicle would be priced below $30,000 after US EV tax credits.

Those credits, however, expired at the end of September, effectively raising prices by $7,500 and prompting a temporary boost in sales ahead of the deadline. Analysts expect demand to slow in the months ahead unless Tesla’s new budget-friendly option helps offset the impact.

“The desire to buy the car is very high,” Musk said during Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call in July. “It’s just that people don’t have enough money in the bank account to buy it. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

Musk previously indicated that production would begin by the end of June, but Tesla later clarified that only “first builds” had been completed. The company now expects the new model to reach customers sometime during the final quarter of the year.

Tesla has faced slowing demand for its ageing line-up, while rivals in China and Europe continue to gain ground. Musk’s increasingly polarising political views have also dented brand loyalty in some key markets. Even so, Tesla reported a rise in sales across several European countries in September.

Earlier this year, the company launched a refreshed Model Y featuring new light bars and a rear touchscreen. Musk is also shifting focus toward artificial intelligence projects such as robotaxis and humanoid robots, with plans to introduce more affordable vehicles, including a simplified version of the Model 3 sedan.

Delivering affordable cars is crucial for Tesla’s goal of producing 20 million vehicles over the next decade. This target is part of ambitious milestones tied to Musk’s proposed $1 trillion pay package approved by the company’s board.

Party leaders in Congress once boasted about finding conservative solutions to global warning, and rank-and-file lawmakers discussed pressure from constituents and activists to act. Now, President Donald Trump’s pro-fossil-fuel ethos is firmly in control.

A handful of Republicans lawmakers still talk about the need to promote renewable energy, but they are increasingly isolated in a party focused on fighting what conservatives call the Democrats’ “Green New Scam.”

“We seem to be in a political retrograde, and yet emissions continue to rise,” said Republican Alex Flint, executive director of the group Alliance for Market Solutions, a conservative group focused on reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.

A lot has changed in a fairly short time. In 2016, House Republicans started joining a bipartisan caucus focused on climate solutions. And in 2019, GOP star pollster Frank Luntz urged the federal government to act on climate, publicly disavowing comments he made 20 years prior.

After Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 and Democrats regained control of Congress, then-House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) created a task force to deal with climate and conservation issues.

Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, now the Republican whip, five years ago talked up “climate resilience” and at one point said of GOP lawmakers, “We all believe climate change is real. We believe mankind is certainly contributing to that.”

Asked last week about action on climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Barrasso said, “Finally, the Republicans are doing the right thing to become energy dominant for this nation in spite of the fact Joe Biden put our head in the noose in the fight against China by shutting down American energy and prioritizing climate over energy that’s available, affordable and reliable.”

Trump himself has repeatedly called human-made climate change a hoax. And Energy Secretary Chris Wright called the international Paris climate agreement “silly.”

The conservative and bipartisan climate caucuses do still exist on Capitol Hill, and so do a small number of Hill Republicans who talk openly about climate change — including Sens. John Curtis of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.

But while dozens of House Republicans signaled their support for protecting renewable energy tax incentives, the party was largely unified in voting to phase them out.

Murkowski and Curtis did help strike a last-minute deal to make that phase-out more lenient. But they have not pushed back, at least not publicly, on the administration’s plans to roll back an EPA decision that underpins federal regulations against greenhouse gas emissions. Murkowski said the move was “not unexpected.”

Tom Pyle, head of the conservative Institute for Energy Research, said, “The climate wing of the GOP has been clipped by reality. Heck, even the Democrats aren’t talking about climate anymore.”

Interviews with lawmakers, advocates and administration officials show how the landscape for climate action feels much different under Trump 2.0 — with many Republicans moving away from well worn arguments against picking winners and losers in energy.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) say the shift in his party is a reaction to Biden-era green energy policies, which he said were too harsh on fossil fuels.

“We had everybody saying you just got to go all renewable, forget the reasonable transition. Now, you got people going the opposite direction,” said Tillis, a moderate who is retiring from Congress next year.

“I think most members are still in the same place,” said Tillis. “Intuitively, they know it’s an all-of-the-above strategy.”

Others attribute the GOP’s increased hostility to wind and solar on the administration’s rhetoric and the decreasing prominence of climate change as an electoral issue.

“The sobering lesson we may be learning is that Trump has correctly judged that politics is about the short term — the consequences be damned,” Flint said.

Clean energy Republicans are not gone, said Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations at the sustainability group Ceres. They are just “shell-shocked” by administration actions.

Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a group that works with Republicans on climate and renewable energy issues, said: “No one has successfully gotten in Trump’s bull’s-eye and withstood it.”

She said, “House members being singled out by the president, in any administration — that’s tough. In this administration, that could be the end of a congressional career: ‘Why should I stick my head out on something that’s not a top voter issue?'”

The election results are a big reason why Democrats are joining climate-minded Republicans in highlighting the economic benefits of renewable energy development rather than its benefits for the planet.

“Those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).

Reams said of climate-minded Republicans, “I think we are in an evolving time. It’s not like we’ve gone from A to B. … I think we are amidst the journey, and we haven’t landed on anything else. It’s kind of hard to put your finger on it.”

Chris Barnard, president of the right-wing American Conservation Coalition, said, “I think the way that we framed it is like — ‘the climate hawk is dead, what comes next?’ And it should be something that aligns energy dominance needs with reindustrialization, with climate co-benefits as a result,” Barnard said. “It’s just a new way of approaching and thinking about these issues.”

Advocates on the left say the Republican Party has had plenty of time to show its true colors on climate action.

“I think assuming congressional Republicans are going to stick up for renewable energy is a mistake,” said Emily Becker, a deputy director at the center-left think tank Third Way. “How many times do we need to touch a hot stove?”

‘All folded like origami’

Republicans’ posture toward clean energy and climate change was on full display during this year’s monthslong fight to pass their One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

GOP moderates, particularly in the House, ceded ground on renewable energy, allowing the near-immediate phase-outs of wind and solar tax credits. The Senate eased but didn’t prevent the incentives’ demise.

Even though the megalaw preserved credits for geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear, House moderates caved when it came to extending tax credits for wind and solar — even after 21 GOP members signed letters urging leniency.

The night before the House voted on its version, Garbarino stormed out of the speaker’s office saying he was “not happy.” Garbarino, co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, ended up missing that early morning roll call but said he would have supported the legislation.

“They all folded like origami,” Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said of the 21 Republicans. “Even to the detriment of their own districts, where these investments have been made. It just hasn’t grown into a policy-making effort. It seems it’s maybe political cover for them.”

But reflecting later on the chain of events, Garbarino rejected accusations that his pro-renewable-energy positions were political cover.

“If it wasn’t for the work prior to the Big Beautiful Bill, everything would have been repealed right away. It was the work we did, both publicly and behind the scenes, both here in the House and Senate, I think that got us to the final language,” the New Yorker said.

“Was the final language perfect? No, the language wasn’t perfect on a lot of things, but it was not a full repeal which a lot of people demanded. I am happy. I am satisfied with what we got in the bill. … It gives people time.”

Sarah Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, which mostly supports Democrats, said pro-renewables advocacy from some Republicans has been positive. The group has launched a $4 million campaign to denounce what it calls the “Big Ugly Bill.”

“I don’t want to greenwash it, but I think how some Republicans in Congress are now talking about clean energy as something we need to get on the grid for energy security and to lower cost impacts is an important shift from even five years ago,” she said.

What about Miller-Meeks?

One key player appeared to be working mostly behind the scenes: Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), who chairs the House’s Conservative Climate Caucus.

Last year, the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) named Miller-Meeks renewable energy champion of the year, and she defended the clean energy credits to top tax Republican Rep. Jason Smith in April. But the swing state congresswoman was relatively quiet during the late-stage public fights over the credits.

Miller-Meeks’ approach was a departure from that of Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 when he was a House member. As caucus leader, Curtis was one of the most vocal GOP representatives when it came to climate issues and has continued that work in the Senate.

With Tillis and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Curtis helped delay fast confirmation of some administration nominees over renewable energy concerns and how the administration would implement the phase-out of incentives.

Curtis has also reached out to conservatives like fellow Utah, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Sen. Mike Lee. “We’ve talked more about what I’m doing, and I’ll just say: He’s not very critical of what I’m doing,” said Curtis.

In an email through her office, Miller-Meeks defended her work, saying the tax credits ended up “in a far better position than I could have hoped this time last year.”

“When we sent the first letter, to Speaker Johnson, asserting Republican support for a more comprehensive conversation on energy tax credits we were fighting against full repeal,” she wrote.

“As more projects were built and came online, the urgency of meeting demand for AI and meetings the energy needs of AI increased, and politization died down, and a reasonable conversation about the benefits of the tax credits emerged.”

Miller-Meeks, who is facing a tough reelection fight, said she helped educate House Republican colleagues about the benefits of renewable energy tax credits and ended up with a compromise.

“But after many conversations with a variety of stakeholders everyone understands the timeline and good projects will continue to be built,” she said.

The group Climate Power, which has Democratic ties, says the GOP agenda is threatening more than 100 clean energy projects and thousands of jobs.

“The credits were never going to last forever and the is a reasonable runway for businesses to meet US energy needs and continue to build out and strengthen our energy system,” said Miller-Meeks.

‘Things appear to be worse’

Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who founded the Climate Solutions Caucus in 2016, said that while Trump may be shifting rightward on climate, the megabill fight actually signaled that not all Hill Republicans are following.

“On the surface, things appear to be worse,” said Curbelo. “Trump 2.0 is definitely looking at climate and energy issues through the lens of the culture wars. Certainly that’s a lot more prevalent in the administration than it was the first time around.”

But beneath the surface, Republican support has not diminished, Curbelo argued — in fact, on the Hill, the opposite is true. He pointed to a failed amendment from Lee that would have scrapped the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy. It went down 21-79.

Curbelo says it’s notable that at least some of the Democrats’ 2022 climate law survived this year when Republicans in 2023 expressed support for full repeal under pressure from the far right during debt ceiling negotiations.

“It depends on your perspective and where you want to start measuring from,” Curbelo said. “But certainly anyone should have expected this to be a major target for the Republican trifecta and the truth is we landed somewhere between the scalpel and the sledgehammer approach and I think significant investments were protected.”

Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell unseated Curbelo in 2018 elections. She was then ousted by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez, who went from stressing climate issues as mayor of Miami-Dade County to downplaying them in Congress.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/eb/ae/c28c2ce64ffcba39a1ee51649e98/congress-tax-cuts-84663.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 06:59:43.948468

But a major shift in federal policy could put the brakes on that momentum. The federal tax credit for electric vehicles has officially expired, putting what was once viewed as the future of driving in jeopardy.

For years, the $7,500 credit helped make EVs more affordable. It boosted consumer demand and pushed automakers to invest heavily in electric models.

Now, without that incentive, executives warn of a sharp drop in EV sales. Ford's CEO says market share could fall to just 4% to 5% by year's end.

Dealers currently sit on about 134,000 unsold EVs — that's roughly two months' worth of inventory at current sales rates.

To soften the blow, some automakers are stepping in. Ford and GM are offering lease deals that mimic the credit. Hyundai is cutting prices on certain models.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-10-07 10:33:04+00:00,NPR,A tribe in Arizona planned to connect 600 homes to electricity. Then the funding was cut - NPR,"Nate Perez, Ryan Kellman",,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5453913/trump-hopi-tribes-native-americans-clean-energy,"Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity.
The Hopi were approved for a $25 million grant to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.","For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.

But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States.

Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.

""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.

The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing nearly $2 billion to tribes to invest in renewable energy.

The Hopi were approved for a $25 million grant to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.

But in August, the Trump administration terminated the Solar for All program, calling it wasteful.

Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.

""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

A game changer for tribes

The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated 54,000 tribal members across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.

""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when tribes were often left out as energy infrastructure was built across the West.

""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.

The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.

The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.

Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.

Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.

But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.

""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a video posted to the agency's YouTube account.

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.

But Pilar Thomas, who practices tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.

""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""

The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.

For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and about 85% of the Hopi's revenue vanished.

The unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%, nearly three times higher than the national average.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.

In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.

Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.

""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""

Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.

"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.

Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""

The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.

"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2Fb0%2Ff8fbbecb40d099875bbcdaffb72a%2F0b6a3014.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:00:25.103631

Trump and DOGE have gutted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which enforces the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Superfund Act, as well as the Department of the Interior, which enforces the Surface Mining Act (for coal), the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and also manages the National Park System. Trump has also fired experienced environmental lawyers and Inspectors General from the EPA, the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Justice Department, and U.S. Attorney's Offices, where these laws are enforced in federal courts. He is making it nearly impossible to implement these laws, thereby allowing industrial and other polluters to damage the environment with impunity. He has also caused the removal of interactive pages from federal websites related to climate change and environmental justice.

In the Department of the Interior, Trump has opened millions of acres of protected public lands and the offshore continental shelf to oil and gas leasing. He recently opened 13 million acres of federal lands to more coal mining and is pushing to restart obsolete, polluting, and expensive coal-fired power plants. His MAGA House and Senate supporters are still trying to legislatively order a massive sell-off of public lands to offset their tax breaks for millionaires. His complicit Supreme Court has recently weakened the standards for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), meaning that there will be less stringent reviews of proposed development projects on Federal Lands.

His minions at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have proposed changing the definition of ""harm"" under the Endangered Species Act to exclude habitat destruction—the primary way in which threatened and endangered species are harmed. His U.S. Forest Service minions have announced a vastly expanded production of timber from National Forests while also cutting the budget for forest firefighters. He has again withdrawn the United States from the international Paris Accord climate treaty and has cut all funding and tax incentives for electric vehicles and solar power. He continues to deny that climate change is happening or caused by human pollution, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and his EPA chief has proposed reversing the “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act that forms the basis for EPA to promulgate rules regulating CO2 and methane in the atmosphere.

In short, the Trump Administration is a disaster for the human and natural environment. It threatens the entire system of environmental and public lands protections that Congress has enacted over the last sixty years. It is madness: Protecting the profits of industry in the short run to guarantee the destruction of the environment in the long run.

The Sierra Club, Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Southern Environmental Law Center, and the Environmental Defense Fund, among others, have filed dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration and have achieved considerable success. For instance, EarthJustice's suit against the USDA for deleting climate data from its website resulted in the USDA restoring the data. A lawsuit by the NRDC led to the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington issuing a preliminary injunction, lifting the Trump administration's unlawful freeze on federal funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. Several courts have ordered the Trump administration to spend money appropriated by Congress for environmental programs and personnel that it had illegally impounded, but the Supreme Court has recently allowed Trump to go forward with many of his firings and personnel cuts.

So, what can you do to help? You can financially support the Sierra Club and the environmental law groups mentioned above in their efforts to thwart Trump's actions. You can write or call your Congressional representatives and respectfully but heartily protest. You can write letters to the editors of newspapers, put statements on your blog posts or social media sites, and show up for public protests. The worst thing you can do is to sit it out and hope the nightmare ends.

Without your activism and that of millions of other Americans, there is no chance of reversing the disaster that Trump is bringing to the American people and the world.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:06.623994

The potential launch comes as the company moves to offset the loss of US federal incentives for electric vehicles.

Sources said the new entry-level Model Y is the vehicle the company hinted at in social media posts over the weekend.

The cheaper variant will drop some features and use less expensive materials to help counterbalance the end of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that ceased this month.

Executives indicated on the company’s latest earnings call that production of the lower-cost model began in June, but the decision was taken to delay scaling up output until after the US phased out the incentives.

Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja and Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering, offered few specifics at the time, before Elon Musk clarified the model in question.

“It’s the Model Y,” Musk said, adding that he would “let the cat out of the bag”.

He continued: “The desire to buy the car is very high, it’s just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it. So, the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

The company reduced costs on the Model Y partly by concentrating on the battery pack and motor, the sources said.

Last week, Tesla reported global deliveries of 497,099 vehicles for the July to September period, a quarterly record.

Tesla does not provide regional breakdowns, but with Europe and China weaker this year, the increase likely reflected stronger US demand.

While the expiry of the tax credits lifted sales ahead of the deadline, the pull-forward could weigh on electric vehicle demand in the coming months.

Musk cautioned in July that the company could face “a few rough quarters” after US incentives end.

According to Kings Research, the global tubular solar collector market was valued at USD 5,450.0 million in 2023 and is projected to expand from USD 5,724.1 million in 2024 to USD 8,394.2 million by 2031, registering a CAGR of 5.62% during the forecast period.

This expansion is supported by rising adoption of solar thermal technologies in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, as well as government-backed incentives for clean energy, advances in hybrid solar systems, and increasing awareness of carbon reduction.

Tubular solar collectors utilize evacuated glass tubes to absorb solar radiation and transfer thermal energy to a heat transfer fluid. A vacuum between the inner and outer tubes reduces heat loss, enhancing efficiency even in low-light and cold-weather conditions. These systems are widely applied for residential heating, commercial water heating, and industrial thermal processes, offering a low-carbon, energy-efficient solution.

Kings Research identifies the following growth accelerators for the tubular solar collector market

Strong Government Incentives and Policy Frameworks

The IEA reports that in 2023, global renewable heat consumption is rising, with solar-thermal use in buildings projected to grow ~40% during 2023–2028. Under the updated Renewable Energy Directive (RED III, 2023), the EU has set a binding target for at least 42.5% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030.

In India, the MNRE’s renewable targets aim for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, reinforcing the country’s push for solar and thermal systems (Source: www.pib.gov.in). In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act extends the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for eligible renewable energy projects (including solar technologies) through at least 2025, aiding deployment of solar thermal and related technologies.

Advancements in Solar Technology

Ongoing innovations such as selective coatings, advanced insulation, automated smart controllers, and hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems are significantly improving efficiency and lowering costs. Hybrid collectors integrating PV and thermal functions are enabling dual energy generation, improving energy independence and space efficiency.

Rising Demand for Hybrid Solar Systems

The integration of tubular solar collectors with PV panels is an emerging trend that enables simultaneous production of electricity and heat. This dual function increases system ROI and makes adoption more appealing for residential and commercial applications.

Commercial & Industrial Sector Adoption The commercial sector accounted for 52% of market share in 2023, driven by demand for energy-efficient heating in offices, hospitals, and hotels. Industrial applications, such as process heating, are also increasingly adopting solar thermal solutions to offset fossil fuel costs and emissions.

Tubular solar collectors offer critical benefits for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors

Operational Efficiency: Low-maintenance systems reduce downtime and enhance long-term reliability.

Cost Savings: Extended equipment life and lower operating costs reduce overall expenditure.

Sustainability: Eco-friendly designs contribute to emissions reduction and compliance with climate policies.

Energy Independence: Hybrid systems and TES integration provide stable energy supply while reducing reliance on grid power.

Regional Outlook

Asia-Pacific: Leading with 36.63% share (USD 1,996.3 million in 2023), driven by large-scale adoption in China, India, and Japan. Favorable policies, rapid industrialization, and off-grid demand strengthen growth, with a projected CAGR of 6.19% (2024–2031).

Europe: Expected CAGR of 5.82%, underpinned by EU carbon-neutrality goals, strong subsidy frameworks, and ongoing technological innovation.

North America: Growth supported by tax credits, rising commercial adoption, and integration into green building certifications (LEED).

Middle East & Africa: Increasing adoption in UAE and Saudi Arabia, leveraging high solar irradiance and government diversification programs under Vision 2030 initiatives.

Soon, though, it may be out of their hands. A BlackRock-owned private equity firm is set to take over the parent company of central Indiana’s electricity monopoly, AES Indiana.

Indiana and Indianapolis need to work together to stop this.

What are private equity firms?

Private equity firms purchase companies with the intent of selling them for profit. They often cut staffing, equipment and put companies in debt to do so, at the expense of their long-term sustainability.

When most people think of private equity, BlackRock is one of the first firms that comes to mind. It is a multinational investment firm and the largest asset manager in the world.

State Treasurer Daniel Elliott put BlackRock on a watchlist last year and ultimately banned it from managing Indiana’s public retirement funds because of its environmental, social and governance commitments, in an attempt to keep “politics out of investments.” ESG commitments include things like a corporation's social mission or cultural agenda that it can't necessarily monetize.

A spokesperson for Elliott declined to comment on the sale.

BlackRock has also invested in companies involved in human rights violations in China, according to the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.

In purchasing a public utility, private equity firms like BlackRock could pass on debt to consumers and lower service quality to extract profit with no consequences, as consumers have no alternatives.

These firms likely see a route to quick profits selling electricity to data centers, fueled by an economy high on artificial intelligence and subsidized by massive state tax breaks.

Blackstone, another private equity firm, bought almost 20% of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. LLC last year. NIPSCO then planned several solar farms and other infrastructure investments and passed costs onto consumers. It is also planning additional natural gas plants to power data centers.

The result was the highest jump in electricity prices of any utility in Indiana over the last year, 26%. For some customers, that meant an increase of $50 per month.

Indiana should ban sale of public utilities to private equity

State Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, who authored a law banning Indiana’s public retirement system from investing in China, opposes the sale of AES Indiana to a firm controlled by BlackRock.

“BlackRock's focus on short-term profits contradicts the long-term interests of Hoosier ratepayers who rely on stable and affordable energy,” Garten told me. “By prioritizing their ESG beliefs over the financial well-being of our communities, BlackRock threatens to undermine our energy independence and economic stability.”

“It is vital that we protect the interests of Indiana residents by opposing this acquisition and ensuring that our utility companies remain accountable to those they serve, rather than to the ideological pursuits of distant investors,” he added.

There is very little that Indiana can do to stop the merger, however, said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizen’s Action Coalition.

“By choice, the state has virtually no authority,” he said, citing a decision by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on a recent merger of two utilities, in which it claimed to have no “approval jurisdiction” over the transaction.

State legislators would likely have to enact a law during the next legislative session to do anything about it.

Such legislation could do several things. It could give the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission “approval jurisdiction” over purchases of public utilities. Then it could ban private equity companies from buying a controlling stake in Indiana’s public utilities. It could also force private equity companies that already own a controlling stake to sell their stock to a municipality or another local owner, ideally a nonprofit.

Indianapolis should buy AES Indiana

If the state does not take action, Indianapolis could offer to buy AES Indiana.

Almost 50 years ago, the city was granted the authority to buy public utilities using revenue bonds, a tool frequently used to fund multimillion-dollar school improvements.

Indianapolis last exercised this right in 2002 with the purchase of the Indianapolis Water Company for $515 million. The city contracted with another company to manage the utility until selling it to Citizens Energy, a nonprofit, public charitable trust, in 2011.

The City-County Council could grant Mayor Joe Hogsett the authority to strike a deal to purchase AES Indiana. It would be an excellent way for the Mayor to begin to fix his public image during a scandal-filled third term.

Jesse Brown, an east-side City-County Council Democrat, supported the idea after I asked him about it.

“Indianapolis should purchase AES Indiana and run it ourselves,” he said on X, after I showed him the portion of Indiana code that allows the city to do so. “If we can use revenue bonds to finance a hotel, why not use those bonds to finance an electric utility? Guaranteed return on equity is obviously attractive to shareholders.”

Republican Councilor Michael-Paul Hart told me the idea was “worth exploring."" He later called it “a massive concept that would restore local control of our power grid.” He clarified in his newsletter, though, he wasn’t “exploring that path right now.”

Josh Bain, another Republican, told me he was open to the idea under one condition.

“I would certainly entertain the idea of Indianapolis purchasing AES, but only if the end goal is to create a true ratepayer-owned cooperative,” he told me. “I don’t trust the Hogsett administration to properly run a utility company, and the last thing we need is more government mismanagement.

“If we’re serious about this, it needs to be owned and operated by the people who pay the bills — not by city hall,” he added.

Hogsett could strike a deal with AES

To be fair, the city had an advantage in 2002 due to an ordinance from 1870 that gave it first option to purchase of the water utility. The state, however, could end its ban on municipalities forcing public utilities to sell their property and give them essentially the same power now.

It's unclear what a fair price might look like to purchase the company, though.

""The city of Indianapolis is in a better position to discuss its own processes, including views with respect to valuations,"" an AES Indiana spokesperson told me.

When AES bought Indianapolis Power and Light Co. in 2000, the transaction valued IPL much higher than AES Indiana is today. But AES Corp.'s ownership structure is more complex. While AES Corp. holds the controlling stake in AES Indiana, it owns only 82.35% of the total stock.

AES Indiana's electricity infrastructure is worth more than $5.4 billion, but much of it is financed through debt. AES Indiana's yearly revenue is around $1.6 billion. Those two points, along with AES Indiana's existing debt obligations, would likely be the key factors in determining the final purchase price. This would be paid for out of the utility's yearly operating revenue over time using bonds.

Regardless of what that final number is, it would likely be a small price to pay to save our public utility from being chopped up and sold for parts.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/03/PIND/82792770007-040325-storms-carmel-kmw-024.JPG?crop=3599,2026,x0,y391&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-07 08:03:00.069849

In North Carolina, registered Democrats still slightly outnumber registered Republicans and as multiple razor-thin Supreme Court races demonstrate, it remains a deeply “purple” state.
That said, a recent public opinion poll in North Carolina helps shine a light on what could be an important Achilles’ Heel.
The issue is gerrymandering – the drawing of political maps to rig elections for partisan purposes.","There are more than a few modern American progressives who wish that the leaders on their side of the great national political divide possessed the same commitment to hardball, take-no-prisoners politics as their conservative adversaries.

“Boy, we sure hate what they’re doing to our country,” goes the thinking that one often hears expressed, “but we wish that our side could stop pussyfooting around and learn a thing or two from the right about doing what it takes to win!”

In some ways at least, it’s an understandable sentiment. Over the last several years, progressives have watched in horror as a determined minority movement has seized control of and radicalized the nation’s laws and governmental institutions in unprecedented ways. In numerous areas – public and higher education, personal bodily autonomy, the role and rights of corporations and workers, racial and gender equality, the distribution of the nation’s wealth, separation of church and state, gun ownership, combating the climate crisis, and even America’s role in the world – the right has succeeded in overturning decades of slow but mostly steady progress and imposing a series of dramatic policy 180’s.

What’s more, to add to the frustration, the change in no way reflects any kind of significant shift in public opinion or popular values.

Rather, like so many past authoritarian movements that seized upon narrow electoral victories and, either by hook or crook, converted them into massive power shifts and policy sea changes, modern American conservatives have used passion, large doses of cynical pragmatism and an unapologetic willingness to shatter legal and societal norms to secure their objectives.

Think about it – the proof of this reality is in the numbers. Donald Trump lost the popular vote in two of the last three national elections and won less than 50% of the vote in his 2024 victory. Congress has been divided by the narrowest of margins for years. In North Carolina, registered Democrats still slightly outnumber registered Republicans and as multiple razor-thin Supreme Court races demonstrate, it remains a deeply “purple” state.

If ever there was a time in which public attitudes would seem to demand divided, middle ground government, this is it.

Instead, of course, we have the opposite. Rather than generally staying the course or pursuing incremental change, Republicans in Washington, DC and several states like North Carolina have repeatedly swung for the fences and moved with all the speed they can muster to roll back past progressive wins and lock in unpopular, ultra-right policies – like slashing taxes on the rich, disempowering workers, undermining reproductive freedom, abandoning efforts to combat climate change and militarizing law enforcement.

Will they succeed in effecting a lasting overhaul of American society?

Maybe.

While it’s true that many, if not most, hard right and authoritarian regimes in modern times have eventually foundered, Trump and company have taken some steps – perhaps most notably in the courts – that will make rooting out some of their changes quite difficult.

That said, a recent public opinion poll in North Carolina helps shine a light on what could be an important Achilles’ Heel.

The issue is gerrymandering – the drawing of political maps to rig elections for partisan purposes.

As has been well-publicized, Republicans have been moving aggressively at Trump’s specific direction of late to further gerrymander already rigged electoral maps in a handful of states they already control in hopes of retaining their narrow control of the U.S. House in the 2026 elections. This includes North Carolina, where it appears Republican legislative leaders are likely to pass legislation later this month that would eliminate chances for Democrats to prevail in the First Congressional District – a region in the state’s east that takes in most of the so-called “Black Belt,” currently represented by Democrat Don Davis.

If this effort succeeds – and some reports indicate that Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger has pledged to do the deed in exchange for a Trump endorsement in his 2026 GOP primary, although Berger has denied this — the state’s already rigged U.S. House map would shift from 10-4 Republican to 11-3.

As a new poll conducted by a GOP polling firm and released by the good government nonprofit Common Cause demonstrates convincingly, however, such a move will be enormously unpopular. The poll found that 84% of voters – including 78% of unaffiliated voters and 65% of Republicans – said gerrymandering maps for partisan advantage is “never acceptable.” Two-thirds of GOP leaders said the practice should be illegal and nearly half conceded that the current already rigged maps were likely unfairly drawn.

Could this remarkable consensus in public opinion ultimately help give rise to a shift in attitudes and behavior among enough voters (and help anger enough progressives) to help swing upcoming elections against Trump and set the nation on a different path? In such closely divided times, it certainly seems possible.

Whatever the case, the blatant and desperate nature of the scheme provides a strong indication that, like many other authoritarian fear-dependent regimes down through human history, the Trump movement is grappling with some significant fears of its own.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Redistricting-Daniel.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 05:58:18.720933

For nearly a century, the Kelley’s Falls Dam in Manchester, New Hampshire, generated as much as 2,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. When the small hydroelectric station in a downtown park came up for relicensing in 2022, its owners faced what many dam operators now expect when trying to extend the lifespan of these power generators: strict requirements that would force them to spend millions on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit. Instead, Green Mountain Power made a choice that has become common among hydroelectric operators. The utility simply surrendered its licenses.

Last year, the plant shut down.

Nearly 450 hydroelectric stations totaling more than 16 gigawatts of generating capacity are scheduled for relicensing across the United States over the next decade. That’s roughly 40% of the nonfederal fleet (the government owns about half the hydropower stations in the U.S.). The country is now on the verge of a major shift in hydropower. The facilities could be relicensed to supply the booming demand for electricity to power everything from data centers to aluminum smelters. Tech and industrial giants could even help pay for the costly relicensing process with deals like the record-setting $3 billion contract Google inked with hydropower operator Brookfield Asset Management in July for up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower. Or, as has been happening for years, the U.S. could continue to lose gigawatts of power as hydroelectric facilities shut down rather than absorb the high costs of relicensing — especially with cheaper competition from gas, wind, and solar.

The fleet of dams that helped electrify the nation starting in the late 1800s provides the second-largest share of the country’s renewable power after wind, and by far its most firm. But the average age of U.S. dams is 65 years, meaning the bulk of the fleet wasn’t built with newfangled infrastructure to enable unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife. As seen in New Hampshire, the cost of upgrading facilities to allow for that passage can soar into the tens of millions of dollars — on top of the expense of upgrading custom-built equipment for each plant. Complicating matters further, after decades of decline in the hydropower sector, the manufacturing muscle for turbines and other hardware that make a dam work has largely atrophied in the U.S.

The relicensing waiting game

The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920 to regulate hydroelectric facilities — does not give any single agency full authority over hydropower the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has over atomic energy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the key permits on the national level, but other agencies also play a role. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, may require a National Environmental Policy Act review to examine a dam’s effects on a specific fish species, a process that involves assessing multiple spawning cycles. And once that’s done for salmon, the agency may undertake yet another multiyear study on trout. FERC, meanwhile, can’t issue its licenses until state agencies overseeing waterways approve permits. That alone can eat up years.

As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)

“It takes longer to relicense an existing hydro facility than a new nuclear facility,” said Malcolm Woolf, the National Hydropower Association’s chief executive. ​“It takes just 18 months to get a new license for a nuclear plant.”

With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.

“This is major infrastructure. These facilities cost billions of dollars,” Woolf said. ​“They’re like bridges and roads. They get a license for 50 years. The state agencies view [the relicensing process] as an opportunity to extract concessions from what they view as a deep pocket.”

At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.

“One … regulator was requiring a facility to pay for a feral-pig-eradication program,” Woolf said.

“In the 1970s, maybe the industry was a deep pocket,” he added. ​“But now, with the low cost of other fuels like wind and solar and gas, it’s driving these facilities to bankruptcy and to surrender licenses.”

The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.

In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license. In Maryland, the Conowingo Dam’s relicensing process has also stretched on for two decades. In Massachusetts, the Northfield Mountain plant is in the middle of a 15-year permitting slog.

To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ​“But if they don’t have a long-term license,” Woolf warned, ​“they’re not about to invest millions in upgrades.”

One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80% of the plant’s market value into upgrades like new turbines or panels, making them eligible for bigger federal write-offs. In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department granted hydroelectric facilities the same flexibility.

But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

“The question in the hydropower industry was, if you think of the Hoover Dam, is it 80% of the electric generating equipment? Or 80% of the whole Hoover Dam and the reservoir? So that’s what the Treasury clarified,” Woolf said. ​“It’s 80% of the electric generating equipment. So if you replace a 50-year-old generator with a new generator, you’re going to satisfy that.”

While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1 executive orders on energy. In July, Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, preserving hydropower’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years. If a hydro project is built in a designated ​“energy community” and uses domestically manufactured equipment, the tax credit can cover as much as half the investment.

A fishy problem

Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as half the biomass in rivers across the country — migrate downstream to spawn as breeding-age adults.

One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.

“Fish-passage solutions can be extraordinarily expensive,” said Jennifer Garson, the former director of the Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. ​“The problem is the burden falls completely on hydropower operators to make these upgrades.”

The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019, the startup Natel Energy, which designs fish-safe hydropower turbines, installed its pilot project in Maine, then another in Oregon the following year. Natel’s technology — based on thicker blades that don’t sever fish as they move through the dam — was validated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The company won $9 million from the Energy Department to scale up its supply chain.

While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40 years old, CEO Gia Schneider said, the new Natel units produce more electricity per spin on average.

“They’re going to modernize, get fish-safe turbines that will safely pass eel, salmon, and herring that need to go through the plant, and they’ll get 5% more energy,” Schneider said.

Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency.

“At another plant where we’re working on the design, the turbines are pretty young – only installed 10 years ago,” she said. ​“There, we’re going to get maybe 0.2% less energy out.”

On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 5% to 15%.

“You’re losing a lot more from these bolt-on solutions,” she said. ​“At the end of the day, if you get 0.2% less on the turbine side, … on the whole-plant level, you’re coming out ahead.”

Old hydropower, new opportunities

At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.

Just 3% of the nation’s 80,000 dams generate electricity. In 2012, an Energy Department report found that the U.S. could add 12 gigawatts of new power by overhauling those facilities to produce electricity. More than a decade later, ​“none of it was built,” Woolf said.

There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.

And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22-year low last year after below-average snowfall, according to analysis by the Energy Information Administration. Yet other parts of the U.S., such as the Northeast, are getting wetter as the planet heats up.

While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China started construction on what will, upon completion, be the world’s largest power station, a giant hydroelectric facility in Tibet. Last month, Brazil held its first auctions for new small- and medium-size dams with hopes of turning $1 billion in investments into more hydroelectricity. And Ethiopia just opened its megadam project meant to alleviate electricity issues in the country, despite pushback from Egyptians who say the facility could negatively impact the flow of water on the Nile.

The U.S. could get in on the game, or at least work to clear away hurdles preventing the country from taking advantage of the infrastructure that already exists. As the Trump administration looks to re-shore heavy industry through tariffs, Woolf said, ​“hydropower is a great resource for colocating manufacturing because you’ve got energy infrastructure and you’re typically in fairly rural areas where land is less expensive.” For data centers, reservoirs could offer the additional service of providing water for cooling hot computer servers, along with electricity. And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power. These plants could, in theory, play that role again as new demand for domestically produced aluminum — to manufacture electric vehicles and clean-energy equipment — puts strain on the remaining six smelters.

“We know we’ve got load growth. We know we’ve got grid variability from renewables and extreme weather. The flexibility of hydropower offers clean, firm generation that is unique,” Woolf said. ​“At the same time — through quirk of history — we’ve got so much of the fleet at relicensing and at risk of surrendering permits. This could be an amazing opportunity.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydropower-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 11:00:54.034602

On a warm, sunny Saturday morning in late September, The Corner Farmers Market in Greensboro’s Lindley Park neighborhood was an inviting place to be. Throngs of people — some with kids or dogs in tow — drifted from one tent to the next, browsing tables filled with fresh vegetables, baked goods, cut flowers and handmade crafts.

Beyond the friendly atmosphere and fresh offerings, the market offers another important benefit: shoppers who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits can not only use them here — they can get double their value.

SNAP participants can visit the manager’s booth to swipe their benefits card, and the market matches the amount — up to $50 — by issuing tokens that can be used to purchase any SNAP-eligible food, market manager Kathy Newsom said.

“They can buy meat, eggs, any sorts of produce [or] prepared foods if they’re cold,” Newsom said.

While the U.S. Department of Agriculture reimburses the amount spent through SNAP, Corner Market must raise separate funds — through grants, community donations and frequent fundraisers — to cover the cost of the match, Newsom said.

“We have to raise about $50,000 a year to match the amount of demand that comes into our market.”

Market regular Dianne, 67, who preferred to use only her first name, said she appreciates that the market offers a discreet, respectful way for SNAP users to shop without stigma.

“Shopping at the market is a win for all of us,” she said. “We need the vendors, and the vendors need us.”

But cuts to the SNAP program embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by Congress threaten to jeopardize access to farmers markets for millions of Americans like Diane. In 2024, nearly 42 million people — about 12 percent of the U.S. population — received SNAP benefits each month, according to USDA data.

Because of the OBBBA, those benefits are due to shrink, with consumers and farmers taking the hits.

Mixed messages

As concerns mount about the scheduled program cuts, U.S. Health and Human Services Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to “Make America Healthy Again.”

A statement on the HHS website reads: “Under the leadership of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., HHS is taking bold, decisive action to reform America’s food, health, and scientific systems to identify the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

Yet in September, the USDA announced it would discontinue its annual Household Food Security Reports, also known as the Food Insecurity Survey — the tool used to measure how many U.S. households struggle to put food on the table. Without the survey, it’ll be hard to track how well people are doing in getting access to healthy food.

SNAP is a key federal tool for reducing food insecurity. Without it, millions of Americans would be at greater risk of hunger or be forced to eat cheaper, lower-quality food.

In North Carolina, more than 1.4 million people — across more than 700,000 households — receive SNAP benefits each month. More than 600,000 children, 159,000 adults over 65 and more than 46,000 North Carolina veterans rely on SNAP, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

In response to the federal government shutdown, the state health department assured residents that October SNAP benefits would not be affected. The agency encouraged households to continue applying for services and said it will post updates as new information becomes available from the USDA. Those with additional questions are urged to contact their local county department of social services, according to information provided on the agency’s webpage.

Mutual benefits

Maggie Funkhouser, the North Carolina Farmers Market Network program coordinator, emphasized the dual purpose of accepting SNAP benefits at farmers markets: expanding food access and supporting the local farm economy.

“[We] estimate that SNAP incentives make up about 20 percent of total sales at farmers markets — and 20 percent is huge,” Funkhouser said.

“If incentives get folks into that market to be able to buy highly nutritious, fresh, culturally relevant food — to support our farmers [and] connect them with our consumers who use SNAP — that’s the goal,” she said.

“We’re able to accept SNAP through the farmers market,” said Brittany Peters, who with her partner, Richard Raggi, operates Sun and Soil Farm in Madison, about 25 miles from Greensboro. The couple sell fruits, vegetables and flowers at the Corner Market.

“It’s a huge deal, because it makes our food more accessible to everybody,” Peters said.

That kind of accessibility — and the income it generates — is especially valuable for small farms, many of which operate on tight margins and face limited funding options.

The support is essential, said Roland McReynolds, executive director of Carolina Farm Stewardship Association, a nonprofit that advocates for sustainable, local and organic food systems. He explained that the federal government — primarily through the USDA and the farm bill that’s reauthorized every few years — has historically provided the main safety net for U.S. agriculture. State governments, including North Carolina, rarely step into this role, he said, and when they do, it’s typically on an emergency basis, such as providing disaster relief after Hurricane Helene.

With growing budget pressures from programs like Medicaid and SNAP, most states are unlikely to fully absorb the burden if federal support declines.

Still, McReynolds said, the state can play a vital role in the event of future SNAP cuts.

“If the state can step in to provide funding for SNAP Double Up Bucks programs — [that] will absolutely be important for helping a lot of small farms stabilize their revenue into next year,” he said.

In addition, in some parts of the state where the now-defunct Healthy Opportunities Pilot was buying produce from local farms to provide to Medicaid recipients, growers will be losing another revenue stream.

“In the Helene-impacted part of the state, there are a lot of farmers who got hit really hard last year,” McReynolds added. “They’re trying to make it this year, but when they run their numbers at the end of this year, we may be looking at a significant number of farmers who don’t come back for next year’s growing season.”

Uncertainty going forward

In response to questions about how North Carolina will support the more than 1 million residents who rely on monthly SNAP benefits, DHHS explained in an email that starting October 2026, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes provisions that would significantly reduce federal reimbursement rates to states for administering SNAP. That shift will force North Carolina’s 100 counties, which handle SNAP applications and eligibility, to absorb a greater share of administrative costs.

“NCDHHS will continue to work with county partners to drive down error rates, which determine the state cost share amount,” a department spokesperson said in an email. “Despite these challenges, the mission of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services remains unchanged — we will continue to work to improve the health and well-being of all North Carolinians.”

With the federal government shut down, combined with SNAP funding under pressure, questions persist about the future of SNAP — and what could happen to access to fresh produce at places like the Corner Farmers Market.

MUFG Bank, administrative agent for the financing, stated that the project demonstrates how international banks can support local energy infrastructure while contributing to regional economic growth. Nord/LB also played a key role in structuring the financing, enabling the rapid deployment of battery storage capacity in a strategic Texas location.

Gaul",,,,,https://undark.org/2025/10/07/epa-greenhouse-gas-data/,"This data is also the backbone of much of international U.S. climate policy: Collection of greenhouse gas emissions data is mandated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which undergirds the Paris Agreement.
In recent years, various groups have stepped up to the table to help calculate greenhouse gas emissions from sources both in the U.S. and nationwide.

Still, all experts WIRED spoke to stressed that ending GHGRP data collection would severely hobble U.S. efforts to measure and combat greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how good the non-federal options are.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced last month that it would stop making polluting companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to it, eliminating a crucial tool the U.S. uses to track emissions and form climate policy. Climate NGOs say their work could help plug some of the data gap, but they and other experts fear the EPA’s work can’t be fully matched.

This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

“I don’t think this system can be fully replaced,” says Joseph Goffman, the former assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. “I think it could be approximated — but it’s going to take time.”

The Clean Air Act requires states to collect data on local pollution levels, which states then turn over to the federal government. For the past 15 years, the EPA has also collected data on carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases from sources around the country that emit over a certain threshold of emissions. This program is known as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, and “is really the backbone of the air quality reporting system in the United States,” says Kevin Gurney, a professor of atmospheric science at Northern Arizona University.

Like a myriad of other data-collection processes that have been stalled or halted since the start of this year, the Trump administration has put this program in the crosshairs. In March, the EPA announced it would be reconsidering the GHGRP program entirely. In September, the agency trotted out a proposed rule to eliminate reporting obligations from sources ranging from power plants to oil and gas refineries to chemical facilities — all major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. (The agency claims that rolling back the GHGRP will save $2.4 billion in regulatory costs, and that the program is “nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.”)

Joseph says shutting down this program hamstrings “the government’s basic practical capacity to formulate climate policy.” Understanding how new emissions-reduction technologies are working, or surveying which industries are decarbonizing and which are not, “is extremely hard to do if you don’t have this data.”

Data collected by the GHGRP, which is publicly available, underpins much of federal climate policy: Understanding which sectors are contributing which kinds of emissions is the first step in forming strategies to draw those emissions down. This data is also the backbone of much of international U.S. climate policy: Collection of greenhouse gas emissions data is mandated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which undergirds the Paris Agreement. (While the U.S. exited the Paris Agreement for the second time on the first day of Trump’s second term, it remains — tenuously — a part of the UNFCCC.) Data collected by the GHGRP is also crucial to state and local climate policies, helping policymakers outside the federal government take stock of local pollution, form emissions-reductions goals, and track progress on bringing down emissions.

There’s some hope that nongovernmental actors could help. In recent years, various groups have stepped up to the table to help calculate greenhouse gas emissions from sources both in the U.S. and nationwide. These groups use a mix of federal, state, industry, and private data — from oil and gas industry databases to public and private satellites to federal data like what the EPA provides — to create tools that help policymakers and the public understand where greenhouse gas emissions are coming from, and how they impact people in various ways. Technology has also grown leaps and bounds, too, as artificial intelligence models are getting more advanced at both tracking and modeling emissions from different sources.

In the days since the EPA’s announcement, groups collecting and modeling emissions data say that they are fielding calls from various stakeholders trying to figure out solutions if the EPA revokes the program. Goffman, who left the EPA at the start of this year, says that there are staff within the agency looking to “connect or become part of university efforts” to continue data collection.

One of the most high-profile efforts in nongovernmental emissions modeling is a coalition called Climate TRACE, which was founded in 2019, following a donation from Google, to observe global emissions using satellites. The group, which has since grown to more than 100 collaborating organizations, has developed a host of AI models that they pair with data from various sources to track and model emissions from around the world.

There’s a dark timing, says cofounder Gavin McCormick, in having the EPA move to end the GHGRP after Climate TRACE has built its models relying so heavily on EPA data. “We started this project on the thesis that America has the world’s best emissions monitoring, and other countries could reduce emissions faster if they got up to the same quality as America,” McCormick says. “We just spent five years building this AI system to try to make it possible for other countries to have an approximation of the same system America has.”

It’s not just the climate-conscious who are worried about the future of this data: There’s significant industry interest in continuing to collect national data on greenhouse gas emissions. Just because the U.S. government is no longer invested in tracking climate change doesn’t mean the rest of the world is on board. Oil and gas companies with facilities in the U.S., for instance, still have a financial interest to keep track of their emissions if they’re selling to other markets — like Europe, which is beginning to impose strict methane requirements on gas imported into the bloc.

“Our phones have been blowing up over the last ten days or so, from people saying, ‘Should we start reporting to you now? You’re not an official source, but you’re the closest thing there is,’” says McCormick. “It’s not obvious to me that we are the right vehicle for that. But there are very clear business interests in why companies would want to continue reporting even though they don’t have to.”

Private industry data could also be used to help track greenhouse gas emissions — and even covers some emissions that aren’t captured in the EPA data. The Rocky Mountain Institute, for instance, a nonprofit that works on market-based climate solutions, runs an index based on private industry data that tracks emissions from across the oil and gas production cycle. (RMI is part of the Climate TRACE coalition.) This private data enables this index to have insights into emissions from the industry that the GHGRP may have missed or undercalculated — including calculating emissions from sources that don’t meet the cutoff for reporting.

Still, all experts WIRED spoke to stressed that ending GHGRP data collection would severely hobble U.S. efforts to measure and combat greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how good the non-federal options are. There’s a myriad of difficulties that face any organization that tries to take on this monumental task.

“If the EPA stopped requiring this, it’s entirely possible that states will continue to do it,” says Gurney. But, he says, “there is no [other] central warehouse to do the collating. Fifty entities turning in data files, which are massively complex, is just a huge endeavor. The EPA plays such an important role as this kind of data arbiter, ensuring that it’s all complying with standardization. That’s key for the rest of us, frankly, to not have to do that ourselves, which would be pretty much a prohibitive barrier for us to be able to make sense of that amount of data.”

There are many different ways to calculate emissions; the techniques used to collect and model data can also differ between different organizations and experts. Gurney, for instance, has been a vocal critic of the way Climate TRACE designs its models. The EPA’s pollution reporting requirements, meanwhile, are also backed by law: “A nongovernmental entity really can’t require that,” Goffman says.

There’s also an open question of whether nongovernmental estimates could hold up legally, especially if a policy formed using these estimates is challenged in court. In Louisiana, a law passed last year seriously restricts the ability of communities to use low-cost emissions-monitoring devices to track air quality and bring complaints or lawsuits about emissions violations; air monitoring must now be solely done by EPA-approved tools. (Groups who advocate for communities living near oil and gas facilities filed a lawsuit in May, saying that the tools are prohibitively expensive for local advocates and claiming the law is a “blatant violation of the free speech rights of community members to use their own independent air pollution monitoring to raise alarms about deadly chemicals being released into their own homes and schools.”)

That law “really drove home to me that this is only partly a scientific and do-you-have-the-data question, and partly an are-you-legally-allowed-to-use-that-dataset question,” says McCormick.

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

Germany’s ruling coalition confirmed it will extend a tax exemption for new electric vehicles as part of a broader effort to support the nation’s key car industry in the transition to more climate-friendly technologies.

Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will present a draft law soon which will keep the existing tax exemption for EVs in place until 2035, Maximilian Kall, a finance ministry spokesman, said Oct. 6 at a regular government news conference in Berlin.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a member of the Social Democrat Party who is also the vice chancellor, told dpa news agency.

The coalition accord agreed on by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and Klingbeil’s SPD included the pledge to extend the incentive to 2035, and the confirmation comes ahead of a planned “car summit” Oct. 9 between government officials, auto executives and labor representatives.

The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.

Announcements last month that Volkswagen AG was paring back production and Robert Bosch GmbH slashing 13,000 jobs were the latest evidence of how the auto industry’s decline is rippling through Europe’s biggest economy.

Car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG followed last week by saying it planned to eliminate 7,600 positions at its electrified drivetrain division as it steps up its restructuring efforts to deal with poor demand.

“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” Klingbeil said. “We want the best cars to continue to be made in Germany.”

Extending the EV exemption is expected to cost the federal government approximately 600 million euros ($703 million) in lost revenue through 2029, Kall told reporters.

As part of his government’s effort to aid the car sector, Merz last month urged the European Union to give up its 2035 deadline to effectively ban combustion engines and instead allow the industry to pursue a softer path to climate neutrality.

RELATED: Europe Car Bosses Tout EVs, Warn Against Combustion-Engine Ban

“We haven’t agreed on a joint position on the matter within the coalition, but I hope that this will happen soon,” Merz said in a television interview with n-tv broadcaster.

“I don’t want Germany to be among the member states that stick to this wrong ban.”

Some members of Klingbeil’s SPD, including Environment Minister Carsten Schneider, are unhappy with the move, but the party is expected to signal its backing later this week, with the issue set to be discussed at regular coalition talks Oct. 8 in Berlin.

Olaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony whose government is VW’s second-biggest shareholder, said last week the priority should be to protect jobs.

Shortly after the government shutdown began last week, the Department of Energy announced the cuts in Minnesota and a handful of other largely Democratic states, totaling more than $7.5 billion. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has denied that the program cancellations had anything to do with the shutdown and said the agency reviewed the merits of the projects for months.

""A team of seven or eight people have evaluated over 2,400 projects just on business conditions, whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not,"" Wright said. ""So no, I mean timing of announcements, I don't control that always. But these decisions are made all in the Energy Department, all based on facts.""

Democrats, meanwhile, have widely viewed the grant terminations as retribution for the shutdown, given the concentration in blue states. The cancelled projects are largely, though not exclusively, focused on issues around climate change, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

""These are big packages that we put together to help keep Minnesota energy effective, efficient, and have fewer disruptions and keep costs down for ratepayers,"" Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) said. ""This is being punitive, this is being harmful, this, in my opinion, almost bears to be childish.""

The largest terminated grant in Minnesota involves a $464 million award to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, related to upgrading the electrical transmission lines across seven Midwestern states. A Commerce spokesperson said Monday that the department still has not been formally notified about the cancellation, but last week, the agency argued the cuts could be potentially illegal if true.

The other cancellations involve millions of dollars in reductions to major power companies in Minnesota, such as Minnesota Power in Duluth that serves northeastern Minnesota, Otter Tail Power, Cummins Electrified Power and Native Sun Community Power Development for tribal communities.

The $50 million grant termination associated with Minnesota Power and ALLETE, Inc., was part of a broader modernization project. DFL State Sen. Grant Hauschild said the state had already come forward with $25 million in matching grant money for that project.

""These are competitive, merit-based grants at the federal level that we were going toward clean energy infrastructure,"" Hauschild said, ""toward our energy grid, making sure we have the power we need.""

The list of terminated projects also includes initiatives such as an American Lung Association car-sharing program for the east side of St. Paul.

""That project, called Greater East Side Expansion, was designed to empower East Side Saint Paul residents to determine how carshare can improve access to jobs, shopping, and healthcare, while also reducing air pollution,"" the American Lung Association wrote in a statement to KARE 11. ""This DOE announcement is a definite setback to this work, although we are still moving forward on other work to expand the carshare network on the East Side of Saint Paul.""

Another significant project on the list of terminations includes $70 million for Xcel Energy, involving a battery project in Colorado and Minnesota to store renewable energy. The Minnesota plant associated with that project is based in Becker, which falls in Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer's district.

Emmer, who also serves in House leadership as Majority Whip, said on a press call with local media last week that Democrats were to blame for the shutdown. He said he had not spoken with the U.S. Department of Energy about the termination of the Xcel funding in his district.

""The battery project in Becker, why would I be talking to them?"" Emmer said. ""I need to be talking to Amy (Klobuchar) and Tina (Smith) and Chuck Schumer and telling them, knock it off.""

In an interview, Senator Smith responded by saying that ""it is the Republican administration that cancelled these grants.""

""So I don't know how you could blame Democrats, who are not doing any of this,"" Smith said. ""What I would say to Rep. Emmer is, I am fighting to get Congress to act to stop a massive increase in health insurance premiums.""",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/e4615ec2-7811-402a-943a-3125cd0593fe/20251006T225038/e4615ec2-7811-402a-943a-3125cd0593fe_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 02:59:30.490786

Nuclear energy has emerged as a top energy priority in the U.S., with significant investments and ambitious timelines for achieving criticality.

The Department of Energy announced its Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in June, fast-tracking 11 projects with a goal launch date of July 4 for at least three of the plans.

American energy startup Aalo Atomics was tapped for the initiative. It's constructing a facility, Aalo-X, adjacent to the ​​Idaho National Laboratory Materials and Fuels Complex in Idaho Falls.

Aalo Atomics' experimental extra modular nuclear reactor is based on advanced nuclear reactors known as small modular reactors. Aalo looks to take the concept further, expanding upon SMRs to develop a reactor that is more flexible and easily deployable.

Aalo Atomics CEO Matt Loszak said the startup had power-hungry data centers in mind when developing Aalo-X's XMR.

""We believe that to address today's massive data center market demand, another category of nuclear reactor is needed, one that blends the benefit of the factory manufacturing of microreactors, the power levels of SMRs, and the economic targets of a large reactor,"" he explained.

As cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels go, nuclear energy has long had something of an image problem.

This is partly due to high-profile nuclear incidents in the 1970s and 1980s, but experts say much of that distrust was based on feelings, not facts — and the technology has come a long way in the intervening decades.

It's true that despite rapid advancements and support from tech titans such as Bill Gates, nuclear energy has its cons. The Union of Concerned Scientists took a balanced yet cautious stance on advanced nuclear energy in 2021, outlining both sides.

Nuclear power generates waste that must be managed properly, and facilities remain ""vulnerable to catastrophic accidents and sabotage,"" the former of which is sometimes unavoidable. The UCS also expressed concerns that nuclear plants could be repurposed to build destructive weapons.

However, in contrast to planet-warming dirty fuels, nuclear remains a low-carbon source of energy, one that provides nearly 20% of the country's electricity. If progress continues, nuclear power could soon play a more significant role in America's energy supply.

""​​Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from founding to fission in less than three years — a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,"" Loszak told Interesting Engineering.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MoIpEjjoLswYTGyiXGObMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/104af4de0986625b450eb2de5acb8c6c,N,,2025-10-07 03:58:58.796885

JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://www.qcnews.com/news/national-news/ap-solar-and-wind-power-has-grown-faster-than-electricity-demand-this-year-report-says/,"Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.
India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

The market may be changing rapidly, presenting a plethora of new challenges, but Entergy Mississippi is harnessing new opportunities to support its communities.
On the topic of environmental impact, Entergy Mississippi is also making significant strides into new renewable energies; in particular, nuclear.","Take an Arkansas visionary, a handshake and a new industry that’ll change the course of the world forever, and you’re transported back in time to the birth of Entergy Mississippi. Founded by Arkansas businessman, Harvey Couch, back in 1923, the business initially started out under the name of ‘The Mississippi Power & Light Company’, acquiring several utility systems throughout Jackson, Columbus, Greenville, and Vicksburg, right at the rise of the electrical industry. Today, Entergy Mississippi is a true powerhouse, leading the state of Mississippi at the forefront of energy innovation.

Energy, Oil & Gas last sat down with Entergy Mississippi in 2023 in celebration of one of its most significant milestones to date: its 100-year anniversary. Commemorating a century of excellence, Haley Fisackerly, Entergy Mississippi’s Chief Executive Officer, shared exclusive insight into the company’s heritage and how it continues to evolve with the industry, keeping affordability and reliability at its core. Now, as Entergy Mississippi embarks upon the latter half of its 102nd year, it continues to champion its legacy of innovation and dynamism within the electrical industry. The market may be changing rapidly, presenting a plethora of new challenges, but Entergy Mississippi is harnessing new opportunities to support its communities.

In September 2025, Haley rejoins Energy, Oil & Gas to offer an update on how the company has progressed. “What’s happened in the two years since we last spoke has been amazing. As we enter our next century of service, we are seeing a transformation in the business like we’ve never seen before,” Haley reveals. “When we were founded 100 years ago, electricity was still a new industry, and now, the industry is seeing a rebirth; a lot of manufacturing is moving back to the United States, and there’s been a huge growth in the number of data centers, cloud storage hubs, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We’re excited because this growth will allow us to better serve our customers and communities.”

In terms of new developments, Entergy Mississippi has been thrilled to announce perhaps its biggest partnership to date: a major data center project with Amazon Web Services (AWS). For a company that’s committed to empowering its communities, this project is monumental for Entergy Mississippi. Regarded as the ‘largest economic win in Mississippi history’, AWS’ investment in the state will change the lives of many, creating thousands of new jobs, generating significant tax revenue and funding an increasing number of charitable and philanthropic projects for communities.

“We entered into an agreement with AWS to provide two data center campuses in Madison County, which is a part of the Entergy Mississippi service territory. It’s the largest economic project in state history, fivefold,” Haley affirms. “AWS has committed over $10 billion to the state of Mississippi, which will create more than 1000 new jobs: it’s a real win for our customers and communities. These investments are also allowing us to pull two of our later-planned power plants forward, which will be a real benefit to our customers.

“Growth is very important when it comes to serving our customers because the more money we spend, the more cost we’re adding to the business, and if our customer base isn’t growing then that cost gets transferred to our customers. When 20 percent of your customers live below the national poverty level, you must be cognizant of that, so we were very aggressive in finding a partner like AWS to come in and help us to grow, invest and unlock new technologies.”

As Haley explains, this investment will accelerate Entergy Mississippi’s planned infrastructure upgrade projects, without transferring the cost to its consumers – a major win for the company and its customers alike. One of such projects is Entergy Mississippi’s Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, situated in Greenville, Mississippi. Focusing heavily on sustainable operation, Delta Blues is set to be a 745-megawatt facility able to power nearly 400,000 homes across Entergy Mississippi’s service area, which will significantly increase the quality and reliability of the energy provided to its customers.

“We recently broke ground on this $1.2 billion project, so it is under construction as we speak – a very highly efficient plant that uses less water, has less emissions and is much quieter. We’re going to install Mitsubishi turbines into the plant, which are 50 percent more efficient than what they’re replacing, and we’re building the plant in such a way that it can be retrofitted to use hydrogen fuel when it becomes more economic. We’re also building the plant to be adaptable to carbon capture capability, so that our CO2 emissions can be sequestered and not admitted into the environment,” Haley elaborates.

On the topic of environmental impact, Entergy Mississippi is also making significant strides into new renewable energies; in particular, nuclear. Haley comments: “We’ve been speaking with potential customers on partnerships within that arrangement. In the last couple of weeks [at the time of writing], we filed a request at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend an early site permit at our Grand Gulf nuclear power plant in Claiborne County, Mississippi. We won the ESP permit for that site back in 2007, which is now set to expire in 2027, but we’re currently working with the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Trump Administration on seeking an extension for another 20 years. That’s very important to us because it would help us to accelerate and reduce costs on another plant if we were to look at building one; it’s something we’re studying very carefully.

“For example, we’re looking at new technologies such as small modular reactors, which are greater passive safety systems than what we currently use today,” he continues. “We’re making investments in upgrading our transmission systems with more resilient, robust structures, as well as into various other grid enhancement technologies, to ensure that the grid is stable and operating at its highest capability.”

With all these developments well underway, Entergy Mississippi is positioned for an exciting 12 months and an even more exciting future. Continuing to build upon its past legacies, Entergy Mississippi enters a new era defined by ambition, innovation and technological advancement, taking both its customers and communities into the future together. Haley concludes by sharing what the next chapter holds for Entergy Mississippi.

“Now, we aim to look for other productive growth opportunities to serve our communities. Reliability and affordability remain at the front of our customers’ minds, and the new revenue generated by AWS is going to allow us to make further investments to offset the rate impacts to them,” he finishes, optimistic for the years ahead. “We’ll be rolling out a new reliability plan over the next five years to really drive that service and make the grid more reliable; we intend to introduce more self-healing networks to sense problems on the grid before they result in outages.

“When I talked about this being a transformational period within the industry, it’s worth noting that the United States is looking at energy dominance surrounding AI, and Entergy is making this happen – not just with us, but with our sister companies in Louisiana and Arkansas as well. We’re working to bring these opportunities forward, not only to benefit our customers and communities, but to unlock a new era of investment in the United States going forward.”",https://energy-oil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Entergy-Mississippi-228-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:59:41.406088

At the same time, the state has avoided more than 742,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

An independent group backing Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Ciattarelli campaign have ads distorting comments Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) made about clean energy and its cost.
She blamed Trump’s cancelling new clean energy projects for increasing costs to ratepayers.","Climate change – which is causing sea levels to rise and heat waves to last longer and be more intense — has taken a back seat to affordability issues in political campaigns, but recent spikes in utility bills have made it a key issue in this year’s race for New Jersey governor.

According to NASA, human activities – primarily the burning of coal, petroleum, natural gas and other fossil fuels – have led to an average 1.8-degree increase in the earth’s temperature since the pre-industrial era of 1850-1900 and that temperature continues to rise .36 degrees each decade. The Paris Climate Accords seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2.7 degrees or no more than 3.6 degrees by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels by half by 2030.

Under Gov. Phil Murphy, New Jersey has taken aggressive steps to reduce the state’s impact on climate change which include a detailed energy master plan and a target of 100% clean energy in the state by 2035. These and other actions are meant to address current and predicted impacts on the state, including more intense storms, sea levels creeping up on ocean and bay beaches, impaired water quality, more drought conditions and degraded air quality.

As part of its efforts, the administration rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gase Initiative, or RGGI, a market-based system in the northeast that aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Under the system fossil fuel plants essentially pay to emit greenhouse gases and participating states receive funding from the sale of carbon allowances. In total, New Jersey has received more than $1 billion through the program, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. New Jersey has awarded close to $233 million of that to about 400 clean energy and climate mitigation projects that include solar power, clean trucks and buses, charging infrastructure, the restoration of tidal marshes and investments in energy efficiency. At the same time, the state has avoided more than 742,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

The Murphy administration had banked on using offshore wind as a major provider of future clean power. But developer Ørsted pulled out, citing inflation and supply chain issues as setbacks. Since January, the Trump administration has taken several actions that have essentially ended the ability of companies to develop offshore wind farms. Atlantic Shores, which was to have been located off the coast between Atlantic City and Barnegat Light and provided enough power for roughly 1 million homes, ended its development effort.

Earlier this year, PJM Interconnection, the energy grid operator for New Jersey, held energy auctions that led to increased electricity costs of about 20% for ratepayers as of June. Another increase is expected next June. The state responded by giving about $430 million in direct relief to electric customers with at least $100 per customer and $150 for those with lower incomes.

Supply and demand are responsible for the higher prices, experts say. The higher demand for power is driven largely by the increase in data centers that deliver artificial intelligence applications, as well as hotter temperatures driving the need for air conditioning. And the power supply is not keeping up with that increased demand due in large part to a logjam at PJM of new energy sources seeking to connect to the grid and replace older coal-burning plants that have retired. New Jersey’s last coal-fired power plant closed in mid-2022.

The consumer concern over higher energy prices is considered so important this year that it is key in campaign messages to potential voters.

An independent group backing Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Ciattarelli campaign have ads distorting comments Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) made about clean energy and its cost. The YouTube page for the ad from Restore New Jersey shows that it has had more than 2.3 million views since Sept. 11. The New Jersey State Democratic Committee has posted on X, formerly Twitter, a short clip from Ciattarelli during a Fox News interview where he seems to say much the electricity rate hike is helping his campaign. The ad cuts off his full response.

Here are the candidates’ positions on climate change, clean energy and rising utility costs:

Republican Jack Ciattarelli

Ciattarelli acknowledges that climate change is real and that it’s “due to human activity.” But he disagrees with Murphy’s approach and has vowed to pull the state out of RGGI. New Jersey’s air quality is influenced by what happens in Pennsylvania, whose membership in RGGI is currently on hold while its state supreme court decides a challenge to it. Unlike New Jersey, which closed its last coal burning plant three years ago, they still operated in Pennsylvania. Ciattarelli said that getting out of RGGI will save ratepayers between $300 million and $500 million because electric companies are passing on the costs they have to pay to generate power, although environmentalists contend ratepayers are saving money because the state is a member of RGGI.

“The way to get down the monthly electric bill is to pull out of RGGI on day one, and I will by executive order,” Ciattarelli said in answer to a question from NJ Spotlight News while campaigning last month in Clinton.

At the same time, Ciattarelli said he plans to create a state Department of Energy, eliminated as a state department in 1988, to help reduce electricity rates.

“I don’t need 1-or-200 people, I need 12 policy experts that will work in partnership with the executive branch,” Ciattarelli said. “I do not believe that energy policy should be coming out of the BPU (Board of Public Utilities) or the DEP. Those are regulatory agencies. We need a department of energy that gives us a rational energy plan that solves the current electricity crisis and points us in the right direction for the future.”

He said he could find enough money to cut from the state budget to fund the new department.

Ciattarelli said he will implement a different state energy master plan that includes natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, and nuclear and solar power, but not offshore wind. He pledged to ban wind farms from being built off the coast.

Another vow from Ciattarelli is to “repeal unrealistic and unaffordable state mandates regarding electric vehicle sales, household appliances, home renovation and home construction.” Murphy set goals for adding electric vehicles to the state vehicle fleet and ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill

Freezing utility costs is Sherrill’s signature energy proposal, saying she would declare a state of emergency on utility costs on her first day in office. Gov. Phil Murphy and others have questioned whether the governor would have the power to do this, but Sherrill’s campaign chairman Sen. Vin Gopal and Stefanie Brand, the former head of the state Division of Rate Counsel, say they think she can. Sherrill pledged no utility rate increases over her first year in office.

“So immediately, as I put that out, we see an open letter from utility companies saying, we want to come to the table and be a part of the solution,” Sherrill told NJ Spotlight News during a campaign stop in Clinton. “We know that there is money coming in from RGGI or the BPU to defray some of these costs. Certainly, it’s a matter of, are you going to allow all of the agencies who failed to take on this problem, even though we saw it coming, to profit off the people of New Jersey or are you going to step in and be a strong leader and make sure that you’re driving change?”

In her position paper on energy costs and the environment, Sherrill said supports the need for New Jersey to do its part to alleviate climate change to help the state “hit our emissions and clean air goals.”

She pledged to expand cheaper and cleaner energy generation to “build an energy arsenal.” Sherrill said she would eliminate unnecessary red tape and make permitting easier for new projects, including solar and battery storage projects, and expedite upgrading the capacity of existing nuclear plants. She also said she would work to develop “new nuclear capacity” in Salem County.

Modernizing natural gas facilities is also part of her plan, with Sherrill promising to “make them cleaner and more efficient – which will lower costs, reduce carbon emissions, and boost reliability and energy independence right now.”

Sherrill, who has been endorsed by NRDC Action Fund and the state League of Conservation Voters, also said she would increase transparency and accountability for the state’s utilities, including the four electricity suppliers.

And she said she would have her attorney general, in coordination with other governors in the region, take the Trump administration and PJM to force them to allow the continued development of clean energy and connect new power generators to the grid. She blamed Trump’s cancelling new clean energy projects for increasing costs to ratepayers. Most recently, the Trump administration cancelled close to $5 million in research grants to Rutgers and Princeton universities.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2020/02/santana-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:59:46.319684

Key Takeaways

Clean energy grants provide funding for projects that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Eligibility criteria for clean energy grants may include project location, organization type, and project scope.

Research available clean energy grants through government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private foundations.

A solid project proposal for clean energy grants should include a clear project plan, budget, and expected impact.

Building collaborative partnerships with other organizations and stakeholders can strengthen a clean energy grant proposal.

Understanding the Eligibility Criteria

Before diving into the application process for clean energy grants, it is crucial for NGOs to thoroughly understand the eligibility criteria set forth by grant-making organizations. These criteria can vary significantly depending on the funding source, which may include government agencies, private foundations, or corporate sponsors. Common eligibility requirements often include the type of organization (non-profit status), project scope, geographic focus, and alignment with specific clean energy goals.

For instance, some grants may prioritize projects that serve low-income communities or those disproportionately affected by climate change. Others might focus on innovative technologies or educational initiatives. By carefully reviewing these criteria, NGOs can tailor their proposals to align with the funders’ priorities, thereby increasing their chances of securing funding.

Additionally, understanding eligibility can help organizations identify which grants are worth pursuing and which may not be a good fit for their mission or capabilities.

Researching Available Clean Energy Grants

Once eligibility criteria are understood, the next step is to conduct thorough research on available clean energy grants. This process involves identifying potential funding sources that align with the organization’s mission and project goals. Various online databases and resources can assist in this endeavor, such as Grants.gov, Foundation Center, and state-specific grant portals.

These platforms provide comprehensive listings of grants, including application deadlines, funding amounts, and specific requirements. Moreover, networking within the clean energy sector can yield valuable insights into upcoming grant opportunities. Attending conferences, workshops, and webinars focused on renewable energy can help NGO professionals connect with funders and other organizations that have successfully secured grants.

Engaging with local universities or research institutions can also provide access to collaborative opportunities and funding insights. By leveraging these resources, NGOs can create a targeted list of potential grants that align with their clean energy initiatives.

Creating a Solid Project Proposal

A well-crafted project proposal is the cornerstone of a successful grant application. It serves as a roadmap for funders to understand the project’s objectives, methodology, and anticipated outcomes. To create a compelling proposal, NGOs should begin by clearly defining the project’s goals and how they align with the funder’s mission.

This alignment is crucial; funders are more likely to support projects that resonate with their values and objectives. In addition to outlining goals, a strong proposal should include a detailed project plan that addresses implementation strategies, timelines, and measurable outcomes. Incorporating data and research to support the project’s feasibility can enhance credibility.

For example, if an NGO proposes a solar panel installation project, including statistics on energy savings and environmental impact can strengthen the case for funding. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders in the proposal development process can provide diverse perspectives and enhance the project’s overall design.

Building Collaborative Partnerships

Collaboration is a powerful strategy for NGOs seeking clean energy grants. By forming partnerships with other organizations, businesses, or government entities, NGOs can leverage shared resources and expertise to enhance their project proposals. Collaborative partnerships can also demonstrate to funders that there is community support and a broader impact potential for the proposed initiative.

For instance, an NGO focused on renewable energy education might partner with local schools to implement educational programs on sustainability. This partnership not only broadens the reach of the project but also showcases community engagement—a key factor that many funders look for in grant applications. Additionally, collaborating with businesses in the clean energy sector can provide access to technical expertise and resources that strengthen project implementation.

Demonstrating Community Impact

Funders are increasingly interested in understanding how their investments will create meaningful change within communities. Therefore, NGOs must articulate the anticipated community impact of their clean energy projects clearly. This involves not only outlining the direct benefits of the project—such as reduced energy costs or increased access to renewable energy—but also addressing broader social and environmental implications.

For example, an NGO implementing a community solar project could highlight how it will reduce energy poverty in low-income neighborhoods while also creating local jobs in installation and maintenance. Providing qualitative and quantitative data to support these claims can enhance credibility. Surveys, testimonials from community members, and case studies from similar projects can all serve as powerful tools to illustrate potential impact.

Budgeting and Financial Planning

A comprehensive budget is a critical component of any grant proposal. It provides funders with a clear understanding of how requested funds will be allocated and demonstrates the organization’s financial responsibility. When developing a budget for a clean energy project, NGOs should include all relevant costs—such as materials, labor, administrative expenses, and any indirect costs associated with project implementation.

Moreover, it is essential to justify each line item in the budget by explaining its relevance to the project’s goals. Funders appreciate transparency and clarity in budgeting; therefore, providing detailed explanations for costs can help build trust. Additionally, NGOs should consider including potential sources of matching funds or in-kind contributions from partners to demonstrate financial commitment and sustainability.

Navigating the Application Process

The application process for clean energy grants can be complex and competitive. To navigate this landscape effectively, NGOs should develop a clear timeline that outlines key milestones—from initial research to final submission. This timeline should account for all necessary steps, including gathering supporting documents, obtaining letters of support from partners, and allowing time for revisions based on feedback from colleagues or mentors.

Additionally, NGOs should pay close attention to application guidelines provided by funders. Each grant may have specific formatting requirements or questions that need to be addressed in particular ways. Adhering strictly to these guidelines is crucial; failure to do so can result in disqualification from consideration.

Engaging in peer reviews or seeking feedback from experienced grant writers can also enhance the quality of the application before submission.

Engaging with Local Government and Agencies

Building relationships with local government officials and agencies can significantly enhance an NGO’s chances of securing clean energy grants. Local governments often have insights into available funding opportunities and may even provide letters of support that strengthen grant applications. Engaging with local agencies responsible for energy policy or environmental initiatives can also open doors for collaboration on projects that align with community priorities.

Moreover, demonstrating alignment with local government goals—such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing renewable energy adoption—can make proposals more appealing to funders who prioritize community impact. Regular communication with local officials not only fosters goodwill but also positions NGOs as proactive partners in advancing clean energy initiatives within their communities.

Implementing Sustainable Practices

Once funding is secured and projects are underway, NGOs must prioritize implementing sustainable practices throughout the project lifecycle. This commitment not only ensures that projects achieve their intended outcomes but also sets an example for communities regarding responsible resource management. Sustainable practices may include using locally sourced materials, minimizing waste during installation processes, or incorporating educational components that promote ongoing community engagement in sustainability efforts.

Additionally, NGOs should consider how their projects can be designed for long-term sustainability beyond the initial funding period. This might involve creating maintenance plans for renewable energy installations or establishing community-led initiatives that continue promoting clean energy practices after project completion. By embedding sustainability into every aspect of project implementation, NGOs can maximize their impact while fostering a culture of environmental stewardship within their communities.

Reporting and Accountability

Finally, effective reporting and accountability mechanisms are essential components of successful clean energy projects funded by grants. Funders typically require regular progress reports detailing how funds have been utilized and what outcomes have been achieved. NGOs should establish clear metrics for success at the outset of the project and regularly track progress against these benchmarks.

Transparency in reporting not only fulfills funder requirements but also builds trust within the community and among stakeholders. Sharing successes—and challenges—through public reports or community meetings can foster ongoing engagement and support for future initiatives. By demonstrating accountability and a commitment to continuous improvement, NGOs can position themselves favorably for future funding opportunities while reinforcing their role as leaders in promoting clean energy solutions.

In conclusion, navigating the world of clean energy grants requires strategic planning, collaboration, and a commitment to community impact. By understanding eligibility criteria, conducting thorough research, crafting compelling proposals, building partnerships, demonstrating impact, budgeting effectively, engaging with local entities, implementing sustainable practices, and maintaining accountability through reporting, NGO professionals can successfully secure funding for transformative clean energy initiatives that benefit both their organizations and the communities they serve.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-10-06 23:58:40.703830

Earth's oceans face 'triple planetary crisis,' new report warns

Climate change is straining America's health care system: Study

Climate change is a public health emergency, driving heat, poor air quality, stronger storms, and new diseases that threaten people's health and strain health care systems, according to a new report from The Commonwealth Fund examining the impact of climate change on health and health care.

The report examined the preparedness of all 50 states and the District of Columbia to address rising health threats from climate change, identifying significant gaps in how health care systems respond to extreme weather, pollution and other climate-related risks.

The highest performers were Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine due to their clean energy policies, lower vulnerability to environmental hazards and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The worst performers were West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi.

However, the report makes clear that even the most prepared states need to do more.

""It's a mix for every state. There's no state that's at the top, ""Matthew Eckelman, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University and report co-author, told ABC News. ""What it tells us is that each state has some work to do.""

Rising temperatures and more frequent, intense heat waves have become the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, accounting for nearly 250,000 additional deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Extreme heat disproportionately impacts older adults, outdoor workers, people with chronic conditions and low‑income populations.

According to the report, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona are the most vulnerable to extreme heat, with Arizona experiencing more than 140 days over 100℉ in 2024 and Nevada approaching 115 days.

Air quality is another growing concern.

Warmer temperatures and more frequent wildfires are leading to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, both of which can exacerbate asthma, respiratory diseases, and heart conditions.

Smoke from wildfires — especially across the U.S. West — is now a significant health hazard and may be responsible for 200,000 excess deaths annually. Arizona and California had the worst air quality, while residents of Alaska and Hawaii can breathe the easiest with the cleanest air.

The report explains that extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, and storms can cause injury, water contamination and mental trauma.

These events often disrupt health services and basic infrastructure, compounding their long-term effects and jeopardizing the health of communities. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida stand out in this category, facing especially severe flood risks. The report estimates that nearly 15 percent of Florida hospital beds are located in high-hazard flood zones.

The health care system is not only at risk from these climate threats, but is also contributing to the problem, the researchers found.

More than 8.5% of the national greenhouse gas emissions originate from the health sector, with West Virginia, Wyoming, and North Dakota contributing the highest percentage per capita, according to the report.

And, while the report examines the national and state picture, weather events are also having a profound impact on local communities.

""Some disasters recently here in the U.S. have wiped out significant health infrastructure,"" Eckelman said.

Flooding in Western North Carolina wiped out some critical manufacturing facilities that supply life-saving medical supplies for the rest of the country, Eckelman explained. So, while the weather event only impacted one region of the country, it affected the supply chains everywhere, he added.

The authors of the report encouraged governments and health facilities to develop resilience plans and emergency plans so that they can continue operating during these events. They also challenged health care institutions to do their part.

""They can take a little bit of control over the emissions associated with their own operations and really abide by their mission to do no harm, not only through the care that they provide, but also in their behavior within the environment itself,"" Eckelman said.

Google said it will cover the full energy costs associated with powering the facility, which Entergy Arkansas argues will contribute over $1.1 billion in net benefits over the life of the contract and help to reduce electricity rates for Entergy Arkansas customers.

The facility will be powered by Entergy Arkansas’s existing generation power portfolio and transmission grid, which will soon include a new 600-MW solar project, backed by a 350-MW battery storage system that will be located in Jefferson County, Arkansas. Google will pay rates that cover the cost of this resource, the utility added.

The White House announced $8 billion worth for clean energy projects would be cancelled. This is part of the first round of cuts the Trump administration said would occur during the government shutdown.

The project would include the existing natural gas facility off Interstate 5 with the goal of producing clean hydrogen energy and increasing grid reliability.

According to Lodi Councilmember Mikey Hothi, the Port of Oakland has already indicated interest in fueling its heavy-duty machinery and trucks with hydrogen.

""We'd be able to fuel trucks up and down the state across the country using hydrogen that was made in Lodi,"" Councilmember Hothi said.

In the MSC Island agreed to indemnify third-party contractors such as OOSI against claims resulting from injuries to Island employees.
The question for the court Did federal Maritime law or Louisiana law govern the dispute?
There was no question that the indemnity provision required Island to indemnify OOSI for Felix’s personal injury claims; however Island argued that the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act rendered the indemnity provision unenforceable.
OOSI said federal maritime law controls.","You would think that a Master Service Contract concerning boats and oilfield operations in the Gulf of Mexico would be governed by federal maritime law. In some situations you would be mistaken, says Offshore Oil Services, Inc. v. Island Operating Company, Inc.

The facts

Fieldwood and Island Operating entered into a MSC through which Island performed production services on Fieldwood’s Gulf of Mexico platforms. Most of the categories of “Work” identified in the MSC were those traditionally associated with production activities. Fieldwood contracted with OOSI for marine transport of equipment and Island’s workers on the platforms.

In the MSC Island agreed to indemnify third-party contractors such as OOSI against claims resulting from injuries to Island employees.

Fieldwood and Island agreed to a work order in which Island would fill “A Operator” positions. These operators would conduct BESE compliance testing and a host of other activities.

Island employee Felix sustained injuries while disembarking from a vessel. OOSI filed a Complaint for Exoneration From and/or Limitation of Liability and Felix filed a personal injury claim. OOSI demanded indemnification from Island.

The question for the court

Did federal Maritime law or Louisiana law govern the dispute? The question was whether transportation vessels would play a substantial role in the performance of the MSC and whether the parties expected as much.

There was no question that the indemnity provision required Island to indemnify OOSI for Felix’s personal injury claims; however Island argued that the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act rendered the indemnity provision unenforceable. OOSI said federal maritime law controls. The trial court granted summary judgment for Island, concluding that the LOAIA governed the dispute based on a finding that the MSC did not provide that the vessels would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract and that the parties did not expect vessels to play such a role.

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the take-nothing judgment against OOSI. The court applied the choice of law analysis in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Whether federal maritime law applied of its own force to the MSC depended on the answer to two questions:

Was the contract to provide services to facilitate the drilling or production of oil and gas in navigable waters? The answer was “yes”. Then the court asked if the contract provided or did the parties expect that the vessel would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract? To this question the court said “no”. The result of that “no” was the MSC was a non-maritime contract. There was not a direct and substantial link between the contract and operation of the ship, it’s navigation or its management afloat.

The result was based on the testimony of the parties. A Fieldwood employee testified to the effect that they typically don’t use equipment associated with a vessel but it had been done. Island’s president testified that operators perform no work on vessels. The provision relating to marine transportation concerned transporting workers to the platform and was not a description of actual work the MSC contemplated.

The trial court, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, ruled that OOSI take nothing. The MSC was not maritime in nature. Thus, the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act controlled, nullifying Island’s indemnity obligations. (OOSI agreed that if the LOAIA applied, the indemnity obligation would be null, rendering discussion of that question unnecessary).

President Trump is still considering a massive aid program for U.S. farmers… Trump officials are reportedly evaluating how money made from tariffs could supplement farmer payments. Official details about the bailout are scarce, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that information regarding “substantial support” for farmers would be released Tuesday. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday his administration will provide “some of that tariff money” to farmers, “who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit.”

Senator Grassley speaks up for Nationwide E15… Any farmer will tell you that they want to sell into the market and not harvest government checks. Although those checks may be necessary again this year, we need to address the root cause of this issue by giving farmers more markets. So, one very important decision that Congress could make is to have permanent year-round, nationwide E15. And, that would do just that, giving farmers more markets – particularly for corn.

Now, people would say, “Well, you better wake up,” because we’ve had nationwide, year-round markets for six years through presidential waiver. But we need to have this by legislation because we need more certainty than what an individual president might think about this issue. And you need that certainty because it’s going to take a lot of investment of infrastructure at retailers selling gasoline to invest in the equipment that it takes to have E15 nationwide. -source: Senator Charles Grassley

FDA moves NWS serum forward… The FDA recently, conditionally approved Dectomax-CA1 (doramectin injection) injectable solution for the prevention and treatment of New World screwworm (NWS) larval infestations and prevention of NWS reinfestation for 21 days. “We understand the urgency with which America’s farmers and ranchers are asking for tools to fight New World screwworm,” said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. “Today’s conditional approval – the first in the U.S. for NWS – shows our dedication to rapidly advancing important animal medicines when they are needed most. We continue to work tirelessly to complete review of other NWS products to protect multiple animal species in the U.S.”

“Under this conditional approval, the FDA has determined the drug is safe and has a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. We are making this treatment available to cattle producers immediately while the sponsor collects the data needed for a full approval,” said Timothy Schell, Ph.D., acting director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine.

The value of all energy trade between the United States and Mexico was estimated to be $57 billion in 2024, down from nearly $72 billion in 2023, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. A combination of lower petroleum output from Mexico and lower fuel prices, particularly for petroleum products that make up the bulk of the cross-border energy trade between the two countries, drove most of the decrease. Energy trade value represents the total value of energy imports and exports between two countries and is driven by commodity volumes and prices.

Most of the energy trade value between the United States and Mexico comes from U.S. exports of refined petroleum products to Mexico—$37 billion in 2024—which accounted for 64% of the total energy value traded between the two countries. The inflation-adjusted value of all U.S. energy exports to Mexico declined by 13% in 2024 from a year earlier to $41 billion, falling by less than the previous annual decline of 24% from 2022 to 2023. -source: U.S. Energy Information Administration

California’s adoption of E15 is a bright spot… California Governor Newsom’s signing his legislature’s E15 bill made the state the last remaining and biggest to allow sales of the higher ethanol blend. Renewable Fuels Association’s Troy Bredenkamp never doubted Newsom would sign the unanimously passed bill saying, “He [Newsome] got on board last year…RFA commissioned a study with UC Berkeley and others, that looked at, what would E15 mean to the California consumer. That study showed a $2.7 billion per year savings to California consumers—almost $200 per household.”

Those numbers reportedly helped fuel Newsom’s signature on the bill. Bredenkamp says California will add almost 600 million gallons of new demand for American ethanol or 200 million bushels of corn. He says he hopes California’s move will give added momentum to year-round E15 legislation in Congress.

The Texas Department of Agriculture enacted an emergency quarantine Oct. 2 to stop the spread of the invasive two-spotted cotton leafhopper, also known as the cotton jassid. Originally from Asia, the cotton jassid has spread across much of the southeastern United States and now poses a serious threat to Texas’ multi-billion-dollar cotton industry and other agricultural products, said TDA.

“Texas cotton farmers are the backbone of our economy and our communities,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. “Texas grows 40% of the cotton grown in the U.S., making this pest a major threat to our supply. I won’t let a threat like the cotton jassid harm our farmers, ranchers, nurseries or landscapes. We’re taking aggressive steps to stop this pest in its tracks.” The quarantine applies to shipments from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee where the pest has been detected.

ON THE ROAD: Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn’t forgiven car companies for helping nix California’s electric vehicle sales mandate, but the state’s top transportation lawmakers aren’t spending time looking in the rearview mirror.

While Newsom and other lawmakers traveled to New York for Climate Week, Assemblymember Lori Wilson and Sen. Dave Cortese — the respective chairs of their chambers’ transportation committees — were in Detroit meeting with Ford and General Motors executives as they attempt to chart a path forward for the state’s EV market.

The trip, organized by SoCal labor leader and former Michigan state Rep. Jon Switalski, took place amid the inauspicious backdrop of Newsom bashing General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he singled out by name as aiding the Trump administration’s successful maneuver to have Congress revoke California’s authority to enforce national-leading vehicle emissions standards.

“Mary Barra sold us out,” Newsom said during a Climate Week press conference late last month. “The Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump‘s leadership, but the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen. GM led that effort.”

Wilson said the policy disagreements made the talks awkward.

“It was an elephant in the room,” she said.

But she also said she was sympathetic to automakers’ dilemma.

“They feel like they’re being beat up by China,” she said. “They would like to see a voluntary collaborative transition that’s led by the market and allows them to stay competitive.”

The episode illustrates how raw the emotions are for Newsom and clean vehicle advocates who’ve watched the Trump administration systematically dismantle EV incentives, including the $7,500 federal tax credit for car buyers and HOV lane access, both of which expired last week. GM spent the most of any automaker — $11.5 million — lobbying the federal government through June. (That’s more than double the spending from Toyota, which also vocally opposed EV rules.)

“They didn’t spend as much as the oil industry, but were clearly part of the offensive,” said Matt Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters.

Cortese and Wilson, who were joined by Assemblymembers Rhodesia Ransom, Juan Carrillo and LaShae Sharp-Collins, said they walked away optimistic that the American auto giants won’t abandon their EV ambitions.

“The theme of both Ford and GM is, ‘We’re not going backwards,” Wilson said. “‘Despite the conversation happening, despite the advocacy, we’re committed to a zero-emission future.’”

Whether that means the companies are prepared to actively work with lawmakers and state regulators to advance California’s EV agenda is an open question. Cortese said he left the meetings with a sense that neither automaker was rushing to offer policy concepts to bolster the state market after the flurry of federal action.

“It isn’t very comforting from the transportation chair standpoint,” Cortese said. “It just seems like, if anything, they’re in a wait-and-see mode.”

However, both lawmakers said the looming specter of the Chinese electric vehicle market, which has rapidly developed into the largest in the world, has Ford and GM spooked and reluctant to step away from electrification completely.

“It’s no joke that there are very competent competitors elsewhere,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, which analyzes auto markets. “We must continue developing and producing because if we don’t, someone else is going to eat our lunch.”

It will take creative lawmaking from Cortese and Wilson to take advantage of that opening without the state’s EV sales targets and with an anticipated budget deficit that has already caused Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill federal tax incentives with a state-run program.

Their agreed-upon target for next session is one of the trickiest knots in the EV space — exponentially increasing the number of home chargers for millions of California renters, with little available funding to encourage landlords to install new infrastructure.

“That’s the missing piece,” Wilson said. “There’s still nothing like people going home, plugging in their vehicle and waking up in the morning knowing they can drive.” — AN

BOTH WAYS: While it’s been an awkward EV autumn between American carmakers and California officials, a Japanese motor company rolled out a high-tech new partnership with one of the state’s largest utilities.

Honda is partnering with Southern California Edison on an initiative to push forward the ability of electric vehicles to power homes, reports David Ferris for POLITICO’s E&E News. The idea has been around for more than a decade but has sputtered getting off the ground. As of now, some EV models are able to feed energy back to a home during a blackout, but that’s limited to when the house is disconnected from the electric grid.

Owners of the Acura RSX will be able to push the envelope further. In SCE’s territory, the grid will be able to actually turn the task of powering appliances like the dishwasher, induction stove and lighting over to the car during periods of high energy demand.

It’s a baby step toward the eventual dream of so-called bidirectional charging for EVs: Using the cars to send power directly to the grid, using them like a miniature, local version of a wind farm or natural gas plant. That is the possibility that most excites vehicle-to-grid experts. Americans drive their cars on average only an hour a day, leaving them idle 95 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“We would love to run, but we are crawling first,” said Chanel Parson, Edison’s director of clean energy and demand response. “We want to master crawling quickly so we can get up and walk quickly.” — DF, NB

NO CIGAR: Veto season is in full swing, and Newsom shot down a series of bills aimed at energy affordability Friday evening. How come? Concern that the proposals could actually cause ratepayer costs to climb.

That was the fate of SB 541, by Senate Energy Chair Sen. Josh Becker. If signed, the bill would have required the California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities Commission to evaluate the economics of “load shifting,” a practice in which utilities incentivize customers to use less energy during high-demand hours so as to reduce the strain on power plants and transmission lines.

Newsom concluded that piling more work on state agencies could backfire.

“At a time when electric bill affordability continues to be a pervasive challenge, it is important that we consider the workload and cost impacts on the CEC and CPUC, some of which are ultimately borne by electric customers, to avoid further compounding the costs embedded in customer electric bills,” Newsom wrote in his veto letter.

It was a similar story for AB 1408, by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, which aimed to expedite clean energy projects while saving ratepayers money by requiring the state to make it easier to plug new projects into the grid where spare space already exists.

“This bill risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability,” Newsom wrote.

Advocates for so-called virtual power plants also took a knock with the rejection of AB 740, which followed the veto of AB 44 earlier last week. AB 740 would have required the CEC to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan, a boon to the companies creating technology that pools energy by adjusting devices in homes, such as batteries and thermostats, to boost the grid during periods of high demand.

Supporters of the vetoed bills expressed a mix of frustration and surprise at the rejection.

“I’m disappointed in this veto of SB 541. This bill was about affordability,” Becker said in a statement, citing a study commissioned by analysis firm GridLab that found the state could avoid $13.7 billion in grid upgrades through 2030 by doubling its load-shifting target. “Next year this area will be a focus of the clean energy community — clearly we have some educating to do.” — NB

SMOLDERING: The U.S. Forest Service has paused planned prescribed burns during the government shutdown, an employee told Marc Heller at POLITICO’s E&E News after a staff meeting last week. The pause comes as the beleaguered agency is falling behind its 10-year average for number of acres on which it’s actively reduced wildfire risk through thinning, prescribed fire and related actions.

As of mid-September — about two weeks before the end of fiscal 2025 — the agency had treated about 2.2 million acres for the year, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, well behind the more than 4 million acres treated in the last year of the Biden administration. — MH, CvK

FOLLOW CALIFORNIA’S LEAD: California’s heat safety regulations are paying dividends for the state’s workers.

The five states, including California, that had heat protections in 2023 saw their odds of workplace injuries increase 8 percent during heat waves that year, while the risk in states without rules was double that, according to a study released Monday by Harvard University and the George Washington University.

The study found that almost 28,000 work injuries occur in the U.S. annually because of heat exposure, but protections like access to water, rest and cool places significantly reduce risk, Ariel Wittenberg reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

The new data comes after the Workers Compensation Research Institute released a study last week that found California’s heat standard reduced workplace injuries by more than 15 percent on hot days in “high-exposure” industries like construction, agriculture and transportation. — AW, AN

RECLAIMING THE LEAD: Scott Cameron will take over as acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, shifting titles at the Interior Department while he maintains his role as the Trump administration’s lead official in negotiations over the future of the Colorado River, as Jennifer Yachnin reports for POLITICO’s E&E News. The decision comes in the wake of Trump’s decision Sept. 30 to withdraw his nomination of Ted Cooke, a former top official at the Central Arizona Project, to be Reclamation commissioner. David Palumbo, a veteran career official at Reclamation overseeing operations in the West, had previously served as acting commissioner.

House Bill 4183 passed early Friday morning with a provision that significantly raises registration costs for EVs. As a result, annual fees for EV drivers will rise by $100, making the cost $260. That increase makes Michigan No. 1 in the nation for the highest, most punitive fees on EVs. A similar increase will be imposed on plug-in hybrids, from $60 to $110.

This outcome is deeply troubling, but it is not irreversible. It is up to the Legislature to solve the problem they created by lowering EV and plug-in hybrid fees to more closely reflect what comparable gasoline-powered vehicles pay. That approach would ensure EV drivers contribute their fair share, while protecting Michigan from being the costliest state in the country for EV ownership.

This fix is essential, because the new policy places a disproportionate burden on a small group of drivers who, according to our research, are already contributing more toward road funding compared to similar gasoline vehicles.

According to the state’s budget estimates, the newly passed measure would only generate $8.3 million in additional road revenues. That amount is negligible in the context of Michigan’s multibillion-dollar transportation budget, but it would create the nation’s highest financial barrier for families who choose to drive electric.

Michigan has built an economic strategy on becoming a hub for clean mobility and electric vehicle manufacturing. Automakers, suppliers, and communities across our state have and are investing in the transition. But the transition hasn’t been easy, and has come under strain by increased foreign competition, tariffs, and the elimination of federal tax incentives.

By increasing EV registration fees, lawmakers risk further undercutting the state’s clean mobility strategy and sending the wrong signal to businesses that are creating jobs in our state.

The costs of this decision, of course, fall on Michigan families. These high fees make it more expensive to own and operate an EV, hitting hardest the households already burdened by high transportation costs and looking to EVs as a way to save money and breathe cleaner air. Instead of supporting these benefits, the state is discouraging adoption and slowing progress toward transportation electrification.

Michigan has a proud legacy as the auto capital of the world, and our future depends on leading the shift to clean mobility. Raising EV fees to the highest in the nation takes us in the wrong direction, punishing families who are part of the solution.

It is now up to lawmakers to correct this imbalance and enact an approach that keeps Michigan competitive, supports innovation, and ensures all drivers contribute fairly to our roads.

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

If this sounds familiar, that’s because it is, the government shut down for a record 35 days in 2018 under Trump’s leadership. As political blame circles in Washington D.C. and the media alike, one of our biggest concerns as a grassroots environmental nonprofit is the vulnerable position this puts our blue-green planet, and the communities who depend on it, in. We work every day to protect marine and endangered wildlife, and promote climate resilience. But we rely on strong public institutions to uphold it. When Congress fails to fund the federal government, the agencies that safeguard our oceans and coastal communities are forced to close their doors, furlough their scientists and halt critical protections. This isn’t just a political gridlock, it’s a direct threat to the ocean, fisheries and the people who depend on healthy marine ecosystems.

An Avoidable and Manufactured Crisis with Real Consequences

Instead of coming together to fund the government responsibly, extremists in Congress are pushing a Continuing Resolution that would lock in an 11% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the long-standing agency we depend on for hurricane forecasts, fisheries management and coastal restoration. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is using the shutdown as cover to accelerate mass layoffs and “Reductions in Force” (RIFs) at environmental and scientific agencies. These actions have already stripped away thousands of years of expertise and data, leaving our nation less prepared for climate disasters and more vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss.

NOAA: Our First Line of Defense Against Climate Disasters

When NOAA is shut down, we all lose and are in danger. Their mission is simple but essential — to protect lives and livelihoods through science, forecasting and stewardship. Without a skilled workforce and technologies the following is possible…

Hurricane forecasting delays: With fewer staff and reduced capacity, communities will receive slower and less accurate warnings just as we enter the height of hurricane season. Every hour counts when lives and homes are at stake.

Fisheries management on hold: A shutdown halts stock assessments and enforcement, creating uncertainty for coastal economies and jeopardizing sustainable seafood supplies.

Climate and ocean research stalled: NOAA’s research vessels will be forced back to port, and its laboratories will go dark. Critical studies on ocean warming, coral bleaching, and shifting marine ecosystems will be delayed or lost entirely.

Public resources offline: Communities rely on NOAA’s Climate Resilience Toolkit and open data platforms to plan for flooding and sea-level rise. A shutdown would cut off access when these tools are needed most.

Wildlife response curtailed: Marine mammal rescue and stranding programs will be scaled back, leaving endangered species like sea turtles and dolphins without critical emergency response support.

The Coast Guard: Working Without Pay and Burning Out

The U.S. Coast Guard, one of NOAA’s closest partners in protecting marine life and coastal safety, must continue operations during a shutdown but without pay. Tens of thousands of service members will still conduct rescues and patrol our waterways under immense strain. Training, maintenance and inspections will be suspended, reducing readiness and increasing risk. Port safety checks will be delayed and pollution monitoring will weaken, all while crews work unpaid to keep the nation’s coasts secure.

Offshore Enforcement Vanished: BOEM and BSEE

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) oversee offshore drilling operations and enforce safety standards that prevent oil spills. When these agencies are shut down, safe inspections stop, leaving oil rigs and pipelines dangerously unmonitored. Also, environmental reviews are frozen which give fossil fuel companies a free pass operate without oversight… a terrifying new reality. We’ve seen what happens when offshore drilling goes unchecked — from Deepwater Horizon to smaller spills that quietly devastate ecosystems. A shutdown puts us on that path again.

U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Paused Protections = At Risk Wildlife

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) plays a key role in protecting endangered marine species and managing coastal habitats that buffer against storms. During a federal government shutdown the following occurs:

Protections for endangered species like sea turtles, whales and sharks are delayed.

National wildlife refuges may close or operate with skeleton crews, harming local tourism and leaving habitats vulnerable.

Restoration projects are halted, weakening natural storm defenses.

Community partnerships and grants freeze, cutting off support for local conservation and coastal resilience initiatives.

Every day of inaction means more lost time for restoration, more risk for wildlife and more hardship for the people who depend on these ecosystems. Healthy oceans and strong environmental protections are not partisan luxuries, they are essential to our survival.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

The operators in the coal sector in the country have long been calling for some sort of action from the government, and although it took some time, the Indonesian officials have finally bent the knee to allow market reform in the coal sector, opening the industry up to increased exports and interest from outside nations.

The coal sector in Indonesia is vital to the success of the Asian nation

The coal sector is facing an uncertain future. Some industry insiders have lamented the reduction of reliance on the coal sector that has been exacerbated by the growth of the renewable energy sector, while others have pointed to countries like the United States that have implemented sweeping measures that aim to reinvigorate the coal sector.

The evidence would suggest that Indonesia falls under the states that aim to keep the flailing coal sector alive and thriving for the foreseeable future. Taking into account that Indonesia is the world’s third-largest producer of coal and lignite, one can understand the government’s easing of pricing regulations in the sector.

The government has removed the obligation for miners in the coal sector

The Indonesian government has revealed that it has removed the obligation for miners to use government benchmark prices as the minimum price for minerals and coal sales. As of March of this year, Jakarta mandated the use of a coal benchmark price for transactions in the sector, which it stated would exercise greater control over the valuation of both domestic and export sales.

The new decree from the government allows miners to sell minerals and coal at prices below the government-set benchmarks, which has been welcomed by industry insiders. The previous benchmark was also used to calculate royalties for the sales of the essential fuel source. However, the production levies and tax obligations will continue to be calculated based on the benchmark prices.

The news underscores the oversupply issues that the coal sector is currently facing. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has meant that global benchmark prices for fossil fuels have plunged by more than 70% since the end of 2022.

Despite the issues faced by the sector, Indonesian coal production has more than doubled since 2020. The sector has been growing at an average rate of 7% per year, reaching 833 Mt in 2024. Other nations have stated that the coal sector is facing a bleak outlook for the future.

The Stockholm Environment Institute outlined the importance of the coal industry for Indonesia.

“Coal is important for the Indonesian economy. It is a source of foreign currency and state revenues as well as employment. In coal mining regions such as East Kalimantan or South Sumatra where the majority of Indonesia’s coal is mined, coal revenues often account for more than 40 percent of provincial government’s revenues; in East Kalimantan, up to 11% of the workforce works in coal value chains.” – Stockholm Environment Institute

The inaugural event was in 2022, which was organized alongside a traditional classic car show in Evansville.","The simulated exhaust note growls from an electric 2024 Dodge Charger Daytona, owned by Jesse Kirkham.

“It's a speaker system that simulates a V8 HEMI,” Kirkham said. ""To be completely honest, I didn't buy it for the sound. I bought it for the look.""

Kirkham cruised in with his car, and dad Jesse Sr. — but this could be their last opportunity. Organizers of the EVs4 EVV event won’t host another — said Caroline Nellis.

“It won't be going unless we get new blood or the dealerships take it over, because we can't, you know, I'm turning 75 this week,"" she said. ""Some of (the board members) are older than I am.”

Her organization, Tristate Creation Care, has organized the event for four years. This year, they paid an individual to organize it because Nellis couldn’t take the lead.

She’s suggested to dealerships that they organize future events to showcase their EVs.

“I don't know if they will decide to do that or not,” she said. “I don't know if this is a final time or if it will be carried on by others in a different capacity from us, but we won't be able to do it anymore.”

The 2025 event was decidedly sparse, but Nellis said test drives were a bright spot. She thinks more were taken this year than previous events.

At the event, a family from Henderson is checking out the brand new Volkswagen ID Buzz electric bus. David Beliles of D-Patrick VW, is showing off its panoramic sunroof, which can go from frosted white, to clear with the swipe of a finger.

“Wow, that's amazing,” said Leann Martin, while taking a test drive with her family. Leann was more skeptical than her husband Kenny. After the drive she was warming up to the idea, after asking about things like the battery range. She appreciated the rear legroom.

Nellis said such interactions with EVs are important, because the whole point was introducing electric vehicles to the public.

“So that ultimately they may end up choosing to buy one at some point and thereby cut greenhouse gas emissions,” she said.

There were enough test rides to warrant bringing two of the VW vans to the show. This is despite the federal tax credits for new and used electric vehicles and hybrids ending last month.

She's encouraged by vehicles like the 2026 Nissan Leaf, for sale at just under $30,000. ""When cars, new cars that are EVs, start being under $30,000 I think that makes it more available to a larger segment of the population,"" Nellis said.

But it seems you've been focusing on some other factor in electricity prices.
And unfortunately, they're beginning to be replaced at the same time as we're seeing rising electricity demand for the first time in the U.S. in basically a generation.
In the New Jersey governor's race, electricity prices have become a huge deal.
INSKEEP: Robinson Meyer of Heatmap News, thanks so much.","STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

A Florida man named Al Salvi noticed something recently. The electricity bills are rising in Pembroke Pines. And he told our colleague, Scott Horsley, that he pays up to $500 per month.

AL SALVI: Seniors down here that are living check to check, now we've got to decide whether we're going to pay electric bill or we're going to buy medication.

INSKEEP: Why is this happening? We called Robinson Meyer, who is executive editor of the climate and energy site Heatmap News. Welcome to the program.

ROBINSON MEYER: Thank you for having me.

INSKEEP: OK, so we hear politicians say that higher electricity prices are about the kind of energy we use, fossil fuels versus renewables, whatever fits their agenda. But it seems you've been focusing on some other factor in electricity prices. What is it?

MEYER: That's right. So I think the biggest driver of the run-up in electricity prices we've seen over the past four or five years, because electricity prices really shot up since the pandemic - they've been rising twice as fast as overall inflation - is the grid itself. And not only the grid itself, it's actually the most local part of the power grid, like that last mile from substations to your house or business.

INSKEEP: I don't automatically get that because the wires are already there and have been there for generations. Why would that get more expensive?

MEYER: In some cases, it's because they've had to be rebuilt because of a natural disaster. And in some cases, they are just getting old. It's actually exactly the fact that they've been there for generations. They're getting old and they need to be replaced. And in some cases, it's because maybe a wildfire burned through an entire area, especially out west. And now the utility has to go in, and not only does it have to rebuild that grid in the local area, it also has to rebuild it in a way that's not as likely to cause a wildfire in the future.

INSKEEP: This is sounding like an unseen cost of climate change.

MEYER: It is, I think, a cost of climate change. I mean, I think it's just that we've had the grid for a long time. I mean, in many places, it's 90 or 100 years old. And it's time for those systems to be replaced. And unfortunately, they're beginning to be replaced at the same time as we're seeing rising electricity demand for the first time in the U.S. in basically a generation.

INSKEEP: What is increasing the demand for electricity?

MEYER: So it's a few things. I think the headline driver is this boom in data center construction and AI, of course. And that is having big effects in certain parts of the country. The other things driving electricity demand are population growth and economic growth. You know, people are getting richer and they're using more electricity. There are people switching to EVs. You know, if you think about going from gasoline to EVs, you got to plug in your car. And then the last thing is something that I think everyone across the political spectrum wants to see, which is more U.S. manufacturing. As factories have gotten built here, that drives higher power demand, too.

INSKEEP: Is it inevitable then that as AI expands, and if the U.S. succeeds in reshoring some manufacturing that I'm just going to pay more and more for electricity?

MEYER: Well, it shouldn't be. And this is one dynamic that I think regulators and state leaders are grappling with right now. In the New Jersey governor's race, electricity prices have become a huge deal. And while I don't think electricity prices are increasing in most areas right now because of AI, I do think there is a good case that AI is driving some of the electricity prices in New Jersey specifically, and data centers specifically. Historically, kind of the way it's worked is that the utility builds out the grid to meet demand from everyone. And then everyone kind of foots the bill for that expansion. I think right now, given that just a few customers are driving so much more electricity demand, utilities and states are trying to figure out how we can, you know, meet that demand while not having absolutely everyone else pay much higher cost to build the infrastructure needed to service those facilities.

INSKEEP: Robinson Meyer of Heatmap News, thanks so much.

MEYER: Thank you for having me.

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

The pipeline will have capacity of up to 950 MMcf/d.
""This expansion allows Energy Transfer to offer its producers and shippers complete optionality in the market place,"" said Jim Holotik, Energy Transfer's vice president of project development.
Energy Transfer's system includes 11,700 miles of pipeline in service plus an additional 550 miles of pipeline that is under construction.","Energy Transfer Partners LP said the board of its general partner has approved a $360 million expansion project that will include the addition of 157 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline and 92,700 horsepower of compression to its proposed 42-inch diameter pipeline system in East and North Texas. The 950 MMcf/d expansion will bring the system's capacity to 2.3 Bcf/d and will bring the total construction cost of the pipeline system to $895 million. The latest expansion is expected to be in service in August 2007.

The new 36-inch diameter line will begin in Limestone County and run southwest to a connection with the 30-inch diameter Texoma system in Hardin County, northeast of Beaumont. Interconnects with several interstate pipelines are being contemplated. Additionally, the Texoma system will deliver gas into Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, a future NGPL interconnect, the Carthage hub, as well as both the east and west side Houston Ship Channel markets.

Energy Transfer said that increased producer commitments out of both the Barnett Shale and Bossier production areas created demand for the expansion project, which will allow shippers to benefit from pricing differentials between marketing hubs. The pipeline will have capacity of up to 950 MMcf/d. It also will increase the capacity of the Texoma system by over 600MMcf/d, with additional capacity available for both intrastate and interstate markets.

""This expansion allows Energy Transfer to offer its producers and shippers complete optionality in the market place,"" said Jim Holotik, Energy Transfer's vice president of project development. He said it gives producers access to three main Texas gas hubs: Waha, Carthage, and Katy, and affords additional access to interstates and east Houston Ship Channel markets. ""This new system offers both Waha and South Texas producers a path around the bottlenecks in the Houston Ship Channel corridor and greater access to both intrastate and interstate markets.""

Those discussions, extended through mid-year, ultimately concluded without resolution, returning the case to court and leading Northern Dynasty to request a summary judgment schedule.
""We are pleased to have filed the Summary Judgement Brief and to simultaneously be continuing our settlement discussions with the government to remove this illegal veto,"" said Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen.
The summary judgment briefs submitted by the plaintiffs argue that the EPA exceeded its legal authority when it vetoed the Pebble project.
""The facts cited by EPA in its veto decision are directly contradicted by the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the official factual record in this proceeding.""","Northern Dynasty, Alaska, Native corps seek ruling to overturn EPA block.

Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. Oct. 6 announced that it, along with the state and two Alaska Native village corporations, has filed summary judgment briefs in Alaska Federal Court challenging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's veto of the Pebble project, asserting that the action was unlawful and should be withdrawn immediately.

After more than a decade of federal review, regulatory reversals, and court challenges, Northern Dynasty's Pebble project culminated in a 2023 Clean Water Act veto issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which effectively nullified years of permitting work and barred development across 309 square miles of Alaska state land in the Bristol Bay region.

The decision, taken despite completion of a multi-year Environmental Impact Statement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that found the project could be developed without measurable harm to downstream fisheries or water quality, marked the first time the agency had used its Section 404(c) authority to preemptively block a mine on state land designated for resource development.

Following that decision, Northern Dynasty and its Alaska-based subsidiary, Pebble Limited Partnership, filed suit alongside the state of Alaska, arguing that EPA's action unlawfully exceeded its statutory authority, conflicted with federal findings, and undermined the Alaska Statehood Act's guarantee of resource management rights over state lands.

Over the next two years, the case moved through a series of pauses and procedural shifts as successive administrations reviewed the matter and federal agencies sought additional time to fill key positions and reassess their litigation strategy.

By February of this year, Northern Dynasty agreed to a 90-day pause requested by EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, granting new leadership an opportunity to review the record and evaluate a potential settlement to withdraw the veto.

Those discussions, extended through mid-year, ultimately concluded without resolution, returning the case to court and leading Northern Dynasty to request a summary judgment schedule.

With settlement efforts at a stalemate, the company now seeks a ruling on what it argues are fundamental issues of law, maintaining that the veto imposes significant economic and legal consequences for Alaska and the United States and contradicts both the conclusions of the project's Environmental Impact Statement and the state's constitutional authority to develop its own resources.

Positioned once again before the court, the case has entered a decisive stage as Northern Dynasty, the state, and two Alaska Native corporations – Iliamna Natives Ltd. and Alaska Peninsula Corp. – seek judicial resolution rather than administrative reconsideration.

""We are pleased to have filed the Summary Judgement Brief and to simultaneously be continuing our settlement discussions with the government to remove this illegal veto,"" said Northern Dynasty President and CEO Ron Thiessen. ""We believe we have a strong case and, along with our fellow plaintiffs, are confident that we will win.""

The latest filings lay out a comprehensive challenge to EPA's authority and interpretation of the Clean Water Act, framing the dispute not only as a matter of permitting but as a test of how far federal agencies may reach in restricting development on state-designated mineral lands.

The summary judgment briefs submitted by the plaintiffs argue that the EPA exceeded its legal authority when it vetoed the Pebble project.

Among the central claims is that the agency's 2023 determination disregarded the official record and the findings of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Final Environmental Impact Statement, which concluded the project could be developed without measurable harm to downstream water or fisheries.

The plaintiffs also argue that the veto imposed substantial economic costs on Alaska and the United States, conflicting with lands specifically designated for mineral development under the Alaska Statehood Act and Cook Inlet Land Exchange.

In addition, they assert that the EPA's conclusions relied on speculative rather than substantiated findings of environmental harm, and that recent U.S. Supreme Court clarification of Clean Water Act jurisdiction shows much of the Pebble deposit area no longer qualifies as federally regulated wetlands.

""And, frankly, we think the filing of this brief will help in our discussions with the government because it clearly highlights agency overreach of its mandate and interference in a project that is on state land which was designated, by statute, for mineral exploration and development,"" said Thiessen. ""The facts cited by EPA in its veto decision are directly contradicted by the Final Environmental Impact Statement, the official factual record in this proceeding.""

As court proceedings advance, the federal government has moved to temporarily halt the case, submitting a motion to stay all deadlines considering the partial shutdown of federal operations that began Oct. 1.

The request, filed after the plaintiffs' summary judgment submission, seeks to pause the court's briefing schedule until the government reopens and its legal teams can resume full activity.

""We object to this request because it is our strong preference to keep to the court ordered briefing schedule, which would require the government to respond by January 2, 2026. We have waited a long time for our day in court in this case, and we should not have to wait any longer to vindicate our rights,"" said Thiessen.",https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/0/0/9300/s_top,N,,2025-10-06 20:02:30.726842

ContourGlobal purchased the Vorotan-Cascade, which houses the three hydroelectric plants and is located in Armenia’s Syunik Province in 2014, making it the largest U.S. investment in Armenia.

That transaction, which occurred during the Serzh Sarkissian administration, was seen as dubious, since the sale of that particular power plant—bordering Azerbaijan—required parliament approval, but was completed in 2015.

At the time, Sarkissian administration officials contended that in the event of a national emergency, the government would nationalize the energy sector and would retain control of that and other power plants in the country.

During a ceremony on Monday a cooperation agreement was signed between CountourGlobal and Ardshinbank, Armenia’s largest bank. Economy Minister Gevorg Papoyan, Martin Galstyan the chairman of Armenia’s Central Bank and U.S. Ambassador Kristina Kvien attended the event.

Welcoming this initiative, Papoyan said that the deal demonstrates the long-term and stable presence of American investments in Armenia and proves that the Vorotan HPP Cascade serves as a guarantor of the country’s energy security.

“The fact that Armenia’s largest bank, Ardshinbank, is able to provide $135 million in funding for such a strategic project speaks to its ability to strengthen the banking sector, comply with international standards, and serve large investors,” Papoyan said in praise of the deal.

“This is a message that Armenia is not only open to investments, but also has strong local partners who can support their implementation,” he added.

According to the source, the funds received from the transaction will be used to refinance existing liabilities and optimize the capital structure, with the goal of increasing the operational efficiency of the Vorotan HPP Cascade (404 MW), which accounts for about 12% of the country’s total electricity generation capacity.",https://media.asbarez.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/10161722/VorotanHydropowerPlant.png,N,,2025-10-06 22:00:34.630439

While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, a key factor that has so far been identified is the failure of the fire suppression system, which allowed the fire to spread rapidly. The building that housed 300 megawatts of battery capacity was completed five years ago, around the time the U.S. utility scale lithium-ion battery storage sector was taking off, with battery safety standards having been updated multiple times since. And now the sector is having to deal with the fallout of the accident, with a growing number of leaders now strongly opposed to the construction of battery storage facilities in their localities.

“We’re not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we’re not going to take risk,” said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, after passing a moratorium in July for a battery storage system proposed near the village line. In August, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York and complained that the state was rushing approvals to meet “delusional” clean energy goals. New York has set an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage over the next five years, equivalent to half of its large-scale systems.

“This is more than a fire, this a wake-up call for the industry. If we’re going to be moving ahead with sustainable energy, we need to have a safe battery system in place,” said Glenn Church, Monterey County Supervisor.

Battery moratoriums refer to a temporary halt on the approval and construction of new Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), often a local or state measure enacted to address public safety concerns related to fires and other hazards associated with lithium-ion batteries. These moratoriums gained traction starting in 2023 and 2024, driven by community opposition to proposed BESS projects near homes and schools, high-profile fires, and a perceived lack of comprehensive safety standards for the technology.

However, the experts have pointed out that BESS detractors could be overreacting, and the nascent industry is merely going through teething problems. “This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,” Ofodike Ezekoye, a mechanical engineering professor and combustion expert at the University of Texas at Austin, said.

Fire risks and growing opposition are just some of the headwinds facing the U..S. battery storage sector. A recent analysis by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), coupled with cuts to other climate policies, could slash U.S. battery production by ~75% by 2030 to 250 GWh from the previously projected 1,050 gigawatt-hours, and EV sales by 40%. According to the report, the new policies could eliminate 130,000 potential jobs in the EV sector by 2030, with the majority in battery manufacturing. Following the passing of the IRA in 2022, companies have announced a total of 128 U.S. facilities for battery manufacturing, with more than half yet to begin construction. Red and purple states including Texas, Michigan, Nevada, Tennessee, Kentucky and Georgia, would be the most adversely impacted.

Interestingly, even Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia, home to Hyundai’s new $5.5B EV and battery manufacturing plant, threw his weight behind the bill, calling it “fantastic.” According to estimates by the experts, the project will create $4-5 billion in fresh investments in Bartow County as well as 3,500 new jobs. Over the past five years, EV-related projects in Georgia have created ~$17 billion in investments and more than 22,800 new jobs.

Meanwhile, the pivotal solar sector would face setbacks under OBBBA. According to a study by the Rhodium Group and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the solar sector has recorded more than $160B in large solar and battery storage projects since the IRA was passed three years ago, marking one of the sector’s most productive periods in recent times. Solar and battery storage have been the fastest growing energy source in the U.S., with the pair expected to account for 81% of new power additions to the grid in the current year.

OBBBA favors solar manufacturing through provisions that incentivize domestic production and streamline the tax credit process, while also setting deadlines for construction and placement in service of solar projects. Specifically, it maintains and clarifies the tax credits for solar projects under Sections 48E and 45Y, while also phasing them out for wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless construction began within 12 months of the Act's enactment.

Losing streak ends Stellantis' 6% gain in the third quarter marks the company's first positive sales quarter in nearly two years.","Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat, posted its first sales gain since the second quarter of 2023.

Chrysler and Jeep brands posted double-digit gains.

Dodge, Ram, Fiat and Alfa Romeo posted decreases, though the company noted positive trends taking place in the Dodge and Ram lineup.

Stellantis' U.S. sales rose 6% in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the same period a year ago, as the brand sold 324,825 vehicles. To keep momentum, the company announced it would take on the cost of the now-expired electric vehicle tax credit through the end of the year while supplies last.

The upswing in Stellantis' sales stands in contrast to the company's performance in recent memory. In the previous quarter, sales fell 10% compared with the same time period in 2024. First-quarter sales this year dropped 12% from the same quarter last year. That followed a 2024 overall decline of 15% year over year.

Despite a tumultuous 12 months — marked by tariff anxiety and an expiring electric vehicle tax credit that led to a massive rush for buyers to cash in on EVs — Stellantis' sales report is good news for the international automaker.

Company officials told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, the offer will continue on the now-expired IRS tax refund on EV sales, following a similar move from competitors Ford Motor Co. and General Motors. Unlike Ford and GM, which are offering credit by preemptively making down payments on vehicles, Stellantis is offering a $7,500 credit through a bonus cash incentive on existing dealer inventory.

According to the numbers, Jeep and Chrysler posted double-digit gains in sales compared with the third quarter of 2025, while Ram posted a slight loss overall, with strong retail sales nonetheless, as the newly retooled HEMI pickups hit the shop floor with orders exceeding production. Dodge, too, underwent a decrease, though the popular Durango — which comes standard with a HEMI — soared to a 44% increase over the model's performance in 2024's third quarter.

Here's how the brands performed in sales compared with 2024's third quarter, according to company data:

Jeep increased by 11%.

Ram decreased by 5%.

Chrysler increased by 45%.

Dodge decreased by 2%.

Fiat increased by 2% (which represents a difference from 316 vehicles in 2024's third quarter, compared with 321 in 2025's second quarter).

Alfa Romeo decreased by 21%.

Stellantis did not report data on its luxury offering, Maserati.

Losing streak ends

Stellantis' 6% gain in the third quarter marks the company's first positive sales quarter in nearly two years. Since May, when Stellantis hired its new CEO, Antonio Filosa, the brand has been on a campaign to revitalize its reputation and status in the American market.

Filosa, a native Italian with more than two decades of experience in the Stellantis family of automakers, replaced former Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares, whose rocky tenure fractured relationships with the UAW and dealers alike.

Under new leadership, Filosa has frequently indicated an intent to revitalize the U.S. sector of the company.

Though Stellantis ended its losing skid, the company turned in poorer sales numbers than its Detroit Three competitors, GM and Ford, which both reported gains.

GM and Ford reported sales on Wednesday, Oct. 1, with GM boasting an 8% increase compared with 2024's third quarter, and Ford's sales also rising about 8% over the same period a year earlier.

The company said it has now started the authorization process and has filed an application for the environmental impact assessment (VIA).

As part of the planned biorefinery project, Eni will convert the existing hydrocracker unit using Ecofining technology and construct a pre-treatment unit for waste and residue feedstocks. Hydrogen will be sourced from existing plants.

Once fully operational, the biorefinery is expected to have the capacity to process 550,000 metric tons of feedstock annually.

According to Eni, the planned conversion project supports the company’s commitment, through Enilive, to increase biorefinery capacity from the current 1.65 million metric tons per year to more than 3 million metric tons in 2028 and over 5 million metric tons in 2030, with the potential to produce up to 2 million metric tons of SAF annually by 2030.

Enilive already produces biofuels at its facilities in Venice, Italy; Gela, Italy; and Chalmette, Louisiana. The company is expected to begin operations at a biorefinery in Livorno, Italy, in 2026. Enilive is also developing biorefinery projects Priolo, Italy, as well as Malaysia and South Korea.

The group of plaintiffs -- made up of solar energy companies, labor unions and homeowners -- filed the lawsuit in federal court in Rhode Island. They accused the EPA of ending the program, in violation of federal law, that would have helped them save on energy costs.

Solar for All was ""expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills during and after the five-year program, providing energy bill relief for more than 900,000 low-income and disadvantaged households,"" the plaintiffs' lawyers wrote.

The program was ""expected to secure 4,000 megawatts of new solar energy over five years and generate 200,000 new jobs,"" according to the complaint.

Solar for All was established with the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $27 billion to make buildings more energy efficient and to install electric vehicle charging stations.

In Monday's complaint, the plaintiffs accused the Trump administration of trying to recapture the billions of congressionally approved dollars in climate funding that was approved during the Biden administration. They are asking a jury to issue an injunction and force the EPA to reinstate the Solar for All program.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said Trump's domestic policy bill, passed in July, canceled ""billions of green slush fund dollars"" for Solar for All.

""The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" Zeldin added.

The plaintiffs also claim Trump's EPA has violated the separation of powers by blocking congressionally approved funding.

(Snark aside: If Big Tech can afford to blow $350 billion on AI capex this year, it can spare some for not frying the grid.)","OPINION:

Oh, the irony of our artificial intelligence overlords: Silicon Valley’s geniuses, busy conjuring chatbots that can write your grocery list or compose bad poetry, are quietly sucking the life out of our electric grids. While Big Tech rakes in trillions of dollars, everyday Americans are left holding the bag — literally, in the form of skyrocketing utility bills.

The data centers powering AI are devouring electricity like a kid with an unlimited candy stash, and it’s high time we force these cash-hoarding behemoths to build their own power plants or buy directly from generators. With more than $368 billion in collective cash reserves — yes, that’s Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Nvidia lounging on mountains of money — they can certainly afford it.

Instead of leeching off the public grid and driving up costs for the rest of us, let them generate their own juice and sell back the excess, easing the strain on consumers. It’s not rocket science; it’s basic fairness.

Let’s crunch the numbers, shall we? AI data centers are energy vampires on steroids. In 2023, they guzzled about 4.4% of U.S. electricity, a figure the Department of Energy projects could triple to 12% by 2030.

Globally, the International Energy Agency warns that demand from these facilities could more than double by 2030, hitting 945 terawatt-hours, enough to power entire countries.

In the U.S., electricity consumption from data centers is slated to surge 130% by 2030, accounting for up to 44% of new demand and necessitating costly grid upgrades.

Who’s paying? You and me. Utility bills are already climbing, thanks to the Biden-era shuttering of reliable coal plants and the addition of huge amounts of part-time wind and solar. AI data demand is growing steeper as AI’s thirst grows.

One report calls it a “sharp rise” in bills, courtesy of infrastructure strains that hit households hardest.

This isn’t just about affordability; it’s about reliability too. AI demands 100% uptime. Those servers can’t afford a hiccup, lest your virtual assistant forget how to boil water. Grids are buckling under the load, risking blackouts and shortages. Deloitte estimates that U.S. AI data center power needs could hit 123 gigawatts by 2035, a thirtyfold jump, compromising grid stability.

Recent analyses show that data centers are doubling their consumption, forcing utilities to scramble and pass costs to consumers via rate hikes.

In states such as Virginia and Georgia, where data centers cluster, residents are already grumbling about inflated bills subsidizing tech giants.

Here’s the fix: Mandate that Big Tech build or buy its own electricity “before the meter.” Be their own generators, strike deals with producers, whatever; just don’t dump demand on the public pool or take away our needed supply. With Big Tech’s $368 billion war chest (and that’s conservative; quarterly revenue alone tops $100 billion for some), they could fund solar farms, wind arrays, natural gas and even nuclear reactors faster than you can say “ChatGPT.”

Then, let them sell excess power back to the grid, relieving pressure and potentially lowering rates for us plebs. In exchange, they get backup during maintenance shutdowns because even their shiny plants need tuneups.

Oh, and make them pay for grid interconnections. Why should ratepayers foot the bill for Big Tech’s reliability crutches?

This calls for legislative muscle. States such as Texas and California, already feeling the pinch, should lead with laws requiring data centers over a certain size to self-generate at least 80% of their power.

Congress could tie federal tax incentives for AI to energy independence mandates, or the Department of Energy could enforce grid-impact fees. A push for an Energy Department study on AI’s toll is a start, but we need action: bills that prioritize consumer wallets over corporate profits. (Snark aside: If Big Tech can afford to blow $350 billion on AI capex this year, it can spare some for not frying the grid.)

Enough with the free ride. Lawmakers, wake up. Enact these changes now, or we’ll all be paying premium for AI’s endless appetite.

“Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development for the Coastal Plain Venture,” Exxon said in an emailed statement.
John Titas, president of the Victoria Economic Development Corporation in nearby Victoria, said he didn’t think Exxon’s decision was related to the tax break fight.
Another firm, Expert Market Research, expects overall plastics markets to grow 51 percent in that time.
As soon as she heard about the new Exxon project, in December 2024, she said she leapt into action, involving herself in the various public processes she’s come to know about, including the school district tax break agreements.","Exxon Mobil will postpone its plans for a large new plastics production plant on the Gulf Coast of Texas, according to the company. Construction was initially planned to begin next year on the $10 billion facility in rural Calhoun County.

“Based on current market conditions, we are going to slow the pace of our development for the Coastal Plain Venture,” Exxon said in an emailed statement. “We’re confident in our growth strategy, and we remain interested in a potential project along the US Gulf Coast and in other regions around the world.”

Six weeks prior, a county district court judge invalidated the local school board’s decision to negotiate a tax break agreement with Exxon, following a lawsuit from Diane Wilson, 77, and her group, San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper.

On Aug. 19 the judge ordered the school board to redo its public hearing on Exxon’s tax break after Wilson alleged the district provided inadequate notice of the meeting in “a deliberate attempt to avoid public opposition.” Wilson, an internationally known environmental advocate, promised to bring a large audience for the repeat hearing.

“I think it definitely played into it,” Wilson said of Exxon’s pause. “I think if everybody had just rolled over for them, if they got exactly what they wanted and there wasn’t a big fight, there would be no delay.”

Exxon, which reported nearly $34 billion in profits in 2024, was seeking a 50 percent reduction in its property taxes to the rural Calhoun County Independent School District for 10 years, beginning in 2031, when the project would come online.

The world-scale plastics plant was planned to produce up to 3 million tons per year of polyethylene pellets for export, primarily to Asia, according to Exxon’s December 2024 tax abatement application.

John Titas, president of the Victoria Economic Development Corporation in nearby Victoria, said he didn’t think Exxon’s decision was related to the tax break fight.

“I think they’ve been very thankful for the support they received in the community,” he said. “It’s economics. To justify an investment of that magnitude, you’ve got to make sure the market will provide a return.”

In Exxon’s latest statement, first reported last week by Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, an industry news service, the company maintained the possibility of resuming the project in the future. “We’re maintaining good relationships with community leaders and contractors, so we are ready to reevaluate the project’s status when market conditions improve,” it said.

Exxon didn’t specify which market conditions would need to change. Most projections forecast strong growth in plastics demand over coming years.

The economic intelligence firm Precedence Research expects markets for polyethylene, which the Exxon plant would produce, to grow 64 percent between 2024 and 2034, according to a June 2025 assessment. Another firm, Expert Market Research, expects overall plastics markets to grow 51 percent in that time. According to the Plastics Industry Association, “The global plastics industry continues to accelerate, backed by strong demand.”

Wilson said the project’s delay marked the best news she’d heard since 2019, when she found out that her lawsuit against another nearby petrochemical giant, Formosa Plastics, would end with a settlement worth more than $100 million in penalty payouts, facility upgrades and cleanup projects.

A retired shrimper and mother of five, Wilson learned her tactics of resistance over decades of radical activism in defense of Texas’ coastal bays, where four generations of her family have fished for a living. In 2023 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize, the leading global award for environmental activism.

As soon as she heard about the new Exxon project, in December 2024, she said she leapt into action, involving herself in the various public processes she’s come to know about, including the school district tax break agreements.

Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.
Aging plants and optimism The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future.","BILLINGS, Mont. — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials said they would go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.” No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government’s biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump’s ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and, in some cases, shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration’s push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who’s going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration’s enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in implementing those policies in markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will proceed beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in the coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful” and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said on Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states, which were won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We’re putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We’ve got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP’s finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually, coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by a Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC’s Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company stated that the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal adjacent to the Spring Creek mine was approximately $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC stated that the low value was supported by prior government reviews, which predicted fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal’s future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually, up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

“U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,” Peabody’s president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don’t see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,” Kumar said.

Re: States are the last line of defense against Trump’s attacks on clean energy and raising utility bills

Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans’ attacks on clean energy have led to higher utility bills for Americans nationwide. In response, state leaders across the country are enacting policies that deploy clean energy to lower energy costs and pollution. The Republican budget is expected to add more than $100 a year to Americans’ bills, and his administration’s attempt to block and limit wind and solar energy could cost even more.

State and local leaders continue to provide a different path focused on deploying clean energy at scale, reducing pollution, and lowering utility bills. In recent weeks, we’ve seen actions like California governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order to speed up clean energy projects eligible for federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits before they expire, and New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherril’s No Rate Hikes pledge that she made on the campaign trail last month.

KEARNEY INTRODUCES ABBY'S LAW State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-Delaware County, has officially introduced Abby's Law in the Pennsylvania Senate as Senate Bill 1008.","(TNS) — The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) this week announced the opening of the state's 20th federally-funded Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station — putting Pennsylvania in the lead nationally for the number of stations built using funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and representing a total federal investment of approximately $11.5 million.

The new station is located at Sheetz in Pittsburgh on Freeport Road along Interstate 76 (Exit 48).

Since the first NEVI-funded station opened in PA, the charging stations have delivered more than 30,000 charging sessions, powering over 3.5 million estimated miles driven and reducing CO2 emissions by more than 1.7 million pounds.

Additionally, PennDOT announced that it is the first state to receive a Full Build-Out Certification under the new federal NEVI guidance issued in August. The build-out certification allows a state to move beyond the initial phase of the NEVI program, which focused on building charging stations on the core network of interstate highways. This enables PennDOT to begin the next stage of the NEVI program — Corridor Connections — which will be released on or before Oct. 7.

""Thanks to our team's diligent work in 2023 and 2024, and Gov. Josh Shapiro's persistent efforts to secure Congressionally appropriated funding, we're in a position to continue making EVs more accessible for PA travelers,"" said PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll. ""That quick action ensured Pennsylvania could adapt to national program changes while locking in investments for Pennsylvania.""

Per NEVI guidance issued Aug. 11, PennDOT submitted an updated Pennsylvania NEVI State Plan and a second request for Full Build-Out Certification to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on Aug. 27. The next phase will begin projects that connect communities.

The NEVI State Plan was approved on Sept. 5, and PennDOT received Full Build-Out Certification on Sept. 22, 2025. Having received approval, the Shapiro Administration is moving forward with the community phase of the NEVI program, beginning with the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity.

The Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity focuses on implementing EV charging stations along major roadways to strengthen long-distance travel outside of previously designated Alternative Fuel Corridors.

PennDOT anticipates soliciting about 24 projects through the Corridor Connections Funding Opportunity, with up to $20 million in available funding.

The submission period will close at 5 p.m. on Jan. 30, 2026.

PENNDOT WELCOMES PROPOSALS

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) Office of Public-Private Partnerships (P3) announced this week that it is accepting unsolicited proposals for transportation projects from the private sector through Oct. 31.

Instructions on how to submit a project and information on the unsolicited proposal review process can be found on the state's P3 website. PennDOT holds an unsolicited proposal period in April and October each year.

The submission period applies to PennDOT-owned projects, infrastructure, and services. During this period, the private sector can submit proposals offering innovative ways to deliver transportation projects across all modes, including roads, bridges, rail, aviation, and ports. Proposals can also include more efficient models to manage existing transportation-related services and programs.

The private sector may also submit applications for non-PennDOT-owned assets directly to the P3 board during this time. Transportation entities outside of the governor's jurisdiction, such as transit authorities and the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, may establish their own timelines or accept proposals year-round.

The state's P3 law allows PennDOT and other transportation authorities and commissions to partner with private companies to participate in delivering, maintaining, and financing transportation-related projects.

As part of the P3 law, the seven-member Public Private Transportation Partnership Board was appointed to examine and approve potential public-private transportation projects. If the board determines a state operation would be more cost-effectively administered by a private company, PennDOT would issue a Request for Proposals and start a competitive procurement as defined by the P3 law.

The next unsolicited proposal acceptance period will occur in April 2026.

PENNDOT INVITES YOU TO SHARE FEEDBACK

The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) is accepting feedback on construction and maintenance services through an online survey.

The public can take the survey through October 21 by visiting — 2025 PennDOT Construction/Maintenance Customer Satisfaction Survey.

PennDOT has been hard at work improving Pennsylvania's roads and bridges throughout the year, improving more than 2,600 miles of road, including over 900 miles of paving, and beginning work to repair, replace, or preserve more than 230 bridges from January through August of this year, officials said.

""The PennDOT team is serving Pennsylvanians every day, and each year we look for feedback on what we're doing well and could improve,"" Carroll said. ""The survey also lets the public tell us how they receive roadway information and helps us find potential educational opportunities.""

The 22-question survey asks participants how they receive PennDOT roadway information and how often PennDOT meets or exceeds expectations in construction and maintenance activities. Respondents are also asked about experiences with reporting concerns to the department, and whether or how they use the state's 511PA traveler information services.

KEARNEY INTRODUCES ABBY'S LAW

State Sen. Tim Kearney, D-Delaware County, has officially introduced Abby's Law in the Pennsylvania Senate as Senate Bill 1008.

The legislation is named in memory of 12-year-old Abigail Gillon, who tragically passed after an e-scooter crash in June 2025 in Aston.

Since announcing his intention in July to introduce the legislation, several serious e-scooter crashes have occurred in the region, underscoring the urgent need for safeguards.

Municipalities have also taken action to underscore Pennsylvania's current laws — Marple Township voted to ban e-scooters outright, while Haverford Township recently passed an ordinance requiring children under 16 to wear helmets when riding e-bikes.

Kearney's proposal has drawn national attention, with safety groups and media outlets across the country highlighting the legislation and its intention.

Kearney's office has been working closely with Abby's family and a wide range of stakeholders to shape the bill so it can move quickly through the legislative process.

""Abby's loved ones have experienced an unimaginable loss,"" Kearney said. ""This is not just about policy. It is about protecting our children and creating commonsense measures that keep pace with changing technology.""

While most other states have legalized e-scooters and set rules for their operations, e-scooters are not recognized under Pennsylvania's Vehicle Code, leaving riders without any clear rules or standards.

To address this gap in regulation and prevent further tragedies, Kearney introduced Abby's Law as a step forward to improve safety on public streets.

This legislation would:

Set an age minimum of 16 for e-scooter riders, and require helmets for 16- and 17-year-old riders

Set a statewide speed limit of 20mph for e-scooters

Prohibit more than one rider on an e-scooter

Require e-scooters to follow bicycle traffic rules

Provide for rider and driver education and awareness

Abby's Law has been referred to the Senate Transportation Committee.

Governor Shapiro’s Administration is setting records, creating more opportunity for Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth.

Harrisburg, PA – Under Governor Josh Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is emerging as a national model for economic development — delivering real results that position the Commonwealth to compete and win, attract investment, and create opportunity in communities across the state. As the Governor speaks to the PA Chamber of Commerce & Industry’s Annual Dinner this evening, Pennsylvania is winning major economic deals.

From day one, Governor Shapiro has prioritized making Pennsylvania more competitive — launching the Commonwealth’s first economic development strategy in nearly two decades, securing $550 million for site development, Main Streets, workforce training, innovation and small businesses, and streamlining permitting, licensing, and certification processes to help projects get built faster.

“Pennsylvania is competing again — and we’re winning,” said Governor Shapiro. “We’re building new industrial sites, revitalizing our Main Streets, and supporting small businesses across the Commonwealth. We’ve cut permitting times and taxes, reduced backlogs and waitlists, and made government move at the speed of business. As a result, we’re winning historic deals including the largest private sector investment in our history and we’re attracting more companies to grow here and create good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians. The Commonwealth is open for business — and we’re just getting started.”

The Shapiro Administration has secured a record $25.6 billion in private-sector investment and created nearly 12,400 new jobs since taking office — transforming communities and positioning Pennsylvania for sustained, long-term growth.

Governor Shapiro has also cut taxes, modernized government, and expanded funding to prepare more sites for business expansion — helping Pennsylvania earn the title of #1 State in the Northeast for Regional Economic Competitiveness from Site Selection Magazine. These reforms have also helped attract the largest private-sector investment in Pennsylvania’s history: a $20 billion initial investment from Amazon to build new AI and cloud computing campuses across the Commonwealth, creating thousands of high-tech and construction jobs.

Cutting Red Tape and Moving at the Speed of Business

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is reforming government and delivering faster, more predictable permitting and licensing processes that give businesses the certainty they need to invest and grow.

When the Governor took office, business filings could take up to eight weeks to process. Now, entrepreneurs can receive approvals in as little as one day. The Department of Environmental Protection has eliminated 98 percent of its permit backlog and processed over 20,000 labor-intensive permits this year.

Governor Shapiro has transformed how Pennsylvania does business by making government more efficient and responsive:

Launched the Office of Transformation and Opportunity (OTO) to coordinate permitting and business support, assisting over 200 companies in 2024.

Created the PA Permit Fast Track Program, the first in the nation for multi-agency coordination to expedite major projects — now supporting 7 public-facing projects.

Introduced PAyback, a money-back guarantee for timely permit and license processing — with over 40 million applications processed and only five refunds issued to date.

Securing Historic Investment and Growing Pennsylvania’s Economy

Governor Shapiro’s focus on competitiveness and reform has led to record-breaking private investment across Pennsylvania.

In June, the Governor announced Amazon’s $20 billion investment to establish high-tech cloud computing and AI innovation campuses – the largest private sector investment in Pennsylvania history – creating at least 1,250 high-paying, high-tech jobs in Westmoreland and Bucks Counties. The Shapiro Administration also committed $10 million for workforce development to expand vo-tech programs, add new CTE classes, and build training centers that prepare Pennsylvanians for these jobs of the future.

Companies like Excelitas Technologies, which moved its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh, and Adare Pharma, which relocated its headquarters to Northeast Philadelphia, are choosing Pennsylvania as their home for growth.

Across the Commonwealth, manufacturers like B. Braun in the Lehigh Valley and Joseph Machine Company in York County are expanding their facilities, creating hundreds of new jobs, and strengthening Pennsylvania’s industrial backbone.

These efforts are driving new investments across the Commonwealth — from revitalizing Downtown Pittsburgh with $60 million in state capital that’s leveraging $600 million in private investment, to strengthening the Commonwealth’s main streets and small businesses that anchor local economies through the Main Streets Matters program.

Building the Energy Economy of the Future

Governor Shapiro reaffirmed his commitment to an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy that keeps costs low, supports Pennsylvania jobs, and ensures reliable power for businesses and families.

Under his leadership, Pennsylvania is producing more energy than ever before – including restarting operations at Three Mile Island and converting former coal-fired power plants into natural gas facilities that will generate an additional 5 gigawatts of power for the regional grid.

Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan — supported by a bipartisan coalition of industry and environmental leaders — will create jobs, lower energy costs, speed up permitting, and expand energy generation right here in Pennsylvania.

Last month, the Governor convened the first-ever state-led PJM Governors Collaborative, bringing together representatives from 13 states to push for regional action to improve grid reliability, reduce costs, and accelerate clean energy deployment for 67 million customers.

Investing in Infrastructure, Innovation, and the Workforce

Through Governor Shapiro’s 2024–25 bipartisan budget, the Shapiro Administration invested $500 million in site development, including $400 million for the PA SITES Program to make more locations shovel-ready for business investment.

To date, 18 projects have been awarded $74.6 million, helping communities across Pennsylvania compete for new job-creating opportunities.

The Governor’s 2025–26 budget proposal builds on this momentum with major investments in innovation, workforce, and tax reform:

$50 million for scientific and technological innovation — including $30 million for life sciences and $20 million for large-scale research and development.

$10 million for the new AdvancePA Tax Credit to attract and retain high-quality jobs.

$12.5 million for WEDnetPA to close workforce gaps.

Accelerated Corporate Net Income Tax cuts to reach 4.99 percent by 2029, and streamlined and modernized tax credits to focus on high-impact growth industries.

Governor Shapiro’s leadership is delivering results: faster government, stronger communities, and an economy built for the future. The Shapiro Administration continues to move quickly and efficiently to process permit applications, get businesses answers, and land major deals that benefit the people of Pennsylvania.

But with Merrimack Station shutting down, there will no longer be coal burned in New England to power the grid.
The company has said publicly that they’re hoping to turn Merrimack Station and Schiller Station into “renewable energy parks,” with batteries and solar.
Oregon and Washington are planning to eliminate coal from their generation portfolio by the end of this year, when the Centralia, WA coal plant is scheduled for retirement.
There, the plan for the future includes a $55 million fund, through an agreement between Washington State and the coal plant owner, to help the Centralia community transition.","The last coal-fired power plant in New England, Merrimack Station, has stopped running.

With the closure of that facility, the region is poised to become the first in the United States without a coal plant on its grid (though New York state, which has its own regional grid operator, stopped burning coal in 2020).

Granite Shore Power, the company that owns the coal plant in Bow, New Hampshire, said they ceased commercial operations September 12th, about a year and a half since they announced they would retire their facility by 2028 as part of a settlement agreement with environmental groups.

“For nearly three quarters of a century, Merrimack Station has reliably served the energy needs of families and businesses across New Hampshire,” the company wrote in a statement.

The facility still has two kerosene-fired generators that will continue running. It has been struggling to keep its coal-fired generators in compliance with state regulations for more than two years.

“I’m so glad that we are not going to burn any more coal in New Hampshire,” said Kendra Ford, a climate organizer with 350 New Hampshire. “I know that this is hard on people who work there, and I know that the town of Bow may also be a little caught off guard by it closing at this moment, so I hope that lots of things can be done for those folks.”

Merrimack Station and another plant owned by Granite Shore Power, Schiller Station, are the last two coal-fired plants connected to New England’s regional electric grid. Schiller Station has not burned coal since 2020. In Maine, a paper mill burns coal to power their own operations.

Mary Cate Colapietro, a spokesperson for New England’s regional grid operator, said the organization has not received a formal retirement request from Merrimack Station, but the region does not depend on the facility for the grid’s reliability.

“Coal generation accounted for only 0.22% of power in the region in 2024,” Colapietro said.

Colapietro said there is no way to track what kinds of fuel are being used to generate the electricity that is imported from other regions, meaning it’s not a given that New Englanders are using coal-free power.

But with Merrimack Station shutting down, there will no longer be coal burned in New England to power the grid.

Granite Shore Power said they would provide assistance or placement services to employees who lost their jobs, and that they were considering “all opportunities” for redevelopment at the site of the plant.

Local transitions

Merrimack Station opened in the 1960s. It generated power for the regional grid – and had a major impact on the community that hosted it, the town of Bow.

“Back when it was built, it was the largest taxpayer in town by far,” said David Stack, Bow’s town manager.

The amount of revenue that Bow got from property taxes on the coal plant allowed the town to keep tax rates low, leading to a boom in residential development. The impact was especially profound because New Hampshire towns depend heavily on property taxes, Stack said.

But the value of the plant, and how much they should pay in taxes, has been the subject of yearslong conflict between Bow and the owners of Merrimack Station – first Public Service of New Hampshire and Eversource, and more recently, Granite Shore Power.

The conflict led to a lawsuit, in which Bow had to pay Eversource millions of dollars, after the New Hampshire Supreme Court found they had charged the company too much in taxes. Stack says that as the value of the plant has continued to drop, Bow has felt the economic impact.

Over the last 15 years, Stack says, Bow has tried to adapt. Officials have worked to become friendlier to developers, changing zoning rules. Firms like DHL and Coastal Forest Products opened distribution centers in town. But other than mixed-use developments that are primarily residential, Stack says there aren’t a lot of new opportunities.

“As far as manufacturing, you don’t really see that anymore,” Stack said. “I just don’t know if big commercial ventures beyond Amazon are that successful.”

A few years ago, the taxes from new commercial developments surpassed the taxes the power plant was paying – a major turning point for reducing Bow’s reliance on the plant. But despite the town’s preparation, the news of Merrimack Station’s closure came as a surprise.

“We realized we were going to get to this point eventually,” Stack said. “I thought they had a little more time.”

Stack says Granite Shore Power has never sat down with officials in Bow to talk about the future. The company has said publicly that they’re hoping to turn Merrimack Station and Schiller Station into “renewable energy parks,” with batteries and solar. Jim Andrews, the head of Granite Shore Power, said in 2024 he wasn’t planning to include natural gas as part of the redevelopment. But, he said, it’s not off the table.

“We’re concerned with the valuation. But we don’t know exactly what technology they’re looking at putting there,” Stack said.

National shifts

In the opposite northern corner of the country, other communities are also preparing to leave coal behind. Oregon and Washington are planning to eliminate coal from their generation portfolio by the end of this year, when the Centralia, WA coal plant is scheduled for retirement.

There, the plan for the future includes a $55 million fund, through an agreement between Washington State and the coal plant owner, to help the Centralia community transition.

Coal still makes up about 8% of the generation capacity in the Northwest, including Idaho and Montana. Next door, in California, coal still made up a small fraction of the state’s power production as of 2024.

Nationally and globally, coal has been on its way out for years. Coal plants account for the largest share of retiring energy generators in the country.

Research shows coal has become more expensive than other fuel options. And it’s one of the most carbon-emitting fossil fuels, creating emissions that can harm the health of people nearby and that fuel climate change.

Still, coal accounted for about 16% of the U.S.’s power generation in 2023. Some plants are delaying retirements. The Trump Administration has announced several efforts to expand the industry, including putting millions of dollars towards re-opening or modernizing coal plants, opening millions of acres of federal land for coal mining, and relaxing federal environmental rules that affect the burning of coal.

For Kendra Ford, the climate advocate, Merrimack Station’s closure seems to be another sign of the industry in decline, despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to revive it.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3322f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+230/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F36%2F733bea6a4cf69221e0b9b8ed0e2f%2Fbowcoalprotest0612.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 18:02:55.214070

October 6, 2025 (Washington) – Conservation Law Foundation (CLF) along with the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), Lawyers for Good Government (L4GG), and the Lawyers Committee for Rhode Island, filed a legal challenge in federal court on behalf of a coalition of businesses and nonprofits to reverse the Trump administration’s illegal termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program.

Solar for All represents a generational opportunity to cut skyrocketing power bills, create new good jobs, and equip our communities to address the causes and consequences of a changing climate. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is attempting to unlawfully terminate the program.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at CLF. “This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat. Stripping those benefits away is unlawful and betrays communities. We will not let it stand.”

Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a statewide organization of trade unions representing more than 80,000 people. EPA’s attempt to terminate Solar for All deprived their members of opportunities for apprenticeships and job training that would have been crucial for a clean energy future.

Solar United Neighbors is also joining the challenge as a nonprofit working in multiple states on projects like creating solar-powered homes that can serve as a refuge for neighbors during power outages in Texas.

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All. This popular program was poised to bring more solar to our communities, provide jobs for the small businesses installing those projects, and help families get cheap, clean power,” said SELC Senior Attorney Nick Torrey. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal against a million American families and communities who need access to clean, affordable energy. By terminating the Solar for All program while simultaneously ending clean air protections, this administration is sending a clear message: they will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry. We will not allow this administration to trample the legal rights of Americans, and we will keep fighting for a clean, affordable future for the people and the planet,” L4GG Vice President of Climate Change and Environmental Justice Jillian Blanchard said.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” said Amy Romero, Chief Legal Counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island. “EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

Background

In 2024, through Solar for All, EPA awarded $7 billion in grants to organizations nationwide to provide energy bill relief to over 900,000 households. All that funding is intended to get affordable solar power to more people through new leasing and power purchase programs, multifamily installations, workforce development and more.

About 28 million households across the country face a high or severe energy burden, meaning they spend a high percentage of their income on energy bills. Solar for All rooftop and community solar programs are helping to alleviate these burdens with a guaranteed 20% savings on electricity bills for participating households. Nationwide, the program is expected to save an estimated $350 million annually on energy bills and generate 200,000 new jobs alongside workforce training programs. In addition, the SFA program is a source of immediate, cost-effective energy for strained electric grids across the country.

Participants will be joined by subject matter experts for a full day of policy discussions on Tuesday, October 7th, including a deep dive on RNG fleeting policy priorities, extending the $0.50/gallon Alternative Fuel Tax Credit, establishing a $1.00/gallon Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Fuel Tax Credit, and preserving RNG viability in EPA's regulatory programs such as the Phase 3 GHG Rule and the Renewable Fuel Standard. On Wednesday, October 8th, participants along with Transport Project staffers will be meeting on Capitol Hill to lobby Members of Congress and senior staff on industry issues.

Chuck Coppa, APG's CEO/CFO, will be representing APG along with multiple industry executives spanning vehicle and engine manufacturers, servicers, suppliers, fuel producers and providers as well as multiple industry trade organizations. Mr. Coppa will be discussing APG's practical, affordable, and proven alternative fuel solution to convert existing Class 8 diesel trucks with APG's vehicular Dual Fuel System. With no loss of power and torque, the Dual Fuel solution provides the ability to realize meaningful net fuel savings through the substitution of up to 60% natural gas including low-carbon and negative-carbon renewable natural gas. According to the American Trucking Association, 95.8% of all carriers operate 10 or less trucks and 99.7% operate 100 or less trucks which makes APG's Dual Fuel solution so appealing as we believe most fleets are either just hesitant of change or do not have the financial resources to completely swap out their entire diesel fleet for cleaner burning vehicles.

Mr. Coppa noted, ""Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, reducing on-road transportation related operating costs and emissions while using readily available cleaner burning domestic fuel sources should be a top priority and is an important step in America's goal of achieving energy dominance and independence. I am excited to represent APG alongside so many high-profile industry executives.""

The EV maker and its rivals are bracing for a sharp drop in sales in the last three months of the year without the $7,500 in credits. While some have cut prices and found mechanisms to extend the benefits of the credit, others have cut production plans in anticipation of a slump.

The EV industry has already been grappling with high tariffs on imports of vehicles and auto parts into the U.S.

While Lucid makes its vehicles in the U.S., it imports some parts from abroad. Lucid vehicles did not qualify for the tax credits on cash purchases, but it used the credits to offer attractive leases.

Lucid handed over 4,078 vehicles in the quarter, compared with estimates of 4,286 deliveries seven analysts, on average, were expecting, according to Visible Alpha. This compares with 2,781 vehicles delivered a year ago.

EV giant Tesla posted record quarterly deliveries on Thursday, while Rivian also beat sales estimates as consumers rushed to buy EVs ahead of the incentive’s September 30 deadline.

The company has put in place offers and discounts to boost the appeal of its luxury Air sedans to attract consumers who have pared back big-budget spending because of high interest rates.

The EV maker has been aggressively striking deals with North American companies to domestically source critical minerals used in manufacturing.

The company’s fortunes rely heavily on the success of its newly launched Gravity SUV and the upcoming mid-size car, which targets a $50,000 price point, as the company looks to expand its consumer base.

The department has evolved its services over time to include technology strategy and design services, application development, and managed security services. In 2017, DIR began offering public cloud services, starting with Azure and AWS, and recently added Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. The goals are to avoid vendor lock-in, which limits technology choice, and provide access to the latest innovations and best-of-breed solutions.

“Texas is a big state, and we have a lot of government entities with varying missions. At DIR, we strive to always offer our customer agencies the choice of what would be best for their applications and ultimately, what would be the best value for Texans and the taxpayers of this state,” Crawford says.

Through the DCS program, public cloud use has climbed to 30% since 2017, with private cloud at 70%, Ward says. The program now serves 121 state and local government agencies and educational institutions, including 29 state agencies that are required by law to participate and 18 others that have joined voluntarily.

Agencies are increasingly adopting public cloud to modernize or build new applications, taking advantage of Platform as a Service and the ability to scale services up or down as needed, Ward says.

DIR offers four public cloud services to give agencies choice, because no two clouds are the same, she says. Their choices are based on the best fit for their application or their existing expertise.

“There are business and technology reasons why one platform would be better for a particular need,” Ward says. “It could be that an agency is an AWS shop or an Azure shop. That’s what they know, and that’s what they want to keep using.”

Modernizing Applications to Improve Public Services

The Office of the Texas Secretary of State uses DIR’s traditional data center services but has also adopted AWS, Azure and other public cloud services to modernize applications, says Dan Teczar, the office’s CIO.

“The economies of scale we achieve through DIR with the buying power of the state is a great resource, especially for a smaller agency like the Secretary of State’s office,” he says. “In addition to cost, we benefit greatly from the contract vehicles, services and expertise offered by DIR’s internal staff and vendor partners.”

The agency took advantage of DIR resources when it recently modernized its Texas Register and Notary Public applications in the public cloud, resulting in more streamlined business operations and better customer service, Teczar says.

The SoS modernized its 30-year-old Texas Register system, where agencies publish public notices and new rules, using a cloud-native, low-code platform hosted in AWS.

The new Texas Register application cut editorial preparation time by up to 75%, reduced security vulnerabilities by 70% throughout the agency and allowed the public to see rule updates almost immediately, Teczar says.

SoS also modernized its Notary Public software, making 95% of filings paperless and saving staff over 700 hours per month through automation.

Overall, public cloud services have enabled the Secretary of State’s office to pursue digital transformation that delivers faster, smarter services, Teczar says.

“By combining modern tools, inclusive engagement and relentless focus on public value, we are turning outdated processes into high-performing digital services that restore trust and reduce burden,” he says.

Scaling Resources Across Departments

Texas Health and Human Services (HHS), which provides IT services for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) and the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), migrated to the DIR DCS program in 2007 and began utilizing public cloud services in 2019.

DSHS chooses public cloud services based on individual application requirements, primarily using AWS (with a smaller presence in Azure), while also using DIR’s private cloud resources. Before the 2007 DCS migration, HHS mostly used on-premises data centers operated by the Texas Facilities Commission.

The DCS program’s public and private cloud services offer advantages over traditional data centers. Both cloud options use a pay-as-you-go model that can provide cost efficiencies.

Because the program’s management structure (which includes private cloud operations and the DCS public cloud manager) handles maintenance and updates, HHS IT staff have more time to focus on core business activities, an HHS spokesperson says.

“With the cloud platforms’ scalable, flexible and agile resources, HHS can quickly adjust capacity based on demand, make timely system changes and reduce downtime,” the HHS spokesperson says. “The platforms also offer higher performance, reliability, built-in disaster recovery, and tools and infrastructure for superior security controls.”

Building Data Center Services

To manage this hybrid environment, DIR has contracted with a multisourcing services integrator that oversees vendors and cloud companies and provides overall governance. DIR uses reference architectures to optimize cloud operations, ensuring each public cloud environment is deployed consistently and securely and meets industry best practices.

“Reference architectures are established to ensure standards and compliance. Customers don’t have to create them,” Ward says. “Health checks are run. Vulnerabilities are managed. All of this is tightly controlled to ensure that we minimize – as much as we can – the opportunity for a breach.”

Public cloud deployments include financial controls to prevent cost overruns. Agency leaders must approve projects and set cost limits. Agencies are notified if they reach a spending threshold, she says.

Previously, state agency leaders were reluctant to fully embrace public cloud, but these operational, security and financial controls have addressed their concerns, prompting increased adoption, Ward says.

To deploy public cloud services, agencies submit a ServiceNow ticket with their requirements, Ward says.

A vendor that serves as the state’s public cloud manager holds a joint application development session with the agency. The vendor scopes out the architecture, Platform or Infrastructure as a Service options, and storage requirements. The public cloud manager creates a cost proposal, and upon approval, spins up the cloud services and turns it over to the agency for testing and final sign-off, Ward says.

Agencies that want to use a private cloud go through a similar process. They submit a ticket with their requirements and automatically spin up virtual instances. DIR uses a variety of technologies in its data centers and most recently began deploying Dell PowerFlex hyperconverged infrastructure.

“It’s very much like what you would see in the public cloud: very easy and not laborious,” Ward says.

Texas’s shared services for public and private cloud offerings are a smart strategy that eliminates government waste, says IDC Analyst Ashish Nadkarni.

DIR’s use of reference architectures provides a standardized blueprint for implementing infrastructure and applications, which eliminates one-off implementations that can be costly and difficult to manage, and that could potentially create security vulnerabilities, he says.

“Creating a reference architecture makes it more cookie-cutter, makes it more scalable,” Nadkarni says. “It takes the guesswork out, streamlines implementation of services and eases the burden on administration and IT teams.”

Satisfying Statewide Demand

Ward expects the current 70-30 split between private and public cloud to even out slowly in the future, possibly reaching 50-50 in the next decade.

Overall, DIR’s IT leaders feel the state’s data center consolidation and mix of private and public cloud services have been successful. State, local and educational institutions spent $546 million in data center services in fiscal 2024, with 97% customer satisfaction, Crawford says.

The technical piece is huge, but change management and relationship management are also critical, she says.

“We hit 100% customer satisfaction for many months. But we did not start out that way,” Crawford says. “It came through a lot of hard work, and it continues to be a lot of hard work. We’re continually evolving our program, so that we can be ahead of the curve and meet the needs of where Texas is going and where technology is going.”

Technology Guide for State Agencies

The Texas Department of Information Resources serves as a technology guide, says Texas CIO Amanda Crawford, assisting agencies in their public cloud and data center initiatives. Those efforts include:

Innovation and testing at DIR’s Texas Innovation and Education Center, where agencies can text new technology in a secure lab to see if it’s a good fit for them

Education and training provided by DIR through conferences, webinars and education days

Dear Editor,

Is there time for climate policies to be political?

The evidence is there–melting glaciers, rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather. Climate change is accelerating, but instead of taking action, we have attached party identities to the issues and are now facing the consequences of political polarization. Party issues create swings between administrations–these frequent reversals are what make our system of government unique.

But unlike some domestic policies where this ""swing"" can be healthy, we cannot treat climate action as a partisan issue when there are global consequences.

I graduated from high school this spring, and while I just began studying political science, I am no expert yet. Already in my lifetime, I have noticed environmental changes in Iowa: frequent flooding, record temperatures, and extreme storms.

That’s why I joined Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL), a volunteer organization seeking bipartisan climate solutions through grassroots advocacy. CCL’s neutral approach bridges many perceptions and concerns about climate policies, and one opportunity to exercise this is through lobbying. Thanks to fundraising led by Northeast Iowa’s CCL Chapter Leader Leslie Sand and a generous grant from the Northeast Iowa Peace and Justice Center, I have had the opportunity twice now to lobby Iowa’s members of Congress for bipartisan climate action.

During meetings with Representatives Hinson and Feenstra and Senator Grassley, our focus was on the role of clean energy and the global ""clean energy race."" But policy compromise still felt out of reach because of a major national barrier: political parties. Political polarization has national leaders trapped in rigid agendas.

One reason for this could be because political identities have become a defining factor in political decisions and voting patterns through political polarization, both at an individual and party level, which encourage party-line votes. But another reason could be political pressure from party leaders or administrations to vote and act certain ways.

This is a big problem, especially for climate policies.

Climate policies are urgent, but as work continues to find bipartisan solutions, our leaders seem to be drifting farther apart.

Climate change does not care how you vote. It is our responsibility to remind our leaders to work together and prioritize bipartisan climate action. Despite divisiveness within our current political environment, I remain optimistic. My conversations locally and in D.C. have changed how I approach climate change, and I believe that by working together, we can protect our future

Participants will be joined by subject matter experts for a full day of policy discussions on Tuesday, October 7th, including a deep dive on RNG fleeting policy priorities, extending the $0.50/gallon Alternative Fuel Tax Credit, establishing a $1.00/gallon Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) Fuel Tax Credit, and preserving RNG viability in EPA's regulatory programs such as the Phase 3 GHG Rule and the Renewable Fuel Standard. On Wednesday, October 8th, participants along with Transport Project staffers will be meeting on Capitol Hill to lobby Members of Congress and senior staff on industry issues.

Chuck Coppa, APG's CEO/CFO, will be representing APG along with multiple industry executives spanning vehicle and engine manufacturers, servicers, suppliers, fuel producers and providers as well as multiple industry trade organizations. Mr. Coppa will be discussing APG's practical, affordable, and proven alternative fuel solution to convert existing Class 8 diesel trucks with APG's vehicular Dual Fuel System. With no loss of power and torque, the Dual Fuel solution provides the ability to realize meaningful net fuel savings through the substitution of up to 60% natural gas including low-carbon and negative-carbon renewable natural gas. According to the American Trucking Association, 95.8% of all carriers operate 10 or less trucks and 99.7% operate 100 or less trucks which makes APG's Dual Fuel solution so appealing as we believe most fleets are either just hesitant of change or do not have the financial resources to completely swap out their entire diesel fleet for cleaner burning vehicles.

Mr. Coppa noted, ""Regardless of which side of the aisle you sit on, reducing on-road transportation related operating costs and emissions while using readily available cleaner burning domestic fuel sources should be a top priority and is an important step in America's goal of achieving energy dominance and independence. I am excited to represent APG alongside so many high-profile industry executives.""

CINCINNATI, October 6, 2025 /CSRwire/ - Duke Energy selected three properties in Southwest Ohio and Northern Kentucky for inclusion in its 2025 Site Readiness Program, which prepares high-potential business and industrial sites for economic development investments and markets them nationwide to companies looking to start, expand or relocate their operations.

Bringing investment and jobs to Ohio and Kentucky: Since 2010, Duke Energy’s Site Readiness Program has evaluated 42 sites in Ohio and Kentucky. Twenty companies have selected and committed to growing on sites that have been through the program.

Those companies are bringing over $2 billion capital investments and 5,400 new jobs for Ohio and Kentucky. Examples of companies include Coca-Cola, Carvana, Shape Corp. and Niagara Bottling.

About the program: The Duke Energy Site Readiness Program sparks economic growth by helping communities understand what steps to take in order to make their sites more competitive. In turn, this results in new jobs and a new tax base.

Under the program, Duke Energy works with consultant Site Selection Group and local engineering firm Bayer Becker. It also partners closely with REDI Cincinnati and BE NKY Growth Partnership, as well as with local community governments and other utilities.

What they’re saying

Amy Spiller, president, Duke Energy Ohio and Kentucky: “Economic development is vital to the future growth and prosperity of our region. Our Site Readiness Program is one example of the proactive economic development initiatives that Duke Energy pursues to help spark investment in the communities we serve. We appreciate our collaboration with local partners and developers as we work to bring more jobs to the region and make Greater Cincinnati a place in which people want to work and live.”

Kimm Lauterbach, president and CEO of REDI Cincinnati: “Duke Energy’s Site Readiness Program not only speeds up economic development opportunities but also ensures that our communities are equipped to compete with sites that are ready to be utilized. We appreciate Duke Energy’s ongoing investment and leadership in enhancing the economy of the Cincinnati region.”

Research over two decades has found “intractable” problems that have made carbon credits in most big programmes poor quality, according to the study. While the industry and diplomats have made efforts to improve the system, it found much-awaited rules agreed at a UN climate summit last year “did not substantially address the quality problem”.

“We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale,” said Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School and co-author of the study, in Annual Reviews. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed.”

Carbon offsets are a tool to cut emissions efficiently by crediting rich polluters for financing cheap climate action abroad while pumping out the same amount of planet-heating gas at home.

In theory, the practice could lead to lower levels of global heating by funnelling money to the places where it will do the most good as soon as possible. But voluntary carbon markets have long been plagued by “junk offsets” that overstate their impact.

The researchers said the worst problems were with issuing additional credits for projects that were already in the pipeline, such as building a windfarm that would have gone up anyway; impermanent projects, such as planting trees that later burn down in a wildfire; projects with leakage, such as protecting part of a forest but effectively pushing loggers elsewhere; and double-counted projects, such as restoring a peatland but letting the seller and buyer claim the drop in emissions.

“An offset may be robust on three of these four dimensions, but if it lacks in the fourth, it may represent a far lower emissions reduction than was credited – or no real reduction at all,” the study warned.

A meta-analysis published in Nature Communications last year found that less than 16% of the carbon credits investigated showed real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

The lead author, Benedict Probst, founder of the Net Zero Lab at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, who was not involved in the new paper, said it provided a “valuable high-level overview of the well-documented problems plaguing existing carbon crediting projects”, despite not providing a critical appraisal of the underlying studies.

“This study echoes the main conclusions of our own research, but it provides a broader picture across the carbon crediting landscape,” he said.

Probst added that the study identified some of the root causes of over-crediting, such as information gaps, but warned of other systemic factors such as the small constituency advocating for high-quality projects, conflicts of interest when drafting standards, and “chronically understaffed” regulators.

There are efforts under way to clean up the market. In response to recent criticism, industry-led initiatives such as the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) have gone through the latest scientific research on which offsets are effective, only approving schemes that meet strict requirements. Separately, so-called “ratings agencies” for carbon offsets now provide buyers with information on whether offsets are likely to represent real-world emission reductions.

The review authors recommended urgently phasing out offsets that did not actively suck CO2 from the atmosphere and shifting the focus of offset markets to high-quality carbon dioxide removal and storage. Instead of financing other meaningful climate projects through carbon offsets, they called for a contribution-based scheme that did not allow donors to claim it negated their own emissions.

But they also found some types of projects that currently suffer from over-crediting could still be remedied, such as issuing cleaner cookstoves and capturing gas from landfill.

“We don’t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” said Lezak. “There are a couple of important domains where it is important to highlight success, or the potential for it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/395b935b2a9343572a2440bcf535c0fac4d37e5c/281_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=db06ef948976f5a39c505ae894309ce1",N,,2025-10-06 17:05:50.389567

The model, according to the LSU executive, Robert Twilley, could be the LSU Ag Center's and LSU Sea Grant's decades-old cooperative extension services.
""The key part of the extension service is that people live in these communities,"" Twilley said during the LSU Energy Research Symposium on Friday.
On Monday, Tara Smith, LSU executive associate vice president and director of the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service at LSU AgCenter, said she wasn't aware of a formal plan to implement the idea.
Hensgens asked if having the extension services step into the current ""messy"" energy debate would harm the trust people have put in the services.","Pumping and permanently storing carbon dioxide under vast stretches of Louisiana forest and farmland has triggered grassroots opposition, as the reality of more than 30 such proposed projects has taken hold over the past two years.

Companies proposing to convert hundreds to thousands of acres of farmland into solar farms have faced similar opposition from pockets of rural Louisiana, including in the state's sugar cane growing regions.

The ""energy transition"" that some officials and business leaders say has arrived in Louisiana is bringing uncomfortable change and conflict to a state with nearly 125 years of history with oil and gas.

During a recent energy symposium, a top LSU executive floated the concept of having the state's flagship university create a new cooperative extension service that could serve as an unbiased mediator and science-based information source on energy. The concept, however, may step into a potentially sensitive area for LSU, with some having previously raised concerns over whether the university has too close a relationship with the carbon capture and energy industries.

The model, according to the LSU executive, Robert Twilley, could be the LSU Ag Center's and LSU Sea Grant's decades-old cooperative extension services. LSU Ag Center includes the popular Louisiana Master Gardener Program.

Twilley, LSU vice president for research and economic development who formerly led the LSU Sea Grant program, said creating a cooperative extension for energy would match a trend happening in some other land grant universities to expand extension services beyond agriculture.

The cooperative extension services, which have the mission of bringing new research to the public, so the public can apply it, have a physical presence in all 64 parishes that could serve as the home for a new energy cooperative extension, Twilley suggested.

Combined with the recently formed LSU Energy Institute, the effort could tap into the university's expertise to address the multi-disciplinary questions energy raises and, Twilley argued, fulfill an obligation that a public research university has to serve as a trusted source of information.

'Informed, trusted agent'

Twilley told the forum audience that early discussions have occurred, including an idea, as a first step, to give agents an ""Energy 101"" class so they can field some questions and direct people to more expert LSU sources.

""The key part of the extension service is that people live in these communities,"" Twilley said during the LSU Energy Research Symposium on Friday. ""That's really critical because they're trusted individuals, and they are trained in how to actually deal with being the informed, trusted agent.""

On Monday, Tara Smith, LSU executive associate vice president and director of the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service at LSU AgCenter, said she wasn't aware of a formal plan to implement the idea.

Smith, who sat on the forum panel moderated by Twilley, said there would have to be ""a lot of future discussions"" at the ""highest levels to make something like that happen.""

Among those challenges, according to Twilley, is finding the people and money.

At the forum, he floated the idea of the U.S. Department of Energy providing the dollars to avoid the inevitable credibility questions industry funding might generate.

Other concerns existed for some. State Sen. Bob Hensgens, R-Abbeville, who attended the forum and grew up in a family of rice farmers, remarked on the credibility the agricultural extension service had with his grandfather.

Hensgens asked if having the extension services step into the current ""messy"" energy debate would harm the trust people have put in the services.

'Not take sides'

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies who has spoken at some community forums to provide information on carbon capture, has already faced criticism. Upton is also interim director of the new Energy Institute.

But Smith and another forum panel member, Rex Caffey, an LSU natural resource economics professor and director of the Sea Grant marine extension, explained they believed the cooperative model could stay above the fray.

""Our stock and trade is to get involved in controversial issues and the way we protect ourselves is to bring science-based information and to not take sides.

Americans don’t expect and really don’t want the government to run the economy. Instead, they hope it will create conditions in which jobs are created, wealth expands, and new businesses not only survive but also thrive.

Achieving this state has been one of President Trump’s primary objectives. So far, he has kept his eye on the ball. In his first term, he cut taxes, slashed red tape and put the interests of working Americans ahead of those of multinationals and money movers who had closely aligned themselves with Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden.

Mr. Trump’s second term began auspiciously, with the White House focused on securing favorable trade deals to enable American industry to prosper. Some in Congress, unfortunately, have other ideas and have kowtowed to well-heeled special interests at the expense of working men and women.

That must change, and Mr. Trump must take the lead. One of the American system’s significant innovations is the respect built into it for the individual’s right to property. It is mentioned in the Constitution, as the Founders believed the success of the nation rested in many ways on the ability of people to secure rights to the property gained through their labor.

After more than 200 years, the definition of property has expanded, and it now encompasses not only tangible things but also intangible ideas. The recognition and protection of intellectual property, the products of human thought, are even more critical now that the global economy runs as much on zeros and ones as it does on fossil fuels and ball bearings.

For some time now, what used to be referred to as “Detroit” has flexed its power in the marketplace and on Capitol Hill, pushing independent mechanics and parts suppliers out into the cold, leaving them unable to access the thousands of bits of information involved in fixing cars and trucks. It has created an auto repair monopoly for vehicle dealerships. The people who build our cars and trucks also want to be the only ones who can service them. From the free market perspective, that’s not fair.

A bipartisan measure making its way through Congress addresses the issue effectively. The REPAIR Act makes the distinctions necessary to protect the rights of innovators producing new products that are truly cutting-edge while preventing auto companies from using IP law to stifle competition from local small businesses that service vehicles and often serve as a gateway to the middle class for working Americans.

This is about the foundation of the U.S. economy. The vehicle supplier industry, which supplies the parts needed for vehicle repair, is the largest piece of the nation’s manufacturing sector. It involves more than 4.8 million Americans, mostly working-class individuals or small-business owners and operators. They’re also Trump voters whose interests are of great concern to the White House.

If Congress fails to step up, this economically essential network of manufacturers, mechanics and suppliers remains at risk. If current trends continue, by 2035, consumers could face additional costs of $34 billion on top of what they should be paying for car and truck repairs. Even now, they are paying the price.

Today, more than 60% of independent repair shops experience weekly, if not daily, difficulties making routine repairs. Just over half of independent repair shops report sending as many as five vehicles each month to a dealer for repair because of data restrictions imposed by “Detroit.” It’s a perversion of the concept of property rights, which means consumers have fewer options, face longer wait times and pay higher prices.

You would think that the restrictions might lead to safer vehicles on the road, but you’d be wrong. In testimony before Congress, Jonathan Morrison, named by Mr. Trump to lead the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, explained that the hoarding of data has a deleterious effect on the nation’s automotive fleet.

“The ability of vehicle owners to service and maintain their own vehicles, or have their vehicles serviced or maintained at the facility of their choice, is important to ensure safety,” he said, promising to support efforts such as the REPAIR Act that, in his words, “provide consumers with secure access to data necessary to maintain or service their vehicles.”

It’s not just about keeping the nation’s vehicle fleet running safely. It’s about what’s best for consumers. Independent shops can perform the same work as dealerships, just as well, if not better, for about two-thirds the cost. Forcing commercial vehicle operators to use the more expensive option by involving nebulous IP concerns drives up costs for essential goods and services.

This is precisely the kind of anti-competitive behavior the Trump administration wants to eliminate. Mr. Trump believes in free markets, intense competition and empowering the American worker rather than compromising with monopolistic entities that squeeze consumers and strangle small businesses.

That’s why the REPAIR Act is necessary. It restores balance by ensuring that independent repair shops and aftermarket parts manufacturers have access to the critical data needed to perform their jobs.

The Trump movement is about shaking up the status quo to deliver results. The REPAIR Act is a textbook example of how to achieve this, leading to lower prices, increased competition and support for jobs in America in an environment that promotes growth rather than protectionism.

The Trump administration moved to cut nearly $8 billion in projects from blue states.

PEORIA — Two Peoria-area manufacturers are set to lose millions of dollars in federal funds following President Donald Trump's move to cancel billions of dollars in energy projects, mostly in Democrat-run states.

Illinois was one of 16 states to have energy projects funding, totaling $7.6 billion, terminated last week by the Trump administration in a move that targets blue states during a government shutdown which Trump and his allies have pinned on Democrats. In total, Illinois will lose $752,301,434 in funding.

The project terminations, which were announced by Trump's director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought, will impact the Peoria area.

Caterpillar is set to lose a $3.2 million in U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood's district, while Komatsu is slated to lose $2.5 million in funding in U.S. Rep. Eric Sorensen's district.

Sorensen, a Democrat from Illinois's 17th District, said the projects, which were already appropriated by Congress, were designed to ""lower energy costs, create jobs, and boost American innovation.""

“This is a political stunt that puts working families last. This reckless decision means more than $54 million in lost investment that would have created good-paying jobs, supported clean energy technology, and kept our communities competitive,"" Sorensen said in a statement. “This isn’t about saving taxpayer dollars. The funding was already approved. This is about politics, plain and simple — and our families will pay the price.”

Vought, one of the co-authors of Project 2025, said in a statement on X that the projects were part of the ""Green New Scam"" and ""fueled the Left's climate agenda.""

Komatsu declined to comment for this story.

Caterpillar and LaHood's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sustainable energies and technologies has been a focus point of Caterpillar's in recent years following the launch of its ""Pathways to Sustainability"" program.

Under the electric power sustainable energy and technology section of its website, Caterpillar says: ""For Caterpillar, sustainability is not a new concept. It’s part of who we are and what we do every single day. From lower carbon intensity fuels to solar power, Cat Electric Power puts sustainability in action by delivering a wide range of power solutions that make your operations more efficient and help to meet your sustainability-related goals.""

Komatsu, too, according to its website, has made sustainability a focus in recent years and has even made a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.

""At Komatsu, sustainability is not just a goal — it’s a fundamental part of how we do business,"" Komatsu's website says. ""We aim to create value through manufacturing and technology innovation to empower a sustainable future where people, business and our planet thrive together.""

Trump has routinely targeted programs and rhetoric focused on curbing climate change, including solar power and electric vehicles, during his presidency. While speaking to the United Nations last month, Trump called climate change a ""con job.""

“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said at the United Nations. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.

While lease prices have risen significantly, the company has maintained purchase prices for its vehicles unchanged.
This move highlights how the expiration of government subsidies can directly impact consumer costs in the electric vehicle market, even for industry leaders like Tesla.
The company’s decision to increase lease prices while keeping purchase prices stable creates different financial implications for consumers depending on their preferred acquisition method.
The expiration of federal incentives represents a significant test for the electric vehicle industry’s ability to maintain growth momentum without government subsidy support.","Tesla has implemented lease price increases across its U.S. vehicle lineup this week following the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits, directly passing the lost subsidies to customers. The Texas-based electric vehicle manufacturer raised monthly lease costs for its Model Y to a range of $529 to $599, representing increases of $50 to $70 from previous rates of $479 to $529. While lease prices have risen significantly, the company has maintained purchase prices for its vehicles unchanged.

The timing of these price adjustments coincides directly with the expiration of federal EV incentives, suggesting Tesla is responding to the changed economic landscape by shifting the financial burden to lease customers. This move highlights how the expiration of government subsidies can directly impact consumer costs in the electric vehicle market, even for industry leaders like Tesla. The company’s decision to increase lease prices while keeping purchase prices stable creates different financial implications for consumers depending on their preferred acquisition method.

Industry observers are now watching how other electric vehicle manufacturers in the United States will respond to similar market conditions. Companies like Bollinger Innovations, Inc. (NASDAQ: BINI) face similar decisions regarding how to manage the financial impact of expired federal incentives on their business operations and customer pricing strategies. The broader electric vehicle industry must now navigate a market environment without the federal tax credits that previously helped make EVs more affordable for American consumers.

This development comes at a critical time for the electric vehicle industry as manufacturers balance growth objectives with changing government support structures. Tesla’s pricing strategy following the subsidy expiration provides insight into how market leaders are adapting to reduced government incentives while maintaining their competitive position. The company’s approach of targeting lease customers for price increases rather than all buyers demonstrates a nuanced response to changing market conditions that other manufacturers may study closely.

The full implications of these pricing changes will become clearer as consumer response data emerges in the coming months.

What This Means for Data Center Developers Over the next several years, the structure of power procurement deals for data centers is likely to evolve significantly.","Over the last 18 months or so, the energy generation industry and its public utilities have been significantly impacted by the AI data center boom. It has been demonstrated across North America that the increase in demand for power, as driven by the demand for hyperscale and AI data centers, greatly exceeds the ability of the industry to actually generate and deliver power to meet the demand.

We have covered many of the efforts being made to control the availability of power. In response, utilities and regulators have begun rethinking how to manage power availability through means such as: temporary moratoriums on new data center interconnections; the creation of new rate classes; cogeneration and load-sharing agreements; renewable integration; and power-driven site selection strategies.

But the bottom line is that in many locations utilities will need to change the way they work and how and where they spend their CAPEX budgets. The industry has already realized that their demand forecast models are hugely out of date, and that has had a ripple effect on much of the planning done by public utilities to meet the next generation of power demand.

Most utilities now acknowledge that their demand forecasting models have fallen behind reality, triggering revisions to Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs) and transmission buildouts nationwide. This mismatch between forecast and actual demand is forcing a fundamental rethink of capital expenditure priorities and long-term grid planning.

Spend More, Build Faster

Utilities are sharply increasing CAPEX and rebalancing their resource portfolios—not just for decarbonization, but to keep pace with multi-hundred-megawatt data center interconnects. This trend is spreading across the industry, not confined to a few isolated utilities. Notable examples include:

Duke Energy raised its five-year CAPEX plan to $83 billion (a 13.7% increase) and plans to add roughly 5 GW of natural gas capacity by 2029 to meet accelerating data center and industrial load growth.

Dominion Energy lifted its five-year capital plan to $50.1 billion, citing data centers as a primary driver while warning of potential rate pressure from grid modernization and capacity expansion.

NV Energy’s 2024 Integrated Resource Plan explicitly models about 5.9 GW of bundled-service data center requests by 2033, supported by new gas, storage, and renewable additions.

Salt River Project (Phoenix) is advancing a mixed portfolio of peaking gas and clean capacity, including the Coolidge Generating Station Expansion—a 575-MW project approved and now under construction—with additional peak resources under review.

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is moving forward on advanced nuclear for long-duration firming, including a BWRX-300 small modular reactor application for the Clinch River site, and a power purchase agreement with Kairos Power’s Hermes-2 test reactor expected to support Google data centers around 2030.

These CAPEX expansions fund both new generation capacity in the form of modern combined-cycle and combustion-turbine plants, nuclear pilots, and renewables, and grid-side investments to move bulk power to where data centers are locating. This demand is now an explicit planning driver in utility integrated resource plans (IRPs) and board approvals. It’s important to note that these investments encompass both generation and transmission infrastructure.

New Rate Designs and Risk-Transfer Contracts Shift More Responsibility to Data Centers

Utilities are retooling tariffs to protect existing ratepayers and de-risk megawatt-scale customers. With a goal of protecting consumer rate payers, a number of different tariff designs have been put forth.

The goal is to ensure that the cost of new capacity and infrastructure upgrades falls primarily on large commercial users - particularly data centers -rather than being spread across residential and small-business customers. Several new tariff structures explicitly define data center capacity obligations and cost recovery terms. Examples include:

New data center rate class: Dominion Energy has proposed a dedicated rate category for customers ≥25 MW with ≥75% load factor, featuring 14-year take-or-pay–style commitments to cover stranded-cost risk and ensure “full cost of service.”

Take-or-pay / minimum-take provisions: Duke Energy is pursuing minimum-take contracts (requiring payment regardless of utilization) and up-front contributions for network upgrades tied to data center interconnections—part of a broader shift toward “contribution in aid of construction” (CIAC) requirements.

Standby and curtailable service riders: Large-load customers are increasingly directed toward standby-generator and curtailable-service schedules to formalize flexibility. Dominion’s Schedule SG and Schedule CS are examples under their targeted sector programs.

The net effect of these evolving tariffs is that utilities are socializing less risk from speculative or timing-uncertain AI loads, while providing greater queue certainty for data center developers willing to shoulder their share of capital costs.

Changing the Relationship Between Data Centers and Utilities

A major shift is underway: load flexibility is becoming a formal part of interconnection agreements. New legislation and regulatory frameworks across multiple regions are requiring data centers to demonstrate the ability to adjust or curtail power consumption during grid stress events.

From on-site cogeneration and load balancing to demand-response participation and remote-curtailment capabilities, utilities and regulators are increasingly embedding flexibility requirements into contracts and permitting. Examples include:

Under Texas SB 6, ratified in June 2025: Beginning December 31, 2025, new large-load customers (≥75 MW) must be able to remotely curtail load or switch to on-site generation during emergencies. ERCOT will also begin procuring demand reductions from major customers. Interconnection agreements are expected to include fees, disclosure of backup power systems, and cost-sharing provisions as standard components.

PJM and SPP: Both grid operators are fast-tracking policies to curtail or manage large loads during scarcity events. The SPP “HILL/CHILL” framework establishes a 90-day expedited interconnection path when large-load customers pair with generation resources, defining curtailable service classes for planning and market participation.

Voluntary demand-response partnerships: To preempt mandatory curtailment mandates, some hyperscalers are signing voluntary flexibility agreements. Google, for instance, has reached demand-flexibility deals with Indiana Michigan Power and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to shift or reduce AI workloads during peak grid demand—an emerging model for bridging near-term capacity gaps.

Collectively, these developments signal a new era of active coordination between utilities and data centers, in which grid reliability, flexibility, and cost allocation are shared operational priorities.

Upgrading Power Transmission: Accelerate, Reconductor, Right-Size

Serving today’s multi-gigawatt data centers and campus-scale developments requires both new transmission lines and rapid capacity upgrades along existing corridors. With data center interconnection queues expanding across nearly every regional transmission organization (RTO), utilities and regulators are under pressure to streamline approvals and unlock capacity faster.

PJM approved $5.9–$6.7 billion in near-term transmission projects in 2025, explicitly citing data center–driven load growth and resource shifts as key justifications.

Advanced conductors: Google and CTC Global have partnered with utilities to reconduct existing lines using ACCC® (Aluminum Conductor Composite Core) technology, boosting transmission capacity in months rather than years. Priority is being given to reconductoring lines that unlock capacity for new data center sites.

Aggressive planning upgrades: PJM’s evolving Regional Transmission Expansion Plan (RTEP) process aims to “right-size” near-term fixes for long-term needs. The DOE and NREL have identified Grid-Enhancing Technologies (GETs) such as Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) and topology optimization as practical, near-term pathways for unlocking transmission capacity without lengthy new-build timelines.

Federal rulemaking: Two FERC orders are reshaping how utilities and RTOs plan for both new generation and surging load growth:

FERC Order 2023 (2023): Requires cluster-based interconnection studies with enforceable deadlines and penalties, designed to reduce the interconnection backlog and expedite capacity additions.

FERC Order 1920/A/B (2024–2025): Mandates 20-year regional transmission plans, state involvement in cost allocation, and greater transparency, giving utilities a framework to plan around structural load growth driven by AI and industrial electrification.

Process innovation: SPP is implementing a 90-day fast-track path for “high-impact large loads” paired with new generation under its HILL/CHILL policy framework.

Together, these measures reflect a system-wide acceleration of transmission modernization, combining new lines, smarter planning, and digital tools to move power where AI and hyperscale demand is rising fastest.

Green Tariffs and “Bring-Your-Own-Clean-Power” Programs Are Changing How Data Centers Source Energy

Utilities are expanding subscription-based renewable programs and custom clean-energy constructs that enable data centers to meet sustainability and carbon-reduction goals within regulated tariffs. For large-scale operators, the challenge lies in navigating a fragmented landscape: each utility administers its own program, requiring project-specific power purchase agreements (PPAs) and regional tailoring to reflect local policy and grid conditions.

Examples of key programs include:

Duke Energy – Green Source Advantage (GSA / GSA Choice, North and South Carolina): Allows large customers to contract utility-backed renewable projects through long-term agreements. The program was expanded in 2024 to add new capacity and greater flexibility for participants.

Georgia Power – CRSP / CARES: The Clear and Renewable Energy Subscription Program offers 1,000–2,100 MW of utility-procured renewables for large-customer subscription. QTS Data Centers subscribed to approximately 350 MW under CRSP for its Atlanta-area facilities.

Dominion Energy – Schedule RG / Schedule CFG: Provides utility-sourced carbon-free and renewable energy options for large commercial and industrial (C&I) customers. Schedule RG (approved in 2018) and the newer Schedule CFG (for projects ≥1 MW) are voluntary programs that allow customers to directly procure renewable generation through Dominion-backed assets.

A growing number of utilities are evolving from pass-through energy suppliers to active counterparties, developing or contracting clean-energy assets that are directly matched to data center load profiles. This integrated approach (where power buyers participate in generation planning) aims to improve efficiency, transparency, and reliability in how large loads source renewable energy.

Regional Utility Responses Are Diverging

Not all power generation, and not all regulatory response, is created equal. Across the U.S., states and regional transmission operators (RTOs) are adapting to data center–driven load growth in markedly different ways, reflecting local politics, resource mixes, and grid constraints.

Virginia (PJM): Data centers now account for approximately 25% of statewide electricity consumption, according to Dominion’s filings and state reports. Dominion’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) and new large-load rate class proposals formally recognize data centers as the primary driver of load growth and cost allocation debates. Transmission capacity remains the chokepoint, making advanced conductor pilots and PJM’s RTEP expansion windows key to sustaining growth.

Texas (ERCOT): Senate Bill 6 (2025) effectively resets the social contract for large loads—requiring operators to flex or face emergency curtailment—and is expected to push wider adoption of on-site generation, energy storage, and hybrid PPAs. Other utilities and cooperatives across the state are expected to mirror ERCOT’s flexibility protocols in their own tariffs.

Arizona (SRP / APS): Rapid regional growth is driving a buildout of gas peaker plants paired with battery storage, alongside stricter queue management and prioritization. Salt River Project’s Coolidge Expansion exemplifies a reliability-first strategy, with clean-energy components layered in to support long-term decarbonization goals.

Midwest (MISO / Indiana): The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) has approved new large-load interconnection rules, while utilities such as Indiana Michigan Power (I&M) are signing demand-response agreements—including with Google—to mitigate peak load. Policymakers are advancing cost-sharing requirements for new generation supporting big-load customers.

SPP (Plains states): The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) is actively marketing the region to High Impact Large Load (HILL) customers through accelerated interconnection studies and firm/curtailable service classes, aiming to attract data center development away from saturated hubs like Virginia and northern Texas.

Regional differences in regulation and resource strategy are now shaping the geography of new data center investment, rewarding jurisdictions that can align policy agility, grid capacity, and clean-power availability.

What This Means for Data Center Developers

Over the next several years, the structure of power procurement deals for data centers is likely to evolve significantly. Utilities will increasingly require greater up-front financial participation from customers, shifting capital and risk onto large-load developers. Expect to see:

Contribution-in-aid-of-construction (CIAC) payments or similar up-front contributions to fund new substations, network upgrades, and capacity expansions.

Minimum-take or take-or-pay obligations to guarantee long-term revenue recovery for utilities.

Extended contract terms—typically 10 to 15 years—to secure capacity and protect other ratepayers from stranded-cost exposure.

Flexibility will become a baseline requirement. Interconnection agreements may now mandate curtailment capabilities, demand-response participation, and certified backup generation. In ERCOT, for example, new large loads ≥75 MW must be equipped for remote disconnection or on-site generation under Senate Bill 6 (2025).

Transmission-friendly regions will rise in priority for new site development. Locations within PJM subregions or along SPP’s HILL corridor, where reconductoring and RTEP upgrades can unlock capacity quickly, will gain competitive advantage as interconnection bottlenecks persist elsewhere.

Data center developers will also need to maintain ongoing visibility into utility and regulatory planning cycles, tracking updates from individual utilities, regional transmission operators (RTOs), and federal agencies such as FERC. Understanding how generation mix, transmission planning, and tariff reform interact will be essential to long-term siting and investment strategy.

In short, the path to power is becoming more capital-intensive, flexible, and policy-dependent, requiring data center developers to act as active partners in the evolving utility ecosystem.","https://img.datacenterfrontier.com/files/base/ebm/datacenterfrontier/image/2025/09/68cac843484992e78987ed82-gettyimages2194154654.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-06 16:04:19.116980

A new Rainey Center poll shows rare unity among voters as Americans agree energy and data must stay secure, independent, and powered by U.S. innovation.

The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

— Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

A Deep Dive into the Options Tsunami and Key Catalysts

The options market for Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) witnessed extraordinary activity on Monday, October 6, 2025. Investors acquired a staggering 134,256 call options, marking a 92% increase over the average daily volume of 69,806 call options. This surge propelled the total options market activity to 199,000 contracts, more than doubling the usual daily average. The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment was further underscored by an exceptionally low put/call ratio of 0.14, significantly below the typical level of approximately 0.22. Concurrently, EOSE's implied volatility (IV30) climbed by nearly 11 points to around 120.24, anticipating a daily price fluctuation of $1.08, reflecting the market's expectation of substantial movement.

This options frenzy did not emerge in a vacuum but was the culmination of several strategic developments and market catalysts. The most immediate and impactful event was the announcement on October 6, 2025, of a strategic partnership with Unico. This collaboration is poised to enhance Eos Energy's storage solutions, promising improved performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby acting as a powerful catalyst for positive market sentiment. Earlier in the year, EOSE had already garnered attention with its inclusion in the Russell 2500 Growth Index, effective June 30, 2025, following successful capital raises in early 2025, including a $75 million common stock offering and a $200 million convertible senior notes offering, which bolstered the company's financial position.

Despite mixed financial results—missing Q1 2025 revenue expectations in May and Q2 2025 revenue expectations in August, while reaffirming an ambitious full-year 2025 revenue outlook of $150M-$190M—the company highlighted substantial manufacturing expansions and operational resilience. The appointment of John Mahaz as COO in August 2025 was also viewed positively, aimed at streamlining operations and supply chain efficiency. While some share offerings and insider selling in late September/early October and May 2025 raised concerns about potential dilution, the overall market reaction to the Unico partnership demonstrated a strong focus on future growth prospects.

The initial market reaction on October 6, 2025, was unequivocally positive. Following the Unico partnership announcement and the heavy call options activity, EOSE's stock price surged, trading up $1.25 to reach $13.85 during the day, marking a 9.9% increase. By market close, the stock had climbed an impressive 18.2% to $14.89. Share trading volume also dramatically increased to 22,625,168 shares, significantly exceeding its average of 11,675,751. This robust performance indicates that investors are placing substantial bets on EOSE's ability to execute its growth strategy, leveraging new partnerships and operational improvements.

Winners and Losers: Implications for EOSE and the Energy Storage Sector

The unusually high options trading activity in Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) and its strategic partnership with Unico present a clear potential win for EOSE itself. The immediate surge in stock price and overwhelming bullish sentiment in the options market reflect increased investor confidence, which can translate into easier access to capital for future expansion and R&D. The Unico partnership, focused on enhancing Eos Energy's storage solutions, is expected to improve product performance and cost-effectiveness, strengthening EOSE's competitive edge in the rapidly expanding energy storage market. This could accelerate the company's journey towards profitability, allowing it to better leverage its zinc-air battery technology to meet the growing demand for long-duration energy storage. However, EOSE must navigate the delicate balance of capital raises and potential share dilution, which has previously caused investor apprehension, to fully capitalize on this newfound momentum.

For the broader energy storage sector, EOSE's recent developments could be a bellwether. If EOSE successfully integrates the Unico partnership and scales its manufacturing, it could validate zinc-based battery technology as a viable and cost-effective alternative to lithium-ion for grid-scale applications. This success could attract more investment into long-duration energy storage solutions, benefiting other companies developing similar or complementary technologies. Conversely, companies heavily invested in alternative long-duration storage chemistries might face increased competitive pressure if EOSE's solutions gain significant market share due to improved performance and cost.

The event also highlights the dynamic nature of the renewable energy infrastructure market, where technological advancements and strategic alliances can rapidly shift market perceptions and valuations. Companies that are agile in forming partnerships, innovating their products, and demonstrating a clear path to commercialization and scalability are likely to be the winners. Those that lag in innovation or struggle with operational execution might find themselves at a disadvantage, especially as capital flows towards perceived market leaders.

While the Unico partnership is a clear positive, the financial health of EOSE remains a critical factor. The company's mixed Q1 and Q2 2025 financial results, despite reaffirming ambitious annual guidance, underscore the challenges of scaling an emerging technology company. Sustained operational improvements, successful manufacturing ramp-up, and eventually, achieving consistent profitability, will be crucial for EOSE to convert speculative options activity into long-term shareholder value. The ability to manage costs effectively and deliver on large backlogs will determine if EOSE can solidify its position as a leader rather than just a high-potential player.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Energy Storage Landscape

The dramatic options activity surrounding Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) is more than just a company-specific event; it resonates with broader industry trends and the accelerating global transition to renewable energy. The increasing demand for grid-scale energy storage is a foundational trend, driven by the intermittency of renewable sources like solar and wind. EOSE's focus on zinc-air battery technology, designed for long-duration storage, positions it squarely within a critical segment of this market, where lithium-ion batteries often fall short in terms of cost-effectiveness for extended discharge periods. The market's bullish response to EOSE's strategic moves signals a growing recognition of the necessity and potential profitability of these long-duration solutions.

The ripple effects of EOSE's success or struggles could significantly influence investment and development across the energy storage ecosystem. If the Unico partnership proves successful in enhancing EOSE's offerings, it could spur further innovation and competition in zinc-based and other non-lithium battery chemistries. This could attract more venture capital and institutional investment into emerging storage technologies, potentially diversifying the market away from its current heavy reliance on lithium-ion. Competitors, both established giants and other startups, will be closely watching EOSE's execution, potentially adapting their own strategies to either compete directly or explore complementary niches. For instance, companies like Fluence Energy (NASDAQ: FLNC) or Stem (NYSE: STEM), while focusing on different aspects or technologies, might see increased market attention on the long-duration segment they also serve.

Regulatory and policy implications are also significant. Governments worldwide are implementing policies and incentives to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including energy storage. Breakthroughs and successful commercialization by companies like EOSE can influence future policy decisions, potentially leading to more favorable tax credits, grants, or mandates for specific types of energy storage that demonstrate superior performance or cost advantages. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, for example, already provides significant incentives for domestic clean energy manufacturing and deployment, which EOSE aims to leverage. A thriving domestic energy storage industry, bolstered by companies like EOSE, could further solidify national energy independence and security.

Historically, emerging technology sectors often experience periods of intense speculative interest, characterized by high options trading volumes and significant stock volatility. Comparisons can be drawn to early stages of the solar or electric vehicle industries, where companies with promising technologies saw rapid valuations, often preceding sustained profitability. While the underlying technology and market dynamics differ, the pattern of investor excitement driven by strategic partnerships and future growth potential, despite current financial challenges, is a common theme in disruptive industries. This suggests that while EOSE's current trajectory is exciting, it also carries the inherent risks associated with pioneering new technologies in a competitive landscape.

What Comes Next: Navigating Growth and Challenges

Looking ahead, the short-term focus for Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) will be on the successful integration of its strategic partnership with Unico and the tangible benefits it brings to product performance and cost. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming earnings reports for evidence of improved financial metrics, particularly revenue growth and progress towards profitability, which remain critical hurdles. The company's ability to effectively scale its manufacturing operations and fulfill its substantial backlog will also be a key indicator of its operational execution in the coming months. Any delays or setbacks in these areas could temper the current bullish sentiment.

In the long term, EOSE's trajectory will depend on its capacity to sustain technological innovation, achieve economies of scale, and establish a dominant market position in long-duration energy storage. The energy storage market is fiercely competitive, with both established players and new entrants constantly vying for market share. EOSE must continue to differentiate its zinc-air battery technology through superior performance, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Potential strategic pivots might include expanding into new geographical markets, diversifying its product offerings, or forming additional partnerships to strengthen its supply chain and distribution networks.

Market opportunities that may emerge for EOSE include capitalizing on the accelerating retirement of fossil fuel power plants and the increasing need for grid stability solutions. The growing demand for industrial and commercial energy storage, alongside utility-scale projects, presents vast opportunities. However, challenges such as intense competition from other battery chemistries (e.g., flow batteries, solid-state batteries), raw material price volatility, and the continuous need for significant capital investment will persist. Regulatory shifts and geopolitical factors could also introduce new complexities.

Potential scenarios for EOSE range from becoming a leading provider of long-duration energy storage, consistently delivering innovative solutions and achieving sustained profitability, to facing ongoing financial pressures if operational execution falters or competition intensifies beyond expectations. A mid-ground scenario could see EOSE carving out a strong niche in specific applications or regions, becoming a key, albeit not dominant, player in the broader energy storage market. The next few quarters will be crucial in determining which path the company is likely to take.

The unusually high options trading activity in Eos Energy Enterprises (NYSE: EOSE) on October 6, 2025, following its strategic partnership with Unico, represents a significant moment for both the company and the broader energy storage sector. The overwhelming bullish sentiment, evidenced by the surge in call options and the subsequent stock price jump, underscores a market belief in EOSE's potential to be a key beneficiary of the global energy transition. This event highlights that while EOSE has faced financial hurdles and dilution concerns, investors are increasingly focusing on strategic growth catalysts and the long-term viability of its zinc-air battery technology for grid-scale applications.

Moving forward, the market will assess EOSE's ability to translate this renewed investor confidence into tangible operational and financial success. The company's capacity to integrate the Unico partnership effectively, scale its manufacturing, and demonstrate a clear path to profitability will be paramount. The energy storage market remains a high-growth, high-risk arena, characterized by rapid technological evolution and substantial capital requirements. EOSE's journey serves as a microcosm of the challenges and opportunities inherent in pioneering new solutions for a critical global need.

The lasting impact of this event could be to further validate the investment case for long-duration energy storage technologies beyond lithium-ion, potentially attracting more capital and innovation into the segment. EOSE, with its zinc-based solution, stands as a bellwether for how alternative battery chemistries can compete and thrive. Investors should closely watch EOSE's execution on its strategic initiatives, its quarterly financial performance, and any further partnerships or technological advancements. The next several months will be crucial in determining whether this options frenzy was a fleeting speculative surge or a genuine precursor to EOSE solidifying its position as a leader in the future of energy storage.

2) Driving an Unbiased Dagger into our Hearts Claim: “EPA cannot prejudge the outcome of this reconsideration process.” EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Okay, sure.
Also, let’s be clear: climate change isn’t a religion.
It’s science.
As in, 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity.","On July 28, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made a big announcement: the agency plans to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding. That might sound like something out of a Marvel movie, but it’s actually the cornerstone of U.S. climate policy. The Finding legally establishes that greenhouse gas emissions, from new motor vehicles, threaten public health and welfare. It gives the EPA the power to regulate these emissions not just from cars, but from power plants, factories, and other major pollution sources.

Without it? The EPA’s hands are tied when it comes to regulating emissions. This move raises eyebrows and questions, and the agency released a one-pager explaining their decision. We read it. We checked it. Here’s our fact check of their one pager HERE and here’s the highlights:

1) Making it Easy… or Not?

EPA Claim: “Through this reconsideration, EPA will give the public a chance to weigh in on the science, law, and policy choices at issue in the Finding”.

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: While the EPA says it’s opening the floor to debate, the federal government is cutting off the tools that make public comment more accessible; specifically, the API (Application Programming Interface) that allows people to submit comments through third-party platforms instead of directly through their Regulations.gov website.

In other words, yes, you can weigh in, but only if you go through the official portal, which many grassroots campaigns and advocacy orgs can’t easily access anymore. So it’s like being told you can speak… but only if you do it exactly the way they want.

2) Driving an Unbiased Dagger into our Hearts

Claim: “EPA cannot prejudge the outcome of this reconsideration process.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Okay, sure. But if the EPA isn’t prejudiced, why did Administrator Zeldin recently declare: “”We are driving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion…” That’s not exactly a “wait and see” kind of comment. That is clearly a judgment. Also, let’s be clear: climate change isn’t a religion. It’s science. Hard science. As in, 99.9% of peer-reviewed studies agree that climate change is real and caused by human activity.

3) What is the Endangerment Finding & Why Does it Matter?

Claim: “The 2009 Endangerment Finding was the first step in the Obama-Biden Administration’s overreaching climate agenda… That evasion ends today.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Let’s unpack this one, because it’s doing a lot of heavy lifting.The claim here is that the Endangerment Finding kicked off, “trillions of dollars of cost on Americans” and by rescinding it we will save $54 billion in costs annually. Funny how Zeldin doesn’t mention the real price tag Americans are paying: climate change-linked illnesses, death, and pollution-related diseases have been know for over a decade and some studies estimate they will cost the U.S. over $820 billion annually.

Also, those 2027 vehicle emissions standards the EPA now wants to reverse? They were projected to prevent 7.2 billion tons of CO₂ through 2055; that’s four times what the entire U.S. transportation sector emitted in 2021.

4) Duty to Regulate

Claim: “Massachusetts vs. EPA, held that the Clean Air Act’s general, Act-wide definition of “air pollutant” was broad enough to include carbon dioxide. Massachusetts explicitly did not hold that EPA was required to regulate these emissions from these sources.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: The 2007 Supreme Court ruling was very clear: greenhouse gases, such as excess carbon dioxide, are “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act. That means the EPA has a duty to regulate them unless it can show they DO NOT endanger public health or welfare. So unless Zeldin has some groundbreaking scientific discovery to share (spoiler: he doesn’t), the law still stands. The EPA still has a legal obligation to act.

5) By the Books

Claim: “The Endangerment Finding took an unorthodox approach… It never makes a straight-line conclusion that carbon dioxide from new motor vehicles is causing endangerment. It looked at this mix of six gases, from all sources over the world, … to determine that this mix contributed … an unknown amount above zero to climate change, and that climate change contributed … an unknown amount above zero of endangerment to public health. The Finding looked at U.S. vehicle emissions … and said that they were a big enough piece of the pie (some 4 percent of global emissions) to be “causing or contributing” to the mix of six gases—not to the endangerment itself.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: This one reads like a climate denialist word salad, but let’s chop it up. The EPA’s original Finding didn’t go rogue. It followed the law, the science, and the courts. It reviewed research from the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, and U.S. agencies to conclude, based on overwhelming scientific evidence, six key greenhouse gases (CO₂, methane, nitrous oxide, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆) collectively contribute to climate change.

Cars emit several of these, the most significant being carbon dioxide. That’s enough under the Clean Air Act. The law doesn’t require proof of direct causation by U.S. cars alone, just a finding that their emissions contribute to the problem. Which they very much do; in 2022, 29% of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. came from the transportation sector, the vast majority of which were from cars and truck emissions.

This whole “unorthodox” claim of government overreach is like saying a seatbelt is illegal because it wasn’t designed to stop every car accident. It’s just not how the law, or logic, works.

6) Massachusetts Still Stands

Claim: “These legal issues require fresh scrutiny, particularly in light of major Supreme Court cases… and new developments in science and technology.”

EARTHDAY.ORG’s Position: Here’s where the EPA throws some legal spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. They cite recent Supreme Court cases, none of which overturn Massachusetts v. EPA.

Loper Bright Enterprises et al. (Loper) overturned the Chevron deference, which used to let agencies like the EPA interpret unclear laws, but not Massachusetts as the case clearly gives the EPA authority to regulate emissions.

West Virginia v. EPA didn’t question whether the EPA can regulate emissions; instead, it said the EPA went too far by trying to shift the entire power industry from coal to cleaner energy without clear permission from Congress. So while the majority in West Virginia may have been skeptical of Massachusetts they did not overrule it.

Also, is Administrator Zeldin seriously claiming that “new science” or “new technology” means we have to reconsider whether greenhouse gases are dangerous? That’s like arguing a better thermometer means we should rethink whether fire is hot.

In fact, the latest science only makes the case for greenhouse gases being the cause of climate change stronger. We’ve seen the impacts firsthand. The climate crisis is no longer hypothetical, it’s happening in real time. So using “technological progress” as an excuse to scrap foundational climate protections isn’t just misleading – it’s backward.

This so-called “reconsideration” of the Endangerment Finding isn’t about science. The Finding has been upheld, reaffirmed, and scientifically validated. What’s changed isn’t the evidence – it’s the EPA’s leadership. Want to make a difference?

The phaseout, brought on by the 2025 reconciliation law, hit the EV industry last week with the end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit last week he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5% after the tax credit ends from around 10% to 12% now.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller — way smaller than we thought — especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said. “We’re going to find out in a month.”

The tax credit rollback comes on top of the Trump administration’s revamp of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program created by the 2021 infrastructure law. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suspended the program in February, citing wasteful spending, and later relaunched with pared down standards.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said in a statement.

In an attempt to soften the blow, automakers Ford and General Motors Co. have plans to use their financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory, allowing the lending arms to qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.

Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and John Barrasso of Wyoming criticized the car companies’ plans, calling on the Treasury to close the automakers’ “loophole” and saying the plans are a “serious violation of Congressional intent.”

“These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off,” they wrote in a letter to the Treasury last week. “[IRS] guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.”

Despite automakers’ efforts to soften the hits to the EV industry, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an interview that the combination of the tax credit phaseout and rollback of other federal programs aimed at boosting battery manufacturing and production fares poorly for the industry.

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50% market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives. Now, she estimates it will be capped at 30%.

“It looks like the [auto] companies are going deeper into subprime, and that’s always an indication that sales in general are slowing … and they’re looking to keep the sales pace at a rate that allows them to maybe snowplow a little bit on total revenue,” she said. “We’ve seen several announcements now that these companies are delaying the product cycle for EVs.”

Renewables on deck

The 2025 reconciliation law also put new restrictions on renewable energy production and investment tax credits implemented under a 2022 reconciliation law, moving the timeline to qualify up by several years. Previously, projects needed to begin construction by the end of 2032. Now they must do so by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027, to take advantage of the federal support.

“This is an extremely tumultuous time,” said Bonnie Angermeier, senior legislative associate for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “There were promises made by the federal government, and there were strong signals for how they were going to support clean energy development.”

“Essentially, the rug got ripped out from under the clean energy industry,” she added.

Projects able to start construction before next July maintain eligibility for the credits for up to four years, Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said. SEIA is the national trade organization representing the solar and battery storage industry.

“The most advantageous position to be in right now is to qualify for that start of construction provision,” Gallagher said. “Companies that can’t qualify for that start of construction — they’ve got to get those projects online by the end of 2027, and so people are working hard to do that.”

Angermeier agreed, noting that companies focused on residential solar are at an even greater disadvantage.

“They have their pedal to the metal trying to complete projects as quickly as possible because they know that the window of that tax credit closes at the end of this year, which was highly unexpected and puts a ton of pressure on them,” she said.

She noted that the changes are “really throwing a wrench” into utility-scale projects as well, which generally rely on longer timelines to move from planning to completion. Some of those have been canceled as a result of the timeline shift, she added.

A solar markets report from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data and analytics for the renewables, energy and natural resources sectors, found that forecasts of new solar deployment through 2030 could be reduced by as much as 55 gigawatts as a result of federal policy changes this year.

Additional grant funding rescissions have also hit the industry hard as billions of dollars of previously allocated funds have been rescinded by the EPA, Department of Energy and other agencies, sometimes after they had already been dispersed.

Angermeier said the changes taken together have led to project cancellations, pauses, layoffs and the cancellation of new jobs that would have come with planned projects.

“We’re going to see a real restriction of new energy supply as a result of both the [reconciliation] bill and the and the administration’s action since the bill was enacted,” Gallagher said. “And of course, we’re seeing this restriction of new supply at a time when energy demand is booming.”

Wind and solar power have recently been among the fastest growing forms of new generation in the U.S., according to an August report from the Energy Information Administration.

While renewables are expected to account for much of the new generation forecast over the next two years, Gallagher said, “the outlook becomes a little bit hazier when you get out to ‘28 and ‘29.”

Even so, he’s not expecting a long-term chilling effect on the industry, because of continued market demand for renewable energy.

The Trump administration says it doesn’t take issue with renewable energy technologies, but with federal subsidies for them.

“Thirty-three years we’ve subsidized wind and solar power in the United States,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a late September press conference. “If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places.”

Wright and other officials say the administration prefers dense, baseload power that they say can respond to increasing energy demand. Wind and solar struggle with intermittency issues and are therefore less reliable than sources of power like natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, they say.

But supporters of renewable energy call that “hypocritical,” noting federal support for oil and gas projects. Renewables subsidies are “really more about creating an even playing field so that we can meet the demand that we have,” Angermeier said.

Gallagher called the administration’s arguments about reliability “tired,” citing the buildout of battery storage to support solar power.

“It was never really a legitimate criticism,” he said. “And it’s all the less so when we have energy storage that can deliver power reliably when the system needs it.”

‘The view from 200 years of history’ Nothing about the story of America’s public lands was inevitable, as Leshy makes clear.
That is partially because America’s public lands are — and have long been — very, very popular, he explains.
But overall Trump is zealously promoting drilling, mining, and logging on many public lands, he says.
Politics are not the only threat to public lands, Leshy cautions: “Climate change is altering how public lands are managed, bringing more species into jeopardy, changing how we manage forests for wildfire, and more — all with uncertain outcomes.","Last June, when United States Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, introduced a provision to sell millions of acres of public lands as part of the domestic policy package known as the “big, beautiful bill,” he might have anticipated pushback from environmentalists opposed to the plan.

Instead, some of the loudest critiques came from self-professed political conservatives — avid outdoorsmen who feared losing access to cherished grounds for hunting, fishing, and camping. Lee, who eventually abandoned the idea, may have been taken aback by the widespread resistance.

But not John Leshy ’69.

“Opinion polls bear this out, time and again: People love public lands,” Leshy says.

He would know. He has spent his life protecting and advocating for the more than 640 million acres of federally owned land in the U.S., first as an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in the 1970s, then as a top attorney at the Department of the Interior during the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, and as a law professor and academic. In a 2022 volume, “Our Common Ground: A History of America’s Public Lands,” Leshy, who is now a professor emeritus at UC Law San Francisco, tells the comprehensive story of how this shared resource came to be.

Today, the U.S. government owns more than a quarter of the nation’s total land area, which is managed by four agencies: the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, and National Park Service. From coast to coast, Alaska to Hawaii, this land contains some of the most stunning sights on earth: lakes and rivers, the tallest trees in the world, active volcanoes, caves, canyons, petrified forests, glaciers, and countless types of flora and fauna. Depending on the level of protection granted, some areas are also used for energy production, livestock grazing, or other kinds of resource extraction.

Beyond their sheer size, what makes the nation’s public lands particularly unique, Leshy says, is how accessible they are. “These lands benefit America and humanity in many ways. Generally open to all, for the most part today they are managed primarily for conservation, recreation, inspiration, and education. Every year they offer hundreds of millions of people life-changing encounters with nature, as well as activities that furnish an economic anchor for many communities.”

What Leshy’s book and career make clear is that the existence of America’s public lands is no accident — and it will take ongoing vigilance to ensure that they endure for generations to come.

“Nothing in the U.S. Constitution says we must have public lands. All it takes is an ordinary act of Congress to transfer every last acre out of U.S. ownership, even iconic treasures like the Everglades or Yellowstone,” says Leshy, who received the Harvard Environmental Law Society’s Horizon Award this year. “Each new generation must decide what it wants to do with its public lands.”

‘It pushed all of my buttons’

Leshy’s career began as something of a happy accident. Growing up in rural Appalachia, he spent a lot of time outdoors as a child, but environmental law was never on his mind. In fact, the field didn’t even exist when he was a student at Harvard Law School in the late 1960s, he says.

As a newly minted attorney, Leshy first went to work at the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, focusing on school desegregation cases. Three years later, having long dreamt of living in California, Leshy asked his best friend from law school if he might have any leads on a position there. By chance, the friend connected him with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Leshy helped them open their Western office and discovered his passion — advocating for public lands.

“It pushed all of my buttons,” he says. “It was nature, it was politics, it was interesting law, it was American history,” he says. “When I fell into it, I just decided that this was what I’d like to do with my life.”

Over the next three decades, Leshy worked on or led several historic efforts that expanded federally protected lands by hundreds of millions of acres. In 1977, he joined the Department of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, where he was part of the effort that produced a landmark law that safeguarded 150 million acres of pristine Alaska wilderness, more than doubling the size of the National Park System and tripling the size of the National Wildlife Refuge System.

Later, as the top attorney under Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt ’65 during Bill Clinton’s administration, Leshy oversaw a groundbreaking endeavor to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 — which gives the president the authority to create new national monuments — to expand protections on more than 5.5 million acres of Bureau of Land Management territory.

It was the first time the bureau had been given the responsibility to manage national monuments, which was, Leshy says, “a really important step because it manages the most land of the four major agencies, and this initiative laid the groundwork for future presidents to do the same,” such as Barack Obama ’91.

‘The view from 200 years of history’

Nothing about the story of America’s public lands was inevitable, as Leshy makes clear. “The breadth and character of this national asset are remarkable, considering that respect for private property and a distrust of government, particularly the national government, are baked into American culture and politics.”

Yet, from Ulysses S. Grant’s signing into law the establishment of the world’s first national park at Yellowstone, to Theodore Roosevelt’s vast expansion of publicly protected lands, to Richard Nixon’s signing of the law that created the Environmental Protection Agency, to the actions of Presidents Carter, Clinton, Bush, and Obama, American history is replete with stories of leaders and grassroots advocates from both parties acting to expand or protect this incredible resource, Leshy says.

That is partially because America’s public lands are — and have long been — very, very popular, he explains. “The view from 200 years of history shows the political system working the way it’s supposed to. It produced something the American public overwhelmingly supports.”

Leshy acknowledges that balancing demands for conflicting uses of public lands can be challenging, but he also says that there are ways of achieving these aims strategically without abandoning what makes America’s system special. “Resource extraction can be appropriate on some public lands, and existing law allows the Interior [Department] to sell or transfer parcels of land to state or local governments for various purposes such as affordable housing. That can be and has been done successfully in a small and measured way,” he says.

But in Leshy’s view, recent proposals to sell off large portions of federal lands are akin to “taking a meat cleaver” to the system. President Donald Trump has so far in this term not reduced the size of some national monuments, as he did in his first term, Leshy says, and also did not openly support Sen. Lee’s sales proposal. This, Leshy suggests, may mean Trump is paying some attention to opinion polls showing national monuments’ wide popularity. But overall Trump is zealously promoting drilling, mining, and logging on many public lands, he says. Some in the Trump administration, Leshy believes, are bent on disabling the agencies to try to convince the public that the federal government simply cannot manage the lands and therefore they ought to be transferred out of federal hands.

Politics are not the only threat to public lands, Leshy cautions: “Climate change is altering how public lands are managed, bringing more species into jeopardy, changing how we manage forests for wildfire, and more — all with uncertain outcomes. This is made worse because the Trump administration is hostile to the very idea that climate change is a serious challenge.”

A political success story

To Leshy, a career spent defending and expanding America’s public lands has been personally and professionally gratifying. But it has also helped illuminate an important American political success story that deserves more attention, he says.

“The vast majority of Americans love the fact that we’ve kept these lands, that they’re open to all, and are protected for future generations to enjoy,” he says. “It’s a ‘small d’ democratic thing, and I think that’s an important message, especially in these divisive times.”

Put plainly, he says, it shows that government can work. “There’s so much cynicism about Washington, D.C., and about how our political system is dysfunctional,” he says. “Of course, our government, like all human undertakings, has its flaws, but if we’re going to survive as a society, the political system needs to work. And the public lands show that it can produce a result people revere.”

Millions of households now endure more frequent and prolonged blackouts — disruptions that leave families without lights, refrigerated medication or internet access when they need it most. In response, more homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems as a resilient, sustainable and cost-effective solution.

When wildfires ravaged Southern California earlier this year, Jason Bulquerin's neighborhood was plunged into darkness. He was safely away from the burning regions, but transmission lines delivering power to his area were destroyed by one of multiple fires tearing through Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and other parts of Los Angeles County miles away.

Despite this, the lights never dimmed at Bulquerin's home even as it took days for utility crews to restore service. That's because Bulquerin is among a growing number of Americans using the latest in battery technology to power lights, appliances and entire homes during blackouts due to grid instability and increasingly unpredictable weather, EcoFlow reports.

Why Blackouts Are Here to Stay: From Extreme Weather to Overloaded Grids

Extreme weather is no longer ""extreme."" NOAA forecasts a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season in 2025, and power outages are expected to increase dramatically, with 13 to 19 named storms. Out of those, three to five could be major hurricanes. These aren't isolated events. In 2024, there were 27 confirmed disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each to hit the U.S.

Compounding the problem is a power grid weakened by decades of neglect. Federal projections warn that without a major investment in energy infrastructure, power outage hours could rise 100-fold by 2030.

Making matters worse, demand is exploding — driven by AI data centers that guzzle electricity, electric vehicles plugging in by the millions and smart homes that never stop drawing power. AI alone could double U.S. electric demand by 2030, pushing an already overstretched system to the brink. The Electric Power Research Institute reports that data centers could consume 9% of the nation's electricity by 2030 — double their current usage.

What Are Whole-Home Battery Systems? Breaking Down the Technology

At their core, whole-home battery systems are simple: They store electricity (either from the grid or solar panels) and release it when the grid fails. But unlike the noisy, gas-guzzling generators of the past, they’re clean, quiet and nearly maintenance-free. When an outage hits, they switch on automatically, so you might not even notice the grid went down.

Today's systems come in three principal schemes, each tailored to different needs:

Modular, portable systems. These are ""build-as-you-go"" solutions. Start small, powering only essentials (fridge, lights, medical devices) and plugging devices directly to portable batteries. You can add more battery capacity later if you want to cover your whole home.

Panel-integrated systems. These tie directly into your home's electrical panel, so you can pick which circuits to prioritize and track energy use in real time via an app. No more tangled extension cords — just seamless power when you need it.

Solar-plus-storage system. Pair a battery with solar panels on your rooftop, backyard, or balcony, and you’re not just preparing for outages — you’re cutting your monthly bills, too. The solar panels charge the battery with free, renewable energy during the day, so you can use that power instead of buying from the grid.

Industry and government data shows how fast this shift is happening. The share of new residential solar installations including battery storage more than doubled in 2024, from less than 12% in 2023 to 28%, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. And in wildfire-prone California, the U.S. government reports the rate is even higher at over half as of last year, which includes 40,000 new systems installed between 2023 and 2024.

More homeowners are turning to whole-home battery backup systems to ensure they have access to power during emergencies. While some backup systems don't require an associated rooftop solar system, many buyers pair battery and solar in order to maximize both their solar investments and their backup power duration.

Getting Word Out While Responding to Disaster

Whole-home systems aren't just protecting individual families — they're also making communities more resilient. Nonprofits that lead disaster response are teaming up with tech companies to turn these batteries into tools for collective preparedness and recovery.

Footprint Project, a New Orleans-based nonprofit focused on building disaster resiliency and response to weather events with green energy solutions, partnered with companies like EcoFlow to upgrade emergency response trailers from local fire departments with batteries and solar panels. These trailers can now roll into fire zones in California and hurricane-hit areas of North Carolina to power rescue tools and communications equipment.

In Canada, the Alberta Lions Emergency Response Team (A.L.E.R.T.), is also equipping itself with donated products to power microgrids for rescue and recovery operations.

Battery Systems are a Greener, Cleaner Alternative to Backup Generators

While fuel-burning generators have been traditionally used for power backup during emergencies, battery systems provide a cleaner, quieter solution. Smaller portable batteries can also be used in apartments and condos, whose tenants often cannot accommodate a generator. New products are also coming online to serve homeowners in need of whole-home load handling and flexible capacity systems.

Bulquerin, the California homeowner, said that since experiencing the extended outage during this year's wildfires, his neighbors have been looking to install backup batteries, including residents new to backup power or those wanting to upgrade from gas.",https://images.stacker.com/s/720/1280/images/stories/2025/09/29/ecoflow-beyond-the-generator.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 17:06:07.829271

The 47-page complaint submitted in the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island centers on the ramifications of the yanked Solar for All grants for solar panel installation companies, labor unions, homeowners and nonprofit advocates.

“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities Congress intended these funds to benefit,” the complaint states.

The lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government and the Conservation Law Foundation, comes more than two months after the EPA abruptly ended the Solar for All program. Originally included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act approved under the Biden administration, the $7 billion program aimed to help low- and moderate-income homeowners and renters access the benefits of solar panels — often too expensive or unfeasible otherwise — while advancing renewable energy use and creating jobs.

Funding was distributed in 2024 to state and local governments, nonprofits and tribal organizations nationwide, including a $49.3 million award to Rhode Island through the state’s Office of Energy Resources.

Rhode Island had spent $89,000 of its share — on employee costs for administration preparation — when the money was clawed back, Christopher Kearns, acting energy commissioner, said in an email Monday.

But development work was well underway, with the state agency in tandem with labor leaders and nonprofit partners intent on maximizing the benefits of its federal windfall. The five-year program was projected to help 900,000 households nationwide save $350 million annually on their energy bills while creating 200,000 new jobs and workforce training programs, according to estimates from the Biden administration.

RI AFL-CIO leads the charge

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, which represents 80,000 union workers in Rhode Island, is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Union leaders helped Rhode Island plan and submit its application to the EPA seeking funding through the program, simultaneously creating and boosting workforce training and apprenticeship programs to prepare for the frenzy of new solar panel installations.

“Because of the requirement for prevailing wages and utilization of apprentices, the hope was that this would end up going to union contractors because we already pay prevailing wages and we always have professional apprenticeships in place,” Patrick Crowley, RI AFL-CIO president, said in an interview Monday.

Meanwhile, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, a nonprofit public interest law firm, increased its staff by 20% — from eight to 10 attorneys — to focus on the state regulations governing solar energy and utilities in preparation for the federal grant, said Jennifer Wood, the center’s executive director.

The Center for Justice is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with a Georgia homeowner who had already applied for a free solar installation, and several businesses and nonprofits involved in solar panel installation, financing and education.

None of the plaintiffs were direct recipients of the Solar for All grants, but all stood to benefit from the funds awarded — and are now “significantly harmed” by the funding termination, the lawsuit states.

“By not having this program, it’s a lost opportunity for hundreds of jobs,” Crowley said.

Kearns, with Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

Access issues

Wood lamented the time and resources spent training two new attorneys on the complexities of state utility proceedings that govern the incentives for and implementation of solar energy in Rhode Island. More consequential, though, was the loss for low-income Rhode Island residents already struggling to afford rising energy bills and unlikely to reap benefits of solar energy without the federal aid.

“There are a lot of questions around solar, how it gets implemented, how the infrastructure works, but for our clients, the question is, can they even get access to it at all?” Wood said. “Not getting funding from Solar for All means our low-income customers may not be able to break into the benefits of solar power. That’s why it’s such a devastating blow.”

The Trump administration’s opposition to renewable energy was clear on the campaign trail, and cemented as soon as he took office: halting offshore wind projects, yanking electric vehicle incentives, and freezing access to federal grants and loans for energy efficiency programs and solar panels, among others.

Federal budget cuts signed into law on July 4 canceled $16 billion of clean energy and emissions reductions incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, a move affirmed by an appeals court in D.C. on Oct. 1. But the federal budget cuts only applied to funds not already committed to specific projects or recipients – suggesting the Solar for All funding was preserved, according to the lawsuit.

It alleges that Zeldin ignored the congressional directive and its “unambiguous text” when he announced in a social media video on Aug. 7 that the EPA was canceling the Solar for All program — violating the Administrative Procedures Act as well as constitutional protections for legislative authority.

The move drew swift condemnation from Democrats in Congress, including Rhode Island U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Gov. Dan McKee also denounced the news, accusing the Trump administration of “trying to undermine programs that support Rhode Island families” in a statement on Aug. 12.

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” Amy R. Romero, chief legal counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, said in a statement Monday. “The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

The complaint asks a federal judge to force the federal administration to restore funding for the program, and declare its termination unlawful.

A spokesperson for the EPA declined to comment in an emailed response on Monday.

Leading experts have concluded that electricity supply is the most acutely binding constraint in expanding AI capacity and our current electricity production is woefully inadequate. The U.S. is seeing an electricity demand surge and needs every tool available to win in the AI race. American made solar and storage are the critical bridge technologies to get electrons on the grid for AI while other resources remain constrained.

The Department of Energy projects that electricity demand from U.S. data centers could triple by 2028, reaching up to 12% of our total U.S. electricity consumption. That growth is already showing up in utility forecasts, interconnection queues, power procurement contracts, and energy prices.

President Trump’s executive orders recognize this challenge and underscore a bold commitment to securing America’s leadership in AI and energy dominance. Delivering on the President’s mandate demands an all-of-the above energy strategy that deploys gigawatts of electrons quickly and builds on U.S. manufacturing supply chains. This is where American-made solar comes in.

In the past few years, the U.S. has reshored a domestic solar supply chain uniquely positioned to meet this moment. We can manufacture over 50 GW – roughly 50 nuclear power plants worth – of American made solar modules each year and the upstream segments of the supply chain are quickly scaling. American-made solar and storage is being used to power the next generation of AI, all while supporting over 40,000 American solar manufacturing workers.

American Made Solar Delivers Speed at Low Costs for Ratepayers

The timelines for AI energy buildouts are measured in quarters, not years. Long permitting and interconnection delays and supply chain bottlenecks are forecasted to delay the use of other generation sources. Utility-scale solar and storage projects can quickly come online in one to two years. AI data center business models depend on speed, and that energy deployment advantage is decisive. Utilities, energy developers, and industry analysts across the board have pointed to utility-scale solar and storage, combined with natural gas, as the near-term solution for meeting AI’s energy needs.

American Made Solar in the AI Pipeline

The deployment of solar from major utilities speaks for itself. Dominion Energy, the utility that serves Northern Virginia’s huge data center market, in its 2024 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) projects 6 GW of gas, alongside 12 GW of solar, 6 GW of offshore wind, and 4.5 GW of storage by 2039. Other major integrated utilities like Georgia Power and Duke Energy are taking a similar portfolio approach, with solar in the lead. The Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is deploying energy to the grid at a significantly higher rate than other markets, led by American made solar deployment. In the past two years, ERCOT decreased prices and increased reliability as it deployed massive amounts of American-made solar. As of January 2025, 28 GW of gas, 38 GW of wind, 153 GW of solar, and 165 GW of storage are active in ERCOT’s interconnection queue.

In its September 30, 2025 forecast (below), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) forecasts 92.6 GW of “high probability additions” solar will come online through July 2028, over four times that of any other resource:

All of the U.S. AI giants, including Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI are building out hyperscale facilities with solar. Two examples of U.S. solar manufacturing providing this energy for AI are instructive:

First Solar and the Orion Project

One of the clearest examples of what’s possible with American-made solar is the Orion Solar Belt in Buckholts, Texas. At around 900 MW, Orion is one of the largest solar projects in the country, and it’s designed to power Google’s growing data center operations in Texas. The project used First Solar’s U.S.-manufactured thin-film modules produced in Ohio, domestic steel, and American-made tracking systems. It is among the first large-scale energy projects to source all major components from within the U.S., demonstrating that America can deliver the scale, speed, and reliability that next-generation infrastructure requires.

And Orion is not an isolated case. First Solar’s customers are increasingly pivotal in ensuring that the surge in U.S. data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, can be matched by equally reliable U.S. energy supply. These are exactly the kind of projects that show how energy dominance and AI dominance go hand-in-hand.

Qcells and Meta’s Long-Term Supply Agreemen

In 2020, Qcells celebrated the commissioning of the 102.5 MW Bancroft Station Solar Farm in Georgia, developed to support Facebook’s Newton County data center. The project used more than 350,000 modules, manufactured at Qcells’ facility in Georgia, one of the largest solar manufacturing plants in the Western Hemisphere. In addition, Qcells is soon opening ingot, wafer, and cell lines in Georgia. For Facebook, and its parent company Meta, this partnership has always been about delivery certainty. With major data campuses coming online across the South and Midwest, Meta needed a supplier capable of producing large volumes of product in the U.S. States, on a predictable timeline, without the logistical challenges of overseas sourcing.

SEMA Members Are Built for Scale

First Solar, Qcells, and other Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition members are not just building solar components. They are building the bridge energy needed to support the AI energy demand and American energy dominance. This all supports good-paying American manufacturing careers, not just short-term construction jobs, from Louisiana to Ohio and Michigan to Georgia.

The future of American AI dominance depends on whether the country can build and deliver enough energy infrastructure to support it. That means embracing every tool that we have —and works fast. U.S.-made solar is one of the few tools that can be built fast enough and deployed widely enough to keep pace with this growth. This moment calls for clarity and coordination.

Tesla Inc. has once again captured the attention of investors with its third-quarter 2025 production and delivery figures, marking a significant rebound from earlier setbacks this year. The electric-vehicle giant reported delivering over 497,000 vehicles, surpassing Wall Street expectations and setting a new company record. This surge was largely fueled by a rush of U.S. consumers eager to capitalize on a $7,500 federal tax credit before its expiration, as highlighted in a recent analysis by CNBC. Production numbers also impressed, with more than 447,000 vehicles rolling off assembly lines, while energy storage deployments hit an all-time high of 12.5 gigawatt-hours.

Beyond the headline numbers, Tesla’s performance underscores its dominance in the EV market, even as competition intensifies from legacy automakers and newcomers alike. The company’s mass-market models, such as the Model 3 and Model Y, accounted for the bulk of deliveries, demonstrating sustained demand despite economic headwinds. Investors reacted positively, with Tesla’s stock climbing in after-hours trading following the announcement, reflecting renewed confidence in the company’s growth trajectory.

The Catch: Sustainability of the Surge

However, this stellar quarter comes with a notable caveat: the boost may prove temporary. Analysts point out that the expiring tax incentive created an artificial pull-forward of demand, potentially leaving a void in the fourth quarter. As noted in a detailed report from The Motley Fool, while the deliveries represent fantastic news for shareholders, the underlying trends suggest caution. Tesla’s year-to-date deliveries are still down compared to 2024, and without similar incentives, maintaining this momentum could be challenging.

Moreover, external factors like weakening European sales and increased rivalry from lower-cost Chinese EVs add layers of complexity. Tesla’s energy division, however, offers a bright spot, with record deployments signaling strong growth in battery storage solutions for utilities and homes. This diversification could buffer against automotive volatility, but it remains a smaller revenue slice for now.

Investor Implications and Future Outlook

For industry insiders, these results prompt a deeper examination of Tesla’s strategic pivots. The company is betting big on autonomous driving and robotics, with upcoming reveals like the Cybercab robotaxi expected to drive long-term value. Yet, as Reuters reports, analysts anticipate the tax credit’s end to usher in a period of slower growth, with European weakness persisting into 2026.

Tesla’s ability to innovate and scale production will be key. CEO Elon Musk has emphasized cost reductions and efficiency gains, which could help mitigate demand fluctuations. Still, the quarter’s success, while impressive, highlights the fragility of relying on policy-driven sales spikes.

Broadening Horizons Beyond Vehicles

Shifting focus, Tesla’s energy storage achievements deserve equal scrutiny. The 12.5 GWh deployment not only sets a record but also positions the company as a leader in renewable energy integration. This segment grew robustly, outpacing vehicle delivery growth and contributing meaningfully to overall revenue, according to data from Tesla’s Investor Relations press release.

As global energy transitions accelerate, Tesla’s Megapack and Powerwall products could become pivotal. Insiders note that partnerships with utilities are expanding, potentially insulating the firm from EV market cycles.

Navigating Challenges Ahead

Despite the positives, challenges loom. Tesla faces regulatory scrutiny, supply chain disruptions, and macroeconomic uncertainties that could dampen consumer spending. The company’s stock, up 75% over the past year per Nasdaq insights, reflects optimism around future tech like Optimus robots, but near-term delivery trends will test investor patience.

In summary, Tesla’s Q3 triumph is a mixed bag—celebratory yet cautionary. For investors, it’s a reminder that while short-term wins boost sentiment, sustainable growth hinges on innovation and adaptability in a competitive arena. As the company prepares for its next earnings call, all eyes will be on guidance for the quarters ahead, where the true test of resilience awaits.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xai-tmp-imgen-a871ab5b-10c2-4c5f-91a1-1a6ff436be1e.jpeg,N,,2025-10-06 20:01:58.739243

This 1978 quote attributed to cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world: indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has,” serves as a ‘north star’ for SACE’s work. Mead is describing what I call a catalytic community, people with passion and vision working together to change their world for the better.

SACE is a catalytic community: a community of people drawn to a vision infused with passion – that people can shape their future by changing the most fundamental choice a society makes: how we produce and consume energy. We refuse to leave this fundamental choice to major corporations that readily sacrifice our long-term health and well-being for short-term financial profit.

The Early Days: Activists Laying the Groundwork

In the late 1970s, a small group of dedicated individuals in East Tennessee came together to challenge the nation’s largest public power utility, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), to listen to and be responsive to the people they serve. Calling themselves the Tennessee Valley Energy Coalition (TVEC), everyday citizens began organizing to speak truth to power. In the mid-1980s, TVA was a massive bureaucracy struggling to find a mission. Having tamed the Tennessee River, built an expansive electric power system, and ridden the growth of the midsouth, TVA had overbuilt its nuclear power program and was facing serious rate hikes on its power customers.

TVA’s massive size bred arrogance. TVEC empowered the public to hold TVA accountable to its public power mission. In 1985, TVEC gained official 501(c)3 status, laying the foundation upon which, over the next four decades, and with the work of many important players, we would eventually build the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

For Four Decades, We’ve Been Fiercely Committed to One Mission…

In the 1990s, TVEC was renamed the Tennessee Valley Energy Reform Coalition (TVERC) with a focus on reforming TVA planning and power choices. We successfully advocated for TVA to conduct public planning in the form of an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) that forced the utility’s planning assumptions and internal biases into the open. We have activists and passionate advocates who, in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, laid the groundwork for us to build upon.

Becoming SACE: Expanding Our Geography and Focus

Understanding and engaging utility planning upstream, before decisions harden and become virtually impossible to stop, has become and remains core to our mission. Climate policy, clean air advocacy, and promoting renewable energy became central to our mission in the 1990s.

In 1999, TVERC expanded its footprint beyond the TVA region and became the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), joining forces with other regional groups. Together, we demanded controls on air pollution that was endangering people’s health and threatening treasured places across our region while also promoting clean, renewable energy choices.

From TVA to the Southeast’s Fossil Fuel Industry

From the forested Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, our parks and beaches are diminished by electric power generated from fossil fuels, and our precious places are in peril. From cradle to grave, these fuels — coal, oil, and methane gas — have scarred our lands. Two of the largest fossil fuel industrial disasters in history have happened in our region: the massive coal ash spill at TVA’s Kingston, Tennessee, Fossil Plant in 2008, and the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster of 2010 in the northern Gulf of Mexico. These catastrophes took a significant toll on our people and the environment.

That same year, SACE celebrated its 25th anniversary, continuing our commitment to building a cleaner, safer, and healthier environment for everyone in our region.

SACE’s pioneering work in the late 1990s and early 2000s set the stage for growing clean, renewable energy, such as solar, wind, energy efficiency, and electrification technologies to counter these negative impacts from fossil fuels. We first worked with utilities to offer customers a clean, renewable energy choice (even if the customers had to pay a little extra for it in the form of utility green power pricing programs), and later moved to forcing those same utilities to recognize that solar, wind, and storage are the lowest-cost electric power generating choices and the cleanest and safest to deploy.

Going ‘All In’ On Electric Transportation

As we placed serious pressure on utilities to lower their carbon emissions and adapted our advocacy again, it became clear that transportation and mobility emissions would surpass utility emissions, which they did in 2016. After working on sustainably produced biodiesel, SACE went ‘all in’ on electric transportation and pushed utilities to produce clean, renewable energy for the grid, enabling electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce their emissions.

SACE has become a leading voice for expanding electric mobility options to all populations across our region. Today, our Electrify the South campaign is a leader in education and outreach, bringing folks together to gain real experience with electric vehicles through “ride and drives” and basic EV education. We have collaborated with local governments to secure electric school buses, thereby protecting children, while also partnering with utilities and local and state governments to prepare their infrastructure for the transition to electric mobility.

Standing On the Shoulders of Those Who Came Before Us

I must highlight the amazing people I have been blessed to work with and who have been the cornerstone of SACE’s success. First, the staff members of our organization have been outstanding. Their dedication, creativity, and grit in challenging some of the world’s largest energy companies never cease to amaze me.

Our Board has been a great source of wisdom and insight in some of our toughest battles while trusting our staff to lead. Our supporters, both large and small, have been great partners over the years, making us stronger and raising their voices with ours, allowing us to focus more on the work than on chasing money. These are the members of the catalytic community that are making the change happen.

Why We Do What We Do

The transition away from fossil fuels to clean energy is an ongoing battle, but it’s critical to ensure clean, safe, and healthy communities throughout the Southeast. We are finally seeing some real progress, especially as some of our regional utilities are beginning to truly scale solar by deploying amounts that counter fossil energy. It needs to happen faster, but the arguments in favor of the status quo and prolonging our reliance on fossil fuels grow weaker by the day.

Today’s accelerating climate catastrophes are the ongoing legacies of dangerous energy choices and a long-lived overreliance on coal, oil, and gas. These fossil fuels are the source of the polluting emissions that are raising sea levels and overheating our planet, resulting in increasingly intense climate disasters that are endangering the people and places we love. The massive destruction and tragic loss of life from Hurricane Helene in the Western mountains of North Carolina is but one recent example in our own region.

We are in this work because we know we can make a difference and shape our collective future. The severity of climate disruption can be overwhelming, and the shortsightedness and misinformation of corporate power, focused solely on financial returns, is maddening. However, clean energy technology is scaling at a pace never seen in human history.

Associated Environmental Systems (AES) and MACCOR Inc. today announced FUSION, a fully integrated battery test system. FUSION combines environmental chambers, battery test fixtures, and battery cyclers in a single pre-configured solution, eliminating integration delays and giving developers a faster, more reliable way to validate and improve battery performance. Manufactured in the U.S., FUSION reflects AES and Maccor's commitment to quality, customer confidence, and constant innovation.

Battery Testing Demands Outpace Integration Capabilities

Battery testing demand is accelerating across electric vehicles, consumer electronics, aerospace, military & defense, and energy storage. Laboratories and manufacturers are under pressure to validate more cells, modules, and packs in less time to keep pace with innovation.

Yet traditional test setups slow progress. Teams often juggle multiple vendors, separate purchase orders, and weeks of on-site integration to have chambers and cyclers communicate. Compatibility troubleshooting and custom programming can stretch deployments from days into months, delaying critical product development timelines. FUSION solves these challenges by providing everything in one fully compatible module that is ready for immediate use.

FUSION: A Complete Integrated Battery Testing Solution

FUSION is more than a chamber and a cycler in the same crate. It's a fully engineered system where hardware, wiring, safety, and controls are designed, validated, and tested to operate as one. This pre-engineered approach gives customers confidence that their system will work seamlessly before it arrives on site.

Each FUSION unit includes:

Maccor battery cyclers

AES environmental chambers

Integrated safety systems within the chamber

Pre-wired cables and wiring

Battery fixtures matched to cell formats

Unified control software - AESONE CONNECT® and Maccor Software Suite

""Customers can issue a single purchase order and receive a complete, turnkey product,"" said Mike Sandoval, Vice President of Business Development at Maccor. ""This approach simplifies procurement, accelerates setup, and reduces risk. It gives customers a faster path to reliable test results.""

With integration already solved, customers can accelerate testing programs at scale, redirecting resources toward innovation instead of troubleshooting. From coin cells to EV pack validation, FUSION helps teams focus on results rather than system setup.

""Customers consistently tell us their biggest frustration is making different systems communicate,"" added Aaron Robinson, Vice President of Sales and Service at AES. ""With FUSION, the controls are already integrated and work together immediately.""

Technical Capabilities of FUSION Battery Cell Tester Systems

FUSION is available in four configurations to meet a range of testing needs:

FUSION-24-016-3200: 200-400A per channel, scalable to 16 channels

The FUSION series has a temperature range from -20°C to +80 °C and delivers ±0.5 °C stability and up to 90% return-to-grid efficiency for regenerative testing on the higher amperage solutions.

A Proven Partnership Powers FUSION

Such sophisticated integration requires extensive experience in both environmental chamber design and battery cycler engineering. AES has manufactured environmental chambers since 1959, deploying more than 200,000 testing channels. Maccor, the world's largest battery test system manufacturer, serves over 1,500 customers in over 50 countries.

Built on a decade of collaborative installations, AES and Maccor's combined expertise is now at the core of every FUSION system.

""FUSION is the culmination of years working directly with customers,"" said Robinson. ""We are both US manufacturing companies, with a focus on technology. Our colleagues at both companies meld together as if we are the same company working toward the same goals. The best integrated technological solution with integrated support is something that is currently not offered in the field.""

(CNN) — Just a couple of years ago, America’s auto industry had visions of an all-electric future. It has since abandoned that talk after the Trump administration eliminated the federal government’s incentives for the technology.

The near future isn’t looking too pretty. The end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs is expected to send sales plunging in the coming quarters and perhaps years.

But the global auto industry hasn’t given up entirely on EVs. Automakers are continuing to invest in an electric future — even if it’s not all-electric, as they had expected. The auto industry remains uncertain about the regulatory future of gas-powered cars in large parts of the United States as well as other markets around the globe. And they don’t want to fall too far behind China’s massive EV surge.

“They have softened their stance on an all-EV future,” said Daniel Ives, tech analyst for Wedbush Securities. “I do believe Ford, GM, Stellantis, and a lot of other automakers will still aggressively go down the EV path. But they’re more carefully going down the path than they were a few years ago.”

Sharply lower US EV sales ahead

The end of a $7,500 federal tax credit a week ago caused an EV sales surge during the third quarter as interested buyers rushed to grab a car before the discount expired. Tesla (TSLA), Ford (F), and General Motors (GM) all sold more electric cars than they ever had before, with GM in particular selling more than double the number of EVs in America than it had a year earlier. Tesla’s sales jump came after six straight months of declining numbers.

But after the sharp rise, EV sales for the rest of the year will likely come back to Earth with a heavy thud. And it’s unlikely they’ll get back up for a long time afterwards.

While a full 10% of all cars sold in the US in the last quarter were electric, Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month that he expects EV sales to fall to 5% of the US market, which would be down from about 7% of the market last year. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson said that his company also expects that “EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously.”

Still placing big bets

But despite the gloomy outlook, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, a move it called its “next Model T moment,” a reference to the Ford car that helped introduce internal combustion vehicles to the mass market more than a century ago.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought, especially with the policy change,” Farley said at a recent company event.

Hyundai, also said it is not pulling back from its EV investment plans in the US market, even after immigration officials arrested 475 workers at one of its new EV and battery plants under construction in Georgia.

But Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stressed at a recent investor day event that the plant will be able to shift between building EVs and traditional gasoline powered cars more easily depending on market demand is part of the comapny’s plan.

Changing emissions regulations

Part of what forced automakers to shift to electric vehicles in the first place had been federal regulations from the Biden administration that aimed for EVs to make up 50% of the American new car market by 2030, and would have imposed steep penalties on automakers that didn’t hit the target.

Those regulations have been mostly rolled back under the Trump administration. The steep financial penalties for violating emission limits were also eliminated in the July tax and spending bill passed by Republicans in July.

California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – had also imposed mandates that would have essentially banned the sale of on gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. Between them, those states account for about a quarter of US car sales.

But Congress recently moved to end California and the other states’ abilities to impose their own, stricter, emissions rules. That fight has been taken to federal court, and the battle could take considerable time to resolve – so much time that changes in administrations in the next decade could ultimately bring that ban back into place as soon as 2035. Europe and China are also moving ahead with their own stricter emissions rules that could force electric vehicle purchases.

Automakers were also chasing much higher stock prices with their EV plans. Tesla has a greater market cap by far than any other automaker, even though it sells only a fraction of the cars any of them do. That has been the case for years, even before CEO Elon Musk and the company’s fans on Wall Street started talking about its ambitious-but-yet-to-be-realized plans about robotaxis and robots driving up the value of the company in the future.

Gas cars ‘no longer a four-letter word’

Rather than going all-in on all-electric cars, automakers are focusing on hybrid–vehicles that have both electric motors and internal combustion engines (ICE).

“There’s still an aggressive push for EVs. But ICE is no longer a four-letter word anymore,” Ives said. “They’re going back to their roots.”

And America’s car companies are saying they didn’t see the same market demand for all-electric vehicles as cars powered by gasoline.

The regulations that had been in place under the Biden administration were “putting us in a box that would have ultimately resulted in a significantly smaller US auto industry, because we wouldn’t have been permitted to sell the internal combustion vehicles at anywhere near the volume we would have sold them,” GM CFO Jacobson said at GM’s investors presentation last month.

He said that, despite those regulations and support for EVs, including the $7,500 tax credit, “customers weren’t adopting at the rate that the government wanted.”

But Jacobson said GM still sees longer-term growth in demand for EVs, even without the tax credit and other support for an all-electric future, and that the company is working to meet that growing EV demand.

“We need to let it settle and understand where is that natural (EV) demand going forward and how do we meet that natural demand,” he said. “That’s going to take a little bit of time. We’ll probably have to adjust our footprint a little bit.”

EVs remain attractive

Automakers also find EVs attractive for competitive reasons: It takes fewer hours of labor to produce an EV than it does a gasoline powered car – with its complicated engine and transmission – making them potentially more profitable for automakers than traditional gasoline powered cars.

And demand for EVs could start to increase again if the cost of producing EVs, especially the batteries that make up a large part of the cost of electric vehicles, continues to drop. And virtually every automaker is announcing plans for less costly battery technology.

As part of its $5 billion EV investment plan announced last month, Ford said it will soon sell an EV pickup for $30,000, making it one of the most affordable available. By comparison, the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup has a starting price of about $55,000. The new line to build that more affordable EV pickup is due to be up and running by 2027, Ford said last month.

And Ford still thinks the world is changing, even if it’s changing more slowly than people originally thought.

“We took inspiration from the Model T — the universal car that changed the world,” Doug Field, Ford’s chief EV digital and design officer, said Monday. “We think today will be a turning point for Ford Motor Company and the auto industry.”",https://abc17news.b-cdn.net/abc17news.com/2025/10/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWdmNXNrcHowMDFlM2I2bjJnNnV6b2kx-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZ2YwZmp1bDAwNzAyOHFvY3oxM2RuMG0.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:04:55.054385

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

Standing before the United Nations last week, U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed long-held animosity for the body dating back decades to when his company was apparently rejected for a renovations gig. Trump swore he would have delivered mahogany walls and marble floors to the tower. And now look at the state of the place, he grumbled. “You walk on terrazzo. Do you notice that?”

Something far worse than composite flooring is in store for nations that fail to rally to Trump’s hypernationalism, anti-immigrant fervor, and fawning embrace of fossil fuels. “Your countries are going to hell,” he said, apparently addressing his comments primarily to the “English-speaking world.” In a room filled with heads of state already reckoning with global warming as an existential threat, Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

He dismissed the decades of warnings about an overheating planet and the increasingly frequent and extreme weather events that the World Economic Forum has estimated are costing the world $16M every hour.

It was a do-as-I-say-and-as-I-do lecture, with Trump modeling a domestic climate response that can best be described as ecocidal. He is burning up the evidence of climate crisis while directly attacking renewable energy and other planet-cooling strategies that could keep more people safer the world over. This includes intentionally crashing climate-observing satellites, shutting down a Hawaii observatory that tracks atmospheric changes and a national climate monitoring network, closing federal environmental justice programs serving many of those most impacted by dirty fuels and climate disruption, curtailing federal assistance for disaster-struck communities, and more.

In the wake of the government shutdown, Trump just this week froze an estimated $26B in federal dollars for transportation and renewable-energy projects that had been headed to Democrat-led states, seeking revenge on Democrats who demanded that Republicans restore public healthcare services stripped in the federal budget bill.

Of course, dismantling federal research efforts and denying assistance does nothing to slow climate harms. Instead it both accelerates warming and puts more people at risk of harm. Teams rooting out so-called DEI initiatives during the opening months of Trump’s term have targeted climate efforts tied to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and clawed back $16B granted under the Biden Administration to help local communities fight climate change.

If anything, these attacks only prove the wisdom of initiatives undertaken in partnership with city and county governments and nonprofits, which aim to foster community resilience not only in response to climate destabilization, but also from potentially unraveling governmental support.

In San Antonio, Texas, for example, austerity measures in a tightening economy have already defunded two widely hailed efforts that are putting power—both literally and figuratively—into the hands of the community. But the project design and creative accounting born from legacies of distrust in government will likely see both efforts continue, even in the shadow of federal antagonism and potential local government retreat.

The ‘Beacon’ of Beacon Hill

Afew miles north of downtown San Antonio sits the Beacon Hill neighborhood, one of the earliest “suburban” neighborhoods for relatively affluent residents of a colonial city. Today it’s populated by older and often ornate single- and two-story homes in various states of repair, an area that has captured the attention of those looking for affordable housing as well as those looking to flip rundown homes at a profit. Its strength is in new and established residents, a vibrant homeowners association, and deepening social networks. In many cases, these are residents aware of the needs of their neighbors and already trained in disaster response.

Elizabeth Eichhorn, for instance, knows two businesses within walking distances whose owners have agreed to open as unofficial warming or cooling centers in the event of extreme temperature shifts. She knows who on the block has gas stoves ready and available to cook or purify water if the electricity is knocked out. She also knows which local business always has a minimum of 80 gallons of drinking water set aside for her block in case the water system fails. It’s information her immediate neighbors share also.

Such understandings arose from necessity starting in the hours after power failure during a 2021 winter storm. In February 2021, hundreds of thousands of residents across the city lost electricity, many for several days. Many others also lost water when the gas-powered generators at those water towers also failed.

Sarah Woolsey, founder of the nonprofit Impact Guild, which at the time operated a brick-and-mortar community center in the area, was soon helping residents stage a door-to-door response to the disaster.

“What happened over those next few days changed me,” she said. “Mostly it was neighbors that needed boiled water but also brought a dozen eggs over. It was this really cool few days of mutual aid with people showing up with what they had, and others needing things, and everybody needing things and receiving.”

That outreach taught her something else about her community. She learned that food insecurity was a daily reality for many before the freeze, with many already “hanging on by a thread,” she told Deceleration.

Beacon Hill has since become a showcase community for the City of San Antonio’s Climate Ready Neighborhoods effort, led by the City’s Office of Sustainability. Impact Guild is a key partner in a program that has intentionally put power into the hands of community by helping them first and foremost deepen their social relationships, identify their resources and talents, and negotiate in advance how they will support one another when disaster hits.

The neighborhood’s experiences in 2021 now inform some of the key literature being distributed by Climate Ready Neighborhoods as it seeks to activate “pods” across the city, neighborhood by neighborhood, teaching the power of interdependence at the level of the city block.

“It’s a matter of realizing that the city can’t be everything, so we have to figure out how to take our own responsibility,” Eichhorn told Deceleration. “Taking care of our neighborhood is shared.”

These neighbors weren’t passively waiting for someone in government to help them prepare for the extreme weather of climate change. They started that for themselves, years before the birth of the Climate Ready effort.

It was a natural shift for Eichhorn, who had lived in areas with frequent disruptions before. “I happened to live in Pasadena, California, where you have to learn to live with earthquakes and wildfires. Most every single person has a safety kit or recovery bag,” she said.

In the world of disaster response, the local—that is, the neighborhood—has long been recognized as a determining factor as to whether someone lives or dies in the aftermath of climate shock.

And that’s not lost on Beacon Hill’s City partners either.

“I think I’m really leaning into that aspect [of the project]. It’s just building up the community connections, the social capital, whatever you want to call it—get to know your neighbor and … build those systems,” said Kate Jaceldo, the City of San Antonio Office of Sustainability’s climate adaptation manager.

Even before the Trump administration started regularly rejecting calls for FEMA assistance and lurching toward dismantling the agency entirely, Beacon Hill residents were asking each other: “What can we do as a community?” Eichhorn said. “How do we connect with people who are already suffering? Let’s say they don’t have access to food, water, or shelter. How do we help with that?”

The summers of rising temperatures—and growing awareness of heat deaths in the city—has only validated the wisdom of those efforts. A recent assessment found the largest of the world’s capital cities are now experiencing 25 percent more extreme heat days than they were as recently as the 1990s. That heat is no surprise and likely to blame for more than 260,000 deaths since 2000.

“The human case for climate change adaptation is obvious,” write the authors of the cities study at the International Institute for Environment and Development. “That’s why city administrations should get the funding boost they need to work closely with communities, civil society groups, and health and other policy experts, on solutions to the growing heat problem.”

Gathering Heat Deaths

About 20 years ago, thousands of people died tucked away in their homes without adequate air conditioning or living on the street without access to a cooling center or home to retreat to.

“A week or so into the heat wave, city officials began running out of places to store bodies,” recounts Jeff Goodell, an Austin-based writer, in the online journal Yale360.

All told, nearly 15,000 died from the heat across France. The year was 2003.

Whether Paris, France or Paris, Texas, the heat has continued to rise virtually unabated as atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels, continue to increase. In 2024, sustained daily temps of 108 degrees Fahrenheit, which Save the Children said was roughly 16 degrees more than the annual average, shut down schools for more than 30 million children across Bangladesh—for the second year in a row. More than 1,300 taking the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia died the same year after walking in daytime temperatures that ranged between 117F and 120F. In the United States, more than 1,000 heat-related deaths were reported while efforts to secure a federal heat standard for workers floundered.

Such “once in a hundred years” extreme heat events now “need to be expected every 2–5 years in most locations,” due to industrially driven climate change, recent research shows.

Heat-related deaths are just one obvious result of a hotter planet. Another are the sudden storms known as “cloud bursts”or “rain bombs,” which have wreaked havoc across India and Pakistan but are no longer unfamiliar in Texas. The link between climate change and flash flooding is easy to understand if we think of the atmosphere as a sponge. Because warmer air holds more water, climate change means a bigger sponge—and when it finally gets wrung, the accumulation can be disastrous.

This is how hundreds can be swept away in Kashmir in one day. It is how 12 inches of rain can fall in just a few hours in the Texas Hill Country and spark a flood that would ultimately claim more than 130 lives.

Texas this year didn’t blow past our recent summer scorchings, thankfully, although summer temps arrived early and have continued to run hotter than normal, well into the upper 90s, despite the arrival of fall. Around the world, temperatures recorded across land and sea continue to show an Earth moving deeper into unprecedented territory, with some of the hottest temps ever experienced by humans recorded in recent years. In spite of Trump’s slurs against the science, this has all played out as the decades of climate models said it would.

It is for this reason that Trump’s UN climate denialism prompted Ilana Seid, an ambassador from the island nation of Palau and head of the organization of small island states, to call the US reversal on climate under Trump “a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” a sentiment echoed by Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi, who said: “we are endangering the lives of innocent people in the world.”

Some long-committed climate activists see that betrayal too—and have started calling for local communities to take survival into their own hands.

‘Dagger in the Heart’

“It’s too late.”

This pronouncement about averting worst-case climate outcomes by Canadian scientist David Suzuki, also one of the world’s leading environmental activists, shook anyone paying attention to climate.

The basic science behind global warming has been understood since the late 1800s. Exxon’s own scientists understood at least since the 1970s that their products were changing the chemistry of the atmosphere, threatening to dangerously overheat the planet, and stating that humans had “a time window of five to 10 years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”

Shell knew too. In the 1980s its scientists confirmed that “global changes in air temperature would … ‘drastically change the way people live and work.’ All told, Shell concluded, ‘the changes may be the greatest in recorded history,’” as the Guardian recounts.

It would take decades more before any tangible federal legislation advanced to tackle the problem. President Obama got behind a proposal known as “cap and trade,” which—for better or worse—aimed to use market mechanisms to wean the nation off fossil fuels. San Antonio’s Valero Energy helped beat that effort back, warning customers in pumpside placards of the cents it would add to the price per gallon. Another 13 years would transpire before President Biden advanced a federal vision of energy transition that sent an unprecedented hundreds of billions of dollars to the states to reduce energy demand and facilitate the transition to renewable energy and battery systems.

Now, with MAGA’s return to power, we’re facing what Suzuki experienced like a “dagger in my heart.”

Trump’s decision to prize the perceived needs of fossil fuel companies while demonizing and attacking lower-carbon alternatives—power sources credited with keeping the power on in Texas since its near grid collapse of 2021—has “flatlined” US climate pollution rates with an expected 7B tons of additional climate emissions over the coming five years, according to Carbon Brief. (Before Trump’s election, the same publication estimated he would inject 4B tons of emissions into the atmosphere and thereby push beyond reach international climate goals of limiting global warming beneath 1.5 degrees over 1990 levels.)

For those who had been warning for years of a “last call” on climate action, this policy lurch backwards within the largest economy on Earth dashed all hopes that we might avert the so-called “worst manifestations” of industrially driven climate change.

“Trump’s win was the triumph of capitalism and neoliberalism, and he’s going to wreak havoc,” Suzuki told Davis Legree at Canada’s iPolitics in July 2025. “For me, what we’ve got to do now is hunker down. The units of survival are going to be local communities, so I’m urging local communities to get together.”

While not surrendering the struggle to move beyond fossil fuels, Suzuki stressed that local adaptation efforts are now imperative, while citing the efforts of the Finnish government on emergency preparedness in particular.

“Governments will not be able to respond on the scale or speed that is needed for these emergencies, so Finland is telling their citizens that they’re going to be at the front line of whatever hits and better be sure you’re ready to meet it. … You’re going to have to inventory your community, and that’s really what we have to start doing now.”

In San Antonio, the Climate Ready Neighborhoods and another effort rooted on the South Side have been seeking to do just that. Both were defunded by San Antonio’s City Council under the new city budget, with funds from a recently established resilience fund diverted to pay local firefighters. However, the city’s Chief Sustainability Officer Doug Melnick said a week before the budget vote that these programs would continue through 2026 by drawing forward dollars from the previous year’s budget. After that, their future is uncertain.

“2025 dollars will be setting the stage for implementation through 2026,” Melnick told Council members at a budget hearing. “I think it will be a different conversation as we go forward into the future. But this year’s work … will continue.”

Withering FEMA

In South San Antonio, Fuerza Unida’s small office and clothing alterations shop is abuzz with climate activity. Maps on the wall denote zones to be planted with mid-sized trees, jobs for arborists are being advertised, and the last homes being gifted heat pump cooling systems are being checked off.

Although the role of fossil fuels tends to grab most of the attention in discussions of global warming, climate change is also a product of deforestation. Both are the targets of neighborhood-based climate work on San Antonio’s Southside, undertaken beneath the banner of the South San Heat Resiliency Project (PDF).

Here demographics dramatically shift from those of Beacon Hill. The per capita income drops significantly as the number of immigrant families rises. Homes here are mostly not yet buffeted by the waves of would-be gentrifiers prowling other quarters of the city. Instead they bake within the dust, heat, and fumes of ubiquitous scrap metal recyclers and auto salvage yards. Southside residents also persist on the edge of the former Kelly Air Force Base and its toxic legacy that many blame for high levels of cancer in the area, which claimed the lives of beloved community organizers Lupe and Robert Alvarado in recent years.

Led by a team of Latina workers who began collectively working to support local women after aLevi’s factory closedin 1990, Fuerza Unida (“united strength”) has served residents for more than 30 years. The city was never a partner here, said Nancy Parrilla, the organization’s chief financial officer. “[Fuerza] never saw them as an ally before,” she said.

A couple years ago, however, the organization was approached by the Office of Sustainability about a climate resilience project.

“The City came knocking on our door. We didn’t go looking for them,” Parrilla said. “They came and were like, ‘We need a stakeholder in the neighborhood’ because everything they had been trying had been unsuccessful.”

Community meetings followed that sparked interest among local homeowners, where temperatures in some homes—suffering from lack of insulation, cooling, and elevated street temperatures due in part to a lack of green space—routinely topped 100F degrees during peak summer. The effort began building trust and attracted the attention of Austin-based Adaptation International, which bills itself as a woman-owned business helping bridge the gap between climate science and community efforts.

Adaptation International’s work is intended to “identify climate vulnerabilities and develop sustainable cooling strategies that enhance resilience,” the organization writes on their website. “By integrating climate science with local knowledge, the project advances environmental justice and empowers communities to shape solutions through storytelling, research, and collaborative planning.”

This summer the effort was awarded an additional $96,000 from the nation-wide Climate Smart Communities Initiative.

While the project clearly emphasizes climate adaptation, it also promotes the language of “workforce development.” While similar projects have suffered elsewhere under Trump’s targeting of projects rooted in equity concerns, the inclusion of more favorable buzzwords has had no impact on the actual work, said Celine Rendon, a climate resilience specialist with Adaptation International. “That’s not really changing the way that we’re engaging with community members that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis,” said Rendon. “It’s not really stopping the work.”

While the San Antonio Office of Sustainability dodged layoffs this budget, colleagues working elsewhere, including for the City of Denver, didn’t fare as well.

Data released earlier this month by the U.S. Government Accountability Office suggests these sorts of community efforts will be more valuable than ever—especially as FEMA cuts back its operations.

Workforce reductions and loss of training capacity have severely compromised FEMA’s reliability as a partner in disaster response, GAO researchers write. FEMA’s slow mobilization to the July Hill Country floods that claimed more than 130 lives in a few days is well documented. But the GAO makes another fact clear: When the rain began to fall over Kerr County, only 15 percent of FEMA’s incident management workforce were available. That number was a mere 12 percent at the start of the year’s hurricane season, according to the GAO. It’s bad news as the country today moves through peak hurricane season.

As the GAO report concludes:

“Should the U.S. experience a similarly catastrophic peak hurricane season in September and October 2025, as it did in 2024, meeting response needs could be a major challenge. Moreover, no concrete changes to disaster response roles have yet been made. FEMA and other federal agencies spreading a reduced number of staff across the same or higher number of disasters nationwide could reduce effectiveness of federal disaster response for upcoming disasters.”

The government shutdown is not expected to further erode FEMA’s response capacity(such as it is). However: “If the agency required additional funds to respond to serious damage caused by a natural disaster during the shutdown,” Simmone Shah writes at Time, “they would be unable to appeal to Congress.”

Fuerza’s leadership say they have experienced the benefit of partnering with the City and Adaptation International. It’s allowed them to install cooling systems to homes in need. But it also kindled hope among their neighbors and helped them to imagine alternative positive visions of the future, the absence of which had been among the project’s “biggest challenges,” Parrilla said.

“I think the saddest part is that they don’t know that [the wealth] you see on the Northside, it’s because that’s what the city has invested in. And they can do the same over here. They have just chosen not to.”

But the program is being intentionally built to advance with or without a governmental partner. Meetings with fellow community-based organizations have increased. Skills and lessons learned are being shared.

Parrilla said the driving goal behind the heat pump installation project, of advocating for better controls over local sources of pollution, of an ambitious urban forestry project now offering neighborhood youth $18 per hour, is for the community to learn how to be sustainable on their own.

“We cannot depend on outside sources to keep our spaces green, to give us a safe environment,” she said. “When we leave it in their hands, we’re the ones who suffer.”

Adelante Juntos

Since the surge in heat deaths more than 20 years ago, the people of Paris, France, have put a tremendous amount of energy into responding to accelerating heat waves. A report from 2019 documents efforts to pull up pavement, plant thousands of trees, and cultivate networks of interlinked cool “islands” to help residents cool off.

The intentional greening of Medellín, Colombia was also recently cited as inspiration by a Bexar County commissioner, as another example of concerted city-scale efforts that have brought down temperatures for their residents in a time of overheating.

While San Antonio is putting more money than ever into “cool pavement” efforts this year, a practice with debatable results, there is also a burgeoning movement to green the city that is driven largely from the grassroots. Fuerza’s project is just one part of that. What participants in both city programs said they found most useful has been the power of deepening relationships with neighbors.

Some also referenced the skills of flexibility and creativity—about how to be prepared for rapidly changing circumstances—including positive ones, such as when new potential partnerships present themselves.

“There’s still funding and resources available,” said Rendon, “you just have to be strategic and make sure you are ready when it comes.”

In the world of adaptation under stress, partnerships deliver in different ways, added the Impact Guild’s Woolsey. Sometimes it is shared knowledge to help neighborhoods organize themselves, efforts that hinge exclusively on volunteer labor. Sometimes it is a check (whether from a public or private source) that facilitates purchases families couldn’t afford otherwise. Sometimes it is changing policies and large-scale infrastructure investments, which typically require massive public pressure on elected leaders.

“Just the way any ecosystem has a lot of biodiversity, our resources—the more diversity we have in them—the better off we are,” Woolsey said.

In recent weeks, Woolsey has been operating outside of San Antonio, helping families collect the things they need to return to homes abandoned after July’s Hill Country floods. There too, she has found that some of the most valuable assistance is low cost, she said. It is more about organizing and time. “There’s a lot that we’re sourcing that’s in-kind. We need dollars to close the gaps to get people into their homes,” she said. “But also it’s the shared meals, it’s the volunteer hours, it’s people giving the furniture.

“The bigger question we are all holding is like: How can [resilience] be the manpower showing up for one another? … How can it be physical sharing of resources that are more this barter/exchange kind of thing? Then when can it be the dollars, as strategically as possible, to close the gaps where those other things can’t do it?”

Far from the image of social breakdown so often depicted in Hollywood blockbusters, every disaster survived deepens a community’s knowledge of itself. It reinforces and strengthens the relationships people can actually rely upon. Each disaster is also “shared seeds,” Woolsey said. And the lessons that are reaped from those seeds often point toward something new, those interviewed told Deceleration. Lessons that point to deepening and rooting further in place, in belonging, in neighborhood—as the old world, oftentimes literally, washes away.",https://texassignal.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/utility-disconnections-campaign-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 15:09:28.189366

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration's termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program's termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.""

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,"" formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump's assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.

As the Trump Administration recklessly slashes over$26 million from clean energy projects in his district and nearly $467 million in critical investments across New York State, Lawler is nowhere to be found.

Lawler’s silence is ironic considering that just last week, he penned an op-ed touting his passion for an “all-of-the-above energy approach” that “build[s] on existing clean energy investments.”

Late last year, Lawler also visited the same IBM research center that was just hit with millions in funding cuts – boasting at the time that he wouldn’t “stop working in Congress to empower our innovators.”

But now that Donald Trump has decided to gut these clean energy projects, it’s crickets from Mike Lawler.

REMINDER: After caving to Trump and voting for the Big, Ugly Bill earlier this year, Lawler admitted he was jeopardizing millions in investments and good-paying jobs in his district and begged Senate Republican leaders to “mitigate” the negative impacts of his own vote.

Politico New York: The good, the bad, the ugly: Federal cuts come to New York.

New York is getting whipsawed by the Trump administration’s aggressive cost-cutting strategy.

About $467 million is being cut from clean energy projects in New York as part of the Trump administration’s Wednesday announcement it would slice about $8 billion in Department of Energy grants in mostly blue states, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s calculations.

Hudson Valley Republican Rep. Mike Lawler is seeing over $26 million cut from his district, with a $19.7 million “methane characterization” project at IBM’s research headquarters being the biggest casualty.

The barrage of energy grant cuts comes at an awkward time for Lawler — he just published an op-ed Monday about his passion for an “all-of-the-above energy approach.”

Last year, he toured the same IBM research center that was ravaged by the recent cuts. “I won’t stop working in Congress to empower our innovators and unleash our potential so that America remains the unequivocal world leader in the 21st Century and beyond,” he said at the time.

Just months after its founding in January, the company went public last week, sparking strong investor demand despite its early-stage status and lack of revenue. Shares surged 55% on their first trading day to close at about $32.50 per share, well above their $21 initial offering price, although they have since declined to levels of about $28 per share currently. Fermi’s market reception highlights surging investor appetite for artificial intelligence infrastructure plays. For a company with no revenue and no operating history, the frenzy around its debut raises the question: what exactly are investors betting on?

Reinventing Data Center Power for the AI Era

At the core of Fermi’s strategy is Project Matador, also called the “HyperGrid,” a hyperscale data center campus in the Texas Panhandle. The company’s model revolves around leasing massive data center space and integrated computing infrastructure to customers such as AI developers, cloud providers, and semiconductor firms. Unlike traditional data centers that depend heavily on strained public utility grids, Fermi plans to embed its own private power supply.

It will operate a mix of natural gas plants, nuclear reactors, solar farms, and battery storage—creating a grid-independent, highly reliable system designed for energy-hungry AI workloads. Fermi brands this approach as HyperRedundant, promising uninterrupted delivery even if the public grid falters. Project Matador is expected to generate 1.1 gigawatts of power by 2026, with a long-term goal of 11 gigawatts and 18 million square feet of space by 2038. For context, CEO Toby Neugebauer claims the site could eventually produce twice as much electricity as all the power plants currently serving New York City.

This ambition reflects the massive energy demands of AI. Training a single large model can consume as much electricity as hundreds of U.S. households annually. As models grow larger and are retrained more often, data center infrastructure must scale dramatically and remain highly reliable, since even brief power interruptions can disrupt AI research and cloud services.

Considerable Risks

That said, the outlook comes with considerable risks. Fermi has no operating history and remains pre-revenue, with construction still in progress. Its plans require massive capital – an estimated $50 to $70 billion over time, including $30 to $35 billion just for nuclear capacity. Financing, construction, and regulatory hurdles remain considerable and a project of this scale could face supply chain bottlenecks, labor shortages, volatile debt markets, and lengthy approval processes for nuclear reactors. Besides this, customer risk adds another layer of uncertainty.

So far, Fermi has signed only nonbinding letters of intent, with no firm tenant contracts. Without binding agreements, demand and cash flows remain uncertain. Finally, demand risk lingers – data center leasing and power revenues depend on broader economic conditions and the pace of AI adoption. While demand appears very strong right now, a slowdown in the pace of advancement of AI tech could hurt long-term growth rates.

In summary, Fermi represents a highly speculative investment opportunity. Valued at approximately $17 billion, the company aims to address AI’s enormous power demands via one of the most ambitious private energy projects ever conceived. That said, the recent stock surge reflects strong investor enthusiasm for the potential of its vision, rather than demonstrated operational success. The company benefits from the credibility and strategic advantages offered by its founders, including former U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, which may support regulatory, financing, and policy efforts. This makes the stock a very high risk, high reward type play at the moment.

The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that a ""thorough, individualized financial review"" determined the projects ""did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment.""

The DOE's review followed a May 2025 Secretarial Memorandum that established a new policy for evaluating financial awards, particularly targeting those ""rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration."" The DOE specified that 26% of the terminated financial awards, valued at over $3.1 billion, were issued between Election Day and Inauguration Day.

The terminated awards originated from several DOE offices like Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), and Fossil Energy (FE).

The decision has ignited significant political controversy, with critics accusing the Trump administration of using the cuts as a political weapon against ""blue states."" White House budget director Russell Vought was explicit about the political nature of the cuts, posting on social media about ""Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left's climate agenda is being cancelled,"" and listing the 16 states targeted, all of which voted for the Democratic candidate in the 2024 presidential election.

Among the highest-profile cancellations is the funding for California’s Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES), a major hydrogen hub project that had been projected to support up to 220,000 jobs. U.S. Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Adam Schiff, both from California, called the cancellation ""shortsighted,"" warning it would undermine economic opportunities.

Other affected projects include a $500 million award for the Lebec Net-Zero project in California, aimed at producing carbon-neutral cement, and an $87 million grant to Sublime Systems for low-carbon cement manufacturing in Massachusetts, which was expected to create between 70 and 90 jobs. The cuts also hit major grid and transmission initiatives, including a proposed $464 million in funding for transmission studies across seven Midwest states.

Critics argue the cancellations will result in the loss of tens of thousands of potential jobs, raise consumer electricity costs, and undercut U.S. competitiveness in critical clean technologies, despite the administration's stated goal of boosting American manufacturing.

Last Tuesday, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) announced it received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate as a national securities exchange.

The SEC go-ahead means that the stock exchange is gearing up to begin trading in early 2026, according to a news release, joining the sprawling avenues of big-name Fortune 500 companies in Dallas.

The nickname “Y’all Street” — a southern riff on Wall Street — came about in early 2024, after Dallas was named the No. 2 city in the country for financial jobs, second only to New York, according to Bloomberg. Financial big names are flocking to the city: In 2020, Charles Schwab moved its headquarters from San Francisco to Dallas; Deloitte plans to open an expanded new campus there this year; and a $500 million Goldman Sachs facility is in the works.

The growth in financial-sector jobs in the Lone-Star state since 2019 was more than six times the growth in New York and the nation as a whole, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2024.

So is it time to take Y’all Street seriously? Here’s where it stands.

Can Dallas become a financial rival to New York?

Texas Stock Exchange’s founder and CEO James Lee said in a press release last week that the exchange is ready to lead Texas’ pro-business environment.

“Real competition for corporate listings in the United States has finally arrived,” Lee said.

Major national stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange appear to see TXSE as a potential rival: NYSE announced it would move its Chicago branch to Dallas two weeks after the Texas exchange filed for SEC approval in January, the Dallas Morning News reported. Nasdaq also announced in March that it would be opening a new headquarters in Dallas.

And the TXSE’s financial backing is nothing to scoff at: the exchange boasts $161 million in funds from Blackrock, Charles Schwab, and other banking giants, according to the Dallas Morning News.

Republican leaders push back at “woke” stock markets

Republican politicians have also celebrated the promising development of the Dallas-based exchange — and are using it against Democratic rivals.

President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post Saturday about the New York attorney general Letitia James, said that her policies would make few companies want to use the New York Stock Exchange, or the NASDAQ.

“The new Texas Exchange will be taking ALL of this business away,” Trump wrote.

Texas Republicans such as Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz shared similar sentiments about the new stock exchange’s potential as an alternative to the New York exchanges.

“If you don’t want a woke stock exchange, and just want an avenue to raise capital, Texas will be the place to do it,” Cruz wrote on X Wednesday. Cruz accompanied the post with a clip of himself on the Fox Business show suggesting that New York politicians, such as mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, were driving business leaders from their state to Texas.

Building momentum: What’s next for TXSE

Texans will have to wait until the end of 2026 to see if “Y’all Street” can truly rival Wall Street. TXSE indicated it will go live at the beginning of the year, with corporate listings in the second half.

The success of the exchange — which will be fully digital — hinges on companies deciding to list themselves, as well as the health of the state’s economy, Sriram Villupuram, a UT Arlington associate professor of finance, told the Texas Tribune. He said that interested investors will be watching closely to see how quickly TXSE can attract its first 50 to 100 companies.

“It gives those that are thinking about listing an idea about what it takes to get on the exchange, and it could snowball from there,” Villupuram said to the Tribune.

Along with the increase in companies moving their headquarters to Texas, the stock exchange could mean something big for Texans.

“What it means for local people, of course, is job creation,” Kirti Sinha, a University of Texas at Dallas assistant professor of accounting, told the Dallas Morning News.",https://thebarbedwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-485990710-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 16:03:48.300195

⛔ SHUTDOWN

If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again and hope for a different outcome:

The Senate is back in town today with another chance teed up to end the government shutdown. Government funding votes are lined up for this afternoon, but no one expects a different outcome from last week.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told House lawmakers to stay home for another week, knowing the stalemate will continue. Though, Johnson also told House Republicans they would get a 48-hour heads-up if they need to return earlier. “The House did its job,” Johnson argued on Sunday because it passed a government extension, directing the blame to the Senate.

A sign this could drag out for quite some time: President Trump is staying out of it. However, The Hill’s Alexander Bolton reports that “Trump may come under more pressure to negotiate with Democrats if the shutdown drags beyond Oct. 15, the date when members of the military will miss their first paycheck due to the fight in Washington.”

How does this ultimately end?: The most-likely way this ends is if Republicans can convince five more Senate Democrats to vote to reopen the government. The Hill’s Al Weaver reports there are five Democratic senators whom Republicans are hoping to flip: Sens. Gary Peters (Mich.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.) and Jon Ossoff (Ga.) and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.).

Portland and Chicago are fighting back:

President Trump’s efforts to send hundreds of National Guard troops to Portland, Ore., against state and local officials’ wishes hit a major snag late last night.

Let me start from the beginning: U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term,blocked the Trump administration on Saturday from sending federal troops to Portland.

The Trump team then tried to send out-of-state troops from Texas to Portland. Immergut then blocked the administration for the second time in two days — and this time, she strongly rebuked Trump as being “in direct contravention” of her order.

Why does Trump think federal troops are necessary?: To quell the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests.

Chicago is also fighting back today: This morning, Illinois and Chicago filed a lawsuit to block Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. Read more

💡 For context on the National Guard: “National Guard forces — largely part-time troops who typically work in civilian jobs full time — are normally under the control of the states, with governors serving as commanders. The troops are often deployed to help after natural disasters or when civil disorder overwhelms local law enforcement authorities, but in some circumstances federal law allows the president to take control of them.” (NYT)

Industries operating without valid permits or violating their permit conditions risk more than financial penalties.
Oteng’s message to AGI members suggests the EPA recognizes that many industries treat permit renewals casually, allowing documents to lapse while continuing operations.
As carbon markets develop, industries will face additional reporting and compliance obligations beyond traditional environmental permits.
Industry association gatherings reach concentrated audiences of decision makers who control permit compliance at their respective facilities.","Industries that fail to renew environmental permits on time will pay three times the standard fee as penalties, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has warned, signaling stricter enforcement of compliance requirements under Ghana’s new environmental legislation.

Samuel Oteng, Greater Accra East (Tema) Regional Director of the EPA, delivered the stern message during the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI) Tema Regional annual meeting held recently. His warning comes as the EPA exercises expanded regulatory powers under the Environmental Protection Act 2025 (Act 1124), which replaced the 1994 legislation in January.

Speaking at the meeting themed “Creating a Conducive Business Environment for Industrial Competitiveness: 24 Hour in Perspective,” Oteng emphasized that permit conditions aren’t optional suggestions but legal obligations carrying real consequences. He revealed that violations of permit conditions and failure to renew before expiration attract sanctions, indicating the agency’s determination to enforce compliance.

The EPA director specified that industries must begin the renewal process at least three months before their permits expire, with late renewals attracting penalties equivalent to three times the applicable fee. This timeline requirement aims to prevent last minute rushes and ensure continuous regulatory oversight of industrial operations.

The warning reflects broader changes in Ghana’s environmental regulation landscape. Act 1124 established the EPA with significantly expanded powers compared to its predecessor legislation, giving the agency more tools to monitor and enforce environmental compliance across industries.

Industries operating without valid permits or violating their permit conditions risk more than financial penalties. The EPA can suspend operations, revoke permits entirely, or pursue legal action depending on the severity and nature of violations. These enforcement mechanisms existed under previous law but gain sharper teeth under the 2025 Act.

Oteng’s message to AGI members suggests the EPA recognizes that many industries treat permit renewals casually, allowing documents to lapse while continuing operations. This practice creates regulatory blind spots where industrial activities proceed without current environmental oversight or updated conditions reflecting operational changes.

The three month advance renewal requirement addresses this problem by building buffer time into the system. Industries that begin renewals three months early can resolve documentation issues, address any concerns the EPA raises, and ensure continuity without gaps in permit coverage.

However, the triple fee penalty for late renewals raises questions about proportionality and business impact. For industries operating on tight margins, especially smaller manufacturers, a threefold increase in permit costs could represent significant unplanned expenses that affect operational budgets.

The EPA appears willing to accept this criticism in exchange for stronger compliance incentives. Previous penalty structures apparently failed to motivate timely renewals, leading officials to conclude that financial consequences needed escalation to change behavior patterns across the industrial sector.

Environmental permits serve multiple purposes beyond bureaucratic box checking. They establish baseline expectations for emissions, waste management, resource use, and pollution control specific to each facility. Regular renewals allow the EPA to update these conditions based on technological advances, environmental science developments, or changes in community conditions surrounding industrial sites.

When permits lapse, the EPA loses this regulatory touchpoint. Industries continue operating under outdated conditions that may no longer reflect best practices or adequately protect surrounding communities and ecosystems. The renewal process isn’t just administrative paperwork but rather ongoing environmental management.

Act 1124’s expanded scope includes new regulatory frameworks that didn’t exist under the 1994 legislation. The law establishes the Ghana Carbon Registry to promote carbon credit trading and climate action, implements strict pesticide controls, tightens hazardous waste regulations, and restricts electronic waste imports. These additions increase complexity for industries navigating compliance requirements.

The legislation also creates the Carbon Markets Office hosted by the EPA, giving the agency responsibilities in emerging climate finance mechanisms. As carbon markets develop, industries will face additional reporting and compliance obligations beyond traditional environmental permits.

AGI members attending the Tema meeting heard Oteng’s warnings within broader discussions about creating conducive business environments under the government’s 24 hour economy policy. This context highlights tensions between environmental regulation and industrial competitiveness that define much of Ghana’s development debate.

Industries argue that excessive regulation or enforcement burdens competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors regionally or internationally. Environmental advocates counter that proper regulation protects public health and ecosystems while establishing level playing fields where all competitors meet minimum standards.

The EPA’s stricter enforcement approach tests whether Ghana can balance these competing interests effectively. Too aggressive enforcement risks driving industries toward non compliance or relocation. Too lenient enforcement allows environmental degradation that undermines long term sustainability and public health.

Oteng’s public warning serves notice that the EPA intends to use its expanded powers under Act 1124. Whether industries respond with improved compliance or pushback against perceived regulatory overreach will shape how effectively Ghana implements its new environmental protection framework.

The AGI meeting provided an appropriate forum for delivering this message. Industry association gatherings reach concentrated audiences of decision makers who control permit compliance at their respective facilities. Oteng’s appearance signals the EPA views industry engagement as important even while warning of tougher enforcement.

Seth Twum Akwaboah, AGI Chief Executive Officer, has emphasized that industries need stable, predictable regulatory environments to plan investments and operations effectively. The EPA’s clear communication about permit requirements and penalties arguably serves this goal by eliminating ambiguity about expectations and consequences.

How industries actually respond to the triple fee penalty threat remains to be seen. Some will likely prioritize compliance to avoid financial exposure. Others might gamble that enforcement won’t match rhetoric, particularly if they perceive the EPA lacks resources for comprehensive monitoring across all permitted facilities.

The EPA’s enforcement capacity represents a real constraint on how effectively warnings translate into changed behavior. Ghana’s regulatory agencies historically struggle with limited budgets, insufficient personnel, and equipment shortages that hamper their ability to monitor compliance comprehensively across regulated sectors.

Act 1124’s expanded mandate increases these capacity challenges. The EPA must now oversee carbon markets, strengthen pesticide control, manage hazardous waste more strictly, and enforce electronic waste restrictions while continuing traditional environmental permitting and monitoring responsibilities. Whether the agency receives corresponding budget and staff increases will determine implementation effectiveness.",https://b843437.smushcdn.com/843437/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/logo-newsghana.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1,N,,2025-10-06 16:03:32.481880

SMUD has received $8 million in reimbursements for work already completed, but the loss of grant funding disrupts the planning and execution of the project.
“This is a reckless and vindictive decision that punishes Sacramento County families and slows our progress toward a cleaner, more reliable energy future,” said Representative Bera.
### NOTE: This release is amended to reflect that the Connected Clean PowerCity® project will continue despite the loss of federal grant funding.","Sacramento, CA — Today, Representative Ami Bera, M.D. (CA-06) condemned the Trump Administration’s revocation of a $50 million federal grant awarded to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) for its Connected Clean PowerCity® project, a major initiative to modernize the electric grid and help the Sacramento region reach zero carbon emissions by 2030.

Funded through the Department of Energy’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) program in 2023, the grant aimed to reduce outages, empower families to manage their energy use, and build a cleaner, more reliable energy system. SMUD has received $8 million in reimbursements for work already completed, but the loss of grant funding disrupts the planning and execution of the project.

“This is a reckless and vindictive decision that punishes Sacramento County families and slows our progress toward a cleaner, more reliable energy future,” said Representative Bera. “This funding was secured through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to modernize our grid, lower energy costs, and strengthen our resilience in the face of climate change. Pulling the plug now abandons a bipartisan commitment to smart energy policy and puts local jobs, innovation, and community preparedness at risk.”

The cancellation is part of a broader effort by the Trump Administration to withhold and cancel clean energy funding from blue states. On October 1, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announced the termination of $8 billion in energy projects, specifically targeting 16 Democratic-led states. That same evening, the Department of Energy confirmed it had canceled 321 previously awarded grants. These terminations will increase energy costs, eliminate jobs, and weaken grid reliability across the country.

With the grant now canceled, Sacramento County will lose out on major investments that would have:

Installed 200,000 next-generation smart meters across the region;

Deployed advanced grid and outage management systems to reduce blackouts during extreme weather;

Added 22,500 intelligent load control devices to help manage demand during emergencies;

Expanded fiber optic infrastructure to improve communication and data reliability;

Partnered with the Wilton Rancheria Tribe of Miwok Indians to support solar, storage, and electrification on Tribal lands.

(ITC), the largest independent electricity transmission company in the U.S.","The nation’s energy grid is transforming at a pace no industry has seen in decades, and it’s fueling a growing career path. For ITC Holdings Corp., the nation’s largest independent electricity transmission company headquartered in Novi, Michigan, careers in energy transmission aren’t just about powering communities — they’re about empowering people. Crain’s Content Studio sat down with Charles Marshall, President of ITC Michigan, and Andrea Gurcsik, ITC’s Director of Total Talent, about the growth in career paths.

Q: Energy is essential to everyone’s daily life. What makes transmission such a reliable and steady part of that picture?

Gurcsik: Transmission infrastructure is really foundational to the energy system. Unlike other sectors that rise and fall, our work is less impacted by market fluctuations. As demand for energy rises, we continue to expand.

Marshall: Stability also comes from the long-term visibility we have into projects. Many take seven to 10 years to develop, so we know the work will be there. ITC has been a growth company for the past 22 years, and we anticipate that to continue for the foreseeable future. Growth brings stability — and frankly, it’s more fun to work for a growing company.

Q: What excites you most about this moment in the industry?

Marshall: The pace of change. Our grid has never been fueled with the resource mix we have today. Just four years ago, solar barely registered; now it’s 10 to 15 percent of the daily portfolio. That kind of shift brings new challenges and new opportunities.

Gurcsik: Employees feel pride and purpose in powering communities. Our engagement scores—world-class according to Gallup—show how strongly people connect to our mission. And innovation is part of our DNA. We have an innovation charter that says ideas can come from anyone, anywhere. Whether it’s a small process change or transforming the grid, being open to innovation and change is part of who we are.

Q: You’ve both emphasized culture. What makes ITC’s workplace different?

Marshall: When people come here, the first thing they often say is, “this feels different.” There’s genuine satisfaction and fulfillment in working at ITC. That culture of belonging is what sustains us. Years later, that feeling remains and is why so many of our employees stay here for the majority of their career.

Gurcsik: Every company says they put people first, but we have the results to prove it — top engagement scores, very low turnover, and leadership that stays close to employees. From welcome lunches to open coffee chats, employees feel supported and heard at all levels of the company.

Q: Charles, you’ve spent your entire career at ITC. What has that meant for you?

Marshall: I’ve worked at ITC throughout my entire career, but I’ve had the chance to reinvent my career multiple times. I’ve moved through engineering, regulatory affairs, stakeholder relations and executive leadership. That’s possible because ITC values curiosity and empowers people to thrive. If you’re willing to learn and grow, doors open.

Q: What career opportunities exist for those looking to join ITC?

Marshall: We’re a technical organization, so many of our employees are engineers. But we also need people with communication skills, perseverance, and the ability to build relationships.

Gurcsik: Beyond engineering, we’re hiring in finance, IT, HR, project management and more. If someone brings transferable skills, curiosity, and collaboration, we can find a place for them.

Q: How are you preparing the next generation of talent?

Gurcsik: Most people get into the energy industry because a family member is in this field. So, exposure is critical. That’s why we run a robust internship program and partner with local schools, such as the Henry Ford Academy. Students get to see how transmission keeps the grid stable—and how meaningful their contributions could be.

Marshall: Showing students opportunities in the energy industry before they set their course in college helps them see this field as a viable and exciting career path.

Q: What advice would you give someone considering a career in energy?

Marshall: We need strategic minds with ambition, creativity and adaptability. Those qualities matter as much as technical expertise.

Gurcsik: Stay curious. Be willing to embrace change and ask why. Those traits make a lasting impact—and they make you a great fit at ITC.

It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.
Taking public comments We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel.","We are embarking on a new statewide study to evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts surrounding the production and distribution of sustainable aviation fuel—including measures to avoid, reduce and mitigate impacts. Our broad statewide studies, also called programmatic environmental impact statements, are required by state law. In June, we released three studies evaluating utility-scale onshore wind and solar energy projects, and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.

As part of the scoping process, we are seeking input from interested parties, including the public, regarding the range of actions and impacts we should study.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

To help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable aviation fuel is blended with conventional petroleum-based jet fuel to power aircraft engines. The fuel is derived from low-carbon sources such as biomass, organic waste and clean synthetic feedstocks using a wide range of production methods and technologies.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a “drop in” fuel—meaning it can be distributed using Washington’s existing fuel infrastructure and used to power aircraft engines without modifications.

Scoping our study to be impactful and efficient

While these fuel projects are designed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and benefit the state economy, they can still have negative environmental impacts that need to be considered—including ways to avoid, reduce, or mitigate those impacts.

Since sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from a variety of renewable resources and transported using various distribution methods, our study will not be able to evaluate every possible option. This means your input is critical. It will help us determine where to focus our analysis to develop the most useful, timely report that will support the future development of sustainable aviation fuel projects in Washington.

The study will evaluate the potential impacts on natural and built resources at a broad level. Developers and agencies can use the findings to help avoid and reduce impacts through siting and design choices. It is important to note that future sustainable aviation fuel projects will need individual environmental review under SEPA using project- and site-specific information.

Taking public comments

We will be taking public comments regarding the range—or “scope”—of potential actions and impacts we should study surrounding sustainable aviation fuel. In October, we will hold two virtual meetings where interested parties can make public comments:

Tuesday, Oct. 21 virtual meeting starting at 1 p.m.

What's driving the numbers?",David Brown,,,,,https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/texas-energy-consumption-drivers-population-ai-data-centers/,"This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity: Texas Standard: So the Department of Energy says Texas used twice as much energy as California and three times as much as Florida in 2023.
And so that accounts for about a half of Texas energy demand, where in California and Florida, it’s a much smaller sliver.
Going forward, ERCOT, who operates the state’s power grid, they’re predicting energy demand in Texas could double by 2030.
And the largest percentage of that projected energy demand growth comes from data centers.
It’s not just hinging on these data centers, it’s going to be coming regardless, given the variety of demand pulls going on here.","Over the past 10 years or so, one of the most durable narratives in the current chapter of the Texas story is the explosive population growth we’ve been tracking – a level of growth that’s put added strain on Texas’s infrastructure, that’s to be sure.

That’s especially true for our electric grid, which was set up to operate mostly separate from the national grid. That’s created some issues to be sure, particularly during weather conditions causing demand to outstrip supply.

But there’s another issue related to Texas’ economic growth that promises to put much further strain on the state’s electrical resources.

Matt Smith, head energy analyst at Kpler, joined the Standard for a closer look. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: So the Department of Energy says Texas used twice as much energy as California and three times as much as Florida in 2023. That’s astonishing. What seems to be driving this outperformance?

Matt Smith: The first thing is the reason they’re focusing on these three states is because they are the three largest energy-consuming states in the U.S. It’s also important to bear in mind that this is total energy, so it includes transportation as well as electricity generation.

But as you were mentioning, the explosion in the population in Texas has happened over the last few years, but it’s actually outperformance from the industrial demand side of things that is driving demand higher. And so that accounts for about a half of Texas energy demand, where in California and Florida, it’s a much smaller sliver. They’re much more focused on commercial and residential demand, as well as transportation.

Now, just to bear in mind, when we talk about industrial demand, that’s Texas’s energy-intensive chemical manufacturing, oil and natural gas extraction, production, petroleum refining, agricultural industry. So it’s all of the behemoth of industry, right?

Well, yeah, but I thought that you were going to be pointing to something else and that’s the explosive growth that Texas has seen in artificial intelligence and these data centers which have sprouted up all over the state. In fact, it seems like the state is going out of its way to position itself as the capital for AI, or at least the backbone that supports that AI infrastructure, these huge data centers.

Yeah, and so there’s a number of areas across the U.S. that can do this. Texas, Louisiana, Virginia, etc, are kind of obvious ones to locate these data centers, just because of the natural resources available, right? So you have the Permian Basin, etc. So you have access to natural gas, to other resources. And so that’s part of it.

If we kind of take a step back, though, industrial demand in the past [has] been from these traditional sources, right. Going forward, ERCOT, who operates the state’s power grid, they’re predicting energy demand in Texas could double by 2030. And the largest percentage of that projected energy demand growth comes from data centers.

And so, yes, it’s going to be a current and future story as opposed to have been something in the past.

Well, what about the power generation mix for Texas? Is anything changing on that front?

And you know, as you look at these three states, are there any comparisons? Somebody doing it better than than we are right now? And of course, there’s been a lot of focus on the fact that we are not fully integrated with the national grid.

Well, renewables is a big piece for California, right? They’re very environmentally friendly, they’ve been focused on solar so much. It’s the largest generator of solar power in the U.S. But then it’s followed by Texas and Florida, actually, in second and third place.

And then when you talk about wind power, Texas is a leading source for that – accounts for up to a third of total U.S. wind power generation.

But it’s just a story of of size, right? So when we talk about Texas, they consume more coal, natural gas and petroleum than any other state, right, but is also second only to California in terms of renewable energy consumption.

So yes, the mix is changing, but Texas is consuming all of these things – like half of the power generation is met by natural gas right now, about 22% by winds, and 8% by solar, 30% from wind and solar, 12% coal, 7% nuclear.

But Matt, if you step back further – and you were talking earlier about how we’re looking at double the demand by 2030, I think you you were saying… What are the long-term fixes?

It’s got to be everything, right? It’s gotta be a combination of those factors.

The challenge still remains with solar and wind is that it’s not baseload for power generation. So there is much more emphasis going forward here on the solar side of things, but it’s emphasis across these various different commodities I’ve mentioned to meet this need.

One thing to bear in mind, too, is that this demand growth is not just coming from data centers, but is coming from an ongoing increasing population in Texas. Cryptocurrency mining, hotter weather… There’s a number of factors, right?

It’s not just hinging on these data centers, it’s going to be coming regardless, given the variety of demand pulls going on here.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ercot-media-tour_41235273065_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 13:05:08.180171

By 2030, AI data centers could consume nearly 10% of all the electricity produced in the United States.

That’s more power than every home in California and New York combined.

And we’re feeling the strain already.

In Virginia — the epicenter of America’s data center industry — utilities are warning of multi-year delays to connect new projects. And in Georgia and Texas, regulators are scrambling to approve new natural gas plants just to keep up with the demand.

Even Wall Street is on high alert about this issue. Goldman Sachs estimates that power demand from U.S. data centers will more than double by 2030, driven almost entirely by AI.

Yet our power grid is already stretched to its limits.

And if the grid can’t keep up, then how will America power the next generation of AI?

We’ve talked about how nuclear energy might become the ultimate power source for AI…

And how fusion could provide unlimited energy in the future.

But what if I told you that the Earth’s crust holds a surprising energy source that could supply humanity’s energy needs for the next 170,000 years?

Enter Hydrogen

Clean energy proponents usually focus on solar panels or wind turbines.

But without steady backup, they can leave entire regions vulnerable when demand surges or the weather turns.

These energy sources also take up a lot of land, and communities often push back because they don’t want turbines or solar fields hurting their views or property values.

That’s why a different clean technology has started moving into the spotlight…

Hydrogen fuel cells.

Instead of burning fuel, a hydrogen cell splits molecules to generate electricity.

The only byproduct they create is water, and that can be reused for cooling in data centers.

To be clear, this isn’t a new technology. Hydrogen fuel cells have been a niche source of energy for decades now.

They’ve been used as backup power for telecom towers and in experimental buses in California. They’ve even been used in forklifts in Amazon’s warehouses.

But now, they’re being scaled to power some of the most energy-hungry machines on Earth.

The best example sits just outside Houston, where a startup called ECL has built what it calls the world’s first off-grid, hydrogen-powered AI campus.

This pilot facility runs one megawatt of fuel cell capacity. That’s enough to drive racks of NVIDIA’s latest GB300 and NVL72 systems, which are some of the most advanced AI chips on the market.

But ECL isn’t stopping there.

Its next phase calls for one gigawatt of capacity. That’s a thousand-fold jump.

For perspective, that’s the size of a full-scale nuclear plant. Except this facility will be modular, scalable and emission-free.

What makes ECL’s design unique is its efficiency. The data center runs at a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of just 1.1, compared to a typical facility’s 1.5 or higher.

And wastewater from the cells is captured and recycled to cool the data center. That means there’s no need for external water. And that’s going to be critical as droughts continue to hit the American West.

It also shows why hydrogen has recently started getting federal backing.

In late 2023, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced $7 billion in federal funding to launch seven regional clean hydrogen hubs to accelerate hydrogen production, storage and distribution.

These hubs were planned to span regions including the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Appalachia, and were chosen to anchor new hydrogen infrastructure across strategic corridors.

The DOE anticipated that, with the help of private companies, the total investment could rise to nearly $50 billion.

But that hit a snag last week when the DOE announced it would cancel over $7.5 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects.

Among those planned cancellations was funding for proposed hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest.

But if we can get past partisan politics and focus on what’s best for our country’s energy needs, new hydrogen hubs could be a huge boon for both AI and our environment.

Here’s My Take

Until now, hydrogen’s biggest problem has been finding a customer big enough to justify scaling up.

If AI data centers become that customer, the rollout of hydrogen as an energy source could accelerate much faster than expected.

But hydrogen isn’t a silver bullet that will instantly solve our energy needs. And there are still some major issues that need to be solved.

Most hydrogen today is made from natural gas, not renewable electricity. Transporting and storing it at scale is expensive. And hydrogen fuel cells must prove they can run for years without downtime. That’s a non-negotiable requirement for hyperscale computing.

But AI is forcing the U.S. to rethink how it generates and delivers power. And hydrogen is one of the few technologies that can deliver large amounts of electricity, on-site, without waiting decades for new transmission lines.

A recent report indicates that Earth’s crust could hold naturally occurring hydrogen reserves large enough to supply humanity’s energy needs for 170,000 years.

That would mean a cheaper, faster path to off-grid hydrogen data centers…

And a new energy race over who taps those underground reserves first.

But even though this report is promising, most experts see it as a long-shot scenario that’s still years from proving viable at scale.

I’m bullish on hydrogen as the “fuel of the future.”

And with AI demand surging past what the grid can supply, that future might be closer than we think.

The company posted a series of cryptic social media clips over the weekend that drew attention from investors and enthusiasts alike.

One video featured a black, hubcap-like object with the Tesla logo spinning before the numbers “10/7” appeared — likely pointing to an October 7 announcement.

Another showed a car shrouded in darkness, with only its headlights visible.

Tesla shares were up 3% in early trading at ₹443.26, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively.

Speculation grows around Tesla’s next model

Tesla’s last major product launch came nearly two years ago with the Cybertruck, a highly anticipated pickup that has since underperformed expectations.

Executives have indicated that a lower-cost version of the Model Y is in development to help sustain sales following the expiration of US electric vehicle tax credits.

Another long-awaited model is the second-generation Roadster, a project first showcased in 2017.

Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said in February 2024 that Tesla was aiming to ship the vehicle this year, but no official timeline has since been confirmed.

The company could benefit from a new model introduction.

Through September, Tesla sold about 1.22 million cars in 2025, down 6% from the same period a year earlier, despite record third-quarter deliveries of nearly 500,000 vehicles.

Analysts on Tesla stock

Tesla stock fell 2.4% last week, even after reporting stronger-than-expected delivery numbers on Thursday.

The muted reaction followed a roughly 40% rally in the month leading up to the report, suggesting the strong results were already priced in.

JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman raised his price target on Tesla shares from ₹115 to ₹150 but maintained an Underweight rating.

He noted that third-quarter deliveries of 497,000 vehicles exceeded forecasts by around 12% but described the strength as a “temporary pull-forward” ahead of the expiration of US EV credits.

JP Morgan expects Tesla to post earnings per share of ₹0.59 for the quarter, about 18% lower than a year earlier.

Analysts are now focused on how Tesla’s demand will hold up without federal incentives.

Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan warned that fourth-quarter deliveries could weaken as Tesla tapers discounts and promotional offers.

He forecast added margin pressure and lower regulatory credit sales, placing his 2025 earnings estimate 29% below Wall Street’s consensus.

Goldman Sachs analysts also flagged the loss of tax credits as a near-term challenge but said the company could find support from seasonal demand trends, new model launches, and upcoming events such as its shareholder meeting on November 6.

At present, investor attention is centred on Tesla’s mysterious October 7 announcement, which could determine whether the company can reignite growth momentum after a subdued year for electric-vehicle sales.

EV market faces sharp decline as tax credits expire

The expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit on October 1, 2025, has sent shockwaves through the electric vehicle market, with immediate implications for battery demand. Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted that EV market share will plummet by more than half to between 4% and 5% of total sales by year's end, according to reporting by the Wall Street Journal.

""We expect a pretty deep fall off,"" Farley stated, while Nissan Americas Chairman Christian Meunier warned that ""October should be the worst market in years for EVs.""

The credit's final month saw a surge in EV sales, with electric models representing an estimated 12.2% of retail sales in September—a record share that now appears unsustainable. Dealers currently hold approximately 134,000 unsold EVs, representing a two-month supply at current sales rates, according to Cox Automotive data cited in the WSJ report.

Consumer sentiment reflects this market uncertainty. A Harris Poll survey found that nearly a third of consumers who were likely to buy an electric vehicle would either be much less likely to consider an EV or won't consider one at all without the federal tax credit. While 54% of these ""EV defectors"" said they'll return to gasoline vehicles, 30% indicated they'd choose hybrids instead—a shift that still impacts battery demand but at reduced scale.

$7.6 billion in clean energy projects axed

The administration's broader assault on clean energy infrastructure became evident with the Energy Department's October 2 announcement canceling $7.56 billion in funding for 223 clean energy projects. The cuts, reported by the Washington Post, disproportionately affect Democratic-led states and include numerous battery storage initiatives.

Among the canceled projects was a $30 million award for battery storage at a California children's hospital and at least $15 million for battery storage and grid upgrades serving Indigenous communities in New Mexico. The cuts also eliminated funding for a project that would have added 28 gigawatts of new energy generation to Minnesota's power grid, mostly from wind and solar—capacity that would have required substantial battery storage integration.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the cancellations, claiming in a statement that the projects ""did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Notably, 26% of the terminated awards—valued at over $3.1 billion—were issued between Election Day and Inauguration Day, suggesting the previous administration's rush to secure funding before the transition.

Strategic investment in the domestic lithium supply chain

Paradoxically, while dismantling renewable energy projects, the Trump administration is simultaneously investing in the battery supply chain's foundation. The Energy Department announced it will take a 5% equity stake in Lithium Americas and its Nevada Thacker Pass mining project, restructuring a $2.26 billion loan agreement from 2024.

""It's in America's best interest to get that mine built,"" Wright told Bloomberg Television, emphasizing that Thacker Pass production could help reduce China's dominance in the lithium market.

The Thacker Pass project, among the largest known lithium deposits in the US, is expected to produce 88 million pounds annually of lithium carbonate for lithium-ion batteries. This investment aligns with broader Trump administration efforts to secure domestic control of critical materials, including similar equity stakes in rare-earths miner MP Materials and strategic positions in the steel and semiconductor sectors.

Industry adaptation and market reality

Automakers are scrambling to adapt to the new landscape. General Motors and Ford have committed to extending EV incentives temporarily, with GM working on dealer programs to effectively continue the $7,500 credit for leases. Hyundai is offering $7,500 discounts on remaining 2025 model EVs and cutting 2026 Ioniq 5 prices by up to $9,800.

However, these manufacturer-funded incentives represent significant financial strain. Ford expects to lose approximately $5 billion in its EV business this year, and CEO Farley acknowledged that promotional programs ""are not going to last forever.""

The fundamental challenge remains cost competitiveness. The average EV sold for upward of $57,000 in August—over $9,000 more than comparable gas-powered vehicles, according to Cox Automotive data from the WSJ report. This price gap, previously bridged by federal incentives, now represents a substantial market barrier.

Battery industry implications

For the battery industry, these developments create a complex operating environment. The elimination of EV incentives and renewable energy projects reduces near-term demand for battery storage systems across transportation and grid applications. The Harris Poll data suggesting that a majority of EV defectors would reconsider with incentives of at least $5,000 indicates that battery demand remains price-sensitive and policy-dependent.

Yet the lithium mining investment signals recognition that battery technology remains strategically important for national competitiveness. The administration's focus on supply chain security over demand stimulation suggests a belief that market forces will eventually drive adoption while ensuring domestic control of critical materials.

This ""one step forward, two steps back"" approach leaves battery manufacturers navigating reduced immediate demand while potentially benefiting from more secure, domestically-sourced raw materials in the long term. The challenge will be surviving the transition period as the market adjusts to new economic realities without federal support for deployment while building toward eventual cost parity and renewed growth.

The administration's contradictory signals reflect the complex politics of energy transition, acknowledging the strategic importance of battery technology while ideologically opposing the policies that would accelerate its adoption. For an industry built on the promise of clean energy transformation, the path forward requires adapting to a landscape where government support flows toward supply chains rather than market development.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltbb8dbb8002daade2/68e3e31d2c719e8cf9599ce6/DOE-Sec-Wright-2223538060.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-06 13:03:54.268634

Four factors ultimately drove Talon’s pivot to TOPCon technology.
First, the realisation that TOPCon cells could serve as effective back cells for future perovskite tandems, maintaining the company’s long-term technology roadmap.
Second, existing US infrastructure was better suited to integrate TOPCon cells into p-type production lines compared to HJT.
Fraunhofer partnership and R&D strategy A key pillar of Talon’s technology development is its partnership with Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE.","“As we went down the road of TOPCon, of course this lawfare that’s happening with intellectual property in the TOPCon space was prevalent,” Tesanovich explains. “So we took a deep dive to look at what IP we could be infringing on. After that analysis, because we’re utilising PVD in our process versus PECVD or other CVD processes, the only IP that we really infringed on was the TetraSun IP from First Solar.”

The TOPCon patent challenge

TOPCon technology has been considered too risky for US manufacturers due to extensive patent litigation between major Asian producers. The technology has been at the centre of what Tesanovich calls “lawfare” – with companies like Maxeon, LG, and Trina locked in patent disputes. Last month, in an interview with PV Tech, the CEO of another US cell production start-up, ES Foundry, expressed his belief that no company can safely produce TOPCon cells in the US without fear of litigation.

But Tesanovich is confident in Talon’s position. By using physical vapour deposition (PVD) rather than chemical vapour deposition (CVD) processes, the company believes it sidesteps most patent issues. The crucial breakthrough came through securing a licensing agreement with First Solar for the TetraSun intellectual property.

“We reached out to First Solar. We’re very aligned on our idea of what the domestic marketplace should look like,” Tesanovich says. “Because of that and also utilising TOPCon cells as back cells and their drive towards perovskites in tandem to supplement their thin film, we really found a great strategic partner in the industry, almost a big brother.”

This partnership makes Talon “the only licence holder in the US that has the ability to produce TOPCon cells that are free and clear of IP”, according to Tesanovich. The company has also engaged directly with other TOPCon IP stakeholders, conducting detailed discussions about potential infringement. “Those conversations have been very positive, and, at this point, we feel that we’re free and clear,” he adds.

From HJT to TOPCon

Talon’s journey began in an unlikely place: the oil and gas industry. Tesanovich and his partners Brandon Dewan and Jared Light built Eagle Group from a small business in 2013 into a major supplier of metallurgical products for hydrocarbon transmission and drilling, serving clients including BP, Repsol, Shell and Chevron.

“A lot of our clients were companies that were getting into renewables, and specifically we saw solar as a great opportunity,” Tesanovich recalls. The team recognised that while the US had lost much of its solar manufacturing intellectual property and footprint to Asia over the past 15 years, there was now “an immediate need for manufacturing here in the US”.

Initially, the company planned to manufacture heterojunction (HJT) cells, attracted by their compatibility with future perovskite tandem technologies. However, market feedback from potential customers proved sobering.

“As we went to market with HJT plans, the initial reception was positive, but as we started drilling down into it and the 45X [tax credit] was kicking in, a lot of the module companies were very hesitant to want to try a new technology,” Tesanovich explains. Module manufacturers would need to adjust stringers and temperatures for HJT cells, creating operational complications they preferred to avoid while benefiting from existing tax incentives.

Four factors ultimately drove Talon’s pivot to TOPCon technology. First, the realisation that TOPCon cells could serve as effective back cells for future perovskite tandems, maintaining the company’s long-term technology roadmap. Second, existing US infrastructure was better suited to integrate TOPCon cells into p-type production lines compared to HJT. Third, HJT technology remained “somewhat unproven in the field”, says Tesanovich. Finally, even Asian manufacturers were “running into difficulties producing HJT cells at a reasonable cost”, Tesanovich says.

The shift also aligned with market constraints in the US caused by ongoing patent litigation. “Having a TOPCon cell is more than good for the US marketplace,” Tesanovich notes.

European equipment, American manufacturing

Talon has made a bold bet on European equipment suppliers, challenging industry conventional wisdom. At Intersolar in Munich two years ago, Tesanovich recalls sitting on a panel where “everybody was saying it’s impossible to utilise European equipment and create a business case that supports the higher capex cost”.

“We took that as a challenge,” he says. The company’s analysis showed that while European equipment requires higher capital expenditure, operational expenses are significantly lower due to reduced power usage, water consumption, downtime and staffing requirements. “You hit parity within two to three years on the higher capex because it saves on opex.”

The European equipment strategy also provides strategic advantages, including local spare parts availability and reduced dependence on Southeast Asian supply chains. Crucially, Talon has “zero FEOC IP” and “zero FEOC investment” in its project, insulating it from Foreign Entity of Concern regulations that have complicated other US solar projects, Tesanovich claims.

Fraunhofer partnership and R&D strategy

A key pillar of Talon’s technology development is its partnership with Germany’s Fraunhofer ISE. Rather than building an R&D facility in Houston, the company decided to invest in a pilot line at Fraunhofer’s Freiburg facility.

“We were going to do our R&D and pilot line here in the US at our facility,” Tesanovich explains. “What we realised is that was going to be a very myopic focus on our current equipment versus a wider vision around what are the next technologies, what are the new advancements that are coming in. Fraunhofer is probably best in class in the world on that. And so we decided that we would put invest in a pilot line with Fraunhofer and our equipment suppliers in Freiburg, Germany.”

The pilot line, coming online in Q2 2026, will produce G12, M10, and larger format cells using identical equipment to Talon’s main production lines. This approach allows the company to dial in formulas and processes before its Houston facility reaches full production, enabling rapid ramp-up while providing training opportunities for US-based teams. Another benefit is that Talon will be able to send its team over to Fraunhofer to train on the same equipment that will be used in the eventual production line.

Importantly, the equipment already has the capability to deposit perovskite tandem layers, a factor that Tesanovich says positions Talon well to have a headstart in this emerging area of PV technology. “What we’re doing is coming together to create a handshake from scalable commercial industrial manufacturing already having that capability in our tools,” he says. “This is a strategy that we’ve deployed to get tandem and perovskite cells out into the marketplace sooner than later.

Policy tailwinds and market demand

Despite the policy uncertainties for the US solar industry following the recent enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill, Tesanovich sees the regulatory environment as providing “quite a bit of tailwind” for Talon’s project. The combination of manufacturing tax credits (45X) and deployment incentives creates what he calls “carrots and sticks” that benefit domestic manufacturers.

“The majority of developers have already safe harboured their projects for the next four to five years,” he notes, referring to projects that locked in favourable tax treatment before recent policy changes. This provides demand visibility even as some incentive programmes face uncertainty.

The company has also benefited from strong support from AI and data centre companies that have been “very vocal in their support of solar and battery” for powering their facilities. Solar and battery storage represent “the only deployable power source that is short-term,” compared to natural gas projects requiring at least two to three years and nuclear projects taking 10-15 years.

“The only way to win the AI race is via solar and battery, and that has become clear to this administration,” Tesanovich observes.

Supply chain and customer base

Talon has secured partnerships with domestic suppliers including Hemlock and Corning for polysilicon and wafers, as well as Nowegian ingot and wafter producer NorSun as that company develops its capabilities. This domestic supply chain approach aligns with growing demand from independent power producers (IPPs) and developers seeking “non-FEOC supply chain” options.

The company’s facility is “essentially completely booked for the next three to five years, depending on the contract”, with strong demand from IPPs and developers. Tesanovich notes that Talon provides value to various industry participants, including potential competitors, by offering cells that won’t trigger patent litigation for module manufacturers.

Talon expects to begin commercial production in Q1 2027, with its Houston facility already secured, along with necessary permits, power, water and wastewater infrastructure. The company has invested heavily in workforce development, establishing programmes at local high schools and trade schools while partnering with Rice University for advanced technical training.

“We’ve spent a lot of time on the front side of our workforce development,” Tesanovich emphasises, noting strong local enthusiasm for these educational initiatives.

Technology reliability and future outlook

Addressing concerns about TOPCon’s field reliability, Tesanovich points to recent research that has resolved early degradation issues. “By utilising good quality inputs as well as playing with formulas to remove aluminium, the industry has found their way around that,” he explains. “Fraunhofer and others have done extensive research on the degradation in TOPCon, and there is a very clear pathway to not having those issues in the marketplace.”

As Talon prepares to begin production, the company represents a test case for whether US manufacturers can successfully compete in solar cell production using advanced technologies and European equipment partnerships. The industry will no doubt be watching keenly to see if Talon’s strategy of producing TOPCon cells in the US without being dragged into patent battles pays off.

Its success or failure will likely influence whether other US entrepreneurs follow Talon’s path or continue to view domestic solar cell manufacturing as more trouble than it’s worth.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Talon-PV.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 15:07:42.210789

BMW and Stellantis (parent company of Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and other brands) will offer $7,500 discounts on electric vehicles (EVs) now that the federal government no longer does.

The two join General Motors and Ford in finding creative ways to extend a discount to match the faded federal incentive.

The federal government offered a tax incentive of up to $7,500 off the purchase or lease of many new EVs as part of a program meant to encourage automakers to shift factories and supply chains to the U.S. The federal incentive ended when October began, torpedoed by a new law pushed by President Trump.

Automakers sold record numbers of EVs in the third quarter as the deadline approached. But analysts from Kelley Blue Book parent company Cox Automotive expect fourth-quarter EV sales to plummet as the discount fades. EV sales will likely find a new level and begin growing slowly sometime next year.

So, some automakers are trying to keep it going — at least until dealers can sell down some of the inventory they currently hold.

BMW’s website shows a $7,500 discount on all of its current EVs, with a note that buyers “must take delivery by October 31st, 2025.”

It’s been a tough year for recyclers in the U.S., most of whom are facing various levels of uncertainty related to the interconnected effects of tariffs, labor constraints and consumer confidence.

Though global and domestic economic pressures are expected to continue into next year, there’s reason to be optimistic about longer-term economic trends that could spur future demand for recycled content, said Emily Sanchez, chief economist at the Recycled Materials Association, at the National Recycling Congress at Wichita State University in Nebraska.

“The industry has always thrived on being innovative. They’ve always thrived on being adaptive. Recycling is fundamentally about solving the eternal problem of scarcity, turning waste into resources,” she said.

Sanchez outlined recent economic headwinds and trends during a presentation on Oct. 3.

Tariffs have already reshaped commodity markets and created destabilizing economic conditions for recyclers in the U.S., particularly those who have more of a dependency on exports and those whose businesses are closer to hard-hit industries, she said. “These policy shifts have been making planning really impossible, but recyclers have been just adapting as best as they can,” Sanchez said.

Overarching U.S. labor market trends are also affecting recyclers. There’s a “downshift in growth and job growth that’s underway,” she said, driven in part by higher cost pressures from tariffs, inflation worries and other factors.

During Q2 earnings calls this summer, several major publicly traded waste companies reported a range of these headwinds were affecting their guidance this year. Most reported lower commodity prices were weighing on earnings, combined with higher labor costs and manufacturing softness. But Republic Services CFO Brian DelGhiaccio predicted the macro environment for manufacturing could turn around in coming years.

Immigration policy is also contributing to labor market weakness, Sanchez said. “Changes in immigration policy have reduced the labor pool and in a really big way in certain sectors. And then on the demand side, the demand for jobs has been really soft.”

Meanwhile, consumer spending is expected to slow down as the year goes on, in part because of these job trends, she said. That lower consumer demand means companies aren’t churning out as many new products, including those made with recycled materials.

The Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and indicated that it could again lower rates later in October.

“I’m particularly looking at how that’s going to affect demand in certain markets that impact recycled materials, like in cars, auto parts, houses and [capital expenditures],” Sanchez said. “These capital expenditures might require recycled inputs, or [generate] recyclable materials at some point in the future.”

Sanchez said companies that have delayed major investments this year have had a direct impact on the industry, but such caution may lead to pent-up demand for recycled materials as early as next year. “There were a lot of companies that have just been postponing purchases today, and they’re going to need materials tomorrow,” she said.

Meanwhile, U.S. recyclers are also weathering global economic impacts, such as a slowdown of global growth that likely means less demand for recycled materials, Sanchez said. She estimates global real GDP growth will be about 3% this year, and decrease slightly to about 2.9% in 2026.

“By this point of the year, we’re seeing that goods trade is weak, and that matters a lot, since so much of goods are made with international supply chains, and then there’s just tremendous uncertainty and a lot of unsettled policy risk,” she said.

But despite geopolitical challenges, she sees a silver lining: “The pace of global growth has actually been pretty resilient” this year, she said.

Recent data from the Purchasing Managers’ Index, a monthly indicator of a country’s manufacturing sector health, also show key growth in the economies of India, Thailand and Vietnam.

Under the deal, green electricity from two solar farms will be supplied to French national railway company SNCF Voyageurs in a move to accelerate the shift to cleaner, fossil-free public transport.

Developed and constructed by global renewable energy company BayWa r.e. and acquired through Octopus’ Sky fund, the solar farms Greenberry and Fontenet 3 (pictured), are expected to deliver over 100GWh of green electricity each year.

The two solar farms are located on former military bases in central and south-west France. Over the agreement’s 25-year period, these solar farms will produce 2.5TWh of clean electricity – enough to power 15,500 TGV trips from Paris to Rennes each year. It marks BayWa r.e.’s and Octopus’ first agreement of this kind in France.

The move brings SNCF Voyageurs a step closer to its sustainability goals. Since 2018, SNCF Voyageurs has expanded its corporate PPA programme, aiming to source 20% of its electricity through CPPAs.

It comes as Octopus is expanding its footprint in France, now managing over 500MW of solar and wind projects and supplying energy to more than 600,000 homes through its retail business.

SNCF Energie’s managing director Richard Fécamp said: “This is a huge leap forward for SNCF’s ambition to decarbonise and expand rail transport.

“As one of France’s largest energy consumers, we aim to source between 40% and 50% of the electricity consumed by our trains from renewables by 2030, including 20% from PPAs.

“The Fontenet 3 and Greenberry PPAs represent significant progress in our commitment to clean energy transformation.”

BayWa r.e. chief operations officer Daniel Gaefke said: “Completing the negotiation of these two PPAs in just three months – from kick-off to signature – underscores what a perfect match this collaboration is and our commitment to delivering large-scale renewable solutions at pace.

“We’re proud to support SNCF’s green rail ambitions by providing expert technical management to Octopus’ assets and look forward to working together with our valued partners on many more projects to advance decarbonisation across France and beyond.”

Co-head of Octopus Energy Generation Alex Brierly added: “Travelling by train is already one of the cleanest ways to get around, and we’re proud to help put SNCF’s trains on an even greener track. We’ve already invested in over 30 solar and wind projects across France, and we’ll continue to steam ahead to power the country’s green energy future.”",https://renews.biz/media/35198/fontenet-3-solar-farm-credit-baywa-re.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-10-06 13:04:00.807990

This edition of the Projects Weekly highlights several milestones in the world of solar. To start things off, EDF power solutions North America and El Paso Electric announced the start of commercial operations at the Milagro Energy Center in New Mexico. Avangrid has begun install solar panels for the Tower Solar project in Oregon. TurningPoint Energy and Pivot Energy have launched a new solar project in Maryland. Ameresco and the city of Olympia, Washington, have broken ground on a nearly $17 million building retrofit project at the 86-year-old Olympia Armory. X-ELIO has powered on a solar + storage plant in Texas that will supply BASF Freeport operations. A car dealership in Pomeroy, Ohio, flipped the switch on a new solar energy system to power operations. Bearing manufacturer Schaeffler has added a rooftop solar system at its facility in Connecticut. Finally, after years of planning, New Mexico has launched its long-awaited community solar program. And speaking of projects, don’t forget to vote for the 2025 Project of the Year Awards.

EDF and El Paso Electric begin commercial operations at Milagro Energy Center

EDF power solutions North America and El Paso Electric (EPE) have started operations at the Milagro Solar + Storage project in New Mexico with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by 100 guests. The 150 MWdc solar photovoltaic project combined with a 75 MWac / 4-hour battery energy storage system (BESS) will supply electricity to EPE under a 20-year PPA.

“Launching our first solar and storage project in New Mexico is an exciting milestone, and we look forward to supporting EPE as this project delivers long-term price stability, stimulates economic growth, and reduces emissions,” said Kate O’Hair, senior VP of U,S, development for EDF power solutions.

Situated on private land in the Santa Teresa area of Doña Ana County, New Mexico, the Milagro Solar + Storage project is designed to store electricity during peak hours for solar generation in a series of batteries. This stored energy is then dispatched when needed to help manage capacity demand, creating a balance between electricity generation and demand. Energy storage can manage evening energy ramps, mitigate curtailment and provide grid stability.

Cool factor: The project created approximately 200 jobs during its peak construction phase, with 100 positions filled by New Mexico residents. Over Milagro’s operating lifespan, it is expected to generate around $18 million in tax revenue for Doña Ana County, and its school districts supported under the Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB).

“This achievement involved 300,000 labor hours dedicated to installing 282,000 solar panels, all completed without a single recordable incident,” said Nick Bergren, project manager for Blattner Energy, which constructed the project.

Avangrid begins panel installation on Tower Solar project

Avangrid Inc. has started to install solar panels at its Tower Solar project in Morrow County, Oregon. When completed, Tower Solar will deliver energy to the Portland General Electric (PGE) power grid and help power a new QTS data center campus that will support Meta’s operations in the region.

“Installing these first panels marks a major milestone for this new solar project in Oregon and adds to Avangrid’s growing fleet of energy facilities across the nation,” said Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO. “Tower Solar will bring much needed capacity to the regional electric grid, improving the reliability and availability of electricity.”

Tower Solar is located just west of Boardman, Oregon, and located on about 900 acres of industrially zoned land owned by the Port of Morrow. The project will utilize more than 200,000 solar panels assembled by SEG Solar in its newly built Houston manufacturing facility. Avangrid was SEG Solar’s first utility-scale customer to receive solar modules assembled from its new U.S. facility. The total installed capacity of Tower Solar will be 166 MWdc (120 MWac).

Cool factor: At the peak of construction, Avangrid expects Tower Solar to create more than 200 jobs, the vast majority of which will be sourced from the region. Tower Solar is expected to pay about $20 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes) and property taxes which will support a variety of public services, including education. Tower Solar will deliver energy to PGE’s grid through Green Future Impact (GFI), a voluntary program designed to help large commercial, industrial, and municipal customers meet their ambitious sustainability and carbon reduction goals through the development of new clean energy facilities in our region.

“The Tower Solar project represents a meaningful step in Morrow County’s continued economic diversification,” said David Sykes, Chair of the Morrow County Commission. “By embracing renewable energy, we’re not only creating jobs and strengthening our local economy. We’re investing in a more resilient future for our citizens.”

Powering up Maryland with 16.6 MW solar portfolio near Baltimore

Maryland’s Baltimore region has a new 2.9 MWdc solar farm. A ribbon cutting ceremony was held at the Clarksville (Howard County), Maryland solar site on Sept. 25 to celebrate the energization of the new community solar farm. Distinguished guests, as well as employees from TurningPoint Energy (TPE) and Pivot Energy, joined community members to mark the completion of the solar project.

“In addition to renewable energy benefits, this solar farm will support dual-use solar, sheep grazing, native pollinator planting, and other efforts to ensure the long-term productivity of this land,” said Samantha Frick, director of community relations and impact at Pivot.

The solar farm was developed by TPE, a leading greenfield developer in Maryland, and is owned and operated by Pivot, a national renewable energy provider and independent power producer. This solar farm is the first to go online in a six-project,16.6 MWdc, portfolio developed by TPE, and built, operated, and owned by Pivot.

Cool factor: With construction completed this summer, this project represents a significant addition to the state’s solar generating capacity and will play a role in helping Maryland achieve its 50% renewable electricity goal by 2030. It will generate approximately 4.25 million kWh of affordable renewable energy annually, enough to power the equivalent of up to 370 Maryland homes. The solar array is made up of nearly 5,500 solar modules, enough to fill nearly 10 football fields.

This project is part of Maryland’s innovative Community Solar Energy Generating System (CSEGS) Pilot Program, which expands access to affordable energy. Community solar enables Baltimore Gas & Electric (BG&E) customers to gain access to lower-cost, renewable energy generated locally. Subscribers to this community solar farm will save an average of 10% off their electricity bill each year. Reflecting strong community engagement, the project is now fully subscribed, with 11 unique participants, including a local church, demonstrating local interest in shared renewable energy solutions.

Ameresco breaks ground on building retrofit in Olympia, Washington

Ameresco Inc. broke ground on a building retrofit project that will add a 150 kW solar system at the Olympia Armory, in Olympia, Washington. The approximately $17 million multi-phase adaptive reuse project will start with upgrades to the 86-year-old building that address safety requirements, improve accessibility, and enhance energy efficiency. Improvements to the building and the installation of a solar PV system will proceed in parallel. The solar technology will facilitate on-site energy generation and support ongoing cost reductions.

In total, the project is anticipated to take approximately 18 months to complete. The multiphase infrastructure improvement initiative is being delivered through an Energy Savings Performance Contract (ESPC) with Ameresco, who provided price and performance guarantees and helped ensure participation from local businesses and key community stakeholders.

Cool factor: The Olympia Armory was first constructed in 1939, on the same site that was previously home to the city’s primary public school, built in 1890. The Armory served as the headquarters for various army units from World War II onward and hosted a range of events from art exhibitions to car shows. It was acquired by the city of Olympia in 2022, and the city contracted with Ameresco to support plans to repurpose the building as a creative campus and arts center for the community.

“We are excited to bring this next iteration of the Olympia Armory to life, building on the site’s history as a community gathering place,” said Valerie Roberts, Armory building manager. “Ameresco is the perfect partner to help execute our vision. Their expertise and innovative approach provide that the Armory is operating efficiently and equipped with the energy resiliency technology to serve our community in its new form.”

X-ELIO powers on Texas solar + storage plant to supply BASF operations

X-ELIO has launched operations at its Liberty Energy Project in Dayton, Texas. The project combines 72 MW of solar PV capacity with an additional 60 MW of battery storage, marking X-ELIO’s first combined solar PV and BESS project in the United States. With Liberty now operational, 100% of the expected imported power at BASF‘s Freeport site will be supplied by renewable energy.

“The inauguration of the Liberty Project marks an important milestone in our journey toward more sustainable operations and enabling the green transformation of our customers,” said Brad Morrison, senior VP and GM at BASF Freeport. “Thanks to our partnership with X-ELIO, we are able to supply 100% of our expected purchased power at our Freeport site from renewable sources. This project supports our long-term commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and reflects the kind of collaboration needed to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.”

Cool factor: BASF will source 48 MW of electricity from the Liberty Project to help power its Freeport site as part of a 12-year power purchase agreement (PPA) announced in 2022. Freeport is one of BASF’s six global Verbund sites, which takes an integrated approach to manufacturing, raw materials and energy management.

“The Liberty Project represents a major step in our planned expansion in the U.S., a key market for X-ELIO,” said Lluís Noguera, chairman and CEO at X-ELIO. “We are currently developing a pipeline of 2.8 GW of solar PV and 2.1 GW of storage projects to advance competitive energy solutions, support local communities, and power a growing American economy.”

Under the umbrella of its Community & Nature Plan Program, X-ELIO coordinated with local partners on several initiatives to benefit the surrounding neighborhoods. These include the creation of the Dwelling Garden in Liberty, a shared green space for the community to gather; the construction of a boardwalk at Kleb Woods Nature Preserve, improving accessibility for people with reduced mobility, families with children, and all community members; and the restoration of the drainage system at the Liberty Food Bank, enhancing safety and enabling the organization to better serve families in need.

Pomeroy, Ohio car dealership adds 196.7 kW solar array

Mark Porter Auto Group in Pomeroy, Ohio, hosted a “flip-switching” event to celebrate the completion of a new solar energy system at its Pomeroy location. The 196.7 kW solar array, designed and built by Kokosing Solar, will generate more than 70% of the dealership’s annual electricity needs.

“This solar array is a great example of how, in the face of increasing electricity costs, local businesses can benefit from proven, cost-saving technology,” said Roberta Washburn of Kokosing Solar.

Cool factor: The system is expected to produce over 236,000 kWh of electricity each year, covering the majority of the dealership’s power demand and significantly reducing utility costs. By lowering reliance on the electric grid, the system also provides long-term stability against unpredictable energy prices.

Funding for the project came from a combination of federal tax incentives and a USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) grant. These tools helped reduce upfront costs, making it possible for a small business in rural Ohio to invest in advanced energy technology.

Schaeffler adds rooftop solar to roller bearing plant in Connecticut

Schaeffler, the Motion Technology Company, announces the successful implementation of its first fully owned rooftop solar energy system in the Americas region at its plant in Danbury, Connecticut, marking a major step forward in renewable electricity generation.

Schaeffler’s Danbury facility specializes in the production of high-precision roller bearings, ball bearings and related components that are critical for various aerospace applications. Installed directly on the facility’s rooftop, the solar system began producing electricity in June.

Cool factor: The 1,154 MWp solar system, installed in partnership with Solect Energy, is now fully operational and is expected to supply approximately 13% of the plant’s annual electricity needs.

“This is a major step forward in our journey toward energy efficiency and on our decarbonization pathway,” said Wendell Fenner, plant manager, Danbury. “We are proud that Danbury is leading the way for the Americas region, setting an example of how clean energy can be integrated into our operations to benefit both the environment and our business.”

New Mexico launches first community solar project

After years of planning, the long-awaited launch of New Mexico’s first-ever community solar project is ready to power up. The Cuidando Los Niños Community Solar Project hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Sept. 30, in Belen, New Mexico.

“This project proves that community solar works,” said Cory Felder, Mountain West regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA). “It delivers affordable power, local investment, and community benefits in a way no other clean energy program can. New Mexico has been working toward this moment for years, and today we’re proud to see the vision becoming reality.”

New Mexico passed its community solar law, SB84, in 2021, but the rollout has been delayed by regulatory proceedings and utility processes. The ribbon-cutting shows that the program is finally moving forward, unlocking a pipeline of projects that will deliver savings and resilience to households statewide.

Cool factor: The project, developed by Affordable Solar, demonstrates the power of community solar to lower bills, expand energy choice, and deliver local benefits. Affordable Solar was awarded seven community solar projects across New Mexico, totaling 35 MW — which cumulatively will offset the energy usage of 15,000 homes. In addition to providing clean electricity to subscribers, the project is supporting Cuidando Los Niños’ mission to break the cycle of childhood homelessness. As part of the celebration, Affordable Solar will present a $45,000 donation to the nonprofit.

“We are honored to bring the state’s first community solar project to life right here in Belen,” said Dylan Connelly, Project Developer at Affordable Solar. “Community solar is about more than clean energy—it’s about putting people first. By helping families save on their bills and supporting Cuidando Los Niños with this donation, we’re demonstrating the wide-ranging impact this program can have across New Mexico.”

The Cuidando Los Niños project is fully subscribed, thanks in part to the efforts of community solar subscription provider Solstice, ensuring that New Mexicans, especially those who otherwise could not install solar, can benefit from renewable energy. Importantly, 50% of the project’s energy production is reserved to support qualified low-income households, directly lowering electricity bills for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Dive Brief:

California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week vetoed several pieces of energy legislation, including AB 740, which passed with bipartisan support and would have required the state to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan.

In a letter to the governor last month, more than a dozen trade and environmental advocacy groups urged Newsom to sign AB 740 into law, claiming VPPs could save Californians $750 million per year in system costs and provide more than 7,500 MW of capacity.

Newsom said in a statement that he supported the aim of harnessing distributed energy resources, but that the bill would have resulted in costs to the California Energy Commission’s primary operating fund, “which is currently facing an ongoing structural deficit.”

Dive Insight:

Newsom last month signed into law a broad package of energy legislation that laid the groundwork for a regional Western electricity market, extended the state’s cap and trade program and added $18 billion to the state’s wildfire fund.

But he rejected several bills that passed, and other initiatives that had been favored by clean energy advocates were left on the cutting room floor of negotiations.

Edson Perez, California lead at Advanced Energy United, said the governor’s vetoes “mark a major setback for California's supposed commitment to leveraging readily-available solutions to tackle real affordability problems.”

“Together, these decisions establish Governor Newsom as the state leader who walked away from billions in potential savings for ratepayers at a critical moment in California’s history,” Perez said in a statement.

In addition to AB 740, Newsom also vetoed SB 541, AB 1408 and AB 44.

SB 541 would have required the CEC and the California Public Utilities Commission to analyze load-shifting strategies and publish reports on load-shifting for each electric retail supplier. Newsom said in a statement that the bill was “redundant” of existing efforts and cost prohibitive for the state.

AB 1408 would have required the California Independent System Operator and utilities to integrate surplus interconnection into their planning. In a statement, Newsom said the bill “risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing customer electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability.”

Newsom also vetoed AB 44, which would have codified load flexibility in state grid planning.

Certain dealers fear the removal of the R135 000 tax credit will leave them burdened with unsold electric vehicles.","Speaking at a Detroit gathering recently, Ford chief executive, Jim Farley, described the development as ""a game-changer"", mere hours before the federal subsidy lapsed.

Farley indicated that he would not be surprised if electric car sales plummeted to just 5% of overall US vehicle sales next month. This figure represents approximately half the August level, a monthly high as buyers hastened to benefit from the credit and would rank among the weakest performances in recent years.

Christian Meunier, chairman of Nissan Americas, was equally pessimistic: ""The EV market is going to collapse in October."" Whilst Japan's Nissan continues launching a refreshed Nissan Leaf compact EV in the American market, Meunier anticipates intense rivalry as competing manufacturers battle to secure buyers for their electric vehicles.

""That competition is going to be super-brutal, because there is an overabundance of stock. Our competitors have built a lot of EVs,"" Meunier remarked in an interview with Reuters.

The R135 000 tax credit was initially authorised by Congress in 2008 for electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle buyers. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act prolonged the incentive, though it simultaneously restricted eligibility to American-built EVs incorporating specified levels of domestically sourced batteries and components.

US President Donald Trump's tax-reduction and spending legislation, enacted in July, established the 30 September termination date. His administration has implemented additional measures potentially hampering EV momentum, including suspending penalties levied on car companies failing to meet fuel-efficiency standards. During last year's campaign, Trump pledged to terminate former President Joe Biden's ""EV mandate"".

Research conducted jointly by academics from the universities of California, Berkeley, Duke and Stanford in November 2024 suggests electric vehicle registrations could decline by 27% in the absence of the tax credit.

The United States trails other principal automotive markets in EV uptake. In China, the world leader in electric vehicles and battery production, the combined sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles have exceeded 40% in recent months. Europe's adoption rate has remained near 20%.

Despite the American tax incentive being available, electric car sales growth had already slowed over the previous two years, prior to this summer's deadline-driven surge. This deceleration occurred notwithstanding manufacturers introducing numerous new EV models.

The German government has begun preparations for the next round of its “climate contract” support scheme for industry decarbonisation. For the first time, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and utilisation (CCU) projects will be eligible to participate, the economy ministry said.

Germany aims to become climate neutral by 2045, but CO2 reductions in basic material industries such as steel, cement, paper, glass and chemicals are difficult to achieve, and entirely new and often expensive production methods are needed. With the help of so-called Carbon Contracts for Difference (CCfD), the government supports climate-friendly manufacturing by bridging the price gap with current carbon-intensive processes, allowing the companies to compete in international markets.

Companies must participate in the preparatory phase if they want to apply for support in the tender, which is expected to begin in mid-2026, the ministry said. During the preparatory phase, companies will also be consulted on the tender rules.

At the start of their term, the governing parties pledged to continue the pioneering ‘climate contracts’ programme of the previous German coalition government. In a first round, fifteen companies were awarded funding in October 2024.

The previous government had opened the preparatory phase for a second round of auctions in summer 2024, but the scheme was put on hold following the collapse of the coalition. Earlier this year, the European Commission gave the green light for the scheme based on state aid rules.

There were 18 items with some kind of measurable economic impact. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was the main agency of the week, providing the most significant regulatory and deregulatory actions of the haul. Across all rulemakings, agencies published roughly $1.9 billion in total costs and added roughly 228,000 paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 37

Final Rules: 97

2025 Total Pages: 48,012

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$74.8 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: -$628 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the rule from EPA regarding “Water Quality Standards To Protect Aquatic Life in the Delaware River.” In particular, the regulation sets “a designated use of protection and propagation of resident and migratory aquatic life and corresponding dissolved oxygen water quality criteria for the mainstem Delaware River in Zone 3, Zone 4, and the upper portion of Zone 5 (in total, river miles 108.4 to 70.0).” EPA issued the proposed version of the rule in 2023, making it an initiative that dates to the Biden Administration. As such, it is hardly surprising that it falls under the “regulatory” side of the ledger for the purposes of Executive Order (EO) 14192. The agency estimates that the rule’s requirements will involve $185.6 million in annualized costs to affected water safety authorities, or roughly $2.3 billion in present value over a 10-year period.

EPA also had a substantial deregulatory action, albeit, one that had more modest estimated cost reductions. The proposed rule on “Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category-Deadline Extensions,” would – as the title suggests – push back some deadlines established under a 2024 rule on the matter. The schedule of extensions is the following:

EPA projects that, under these implementation delays, “estimated annualized cost savings are $79 million to $215 million.” Taking the midpoint of that range means $147 million in annual savings, or roughly $386 million total across a three-year window.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

The ongoing government shutdown is, of course, more of a fiscal matter than a regulatory one. Nevertheless, it will have some impact on the administration’s broader regulatory policy agenda. With agencies generally shuttered, one can already see administrative actions slow to a crawl in the Federal Register. The length of this shutdown will be the primary determinant of how significant this downturn in regulatory activity will be. For instance, looking back to the weeks-long shutdown across 2018 and 2019, the Federal Register had what is likely the lightest issue on record on January 15, 2019, that amounted to a barely half-page notice extending a disaster relief filing deadline.

The only action on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front was from Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introducing yet another series of resolutions of disapproval against Trump Administration rules – including one that seeks to repeal the Department of Interior’s rule on “Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness: Gulf of America.” The American Action Forum (AAF) CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 64 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) joined a bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives this week urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize rules that prioritize domestic feedstocks and protect U.S. farmers and renewable fuel producers from foreign competition.

In a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the lawmakers called on the agency to move forward with its proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported biofuels and to maintain record-high biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes set out earlier this year. They said the policy changes would strengthen American energy security and bolster farm economies across the Midwest.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks,” the members wrote. “The Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.”

The Import RIN reduction, proposed by the EPA in June, would cut in half the RIN credits available for imported renewable fuels or fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Lawmakers argue the move would help level the playing field for American producers facing competition from foreign sources such as Brazilian tallow and used cooking oil imported from China.

The letter also noted that soybean oil plays a key role in the U.S. biofuel industry — though it represents only 20% of the soybean by weight, it accounts for more than half the crop’s market value. About half of that oil is used to make biodiesel, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel.

“The EPA’s own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal,” the senators wrote. “It will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities.”

Joining Young in signing the letter were Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran of Kansas, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Rounds of South Dakota, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, among others.

Thirty-four members of the House of Representatives also endorsed the letter, including Indiana’s Jim Baird (IN-04), Erin Houchin (IN-09), Mark Messmer (IN-08), and Rudy Yakym (IN-02).

The senators said finalizing the rule would fulfill the intent of Congress under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritize domestic production and job growth in rural communities.

And while the president gets better marks on handling immigration and crime, both issues present potential problems as many Americans believe his administration is going too far. Focus groups and a limited number of new polls tell us that he has lost some ground among young people and minorities who voted for him. The president’s overall approval rating has been fairly steady recently, but that relative stability masks some worrying undercurrents, especially among political independents.

All this said, however, the Democrats aren’t exactly capturing voters’ hearts and minds. And, they still have trouble with their base. In the latest Economist/YouGov survey, 54% of Democrats approved of the job Senator Chuck Schumer was doing. Sixty-two percent of Republicans gave that response about House Republican leader Mike Johnson. A new Pew Research Center survey found that all four congressional leaders were viewed more negatively than positively. Pew noted that “Democrats now express more disapproval of their party’s congressional leadership than at any time in several decades,” while Republicans are more positive about theirs.

Off-year elections, where voter turnout is key, are still more than a year away, and that is an eternity in politics. But in the Economist/YouGov poll, independents, by a 10-point margin, said they would vote for the Democratic candidate for Congress over the GOP one if the election were being held today, although many said they were unsure or wouldn’t vote.

It is worth looking at what we know about people who call themselves independents. A substantial amount of political science research shows that many in this large group actually lean to the Democratic or Republican parties and that only a small number are pure independents. A new CNN analysis of independents, building on a 2007 analysis from the Washington Post, KFF, and Harvard provides some insights into independents today and some clues about why they may be a particularly problematic group for the GOP as we move toward the off-year elections.

In the CNN analysis, 44% of people self-identified themselves as independents when asked the familiar question: In politics, as of today, do you consider yourself a Republican, a Democrat or an independent? Of the remainder, roughly equal shares said they were Republicans (28%) and Democrats (27%). When the researchers started looking at the independent group as a whole, they found that 24% were Democratic “look-alikes” and 12% Republican ones. These are people who reject the party labels but actually align closely with one of the two parties. They also vote for candidates of the party they look like. As we have come to expect in recent elections, the Democratic lookalikes are more female than male, and the GOP lookalikes are more male than female. Both are mostly white. Slightly more than half of these soft Democrats call themselves progressives. About a third of the Republicans look-alikes say they align with MAGA.

The “Upbeat Outsiders” were 22% of the independent group. The largest age swath in this group are 30 to 49 years old. They don’t tune into politics and a large number of them say they haven’t voted in a decade. CNN calls them “true independents” and in this analysis, they leaned slightly more to Republicans than Democratic. But most don’t truly lean to either party.

The “Disappointed Middle” are 16% of the independents, and more than the other groups they hold unfavorable views of both parties. They still think it is important to participate.

Valparaiso High School and Benjamin Franklin Middle School are each installing two C65 units. They will generate prime and CHP power for hot water and building heating at both sites.

The four Capstone Green Energy C65 systems, fueled by natural gas, will provide reliable, low-maintenance, and quiet on-site power, an important feature given their proximity to classrooms, the project developers say. The CHP systems will reduce utility costs and support the district’s long-term sustainability and resiliency goals by producing both electricity and heat.

The order was secured by Vergent Power Solutions, Capstone’s distributor for the Midwest and Northeast United States and Eastern Canada; it is expected to be commissioned by the end of October 2025. The project is a collaboration between Vergent and Veregy, a NAESCO-accredited, energy services company (ESCO).

“This repeat order from Veregy shows that microturbines are not just a one-off solution; they are a cornerstone of a long-term energy strategy,” said Justin Rathke, President of Vergent. “Their quiet operation and reliability make them an ideal fit for schools, and their ability to generate on-site power and heat helps clients like Valparaiso reduce costs and build a more resilient energy future.”

In 2020, the two companies partnered to bring a Capstone C65 system to Argos Community Schools in Indiana, which improved energy efficiency, lowered costs, and strengthened resiliency. The project exceeded all of its energy conservation goals after five years, the companies say.

The installations are the foundation of Valparaiso’s Phase 2 $17 million Guaranteed Energy Savings Contract (GESC), which includes solar, retro-commissioning, and other energy efficiency upgrades. The Phase 2 project supports the district’s sustainability efforts, which generated more than $7.6 million in projected energy savings over 12 years using solar arrays, LED lighting upgrades, HVAC enhancements, and real-time utility monitoring.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/10/68e3d222896fa9f3ffe3a07c-valparaiso_high_school_front.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-06 13:05:34.068235

“It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment.
To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.
“Europe’s wind industry has taken notice, and policymakers are mobilizing to help reduce the reliance on Chinese imports and beef up the domestic wind energy supply chain.
Officials hope such measures will encourage manufacturing buildouts while keeping costs in check,” said Andrea Scassola, vice president of supply chain research at Rystad Energy.","As the US aims to decouple from Chinese supply chains by doubling down on its domestic oil and gas resources, industries such as offshore wind have faced a barrage of economic challenges, from stop-work orders, to tax break rollbacks and rising inflationary costs. Despite unfavorable conditions in the US, Rystad Energy research shows new global offshore wind capacity will reach 16 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2025 due to projects already underway, with two thirds of them being developed in China. By 2030, Rystad Energy forecasts China’s offshore wind projects will claim 45% of the world’s cumulative capacity, making it difficult for the US market to compete in the long term, regardless of policy reversals.

“It is now clear that the energy policy shift in the US not only halts or slows progress on offshore wind projects that were previously greenlit but pushes European wind developers away from US investment. The US-China supply chain may be decoupled, but China’s position as a global renewables leader may have only been strengthened because of it,” said Alexander Fløtre, senior vice president and head of offshore wind research, Rystad Energy.

Some clear effects are already emerging. US renewable energy investments have plunged 36% year-on-year so far in 2025, whereas European investments are rising as companies redirect capital away from the US. Stop work orders were issued for both Orsted’s Rhode Island offshore wind development and Equinor’s New York project, with the latter reaching a deal that lifted the administration’s ban. A federal judge has reversed the order on Orsted’s Revolution project, with the question of a continued legal battle waiting to be answered. To remain attractive to investors, Orsted and companies like it must evaluate all options for offshore wind developments and their overall US presence.

On the flipside, China-based CNOOC stated that it is staging its offshore wind portfolio expansion, with a key project in the 1.5 GW Hainan CZ7 aimed to be commissioned before 2030. The project is approved and is to be the first utility-scale project for CNOOC. For European energy companies with less US exposure, their reliance on China and other nations will only be enhanced.

The chances of creating an alternate, renewables-driven supply chain to compete with China are low, with Western original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) flocking back to the country’s favorable business environment after fleeing in 2020. The challenge is formidable: an analysis of turbine platforms with IEC-type certification commonly used across Europe, for example, reveals that approximately 25% of the manufacturing sites producing key components for Western OEMs are in China.

The Embark is built on an EV platform developed exclusively for the THOR family of companies by Harbinger Motors. THOR and Harbinger have been working together to develop the platform since 2022, and released some new technical details in April.

The Embark’s center-mounted 140 kWh battery pack delivers 105 miles of electric range—plenty for shorter trips or daily exploration. For longer hauls, it also incorporates a low-emission gasoline range extender that brings total range up to 450 miles.

Embark’s 800-volt electrical architecture allows for rapid charging at DC fast charger locations. The battery pack can also be charged using the traditional power hookups available at most campsites. The motorhome can serve as a mobile energy backup system to power a home in the case of a power outage.

Standard safety features include a backup camera with dynamic trajectory, front and rear ultrasonic collision warnings, and real-time tire pressure monitoring.

“Electrification will play a central role in the future of mobility, including RVing,” said THOR Industries President and CEO Bob Martin. “This first-of-its-kind [electrified] Class A motorhome reinforces THOR’s innovation leadership and offers unapparelled product differentiation for the Entegra Coach brand.”

Embark is now available for orders, and full production is to begin in 2026. Consumers interested in trying an electrified motorhome will be able to rent an Embark from THL in 2026. Entegra Coach plans to use consumer feedback from THL’s rental fleet to make continuous product improvements throughout 2026.

The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.
As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.
Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives.","The electric vehicle and renewable energy industries are bracing for the end of tax credits they had been relying on to rapidly expand the technologies across the U.S.

The phaseout, brought on by the 2025 reconciliation law, hit the EV industry last week with the end of the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. The renewable energy industry will feel the impact next, as other Biden-administration tax credits supporting production and investment are being phased out faster by the reconciliation law.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley said in Detroit last week he “wouldn’t be surprised” if EV sales fell to a market share of 5 percent after the tax credit ends from around 10 percent to 12 percent now.

“I think it’s going to be a vibrant industry, but it’s going to be smaller — way smaller than we thought — especially with the policy change in the tailpipe emissions, plus the $7,500 consumer incentive going away,” he said. “We’re going to find out in a month.”

The tax credit rollback comes on top of the Trump administration’s revamp of the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure formula program created by the 2021 infrastructure law. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy suspended the program in February, citing wasteful spending, and later relaunched with pared down standards.

“While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,” Duffy said in a statement.

In an attempt to soften the blow, automakers Ford and General Motors Co. have plans to use their financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealers’ inventory, allowing the lending arms to qualify for the federal $7,500 tax credit on those vehicles. As a result, dealers could offer leases with the tax credit over the next few months despite the phaseout.

Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno of Ohio and John Barrasso of Wyoming criticized the car companies’ plans, calling on the Treasury to close the automakers’ “loophole” and saying the plans are a “serious violation of Congressional intent.”

“These electric vehicle subsidies were costing taxpayers billions of dollars each year and distorting the market for automakers and dealers across the country, and we are extremely pleased that Congress acted decisively to cut these credits off,” they wrote in a letter to the Treasury last week. “[IRS] guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.”

Despite automakers’ efforts to soften the hits to the EV industry, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, senior resident fellow in the climate and energy program at the left-center think tank Third Way and a former chief economist at both Ford and the Commerce Department, said in an interview that the combination of the tax credit phaseout and rollback of other federal programs aimed at boosting battery manufacturing and production fares poorly for the industry.

Hughes-Cromwick said she had estimated the EV industry would reach a 50 percent market share by 2030 with the tax credits and other federal incentives. Now, she estimates it will be capped at 30 percent.

“It looks like the [auto] companies are going deeper into subprime, and that’s always an indication that sales in general are slowing … and they’re looking to keep the sales pace at a rate that allows them to maybe snowplow a little bit on total revenue,” she said. “We’ve seen several announcements now that these companies are delaying the product cycle for EVs.”

Renewables on deck

The 2025 reconciliation law also put new restrictions on renewable energy production and investment tax credits implemented under a 2022 reconciliation law, moving the timeline to qualify up by several years. Previously, projects needed to begin construction by the end of 2032. Now they must do so by July 4, 2026, or be completed by the end of 2027, to take advantage of the federal support.

“This is an extremely tumultuous time,” said Bonnie Angermeier, senior legislative associate for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “There were promises made by the federal government, and there were strong signals for how they were going to support clean energy development.”

“Essentially, the rug got ripped out from under the clean energy industry,” she added.

Projects able to start construction before next July maintain eligibility for the credits for up to four years, Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said. SEIA is the national trade organization representing the solar and battery storage industry.

“The most advantageous position to be in right now is to qualify for that start of construction provision,” Gallagher said. “Companies that can’t qualify for that start of construction — they’ve got to get those projects online by the end of 2027, and so people are working hard to do that.”

Angermeier agreed, noting that companies focused on residential solar are at an even greater disadvantage.

“They have their pedal to the metal trying to complete projects as quickly as possible because they know that the window of that tax credit closes at the end of this year, which was highly unexpected and puts a ton of pressure on them,” she said.

She noted that the changes are “really throwing a wrench” into utility-scale projects as well, which generally rely on longer timelines to move from planning to completion. Some of those have been canceled as a result of the timeline shift, she added.

A solar markets report from SEIA and Wood Mackenzie, a provider of data and analytics for the renewables, energy and natural resources sectors, found that forecasts of new solar deployment through 2030 could be reduced by as much as 55 gigawatts as a result of federal policy changes this year.

Additional grant funding rescissions have also hit the industry hard as billions of dollars of previously allocated funds have been rescinded by the EPA, Department of Energy and other agencies, sometimes after they had already been dispersed.

Angermeier said the changes taken together have led to project cancellations, pauses, layoffs and the cancellation of new jobs that would have come with planned projects.

“We’re going to see a real restriction of new energy supply as a result of both the [reconciliation] bill and the and the administration’s action since the bill was enacted,” Gallagher said. “And of course, we’re seeing this restriction of new supply at a time when energy demand is booming.”

Wind and solar power have recently been among the fastest growing forms of new generation in the U.S., according to an August report from the Energy Information Administration.

While renewables are expected to account for much of the new generation forecast over the next two years, Gallagher said, “the outlook becomes a little bit hazier when you get out to ‘28 and ‘29.”

Even so, he’s not expecting a long-term chilling effect on the industry, because of continued market demand for renewable energy.

The Trump administration says it doesn’t take issue with renewable energy technologies, but with federal subsidies for them.

“Thirty-three years we’ve subsidized wind and solar power in the United States,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a late September press conference. “If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places.”

Wright and other officials say the administration prefers dense, baseload power that they say can respond to increasing energy demand. Wind and solar struggle with intermittency issues and are therefore less reliable than sources of power like natural gas, coal and nuclear energy, they say.

But supporters of renewable energy call that “hypocritical,” noting federal support for oil and gas projects. Renewables subsidies are “really more about creating an even playing field so that we can meet the demand that we have,” Angermeier said.

Gallagher called the administration’s arguments about reliability “tired,” citing the buildout of battery storage to support solar power.

“It was never really a legitimate criticism,” he said. “And it’s all the less so when we have energy storage that can deliver power reliably when the system needs it.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/barrasso_BC_202_042925.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:08.124992

“There are opportunities arising for potato sales to Central America, Africa and the Middle East as well,” he said. “There is focus on aligning the U.S. potato industry as a single voice through sign-on opportunities with other national potato organizations to ensure our voice is heard in the Farm Bill via our advocates with the National Potato Council and Potatoes USA.”

The NC Potato Association is coming up on its 100 year anniversary in 2028 and growers are looking toward the future of the industry in the state, while reflecting on the heritage and legacy of the potato industry.

“We have some great opportunities with our partnerships with the NC Department of Agriculture, Potatoes USA, the National Potato Council and the Canadian Produce Marketing Association, to really delve into what it is that makes our potato program here in North Carolina a special one, and that is our short burst of a season that so many chip and table stock markets rely on,” Luks said. “Continuing to adapt to environmental change and demonstrating resiliency in our industry is what makes our state great. We are excited for these partnerships and use them to continuously improve our product and our markets.”",https://theproducenews.com/sites/default/files/2025-10/dept_0.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:19.371997

Under its Capacity*Connect proposal, Xcel Energy will install up to 200 MW of battery storage resources at strategic locations on the grid by 2028. Deployed in collaboration with Sparkfund, the distributed energy resources will help meet increasing demand for electricity, maintain reliable service for customers, maximize the efficiency of existing infrastructure and support local jobs.

“We’re focused on supporting economic growth and the needs of our communities by building out and modernizing our energy grid,” said Ryan Long, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. “We believe distributed energy resources are an important part of that strategy. They will complement our current plans for additional renewable and firm dispatchable generating resources to meet our customers’ needs.”

Xcel Energy’s approach takes advantage of its integrated system planning processes to determine the best customer locations to install the new battery storage resources. The company will integrate the battery storage into its system operations, charging the batteries during times when energy is inexpensive and dispatching that energy to serve all customers during periods of peak demand.

“By storing energy when it’s cheap, delivering it when it’s needed most and placing assets where they maximize grid value, Xcel Energy is delivering reliable energy to customers today and building a grid that is ready for tomorrow,” said Pier LaFarge, CEO of Sparkfund. “Sparkfund will help Xcel Energy deploy distributed energy resources to meet growing customer energy needs, support economic growth in Minnesota and unlock the full value of the U.S. electric grid.”

Battery storage is an important part of Minnesota’s energy future. Xcel Energy’s recently approved Upper Midwest Energy Plan calls for the installation of 600 MW of energy storage by the end of 2030. The proposed distributed capacity procurement will help achieve that goal, and Xcel Energy is bringing it forward to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission with the encouragement of many stakeholders.

Xcel Energy intends to locate the batteries at local businesses, commercial or industrial sites, or nonprofit organizations. This provides more customers — including those in environmental justice communities — with an opportunity to benefit financially from hosting clean energy technologies. Hosts would receive direct payments for participating in the program. Each site will have approximately 1 to 3 MW of storage (1 MW is about the size of a shipping container).

Xcel Energy, in collaboration with Sparkfund, will scale the deployment so the grid can keep pace with increasing demand while prioritizing local workers and complying with the company’s labor standards. Xcel Energy will operate each battery storage asset to maintain safety and security of the system.

With this approach, Xcel Energy and Sparkfund will closely review performance, costs and customer experience as the program grows, ensuring it is cost-effective while supporting a clean, reliable and safe grid.

“The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.” No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013.","BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — U.S. officials in the coming days are set to hold the government's biggest coal sales in more than a decade, offering 600 million tons from publicly owned reserves next to strip mines in Montana and Wyoming.

The sales are a signature piece of President Donald Trump's ambitions for companies to dig more coal from federal lands and burn it for electricity. Yet most power plants served by those mines plan to quit burning coal altogether within 10 years, an Associated Press data analysis shows.

Three other mines poised for expansions or new leases under Trump also face declining demand as power plants use less of their coal and in some cases shut down, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

Those market realities raise a fundamental question about the Republican administration's push to revive a heavily polluting industry that long has been in decline: Who's going to buy all that coal?

The question looms over the administration's enthusiastic embrace of coal, a leading contributor to climate change. It also shows the uncertainty inherent in inserting those policies into markets where energy-producing customers make long-term decisions with massive implications, not just for their own viability but for the future of the planet, in an ever-shifting political landscape.

Rushing to approve projects

The upcoming lease sales in Montana and Wyoming are in the Powder River Basin, home to the most productive U.S. coal fields.

Officials say they will go forward beginning Monday despite the government shutdown. The administration exempted from furlough those workers who process fossil fuel permits and leases.

Democratic President Joe Biden last year acted to block future coal leases in the region, citing their potential to make climate change worse. Burning the coal from the two leases being sold in coming days would generate more than 1 billion tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide, according to a Department of Energy formula.

Trump rejected climate change as a “con job” during a Sept. 23 speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an assessment that puts him at odds with scientists. He praised coal as “beautiful"" and boasted about the abundance of U.S. supplies while deriding solar and wind power. Administration officials said Wednesday that they were canceling $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states won by Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

In response to an order from Trump on his first day in office in January, coal lease sales that had been shelved or stalled were revived and rushed to approval, with considerations of greenhouse gas emissions dismissed. Administration officials have advanced coal mine expansions and lease sales in Utah, North Dakota, Tennessee and Alabama, in addition to Montana and Wyoming.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said Monday that the administration is opening more than 20,000 square miles (52,000 square kilometers) of federal lands to mining. That is an area bigger than New Hampshire and Vermont combined.

The administration also sharply reduced royalty rates for coal from federal lands, ordered a coal-fired power plant in Michigan to stay open past planned retirement dates and pledged $625 million to recommission or modernize coal plants amid growing electricity demand from artificial intelligence and data centers.

“We're putting American miners back to work,” Burgum said, flanked by coal miners and Republican politicians. “We've got a demand curve coming at us in terms of the demand for electricity that is literally going through the roof.”

Coal demand plummets

The AP's finding that power plants served by mines on public lands are burning less coal reflects an industrywide decline that began in 2007.

Energy experts and economists were not surprised. They expressed doubt that coal would ever reclaim dominance in the power sector. Interior Department officials did not respond to questions about future demand for coal from public lands.

But it will take time for more electricity from planned natural gas and solar projects to come online. That means Trump’s actions could give a short-term bump to coal, said Umed Paliwal, an expert in electricity markets at the University of California, Berkeley.

“Eventually coal will get pushed out of the market,” Paliwal said. “The economics will just eat the coal generation over time.”

The coal sales in Montana and Wyoming were requested by Navajo Nation-owned company. The Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) has been one of the largest industry players since buying several major mines in the Powder River Basin during a 2019 bankruptcy auction. Those mines supply 34 power plants in 19 states.

Twenty-one of the plants are scheduled to stop burning coal in the next decade. They include all five plants using coal from NTEC's Spring Creek mine in Montana.

In filings with federal officials, the company said the fair market value of 167 million tons of federal coal next to the Spring Creek mine was just over $126,000.

That is less than one-tenth of a penny per ton, a fraction of what coal brought in its heyday. By comparison, the last large-scale lease sale in the Powder River Basin, also for 167 million tons of coal, drew a bid of $35 million in 2013. Federal officials rejected that as too low.

NTEC said the low value was supported by prior government reviews predicting fewer buyers for coal. The company said taxpayers would benefit in future years from royalties on any coal mined.

“The market for coal will decline significantly over the next two decades. There are fewer coal mines expanding their reserves, there are fewer buyers of thermal coal and there are more regulatory constraints,” the company said.

In central Wyoming on Wednesday, the government will sell 440 million tons of coal next to NTEC’s Antelope Mine. Just over half of the 29 power plants served by the mine are scheduled to stop burning coal by 2035.

Among them is the Rawhide plant in northern Colorado. It is due to quit coal in 2029 but will keep making electricity with natural gas and 30 megawatts of solar panels.

Aging plants and optimism

The largest U.S. coal company has offered a more optimistic take on coal's future. Because new nuclear and gas plants are years away, Peabody Energy suggested in September that demand for coal in the U.S. could increase 250 million tons annually — up almost 50% from current volumes.

Peabody’s projection was based on the premise that existing power plants can burn more coal. That amount, known as plant capacity, dropped by about half in recent years.

""U.S. coal is clearly in comeback mode,"" Peabody's president, James Grech, said in a recent conference call with analysts. “The U.S. has more energy in its coal reserves than any nation has in any one energy source.”

No large coal power plants have come online in the U.S. since 2013. Most existing plants are 40 years old or older. Money pledged by the administration to refurbish older plants will not go very far given that a single boiler component at a plant can cost $25 million to replace, said Nikhil Kumar with GridLab, an energy consulting group.

That leads back to the question of who will buy the coal.

“I don't see where you get all this coal consumed at remaining facilities,"" Kumar said.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/ap25276658907776.41w1FKiQVM.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:49.763611

Attorneys for the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Rhode Island Center for Justice (RICJ), along with a group of businesses and nonprofits from across the nation, sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today to reverse the Trump administration’s illegal termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program, a program designated by Congress to save money for Rhode Island’s consumers while providing union jobs for Rhode Island workers.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s decision to terminate all funding for the Solar for All program. Local attorneys representing the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, Southern Environmental Law Center, Lawyers for Good Government, and the Conservation Law Foundation filed the suit.

Plaintiffs include the RI AFL-CIO, which was relying on Solar for All to expand renewable and cheaper power while ensuring high-quality union careers for a new generation. RI AFL-CIO invested time and money in developing training and apprenticeship programs to increase the implementation of solar energy. The RI Center for Justice is also joining the challenge as a nonprofit working to lower the high cost of electricity for low-income consumers and to provide sustainable, uninterrupted access to vital electricity in their homes by preventing their utilities from being shut off.

“Solar energy is key to Rhode Island’s march towards a carbon-free economy. The Solar for All program is critical to meeting the mandates of the Act on Climate and could lead to hundreds of good-paying union jobs. That is why the Rhode Island AFL-CIO is happy to join this court action,” said Patrick Crowley, President of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. “Our members want this program back up and running as soon as possible.”

“Our clients are struggling with unaffordable electric bills and facing a cycle of shut-offs that puts the health and safety of utility customers, including those who are elderly and living with disabilities, at risk,” said Jennifer L. Wood, Executive Director of Rhode Island Center for Justice. “Affordable access to solar is vital as part of the long-term solution to meeting the Act on Climate goals in Rhode Island while not leaving low-income Rhode Islanders behind. We need this program reinstated so our clients can be included in the benefits of solar energy ‘for all.’”

“Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy,” said Amy R. Romero, Chief Legal Counsel of Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island. “EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy security in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this program. The Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, along with its colleagues, has brought suit against the federal government to enforce the law enacted by Congress and ensure Rhode Islanders receive what Congress intended.”

Before EPA’s abrupt termination of the Solar for All program in August 2025, the EPA obligated $7 billion in grant funding that Congress had directed to provide to states, territories, tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits across the country to develop long-lasting solar energy programs for low-income and disadvantaged communities. According to the EPA, the average low-income household benefiting from the Solar for All grant program would have saved about $400 each year from their electricity bills. Programs funded by Solar for All would have created hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs all across the country. Additionally, the EPA estimated that the Solar for All program would have cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, equal to the emissions of over seven million passenger vehicles.

While a subsequent Congress repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, it explicitly did not repeal the Solar for All program retroactively, rescinding only “unobligated balances.” Yet instead of distributing the Solar for All funds as Congress mandated, the EPA unlawfully announced the termination of the Solar for All program, which will result in the loss of access to affordable solar energy in nearly a million low-income households and the loss of good-paying, high-quality jobs, especially in the low-income and disadvantaged communities that Congress intended these funds to benefit.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FJun!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F147fd6af-1fbf-4685-b4e7-4c9b9cbfd2ea_1500x844.jpeg",N,,2025-10-06 12:07:49.809630

By Apex Clean Energy

Apex Clean Energy is proud to bring Big Bluestem Wind to Henry County, a project designed to deliver clean, reliable electricity while creating long-term economic opportunity for local families, schools, and communities. And despite recent changes in federal legislation — including the phase-out of tax credits and new executive orders — one thing remains steady: renewable energy is the cheapest form of power generation Americans can put on the grid — with or without subsidies.

Built to Last—With or Without Subsidies

Recent federal actions like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and Executive Order 14315 have tightened rules around renewable energy tax credits. But here’s the truth: Wind Energy doesn’t depend on subsidies to succeed.

–Economics First: Wind and solar energy are now the most affordable sources of electricity on the grid—even without federal incentives. According to Lazard, wind has seen a cost reduction of 85% over the last 25 years due to innovations in turbine technology, plus markets of scale and improved siting.

–A Technology Improving for You: It’s not just the cost of wind farms that’s better now. Many of the technological innovations in wind energy have improved the experience of living near a wind farm. Serrated turbine blade edges and variable-speed operation both minimize noise. Fewer, taller turbines declutter the view. And the use of Aircraft Detection Lighting Systems (ADLS), on today’s turbines means you won’t see blinking lights unless a plane flies nearby.

—Not Affected by Offshore or Public Land Restrictions: Executive orders restricting the siting of wind energy only apply to offshore wind and the leasing of federal land. Apex is a private company developing projects by leasing private land in accordance with state and local laws.

Jobs, Revenue, and Local Investment

Renewable energy projects like Big Bluestem Wind can be real, homegrown economic drivers.

–Jobs for Local Workers: Big Bluestem will create hundreds of well-paid construction jobs for Illinois laborers, and up to 12 full-time careers.

–Revenue for Schools and Services: Over its lifespan, Big Bluestem will generate $95 million in property tax revenue for schools, fire districts, libraries, and county services. Over $55 million of that will go to local school districts.

–Reliable Lease Payments: Participating landowners will receive annual payments, helping families plan for the future with confidence.

In Illinois alone, Apex projects in development represent over $7.9 billion in projected investment, $66 million in annual payments to landowners, nearly $1.2 billion in local tax revenue during the first 30 years, and over 3.9 gigawatts of homegrown, pollution-free energy.

Meeting Illinois’s Growing Energy Needs

America needs more power. A 2024 survey of 100,000 Americans by Ernst Young found that two-thirds of Americans could not afford a 10% increase in their energy costs, yet prices for consumers are going up as data centers, AI, electrification, and industrial growth drive unprecedented demand. An “all of the above” strategy is needed to deliver more power to the grid, and renewable energy projects like Big Bluestem Wind are doing their part. 95% of projects in the United States in line to be permitted and built are solar, storage, and wind and according to Time, clean power projects can alleviate price pressure on the grid.

30%: Trump Fails To Kill NEVI Funding, Speeds It Up Instead

Longtime readers of this publication and industry pros probably know the acronym NEVI: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the program allocated $5 billion in funding for DC fast chargers for states to dole out in the form of grant money. As part of its anti-green energy and cost-cutting push, the Trump administration sought to cancel that funding, but a federal court overruled that move in July.

Since then, Politico reports, more than 40 states are in the process of unlocking their NEVI funding—and red states like Texas and Montana lead the way. At least 32 say they have gotten a green light. And Trump's Department of Transportation actually seems to be offering more flexibility on where these chargers can be placed.

The publication calls this ""a major acceleration."" More on why, with emphasis mine below:

The new guidance that DOT issued in August largely kept the Biden administration’s rules but ditched a contentious requirement that chargers be placed every 50 miles along major highways. It also directed states to quickly submit updated implementation plans to access the funds. In the weeks since, at least 44 states and Washington, D.C., have submitted their plans, spokespeople for those states told POLITICO.

In a statement Friday, DOT spokesperson Nathaniel Sizemore said the Biden administration had added requirements to NEVI that were “difficult to understand and implement,” and that the huge amount of money that remained unobligated when the former president left office was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”

“Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient,” Sizemore said. “If a [state’s] submitted plan meets the requirements detailed in the updated program guidance, it will be approved and the State’s NEVI funding will be made available for obligation.”

State and industry officials said the rush to access the money was due to both pent-up enthusiasm for the charger cash and a positive reception to the flexibility offered under the new rules.

“We’re already seeing states reengage and move more quickly toward accessing funds,” said David Piperno, chief financial officer at SparkCharge, an EV fleet charging provider. “The overall tone has shifted and there’s a new urgency to put these dollars to work.”

One transportation official told Politico that the strategic placement of chargers in America is about to get better, and at more gas stations and existing stops, because there's no longer this arbitrary 50-mile requirement. That was often very difficult to implement in, say, places like Alaska, which might have 80-mile stretches of rural highway with no communities along the way.

So, to recap: Trump tried to cancel EV charger funding, failed, declined to appeal in court, and has somehow put new rules in place that may actually be cutting red tape around deployment. What a time to be alive.

More from that story:

But it also reflects a growing reality: Millions of EVs are expected to hit the road in the coming years, regardless of Trump’s policies. And their drivers are going to need places to charge.

“If you look at the states that are putting their [charging] plans and their money back into play the soonest, it’s really states that recognize their EV adoption rate is going to continue to climb,” said Joshua Rodriguez, program director for environment at the nonpartisan American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Red or blue or purple, it doesn’t really matter.”

It's a good sign that, tax credits or no, you can't stop progress.

60%: Stellantis' U.S. Brands Could Get A Big Capital Boost

One major criticism of Stellantis’ former CEO is that he steered capital and R&D investments toward the wrong brands within the European-American conglomerate. American brands like Jeep and Ram make much of Stellantis' revenue, yet they've been dealing with overpriced and aging lineups for years. (I am not saying this magically would've prevented those brands from making lackluster EVs, but it certainly didn't help.)

According to a new report, that could change soon. Bloomberg indicates Stellantis' American brands are about to get a major boost:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants—for re-openings, hiring and new models—in states including Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

[...] The new CEO has started scrapping some European investments, withdrawing support from a joint hydrogen fuel cell venture with Michelin and Forvia SE. Stellantis also is mulling a sale of its Free2move car-sharing business, Bloomberg reported this week. Earlier this year, the automaker hired McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice on Maserati and Alfa Romeo. It has repeatedly denied any plans to sell Maserati.

This U.S. focus makes sense for several reasons. For one, it's Stellantis going where the money is; its sales are lagging in Europe, and it faces severe factory overcapacity there too. And Jeep, Ram and even Dodge are what pay a lot of the bills. Plus, the American investments are necessary at a time when the company is getting hammered by Trump tariffs.

With any luck, this will also mean better U.S. investments into, at the very least, hybrid powertrains. Stellantis can't bet on V8 engines to win the future.

90%: Elon Musk's Turnover Problem

You can't really disrupt an industry the way Tesla did without busting your ass. But one problem within the company is that it still runs at the pace of an early-stage startup, and this has led to rapid-fire turnover that's somehow accelerated in recent years.

The Financial Times (subscription required) has the scoop on the burnout factor at Tesla, which is now endemic to Musk's other companies too:

Important members of Tesla’s US sales team, battery and power-train operations, public affairs arm, and its chief information officer have all recently departed, as well as core members of the Optimus robot and artificial intelligence teams on which Musk has bet the future of the company.

While many left happily after long service to found start-ups or take career breaks, there has also been an uptick in those quitting from burnout, or disillusionment with Musk’s strategic pivots, mass lay-offs and his politics, the people said.

“The one constant in Elon’s world is how quickly he burns through deputies,” said one of the billionaire’s advisers. “Even the board jokes, there’s time and then there’s ‘Tesla time’. It’s a 24/7 campaign-style work ethos. Not everyone is cut out for that.”

Robert Keele, xAI’s general counsel, ended his 16-month tenure in early August by posting an AI-generated video of a suited lawyer screaming while shovelling molten coal. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough,” he commented.

It's certainly not news that working for Musk can be brutal. But this situation is also intertwined with Tesla's apparent pivot away from building newer and cheaper EVs, and more to the unproven spaces of robotics and AI, the story notes:

Tesla has traditionally been the most stable part of Musk’s conglomerate. But many of the top team left after it culled 14,000 jobs in April 2024. Some departures were triggered as Musk moved investment away from new electric vehicle and battery projects that many employees saw as key to its mission of reducing global emissions—and prioritised robotics, AI and self-driving robotaxis.

Employees also perceive Musk’s rivalry with [Sam] Altman—with whom he co-founded OpenAI, before they fell out — to be behind the pressure being put on staff.

“Elon’s got a chip on his shoulder from ChatGPT and is spending every waking moment trying to put Sam out of business,” said one recent top departee.

I suppose we'll see what this era of Tesla is really capable of with tomorrow's reveal of the allegedly cheaper Model Y variant.

100%: How Much EV Charging Does America Need?

If you say ""more than we have now,"" I'd certainly agree there. And I also think the U.S. over-indexes on DC fast-charging when it could stand to have more slower Level 2 charging everywhere, from movie theater parking lots to apartment complexes.

But let's imagine the future when we're past this current moment and EVs are at a tipping point. When do we hit ""enough"" public EV chargers? And what does that even look like?

This milestone marks the transformation of legacy energy liabilities into measurable, bankable climate assets.

This achievement proves oil and gas can lead in measurable, financeable climate action.

Share

The flagship project, centered on the Christopher Facility and a deep gas well in West Texas, followed a rigorous, commodity-grade Plug and Abandonment (P&A) process that permanently eliminated existing emissions and future methane (CH₄) leakage - a greenhouse gas over 25× more potent than CO₂.

All emission reductions were independently verified by a third-party accredited auditor under ISO 14064-3, CORSIA ensuring methodological rigor, transparency, and alignment with international standards.

The insured tokens are created under the Blu Diamond Standard and underwritten by global insurers, combining engineering assurance, technology-backed permanence, independent verification, and financial-grade credibility. Insurance transforms these verified climate outcomes into bankable commodities; unlocking price discovery, preserving value, and integrating environmental assets into capital markets.

Scaling a Repeatable Global Model

As a pioneer in engineered methane avoidance, Last Mile is setting a global precedent for converting oil and gas decommissioning into climate assets. These credits can be recognized in voluntary markets and converted into compliance instruments, tapping demand worldwide.

Through digital traceability, dual-custody verification, rigorous third-party auditing, and AI-driven monitoring, each credit’s lifecycle - from engineering intervention to insurance activation to market transfer - is fully auditable and regulatory-ready.

“This achievement proves oil and gas can lead in measurable, financeable climate action. By integrating digital traceability, we’ve created a repeatable blueprint that converts decommissioning liabilities into globally recognized, insured environmental assets. This isn’t just compliance: it’s a profitable, scalable sustainability strategy.” Zach Wagner, CEO, Last Mile Production

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.
A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.
China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems.
Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years.","More and more, big arrays of lithium-ion batteries are being hooked up to electrical grids around the U.S. to store power that can be discharged in times of high demand.

But as more energy storage is added, residents in some places are pushing back due to fears that the systems will go up in flames, as a massive facility in California did earlier this year.

Proponents maintain that state-of-the-art battery energy storage systems are safe, but more localities are enacting moratoriums.

""We're not guinea pigs for anybody ... we are not going to experiment, we're not going to take risk,"" said Michael McGinty, the mayor of Island Park, New York, which passed a moratorium in July after a storage system was proposed near the village line.

At least a few dozen localities around the United States have moved to temporarily block development of big battery systems in recent years.

Long Island, where the power grid could get a boost in the next few years as offshore wind farms come online, has been a hotbed of activism, even drawing attention recently from the Trump administration. Opponents there got a boost in August when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin visited New York to complain that the state was rushing approvals of sites in order to meet ""delusional"" green power goals — a claim state officials deny.

Battery growth spurt

Battery energy storage systems that suck up cheap power during periods of low demand, then discharge it at a profit during periods of high demand, are considered critical with the rise of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar.

Known by the acronym BESS, the systems can make grids more reliable and have been credited with reducing blackouts. A large battery system might consist of rows of shipping containers in a fenced lot, with the containers holding hundreds of thousands of cells.

China and the United States lead the world in rapidly adding battery storage energy systems. However, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Netherlands, Chile, Canada and the U.K. have commissioned or started construction on large projects since 2024, too, according to research from BloombergNEF.

In the U.S., California and Texas have been leaders in battery storage. But other states are moving quickly, often with privately developed systems. While the Trump administration has been unsupportive or even hostile to renewable energy, key tax credits for energy storage projects were maintained in the recently approved federal budget for qualified projects that begin construction in the next eight years.

Developers added 4,908 megawatts of battery storage capacity in the second quarter of 2025, with Arizona, California and Texas accounting for about three-quarters of that new capacity, according to a report from American Clean Power Association, an industry group. That's enough to power nearly 1.7 million households.

New York has an ambitious goal to add 6,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030, half of it large-scale systems.

Lithium-ion fire worries

Opposition to the storage systems usually focuses on the possibility of thermal runaway, a chain reaction of uncontrolled heating that can lead to fire or an explosion. Opponents point to past fires and ask: What if that happens in my neighborhood?

A battery storage system in Moss Landing, California caught fire in January, sending plumes of toxic smoke into the atmosphere and forcing the evacuation of about 1,500 people..

Experts in the field say battery systems have become safer over the years. Ofodike Ezekoye, a combustion expert and professor of mechanical engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, notes that failures are relatively infrequent, but also that no engineered system is 100% foolproof.

""This is a relatively immature technology that is maturing quickly, so I think that there are a lot of really thoughtful researchers and other stakeholders who are trying to improve the overall safety of these systems,"" Ezekoye said.

Battery storage proponents say a facility like Moss Landing, where batteries were stored indoors, would not be allowed in New York, which has adopted fire codes that require modular enclosure design with required minimum spacing to keep fires from spreading.

Blocking battery systems

People who live near proposed sites are not always assured.

In Washington state, the city of Maple Valley approved a six-month moratorium in July as a way ""to protect us until we know more,"" said city manager Laura Philpot.

Voters in Halstead, Kansas, which has a moratorium, will be asked this Election Day whether they want to prohibit larger battery storage systems inside the city limits, according to Mayor Dennis Travis. He hopes the city can one day host a safely designed storage system, and said local opponents wrongly fixate on the California fire.

The number of localities passing moratoriums began rising in 2023 and 2024, mirroring trends in battery storage deployment, with a notable cluster in New York, according to a presentation last year by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Winnie Sokolowski is among area residents against a proposed 250-megawatt lithium-ion storage system in the Town of Ulster, New York, contending it is too close to schools and homes.

""They're banking on nothing happening, but I don't think you can place it where they're proposing and assume nothing's going to happen,"" Sokolowski said. ""It's just too risky if it does.""

The developer, Terra-Gen, said the design will keep a fire from spreading and that the system ""poses no credible, scientific-based threat to neighbors, the public or the environment.""

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President Doreen Harris said she's confident the state has the right safety rules in place, and that scaling up the use of battery storage systems will ""strengthen and modernize our grid.""

She noted there also were local concerns in the early stages of siting solar farms, which have since proven their benefits.",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/energy.RcWqRjWyCI.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.55&fp-y=0.38&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:37.836833

This includes life-cycle assessments and product-carbon footprints, which rely on emissions data from facilities upstream in the value chain.
Projects totaling $77 billion in capital expenditures plan on making use of 45Q, but companies need to access data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to claim the credit.
“Canceling the greenhouse gas reporting program means you can’t get 45Q,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm.
Companies would still need to collect emissions data to comply with state regulations, demands from investors and requirements from countries they export to.","A foundational data source that shapes the work of sustainability professionals across multiple sectors will disappear if the Trump administration goes ahead with plans to scrap the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, critics of the move warn.

The program, run since 2009 by the Environmental Protection Agency, requires around 8,000 oil refineries, power plants and other industrial facilities to submit annual emissions reports to the agency. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin proposed scrapping the program last month, describing it as “nothing more than bureaucratic red tape.”

Sustainability professionals see it differently.

“The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program matters to everyone, not just the companies that report,” said Sean Hackett, senior manager for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund. “It’s the most comprehensive source of emissions data. It underpins investor confidence, regulatory oversight and supply chain accountability across the economy.”

“The corporate world has built sustainability and investment plans around all it does,” added John Milko, senior managing policy advisor at Carbon180, a carbon removal nonprofit.

Cascading impacts

Ending the program would trigger a cascade of negative impacts, they and others warn, because the program provides a standardized data set that feeds into work across the economy. This includes life-cycle assessments and product-carbon footprints, which rely on emissions data from facilities upstream in the value chain.

In construction, for example, companies building data centers and other facilities are increasingly demanding that low-carbon steel and concrete be used. “We want to move to a system that improves the calculations of that embodied carbon,” said Milko. “Shuttering the largest-scale program that is seeking to standardize that data is counterproductive to the sustainability goals of large corporations.”

The move also places billions of dollars of announced investments in carbon removal in jeopardy, including direct air capture projects and plans to capture and store emissions from industrial facilities. The economics of these projects rely on a tax credit known as 45Q, which was made more valuable in 2022. Projects totaling $77 billion in capital expenditures plan on making use of 45Q, but companies need to access data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program to claim the credit.

“Canceling the greenhouse gas reporting program means you can’t get 45Q,” said Julio Friedmann, chief scientist at Carbon Direct, a carbon management firm. “Whether this is intentional or accidental, it’s very bad. It will chill investment, cost time and money and impair trade.”

Increased costs and complexity

Zeldin framed his proposal as a move that would save businesses billions of dollars by cutting regulatory burdens, but experts warn of increased costs to businesses that report to the program. Companies would still need to collect emissions data to comply with state regulations, demands from investors and requirements from countries they export to. “Without that federal baseline, companies would face a patchwork of state and voluntary programs that would increase costs, uncertainty and complexity,” said Hackett.

I’d dump DS, but if you get rid of Maserati then maybe DS can do what Chrysler is going to do in the United States (no V8s for Europe, though).
If you want more manufacturing in the United States, then the automakers who build here should get some sort of tariff relief.

In particular, I’ve harped a lot on Stellantis for letting Chrysler and Dodge wither on the vine, but it comes from a place of caring.

It’s why a new report hinting that Stellantis may be trying to help those brands out is music to my ears. This is good news, and I’m feeling like I need to make The Morning Dump a little more positive after Archie Manning disappointed the Longhorn faithful again this weekend.

Other good news? Well, it sounds like the White House might be considering offsetting tariff costs for manufacturers who build cars in the United States. What’s that going to look like? No one knows! How will that work? See the previous answer.

BYD doesn’t have to worry about U.S. tariffs at the moment, and it can now officially celebrate besting Tesla for four straight quarters in EV sales. In five years, that might look like when the Red Sox beat up on the Astros earlier this season. It doesn’t matter anymore!

And, finally, Genesis has established itself as a real player in the luxury space. The next move? Show it can build a performance identity.

How To Fix Stellantis, Redux

I have never been even partially responsible for a company that’s built a car. When David finishes the Jeep, I suppose that’ll change. Until then, I understand why you’d wonder where I get off telling car execs what they’re doing wrong. Sure. Fair.

Though, in the case of Stellantis, I specifically pointed out all the reasons why I thought the company was in bad shape, even after reporting huge profits. Stellantis shuffled off its CEO less than a year later, for many of the reasons that I identified, and the company has swung from big profits to losses.

I think I like the new guy, Anthonio Filosa, or at the very least, I think he’s saying the right things and deserves some time to try and get it right. According to a new report from Bloomberg, he’s maybe going to get a lot right:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who declined to be identified discussing information that’s not public. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants — including re-openings, hiring and new models — in states such as Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

Stellantis is focused on reclaiming the past success of the Jeep brand and is considering fresh investments into Dodge, which could result in a new Dodge V8 muscle car, and possibly even the Chrysler brand in the long term, some of the people said. Talks are ongoing, no final decision has been made and the amount and targeted projects could still change, the people said.

I guess it’s time to play the “Re-Build Stellantis Plan Waltz” one more time:

Jeep: A top and bottom approach. The most important brand, so give engineers more money and fight back against Bronco with a more modern Wrangler. At the same time, more volume hybrids that looks good.

Ram: I still think putting it under Dodge is smart, but in lieu of that: A midsize hybrid truck, which the company has basically said will happen.

Dodge: Muscle car? Sure. A replacement for the Durango is also key, and an entry-level crossover that can compete with the HR-Vs of the world. Maybe something French?

Chrysler: Literally, anything that’s not a van. More specifically, make it your luxury brand, build a luxury car and a luxury SUV. And, when you do that, you should also…

Kick The Italian Brands Out Of The US: You can’t do everything at once. Sergio’s dream was a great dream, but it wasn’t implemented properly. Sell Maserati (I know, I know, “it’s not for sale,” but sell it). Keep Alfa for Europe. Keep Fiat for Europe. I don’t care what you do with Lancia.

Keep Peugeot And Citroën, Dump DS: I love the French brands, and I can’t pretend like I don’t (I probably am emotionally invested in Lancia’s outcome a little). The French government owns a big chunk of the company, so there’s really no choice here. I’d dump DS, but if you get rid of Maserati then maybe DS can do what Chrysler is going to do in the United States (no V8s for Europe, though).

Leapmotor: Seems fine!

This gets way more complicated in practice.

Obviously, the UAW loves this plan. The White House is going to love this plan. The Italian government is going to hate it. You can’t make everyone happy, and Stellantis doesn’t have unlimited money.

After a lot of back-and-forth, the Tavares-run Stellantis committed itself to spending more in Europe. But with the company cutting back across the continent due to overcapacity, I don’t get how that’s going to work.

It sounds like Filosa is going to meet with the Italian unions later this month. Oh, to be a mosca on that wall.

The Anti-Inflation White House Allegedly Wants To Address Car Price Inflation

Inflation became such a bad word that President Biden named his signature piece of legislation the Inflation Reduction Act. I’m not sure how much reduction of inflation actually occurred, and it’s clear that the price of eggs had a lot to do with the election of President Trump.

Tariffs are historically inflationary, and it’s only a matter of time before companies raise prices to offset tariffs. Unless, unless… the White House does something to reverse or offset them.

Here’s Senator Bernie Moreno–a car dealer–explaining how this might work in a Reuters exclusive:

“The signal to the car companies around the world is look, you have final assembly in the U.S.: we’re going to reward you,” Moreno said in an interview. “For Ford, for Toyota, for Honda, for Tesla, for GM, those are the almost in order the top five domestic content vehicle producers – they’ll be immune to tariffs.”

[…]

Moreno added automakers with significant final production in the United States should get tariff breaks: “Look, at the end of the day, they’re doing exactly we want them to do – paying employees in America well and doing final assembly in the United States with the cars that they sell here.”

Asked for comment on the proposal, a White House official told Reuters that Trump and the administration “are committed to a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to securing domestic auto and auto parts production. Until any official action is signed by the president, however, any discussion about administration policymaking is speculative.”

I love the “almost in order” there. I guess it depends on which measure you’re looking at, but I assume somewhere in Senator Moreno’s mind he was aware that this is not the correct order. It doesn’t really matter because the concept is sound. If you want more manufacturing in the United States, then the automakers who build here should get some sort of tariff relief.

What this means in Realityville is another question.

The biggest sticking point is probably Canada and Mexico. President Trump clearly doesn’t love that there’s production in those places, but he was the one who wrote the most recent treaty (USCMA) that continued to make it efficient for companies to do so…

Will automakers like Toyota and Honda get a 1:1 discount on imported cars for every car built here? Or are automakers going to get a break if there’s “final assembly” and that means some parts made in Canada are fine? One of the biggest obstacles to building cars efficiently in the United States is the steel and aluminum tariffs, so will automakers get a break from that?

Again, the form that this takes is extremely important.

I’m torn on how to think about some of this. On one hand, President Biden and the Democrats have made a big deal out of bringing manufacturing back to the United States, and no small portion of the plants that carmakers are bragging about are ones that were already going to be built because of Biden-era policies. On the other hand, Democrats seemed mostly content to let the USMCA status quo continue (they might argue that one way to slow cross-border immigration is improve Mexico’s economy and allow more jobs there).

It likely makes sense for automakers to shift as much manufacturing here from overseas as they can because Democrats will probably take credit for the plants being built/planned if they somehow win back the White House in a few years. You think any Democrat President, on the off chance it happens, is going to ship the jobs back?

BYD Beats Tesla For Fourth Straight Quarter

Tesla v. BYD is potentially not the best framing for the Chinese car market over the long term, but it has some value in the moment. The fact that BYD has now gone a year straight selling more electric cars globally is a not-small detail, especially given that BYD doesn’t have the same market access that Tesla has.

It’s also interesting because Tesla and BYD both seem in trouble in China according to this Bloomberg article:

BYD is losing momentum in its home market, where policymakers are increasingly concerned about destructive competition. Tesla will have trouble replicating last quarter’s showing now that the US has phased out federal tax credits supporting EV purchases.

China’s government has sought to temper cutthroat competitive practices in the world’s biggest car market, where manufacturers have waged a relentless price war since early 2023. BYD has been at the fore of the discounting trend and in late August reported a surprise 30% drop in quarterly profit.

Both BYD and Tesla are more than capable of overcoming these challenges, although only BYD seems truly interested in building better cars. Tesla seems more into robots right now.

‘Driving Control, Precision, And Confidence’ Will Define The Future Of Genesis Performance Cars

I’ve written about this before, so I will try not to retread too much.

The larger automaker known as Hyundai went on a bit of a buying spree about a decade ago, bringing on some of the best designers and engineers from peak-era Germany. It’s how we ended up with the guy behind the best M cars tuning Velosters, and the guy who designed some of the best Audis, transforming Genesis into a real luxury player.

The Hyundai N cars are never quite the fastest, but damn if they don’t just feel right.

Genesis also has a host of highly competitive vehicles (I encouraged a friend to test one, and he fell in love), but it’s apparently not enough to merely make nice cars. What’s missing, according to the company, is a sense of true performance. That’s where the company’s Magma performance brand comes in.

BTW, let’s please recognize how metal that name is: MAGMA. I’m pretty sure I saw them open for Rob Zombie at L’Amour.

A big part of MAGMA’s mission will be planned by Manfred Harrer, head of the Vehicle Development Technology Unit at Hyundai (and ex- of Porsche, BMW, Audi, Apple…). Here’s what he told Automotive News what’s key to making this work:

“In my eyes, we have one gap with the brand and the brand image, and that’s the performance part,” Harrer said in a separate interview at the automaker’s Namyang R&D center south of Seoul.

“And this should be covered by our new Genesis Magma lineup.”

Part of the Magma proposition will be raw power and torque, acceleration and top speed, Harrer said. But the differentiator, he said, will be driving control, precision and confidence.

“This is the philosophy, from an engineering standpoint,” said Harrer, who previously worked on Apple’s discontinued electric vehicle project and earlier at Porsche, BMW and Audi. “It’s the preciseness and controllability of the powerful engines in these powerful cars.”

I like the way that sounds. Pure power is getting super boring, and while it’s not like AMG is just handing out 1,000 HP cars (that’s what SRT is for), I think N is a good example of Hyundai prioritizing feel over numbers.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

If you don’t have a daughter or, maybe, you don’t have ears, you may be unaware there’s another Taylor Swift album that just dropped on Friday. I don’t love it. I respect that she puts out a bunch of music and tries things. It’s also not really for me, sure, but as an enjoyer of the odd pop tune, I don’t think it’s doing anything new. Both the latest Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX album feel like they’re doing a lot more.

Oh, right. Sabrina Carpenter shows up on this album on the titular track and is predictably one of the better ones. The best song on the album thus far is probably “Actually Romantic.” People who care more than I do seem to think this is about Charli XCX, and I think that’s probably right (inasmuch as the song is about any one person and not about a few individuals, like the people in New York Magazine).

I suppose Charli fired the first shot with “Sympathy is a Knife,” but that song feels like less of a diss track and more just an artist sharing her own feelings of inadequacy? This kinda feels like punching down. Also, it’s pop music, it doesn’t matter.

With demand trends and supply chain challenges putting pressure on the electric vehicle (EV) industry, ITS aims to offer manufacturers and Tier 1 automakers safe, compliance-ready, and scalable operations tailored to today’s market.

“The EV transition is still accelerating, but companies are now facing headwinds that could cause significant demand fluctuation,” explained Kasia Wenker, VP of Solutions Engineering at ITS Logistics. “In this type of environment, a fixed facility optimized for the lowest cost during ideal conditions quickly becomes a liability. The flexibility to scale with demand while maintaining operational excellence is the real key to protecting against risk.”

The EV battery market has seen exceptional volatility over the past year, with geopolitical tension influencing both supply and demand. Tariffs on rare earth minerals as well as lithium-ion cells represent a threat to domestic EV battery production. Additionally, the rollback of the federal EV tax credit, which offered consumers up to $7,500 in tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles, is expected to decrease EV sales in the short term. Still, market optimism persists. Despite uncertainty, BloombergNEF forecasts U.S. EV passenger vehicle sales to more than double by 2030, representing 27% of total passenger car sales. While automakers anticipate a slight correction following record-high sales in August, most experts agree consumers will continue to purchase EVs for their environmental benefits and lower gasoline costs. For now, many brands are augmenting their strategy to include a mix of hybrid and ICE models in addition to all-electric vehicles.

“Current market dynamics, and the reactions we’ve seen from automakers so far, underscore a clear truth: to remain profitable in uncertainty, you must embrace flexibility — without compromising safety or compliance,” Wenker continued.

Lithium-ion batteries are high-value, hazardous, and subject to strict oversight across transport and storage. They require compliance with DOT and IMDG regulations in transit, and must meet NFPA 855, FM Global, and insurer requirements in storage. Variations in chemistry, packaging, and state-of-charge add operational complexity that traditional logistics networks can struggle to adapt to real-time demand and customer needs.

To address this, ITS Logistics has developed multi-tenant, campus-style Battery Hubs in Indianapolis and Dallas, designed to flex capacity up or down as demand shifts, support new model launches or recalls, and provide geographic diversity across the U.S. for regional agility. The network balances flexibility with critical needs for battery supply chains, including:

• Fire suppression and environmental monitoring systems designed specifically for lithium-ion risk and aligned with upcoming regulatory changes.

• Boots-on-the-ground, extensively trained operators and hazmat-certified staff executing battery-specific procedures and compliance documentation.

• FTZ-ready space for managing imports, completing assembly tasks, and protecting cash flow.

• Integrated hazmat-certified transportation across road, intermodal, and drayage, seamlessly coordinated with warehousing to reduce handoffs and delays.",https://www.ajot.com/images/uploads/article/_large/Battery_Hub_PR.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:09:31.842539

Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A.","A coalition of solar energy companies, labor unions, nonprofit groups and homeowners sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday over its termination of $7 billion in grants intended to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels on their homes.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Rhode Island, accused the agency of illegally revoking the money under the Solar for All program without congressional approval. It expanded an ever-widening legal battle over President Trump’s efforts to claw back billions of dollars in climate funding that had been approved by the Biden administration.

The lead plaintiff is the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a group of labor unions that had trained electricians and other workers to install solar panels in the state. While the unions did not directly receive funds under the Solar for All program, they had been counting on work that would have followed a $49.3 million grant to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.

“Now that the program is on hold, potentially hundreds of job opportunities are lost,” said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. He said the Trump administration had jeopardized hundreds of additional jobs for his members by ordering work to halt on several wind farms off the coast of New England.

“It’s not just a one-two punch to the work force that I represent,” Mr. Crowley said. “It really is a one-two punch to the entire state of Rhode Island because our energy costs need to be controlled, and renewable energy sources like solar and wind are a key component of that.”

Other plaintiffs include a homeowner in Atlanta who had applied for free rooftop solar panels from an initiative supported by a $156 million grant to the Georgia Bright Communities Coalition and companies that install solar panels in Georgia and Pennsylvania.

The plaintiffs are represented by nonprofit legal advocacy groups including the Southern Environmental Law Center and Lawyers for Good Government. Brigit Hirsch, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on the suit, citing an agency policy of not commenting on pending litigation.

The Solar for All program was not only intended to help low- and moderate-income homeowners. It was also meant to expand community solar initiatives, which bring solar energy to people who don’t own their own homes or otherwise can’t install their own panels.

The program was projected to help 900,000 households get access to solar power, according to estimates by the Biden administration. The idea was to reduce the use of fossil fuels, the leading driver of climate change, while also helping to lower electricity bills. The participating households were expected to collectively save $350 million each year on utility costs.

Lee Zeldin, the E.P.A. administrator, said in August that he was ending the Solar for All program at the behest of Congress. He said that Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill, which Congress passed in July, had eliminated what he called “billions of green slush fund dollars” under Solar for All.

“The bottom line again is this: E.P.A. no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” Mr. Zeldin said in a video posted to social media.

But in the lawsuit, the coalition argued that the bill revoked only climate grants that the E.P.A. had not yet awarded. Under the Biden administration, the agency had awarded the Solar for All grants to 60 state agencies, nonprofit groups and Native American tribes.

The claim that the bill rescinded the Solar for All grants is “patently false and legally unsupportable,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government.

The Solar for All program was established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s signature climate law. The measure authorized a total of $27 billion in grants for green activities like installing electric vehicle charging stations and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.

Last month, an appeals court ruled against several nonprofit groups that had $16 billion in such grants frozen by the E.P.A. In a 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case and that the Trump administration had acted legally in its attempts to claw back the funds.

Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, said that because the case was essentially a dispute between the government and grant recipients, it belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. The lawsuit filed Monday is unlikely to face a similar setback, legal experts said, since it was not brought by the grant recipients.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/18/multimedia/01cli-solar-lawsuit/01cli-solar-lawsuit-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:04:51.647725

Trump Brings Fossil Fuel, Far-Right Think Tank Agenda To Government

An analysis of over 100 staffers' backgrounds reveals Texas oil money takeover of Trump administration, deep ties to fossil fuel industry and far right think tanks; Polluters get ‘concierge, white glove service’

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has installed more than 100 fossil fuel insiders, renewable energy opponents, corporate lobbyists, and far-right think tank alumni across nine agencies during his second term, according to a new analysis of the backgrounds of staffers appointed to roles in the administration.

The analysis by Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project of 111 officials identified:

43 former fossil fuel industry employees

29 former corporate executives

14 former corporate lawyers

12 people tied to fossil fuel-funded right-wing think tanks

7 people tied primarily to Republican politics such as elected officials and staffers pushing a fossil fuel or corporate agenda

6 from utility companies or the nuclear energy industry

The analysis also found that more than two-thirds (25 out of 37) of staff nominated to Senate-confirmable jobs at the Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of the Interior had ties to polluting interests.

The agencies have made dozens of hires from the fossil fuel sector and other polluting industries, as well as corporate lawyers and far-right think tank alumni who are enacting Trump’s policies designed to promote dirty energy and destroy America’s public lands.

The report details comments by a White House staffer speaking on an energy lobbyist’s podcast, stating the Trump administration is providing “concierge, white glove service” to dirty energy companies pushing pipelines, mining projects, and export terminals.

The report highlights the expansive influence of the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the America First Policy Institute in staffing the second Trump administration. Both of the far-right think tanks are funded by the Texas oil billionaire Tim Dunn, and have created a pipeline of Trump staffers to implement an extreme, pro-fossil fuel agenda.

The ascent of Dunn and other allied Texas donors represents a changing of the guard from the libertarian Koch network, which had extensive influence on the first Trump administration, yet has parted ways on some issues, such as Trump’s tariffs.

“This is nothing short of a Texas oil industry takeover of the U.S. government at the expense of consumers, the climate, public health, and public lands and waters,” said Alan Zibel, a research director with Public Citizen and a co-author of the report. “To execute his extreme, reckless, backward-looking fossil fuel agenda, Trump has stocked his administration with fossil fuel staffers and ideologues,”

“Texas-based billionaires have taken over the Trump administration, providing a steady stream of staffers and an extreme set of policy ideas that consciously favors the most polluting forms of energy,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, senior researcher with the Revolving Door Project. “Trump’s policies aid the fossil fuel industry’s exploitation of the public sphere for private profit while simultaneously sabotaging renewables and ensuring that the U.S. remains trapped in a dirty energy economy.”

At the same time, Trump has launched a far-reaching attack on renewable energy, with wind power hit the hardest. Offshore wind developers have been forced into court to defend projects, including an almost complete offshore wind farm. Since offshore wind turbines are sited in federal waters, the industry is especially vulnerable to Trump’s sabotage. The industry has long been the subject of a far-right think tank-backed anti-wind disinformation campaign.

Beyond the revolving door of corporate nominees and appointees, the report details numerous examples of Trump administration hires serving in, or nominated for, high positions with little, if any, subject matter expertise. Many have political connections, experience in other fields, or backgrounds in marketing, public relations and public speaking.

30%: Trump Fails To Kill NEVI Funding, Speeds It Up Instead

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Longtime readers of this publication and industry pros probably know the acronym NEVI: the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the program allocated $5 billion in funding for DC fast chargers for states to dole out in the form of grant money. As part of its anti-green energy and cost-cutting push, the Trump administration sought to cancel that funding, but a federal court overruled that move in July.

Since then, Politico reports, more than 40 states are in the process of unlocking their NEVI funding—and red states like Texas and Montana lead the way. At least 32 say they have gotten a green light. And Trump's Department of Transportation actually seems to be offering more flexibility on where these chargers can be placed.

The publication calls this ""a major acceleration."" More on why, with emphasis mine below:

The new guidance that DOT issued in August largely kept the Biden administration’s rules but ditched a contentious requirement that chargers be placed every 50 miles along major highways. It also directed states to quickly submit updated implementation plans to access the funds. In the weeks since, at least 44 states and Washington, D.C., have submitted their plans, spokespeople for those states told POLITICO.

In a statement Friday, DOT spokesperson Nathaniel Sizemore said the Biden administration had added requirements to NEVI that were “difficult to understand and implement,” and that the huge amount of money that remained unobligated when the former president left office was “a clear signal of the program’s failure.”

“Earlier this year, Secretary Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration launched a review of the program’s guidance to make the NEVI program more efficient,” Sizemore said. “If a [state’s] submitted plan meets the requirements detailed in the updated program guidance, it will be approved and the State’s NEVI funding will be made available for obligation.”

State and industry officials said the rush to access the money was due to both pent-up enthusiasm for the charger cash and a positive reception to the flexibility offered under the new rules.

“We’re already seeing states reengage and move more quickly toward accessing funds,” said David Piperno, chief financial officer at SparkCharge, an EV fleet charging provider. “The overall tone has shifted and there’s a new urgency to put these dollars to work.”

One transportation official told Politico that the strategic placement of chargers in America is about to get better, and at more gas stations and existing stops, because there's no longer this arbitrary 50-mile requirement. That was often very difficult to implement in, say, places like Alaska, which might have 80-mile stretches of rural highway with no communities along the way.

So, to recap: Trump tried to cancel EV charger funding, failed, declined to appeal in court, and has somehow put new rules in place that may actually be cutting red tape around deployment. What a time to be alive.

More from that story:

But it also reflects a growing reality: Millions of EVs are expected to hit the road in the coming years, regardless of Trump’s policies. And their drivers are going to need places to charge.

“If you look at the states that are putting their [charging] plans and their money back into play the soonest, it’s really states that recognize their EV adoption rate is going to continue to climb,” said Joshua Rodriguez, program director for environment at the nonpartisan American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. “Red or blue or purple, it doesn’t really matter.”

It's a good sign that, tax credits or no, you can't stop progress.

60%: Stellantis' U.S. Brands Could Get A Big Capital Boost

2025 Jeep Wagoneer S Limited

One major criticism of Stellantis’ former CEO is that he steered capital and R&D investments toward the wrong brands within the European-American conglomerate. American brands like Jeep and Ram make much of Stellantis' revenue, yet they've been dealing with overpriced and aging lineups for years. (I am not saying this magically would've prevented those brands from making lackluster EVs, but it certainly didn't help.)

According to a new report, that could change soon. Bloomberg indicates Stellantis' American brands are about to get a major boost:

Stellantis NV is planning to invest about $10 billion in the US as the troubled maker of Jeep sport utility vehicles and Ram pickups refocuses on the market that’s pivotal to its profits, according to people familiar with the situation.

The carmaker may announce in the coming weeks about $5 billion in fresh money on top of a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The investments over several years could be funneled into plants—for re-openings, hiring and new models—in states including Illinois and Michigan, the people said.

[...] The new CEO has started scrapping some European investments, withdrawing support from a joint hydrogen fuel cell venture with Michelin and Forvia SE. Stellantis also is mulling a sale of its Free2move car-sharing business, Bloomberg reported this week. Earlier this year, the automaker hired McKinsey & Co. for strategic advice on Maserati and Alfa Romeo. It has repeatedly denied any plans to sell Maserati.

This U.S. focus makes sense for several reasons. For one, it's Stellantis going where the money is; its sales are lagging in Europe, and it faces severe factory overcapacity there too. And Jeep, Ram and even Dodge are what pay a lot of the bills. Plus, the American investments are necessary at a time when the company is getting hammered by Trump tariffs.

With any luck, this will also mean better U.S. investments into, at the very least, hybrid powertrains. Stellantis can't bet on V8 engines to win the future.

90%: Elon Musk's Turnover Problem

You can't really disrupt an industry the way Tesla did without busting your ass. But one problem within the company is that it still runs at the pace of an early-stage startup, and this has led to rapid-fire turnover that's somehow accelerated in recent years.

The Financial Times (subscription required) has the scoop on the burnout factor at Tesla, which is now endemic to Musk's other companies too:

Important members of Tesla’s US sales team, battery and power-train operations, public affairs arm, and its chief information officer have all recently departed, as well as core members of the Optimus robot and artificial intelligence teams on which Musk has bet the future of the company.

While many left happily after long service to found start-ups or take career breaks, there has also been an uptick in those quitting from burnout, or disillusionment with Musk’s strategic pivots, mass lay-offs and his politics, the people said.

“The one constant in Elon’s world is how quickly he burns through deputies,” said one of the billionaire’s advisers. “Even the board jokes, there’s time and then there’s ‘Tesla time’. It’s a 24/7 campaign-style work ethos. Not everyone is cut out for that.”

Robert Keele, xAI’s general counsel, ended his 16-month tenure in early August by posting an AI-generated video of a suited lawyer screaming while shovelling molten coal. “I love my two toddlers and I don’t get to see them enough,” he commented.

It's certainly not news that working for Musk can be brutal. But this situation is also intertwined with Tesla's apparent pivot away from building newer and cheaper EVs, and more to the unproven spaces of robotics and AI, the story notes:

Tesla has traditionally been the most stable part of Musk’s conglomerate. But many of the top team left after it culled 14,000 jobs in April 2024. Some departures were triggered as Musk moved investment away from new electric vehicle and battery projects that many employees saw as key to its mission of reducing global emissions—and prioritised robotics, AI and self-driving robotaxis.

Employees also perceive Musk’s rivalry with [Sam] Altman—with whom he co-founded OpenAI, before they fell out — to be behind the pressure being put on staff.

“Elon’s got a chip on his shoulder from ChatGPT and is spending every waking moment trying to put Sam out of business,” said one recent top departee.

I suppose we'll see what this era of Tesla is really capable of with tomorrow's reveal of the allegedly cheaper Model Y variant.

A 2023 U.S. Department of Energy report found that Puerto Rico had more than enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity needs.","Conservation and community groups have won a legal challenge to federal plans to spend billions of dollars to rebuild Puerto Rico’s electric grid back to the centralized, fossil fuel-dependent status quo instead of investing post-disaster funding in distributed renewable energy.

Thursday’s ruling by the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico holds that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) violated the National Environmental Policy Act when it failed to consider rooftop solar, storage and other forms of distributed renewable energy to provide electricity to communities at risk from Puerto Rico’s hurricane-battered grid. The ruling orders FEMA to prepare an environmental impact statement that analyzes distributed renewable energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.

The new ruling found that “[m]ost Puerto Ricans depend on an electrical power infrastructure that relies primarily on fossil fuels,” which the court concluded “has proven inadequate, unreliable and extremely vulnerable to weather events, events whose effects will be more severe in the future due to climate change.”

The ruling goes on to find that “if FEMA funding continues to be channeled to fossil fuel-based infrastructure, it is unlikely that Puerto Rico will have the resources to pursue renewable energy alternatives in the near future,” explaining how “the record clearly shows that renewable energy alternatives were reasonable and feasible.”

”This decision shatters the misconception that there is only one way to transform the electrical system and, on the contrary, recognizes that the alternative we have promoted for years — a renewable, distributed system — is viable and should be seriously considered when allocating public funds,” said Federico Cintrón Moscoso, program director of El Puente de Williamsburg’s Latino Climate Action Network in Puerto Rico. “FEMA’s failure to consider the solar alternative violated the law and paved the way for the reconstruction of the same obsolete fossil-based system that brought us to this crisis in the first place. This decision, therefore, recognizes our right to an accessible and clean energy system, as stipulated by our local laws and collective aspirations. It also recognizes that we cannot aspire to transform our electrical system at the expense of our health and that of the environment. Energy issues must be addressed fairly because they are not separate from the well-being of people or the planet.”

The ruling comes after Hurricane Erin impacted the archipelago in August 2025 and left thousands of Puerto Ricans without power yet again. Earlier this year, chronic grid outages compelled Puerto Rico’s governor to pledge to improve the fossil fuel grid. This case involves funds that Congress already allocated to Puerto Rico in Hurricane Maria’s aftermath.

This case concerns FEMA’s use of disaster relief funds from 2017’s Hurricane Maria to invest at least $12 billion in projects that lock Puerto Ricans into decades of fossil-fuel dependence. FEMA’s projects conflict with Puerto Rico’s 2019 law setting a goal of 100% renewable energy by 2050 and Puerto Ricans’ own energy plan for local solar and storage. A 2023 U.S. Department of Energy report found that Puerto Rico had more than enough renewable energy potential to meet its electricity needs.

The lawsuit was brought by the Center for Biological Diversity and eight Puerto Rican community groups: Alianza Comunitaria Ambiental del Sureste, Campamento Contra las Cenizas en Peñuelas, Casa Tallaboeña de Formación Comunitaria y Resiliencia, Comité Caborrojeño Pro Salud y Ambiente, Comité Dialogo Ambiental, Comité Yabucoeno Pro-Calidad de Vida, El Puente de Williamsburg and Frente Unido Pro-Defensa del Valle de Lajas.

A Circular Future Critical minerals are essential to everyday life and the clean energy transition.
In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals.","Key Takeaways:

The United States remains heavily dependent on imports for the critical minerals essential to the clean energy transition and everyday technologies.

Circular economy strategies help bolster the domestic supply chain by reducing reliance on virgin materials and imports.

Recycling and secondary recovery methods tap into discarded products and waste products to recover critical minerals and put them back in circulation.

Critical minerals are embedded in the fabric of everyday life, from energy, communications, and consumer electronics to transportation and healthcare. These minerals are also the foundation of the clean energy transition. Minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel are key inputs for the advanced batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage. Neodymium and dysprosium are essential for the permanent magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines. Tellurium and cadmium can be found in solar panels, while aluminum is a crucial component of modern transmission lines. Even next-generation fuels like renewable hydrogen rely on platinum, nickel, or iridium.

The U.S. Depends on China and Others for Its Critical Minerals

The United States produces 37 of the 50 critical minerals identified by the U.S. Geological Survey from mining, secondary recovery, or recycling. However, it lacks a strong domestic supply chain, making the country heavily dependent on imports for most of its mineral needs. In 2024, the United States relied on imports for 100% of 12 critical minerals, and for more than 50% of another 28 minerals. China dominates global supply chains, being the top producer of 60% of U.S.-designated critical minerals. China is also the leading source of U.S. imports for nine of the 13 minerals for which the United States is most import-reliant. The United States also relies on Canada, Japan, and South Africa for critical minerals.

As this reliance suggests, a small fraction of countries produce the bulk of global critical mineral supplies. This fact—combined with long timelines for U.S. mining projects, mineral price volatility, and geopolitical conflict—has left the country vulnerable to supply chain disruptions. Finding alternative, domestic sources of critical minerals can reduce vulnerability to these disruptions while supporting the clean energy transition.

The Circular Economy Approach

One strategy to reduce dependence is to adopt a more circular economy. As opposed to the traditional “take-make-waste” linear model, circular economies emerge when companies reduce material use, redesign products to require fewer inputs, and capture waste as a resource for new production. This approach improves resource efficiency, reduces waste, eases pressure on ecosystems, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. It also presents opportunities for new markets and job creation by expanding recovery and remanufacturing industries, and by favoring new business models like product leasing and product-as-a-service.

Improving resource efficiency and exploiting domestic sources is particularly important for critical minerals. As demand for clean energy and other critical mineral-reliant technologies increases, the need for minerals such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese is expected to rise. Circular strategies like recycling and secondary recovery can help meet this increased demand through domestic supply, without resorting to mining and its accompanying environmental damage. Reconfiguring the country’s critical mineral supply chain to prioritize circularity could bolster sustainability efforts and build toward a more secure energy future.

Closing the Loop: Battery Recycling

Recycling is one of the most important strategies for securing access to critical minerals. Mineral recycling can help reduce import reliance, decrease waste, and limit the environmental impacts of mining and waste disposal. Indeed, as more products containing critical minerals reach the end of their lives, they end up in landfills, potentially harming the environment and disproportionately impacting low-income and Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) communities.

Lithium-ion battery recycling, particularly of EV batteries, presents significant opportunities. Battery recycling could reduce demand for mined lithium, nickel, and cobalt by around 10%. Despite this potential, fewer than 15% of U.S. lithium-ion batteries are recycled due to inefficient and inconsistent collection systems and limited recycling infrastructure.

Currently, most critical mineral recycling takes place through pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. In pyrometallurgy, batteries are smelted at high temperatures to recover metals, whereas in hydrometallurgy, acids are used to leach minerals from the battery’s cathodes, where the critical minerals are found. While both methods are effective, they are also costly and resource-intensive.

However, new techniques are beginning to improve the affordability and sustainability of mineral recycling. Researchers are developing two processes, organic acid extraction and deep eutectic solvents, which increase the efficiency and decrease the environmental impacts of hydrometallurgy. Another more widely adopted innovation is direct recycling, also known as “cathode to cathode” recycling, which restores cathode materials for immediate reuse rather than breaking them down into their base metals.

Battery design is a critical factor in overall recyclability. Complex disassembly is a major obstacle to scaling up recycling. Currently, many EV batteries are built with screws and welds that make dismantling them difficult and time-intensive. To address this challenge, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are experimenting with a new Quick-ReleaseTM Binder that could replace conventional fasteners, enabling more cost-effective and efficient disassembly. Designing batteries for recyclability from the start ensures that mineral recovery is viable.

While recycling alone cannot fulfill U.S. demand for critical minerals, it is crucial to securing a domestic supply chain. By recapturing minerals that would otherwise end up in landfills and returning them to circulation, the United States can bolster its supply chain while protecting vulnerable communities.

Secondary Recovery

While recycling focuses on products already in circulation, secondary recovery targets byproducts, or “tailings”, of critical mineral production, processing, and manufacturing. Historically, this waste has been underutilized due to its environmental and health hazards, but when treated properly, it can be transformed into new, domestic sources of critical minerals.

Acid Mine Drainage

On federal land alone, there are 140,000 abandoned mine features, costing the federal government $287 million in annual remediation. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one of the most significant issues associated with abandoned mines, contaminating 12,400 miles of streams and rivers in the United States. When mines are abandoned, they leave behind pits that collect rainwater. This water reacts with sulfide minerals from exposed rocks and oxygen to form sulfuric acid, which in turn dissolves heavy metals from the rocks into the water. Once the pit reaches its maximum level, it overflows into the surrounding watershed, contaminating the environment. Contaminated AMD water also contains critical minerals.

New treatment methods can simultaneously clean the water while capturing these minerals. For example, a two-step process developed at Pennsylvania State University adds carbon dioxide to AMD to create solids containing critical minerals that can be separated from the water. In Appalachia, solids collected from AMD treatment have been found to contain over 2,000 milligrams of rare earth elements per kilogram of material, valued at up to $400 per metric ton. The study of a pilot recovery plant by the University of West Virginia confirmed that recovery can be both technically feasible and economically viable at scale, with positive returns and payback within a few years. These high yields have been confirmed for AMD from coal and hard-rock mines, indicating that AMD recovery is applicable to many abandoned mines across the United States.

Phosphate Fertilizer Waste

Another promising opportunity for critical mineral secondary recovery comes from the fertilizer industry. Producing phosphate fertilizer generates large volumes of phosphogypsum waste—about 5 tons for every ton of phosphate produced. This radioactive waste, typically stored in large piles at hazardous waste sites, has high concentrations of critical minerals.

While more experimental than AMD recovery, chemical extraction methods for fertilizer waste have successfully extracted 77–94% of rare earth elements (REEs), a subset of critical minerals, from phosphogypsum. More recent research on biological methods of extraction has found that bio-acids can leach REEs at a milder acidity than mineral acids, reducing potential environmental impacts. A concentration of only 4% of REEs in phosphogypsum is required for recovery. Adding special polymers to the fertilizer waste can further concentrate REEs, increasing the ease of extraction.

Researchers are now looking to bring these methods to scale and increase yields. Experts emphasize that recovery becomes most viable when extraction facilities are co-located with existing phosphate operations, where the waste is already being collected and handled. Co-location reduces transportation and infrastructure costs, allowing recovery systems to leverage the fertilizer industry's existing footprint.

A Circular Future

Critical minerals are essential to everyday life and the clean energy transition. Worryingly, the United States remains heavily reliant on imports for most of its supply. Circular economic strategies, particularly recycling and secondary recovery, offer practical ways to reduce dependence while simultaneously bolstering economic and environmental opportunities.

In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order prioritizing the domestic production of critical minerals. The Department of Energy responded with nearly $1 billion in new funding for battery recycling, expanded recovery from mining and metal byproducts, and rare earth recovery and refinement demonstration projects. Congress has shown bipartisan support as well, through the Promoting Resilient Supply Chains Act of 2025 (H.R.2444/S.257) and the Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act (H.R.3198/S.823).

Even with this growing activity, additional federal support is still needed, including long-term support for recycling infrastructure, expansion of nationwide secondary recovery facilities, and clearer standards for integrating circular economy principles into supply chain planning.",,N,,2025-10-06 11:04:54.553486

The move has triggered a wave of criticism from Democratic lawmakers and energy advocates, who say the decision amounts to political punishment with consequences for jobs, innovation, and consumer energy costs.

“Following a thorough, individualized financial review, DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” the agency said in a statement.

A full list of affected projects has not yet been made public. However, DOE confirmed award recipients have 30 days to appeal the terminations, and some have already begun that process.

The cancellations cut across a wide range of DOE programs, including the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and Fossil Energy. In total, 321 financial awards were terminated. DOE officials highlighted that 26% of the awards — worth more than $3.1 billion — were issued in the short window between Election Day and the presidential inauguration, calling them hastily approved and inadequately documented.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright defended the decision, saying DOE has been working to review “billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.”

Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, echoed support in a post on X, saying the awards in states such as California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, and Washington were part of “Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

But Democratic leaders see the move differently. They argue it undermines the rule of law and weaponizes federal policy for partisan purposes.

“This administration has had plans in the works for months to cancel critical energy projects, and now, they are illegally taking action to kill jobs and raise people’s energy bills,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. “This is a blatant attempt to punish the political opposition.”

“Our democracy is badly broken when a president can illegally suspend projects for Blue states in order to punish his political enemies,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., called the cancellations “reckless” and a betrayal of the public trust. “Terminating critical energy projects in Democratic states weaponizes policy for political revenge and will only drive energy bills higher, increase unemployment, and eliminate jobs.”

Advocacy groups also warned of wide-ranging fallout. Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said ending the awards would “stall American innovation and competitiveness, raising costs for consumers, and further cementing our reliance on dirty fossil fuels.”

Canceled awards reportedly include hydrogen hubs in California and the Pacific Northwest, battery production facilities, grid modernization efforts, clean vehicle manufacturing, and industrial decarbonization projects. California officials confirmed DOE rescinded up to $1.2 billion earmarked for ARCHES — the state’s planned hydrogen hub.

“The cancellation of ARCHES is vindictive, shortsighted, and proof this Administration is not serious about American energy dominance,” said Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also denounced the move, saying it would undercut U.S. leadership in renewable energy.

Environmental groups stressed that consumers ultimately will bear the brunt. “By canceling more renewable energy projects, Trump is directly raising energy bills for millions of Americans,” said Patrick Drupp, Climate Policy Director at the Sierra Club.

With $7.6 billion in funding now rescinded, energy experts say the decision could slow progress toward decarbonization, stall advanced technology deployment, and diminish private sector confidence in federal clean energy initiatives. Supporters of the canceled projects warn that the U.S. risks losing its competitive edge to Europe and Asia, where governments are aggressively investing in clean energy manufacturing and innovation.",,N,,2025-10-06 12:06:48.905743

clean energy mobility market around the Pacific Northwest region. They also have plans

to install four hydrogen refueling stations in the region.

As part of the Port of Morrow project Northwest Seaport Alliance will develop and

implement an incentive program to support the purchase and deployment of hydrogen

powered drayage trucks and cargo handling equipment. The hydrogen trucks and

equipment will be used in port and goods movement applications in Seattle and

Tacoma. PNHA’s website lists the project as currently in design.

Another potentially affected project is in Baker City where Express Ranch Hydrogen is

developing an electrolytic hydrogen production facility between Baker City and

Huntington. The facility is planned to supply hydrogen to a mining operator that is

transitioning part of its heavy-duty haul truck fleet from diesel to hydrogen-powered

engines.

They also plan to establish a publicly accessible hydrogen fueling hub along Interstate

84 to serve long-haul trucking fleets. The project status says finalizing project scoping

and initiating permitting process.

To help close this funding gap, Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership (FAST-P) launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 2023, created GIP to finance and de-risk climate projects in the region.

GIP is an innovative blended finance vehicle under FAST-P that has secured $510 million in committed capital from global and regional private, public and philanthropic institutions. It will fund projects in sectors critical to decarbonisation and sustainable growth including renewable energy, distributed generation, e-mobility, circular economy and emerging climate solutions. GIP begins investing this year, starting with a bio-energy programme through BECIS Bioenergy that converts agricultural waste and other sustainably sourced feedstock into renewable steam, reducing over 100,000 tonnes of emissions annually. Also, a renewables portfolio with ib vogt comprising utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, cutting an estimated 257,000 tonnes of emissions each year.

BII’s $60 million commitment, including $10 million from its £100 million mobilisation facility announced by the UK Prime Minister at the UN General Assembly in 2024, has played a critical role in achieving the fund’s first close. It has helped to de-risk the capital structure to attract further commercial capital.

Leslie Maasdorp, CEO, BII, said “We are proud to support GIP, which exemplifies the power of blended finance, bringing together development finance, public, and private capital to unlock opportunities that might otherwise remain out of reach. By supporting GIP, we are accelerating the low carbon transition in South-East Asia and also demonstrating the power of innovative technologies and new business models.

“BII’s participation is designed to catalyse further commercial investment, sending a strong signal to the market and helping to scale climate action across the region.”

Nik Mehta, British High Commissioner to Singapore, said: “The UK’s commitment to the Green Investment Partnership demonstrates our determination to mobilise private capital for climate action at scale into developing countries in South-East Asia. This pioneering approach, co-investing alongside Singapore and other partners through FAST-P, will help unlock significant private investment for clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects across the region, driving growth and jobs in the process.”

Congressman Gabe Vasquez: So, this funding was yet to be distributed.
Congressman Gabe Vasquez: Sure.
KC Counts: Congressman Gabe Vasquez, thank you very much for your time.
Congressman Gabe Vasquez: Thank you so much.","The Department of Energy announced billions in cuts to green energy projects in blue states. U.S. Congressman Gabe Vasquez talks with KC Counts about how New Mexico is affected. Here is a transcript of their conversation:

KC Counts:

Tell us what the landscape looks like in terms of how these cuts will impact New Mexico.

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

So, because of this political retribution and this decision to cut Department of Energy projects across the nation, New Mexico stands to lose over $135 million in investment for energy production, energy research, and that includes $56 million right here in New Mexico's second district. All four of the projects that were defunded in my district would be housed at New Mexico Tech inSocorro. Now, by cutting these projects, the administration has really hamstrung the ability for us to modernize fossil fuel development and oil and gas development in places like the Four Corners and the Permian Basin. The purpose of these funds were to develop, you know, methane capture technology that would make oil and gas production cleaner, avoid the types of methane leaks that we've seen. We have one of the largest methane clouds in the world right here in the Permian Basin. So, this means that we're going to lose out on research projects, jobs, students are going to miss out on this opportunity. And not just that, but the most important thing is that having cleaner oil and gas development contributes to cleaner air for all New Mexicans. And that's one of the things that we absolutely need, especially in communities like Hobbs and Carlsbad right here in my district, but also areas like Farmington and Gallup up north. So, it really impedes our ability to move forward with that technology and that includes retrofitting existing oil and gas wells. So, we're not moving in the right direction. And those folks at New Mexico Tech deserve to continue with this important research that's going to benefit all New Mexicans and the companies as well.

KC Counts:

In what way is this particular funding being affected? Was it yet to be distributed?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

So, this funding was yet to be distributed. Here at New Mexico Tech, that $56 million was congressionally approved funding. That means Congress allocated that funding by a vote in Congress. It's now been rescinded by Secretary Wright of the Department of Energy. The projects across the country are different. There are some projects that were already underway that are being cut halfway through their grants or through their projects. There's other projects that were just about to start, and if you think about what it takes for a university like New Mexico Tech to put the resources in place just to conduct and deliver on this grant, they have to mobilize an immense amount of resources, not to mention the amount of time that it took to actually apply for these funds. So, there's already money being lost. There's potential jobs being lost with contractors who are going to work as part of this project. So, it varies project by project across the country U.S. Congressman Gabe, but in this case, we stand to lose all $56 million of that congressionally approved funding for New Mexico Tech, although New Mexico Tech has already prepared themselves to take on this research.

KC Counts:

At this point, Congressman Vasquez, what is the remedy?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

Well, just today I sent a letter to Secretary Wright outlining how important these projects are across the country. One, because they help to lower the utility bills for all Americans. When we can create safer, cleaner, renewable energy or safer and cleaner fossil fuel energy, it helps both the companies and it helps New Mexicans, because if you think about methane leaks and capturing those methane leaks, those oil and gas companies actually make money off of selling some of that natural gas and some of the byproducts back to New Mexico, in the form of royalties, and that's really important. So, we're actually standing to lose millions more from not implementing this type of technology. Our air is going to get dirtier. You know, those high rates of respiratory disease in places like the Permian Basin are going to continue to climb. So that's just, it's not a good thing for us. But in terms of how we fix it, Secretary Wright has the opportunity to turn the dial back on this. Unfortunately, because of this political retribution, the fact that these projects were pulled in 12 blue states and the fact that this is a vindictive action by the administration, I'm not sure how willing they're going to be to restore that funding. But in my view, it also is a violation of the impoundment clause, which this administration has completely ignored in the last eight months.

KC Counts:

Looking ahead, do you think that there is a longer-term fix? Obviously, There's been a lot of political maneuvering in states like Texas to redraw boundaries, get more Republican seats. So, what is your outlook, quickly, before I let you go, Congressman Vasquez, on the midterms?

Congressman Gabe Vasquez:

Sure. Well, look, when Democrats have the majority in the House, we're going to work on a package of legislation that protects the American people from any future actions, from any future administration, from violating the impoundment clause, making clear that it is a violation of the law to misuse or misappropriate or retract congressionally directed spending. There's three branches of government for a reason. The Democratic Party believes strongly in those foundations that our founding fathers laid before us. And even though some may want to abdicate that responsibility or give that responsibility to the administration, I refuse to render Congress powerless. Folks elect us for a reason. They expect us to pass a yearly budget, which we haven't done. They expect that those congressionally directed funds are going to be spent in the way that they're supposed to be spent. And we've got to make sure that no president, Democrat or Republican, can do this in the future.

KC Counts:

Congressman Gabe Vasquez, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it.

Created in 1948, the IUCN comprises the world’s largest and most diverse network of organizations working for the environment. From governments to non-profits and more, over 1,400 member organizations and 17,000 experts make up the union of the IUCN—the “global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it.”

The Aquarium was recognized as a member because of its commitment to conservation and the IUCN mission, demonstrated through our extensive animal care, innovative scientific research, and marine conservation and education work. While the IUCN strives to conserve all of nature, our ocean-specific focus lets us weigh in on issues ranging from marine life and habitats to the blue economy and youth engagement—and connects the Aquarium to a broad array of experts and resources to help advance our own work to protect the blue planet.

While it’s still the early days of the membership, there are opportunities to be more involved in the future. One area is in informing equitable and effective practices for the IUCN’s project-based conservation work around the globe, based on our experience working with and learning from our Marine Conservation Action Fund (MCAF) fellows and project leaders.

Another is for members of our Animal Care and Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life teams to serve on the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC)—groups of volunteer experts who gather knowledge on the status of over 150,000 different species and threats to them.

The SSC network, composed of more than 180 Specialist Groups, Red List Authorities, Conservation Committees, and Task Forces, “provides scientific advice to conservation organizations, government agencies, and other IUCN members,” and helps support international environmental agreements to protect biodiversity.

Already, Dr. Elizabeth Burgess, senior scientist in the Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, is a member of the SSC Sirenia Specialist Group. Veterinarian and Senior Scientist Dr. Charles Innis participates in the SSC Tortoise and Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group.

The Aquarium is also exploring joining one of several other Commissions, such as the Commission on Education and Communications or the World Commission on Protected Areas.

In mid-October, a delegation from the Aquarium will be traveling to Abu Dhabi to attend the IUCN World Conservation Congress, a gathering held once every four years that brings together experts and decision-makers from around the globe. Chief of Conservation and Stewardship Dr. Letise LaFeir will represent the Aquarium as Authorized Vote Holder at the conference, joining debate at the Member’s Assembly and voting on IUCN conservation priorities on behalf of the Aquarium.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a Social Democrat who is also the vice chancellor, told the news agency.
The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.
“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” DPA quoted Klingbeil as saying.
“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ.","Germany’s ruling coalition confirmed it will extend a tax exemption for new electric vehicles as part of a broader effort to support the nation’s key car industry in the transition to more climate-friendly technologies.

Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will present a draft law soon that will keep the existing tax exemption for EVs in place until 2035, Maximilian Kall, a finance ministry spokesman, said Monday at a regular government news conference in Berlin, confirming a report by DPA.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a Social Democrat who is also the vice chancellor, told the news agency.

The coalition accord agreed on by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and Klingbeil’s SPD included the pledge to extend the incentive to 2035 and the confirmation comes ahead of a planned “car summit” Thursday between government officials, auto executives and labor representatives.

The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.

Announcements last month that Volkswagen AG was paring back production and Robert Bosch GmbH slashing 13,000 jobs were the latest evidence of how the auto industry’s decline is rippling through Europe’s biggest economy.

Auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG followed last week by saying it planned to eliminate 7,600 positions at its electrified drivetrain division as it steps up its restructuring efforts to deal with poor demand.

“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” DPA quoted Klingbeil as saying. “We want the best cars to continue to be made in Germany.”

Extending the EV exemption is expected to cost the federal government approximately €600 million ($702 million) in lost revenue through 2029, Kall told reporters.

As part of his government’s effort to aid the car sector, Merz last month urged the European Union to give up its 2035 deadline to effectively ban combustion engines and instead allow the industry to pursue a softer path to climate neutrality.

Some members of Klingbeil’s SPD are unhappy with the move, but the party is expected to signal its backing this week, with the issue set to be discussed at regular coalition talks on Wednesday in Berlin.

Olaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony whose government is VW’s second-biggest shareholder, said last week the priority should be to protect jobs.

“The goal of selling only pure electric cars by 2035 is not realistic,” Lies told German newspaper NWZ. “Combustion engines, especially plug-in hybrids and vehicles with range extenders, must continue to be permitted beyond 2035, and alternative fuels must also be included.”

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

However, the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as the fastest-growing market, fueled by urbanization, renewable energy mandates, and energy independence policies in countries like China, India, and Japan.

""Home energy storage is no longer a luxury—it's becoming the backbone of the modern renewable home,"" notes an energy analyst from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Renewables Integration and the Rise of Energy Independence

Homeowners across the world are rethinking how they consume and store energy. With increasing electricity demand and growing solar installations, energy storage is bridging the gap between generation and reliability.

Residential users can now store excess solar energy generated during the day and deploy it when sunlight fades or during grid outages. This not only enhances energy security but also significantly reduces electricity costs, creating a compelling economic case for adoption.

In markets like California, Germany, and Australia, government incentives and tax credits have accelerated residential storage installations. For instance, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act offers a 30% federal tax credit, while Australia provides rebates up to A$1,300 under new state energy programs.

Battery Technology: From Lithium-Ion Dominance to Sodium-Ion Disruption

In 2024, lithium-ion batteries held roughly 70% of the global market share, thanks to their high energy density, efficiency, and long lifecycle. However, the market is undergoing a technological transition.

Emerging sodium-ion batteries are attracting attention as a lower-cost, safer, and more sustainable alternative. They rely less on critical minerals like lithium and cobalt and perform effectively across wider temperature ranges. This makes them especially suited for frequent charge-discharge cycles—a hallmark of residential energy systems connected to intermittent renewables like solar.

""Sodium-ion chemistry could become the defining innovation of the next decade,"" predicts a senior researcher at BloombergNEF, ""particularly as cost reduction aligns with scaling solar-plus-storage projects.""

At the same time, the race toward solid-state batteries promises even greater safety, energy density, and durability, further lowering the total cost of ownership for homeowners.

AI and Smart Energy Management

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining how home energy storage systems operate. Advanced AI algorithms are enabling dynamic energy forecasting, real-time optimization, and predictive maintenance.

Smart energy management systems now predict renewable generation patterns and optimize when to buy, store, or release energy based on grid prices. This capability transforms a household battery from a passive storage unit into an intelligent energy trading asset.

AI also plays a crucial role in battery health diagnostics, extending lifespan through adaptive charging strategies and preemptive fault detection.

This integration of digital intelligence is paving the way for Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) decentralized energy networks that aggregate home batteries into grid-level assets. VPPs enhance grid stability, unlock new revenue streams for homeowners, and support the broader decarbonization of energy systems.

Market Segmentation: Powering Homes of All Sizes

By Capacity: The 10-20 kWh segment leads the market with a 40% share, as it aligns with typical residential backup needs and peak load management. However, >20 kWh systems are expected to grow fastest as costs decline and demand for long-duration backup rises.

By Connectivity: On-grid systems dominate with 60% share, while hybrid systems—which combine grid, solar, and battery backup—are expected to see the most significant growth through 2034.

By End User: Single-family homes remain the largest segment (55% share), driven by rooftop solar adoption. Meanwhile, multi-family housing is emerging as a fast-growing segment, especially in dense urban areas where shared energy systems are being tested.

Regional Outlook: Global Hotspots of Growth

North America

The U.S. market alone was valued at USD 0.96 billion in 2024 and is expected to more than double to USD 2.40 billion by 2034. Federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and state-level programs such as California's SGIP continue to propel adoption.

Grid modernization projects and frequent climate-induced outages further strengthen demand for resilient residential systems.

Europe

Germany remains the European leader, supported by KfW loans, net-metering incentives, and strict technical standards for battery integration. The U.K. has reinforced growth with VAT exemptions for home battery systems and the Smart Export Guarantee (SEG), rewarding users for exporting stored energy.

Asia-Pacific

Expected to grow at the fastest CAGR through 2034, the region's expansion is anchored by China's 30 GW energy storage target by 2025 and India's ₹5,400 crore viability gap funding (VGF) for new BESS projects. Japan's GX Transition Bonds and aggressive decarbonization initiatives further underline Asia's pivotal role in shaping global energy storage trends.

Investment and Industry Momentum

Private equity and utility companies are investing heavily in home storage technologies. Giants like Tesla (Powerwall 3), LG Energy Solution (enblock S+), and BYD (Battery-Box HVB) are joined by emerging European innovators such as Sonnen and software-driven platforms like Enphase Energy.

Investors are particularly attracted by the dual value proposition: growing consumer demand for energy independence and the opportunity to participate in decentralized grid stabilization via VPPs.

Toward a Smarter, Decentralized Future

As the world edges toward a decentralized, AI-enabled energy economy, home energy storage systems are set to become a mainstream household technology. The convergence of battery innovation, digital intelligence, and renewable generation is transforming how homeowners interact with energy—turning them from passive consumers into active participants in the energy ecosystem.

By 2034, the global market will not only double in value but also redefine what it means to be energy independent—where every home can generate, store, and manage its own clean power.",https://www.altenergymag.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:05:25.391392

James Cleverly, the shadow housing secretary, attacked Sadiq Khan’s housing record as London mayor in his speech to the conference this afternoon.

Since 2010, Conservatives have delivered 2.5m homes – a million of those in the last parliament alone.

Last year in the south-east of England, and the east of England, Conservative-run regions, about 2.5 new homes were built per thousand people.

In London, run by Labour for the best part of a decade, 0.5 homes per thousand.

And so, what do those figures mean, for real people, for ordinary hard-working Londoners?

In 1980, the average London home cost £25,000, and that was about four times the average national salary.

Today, the average London house costs over £500,000.

And that is fifteen times the average salary.

That is Sadiq Khan’s record of failure.

We should not, and we cannot, and we must not accept it.

There is speculation that Cleverly may put himself forward as the Tory candidate for London mayor at the next election, in 2028.

Matt Chorley from the BBC has written an excellent long read on what Tory MPs are saying in private about Kemi Badenoch and her prospects. It includes this wonderful anecdote.

In recent weeks, stung by criticism that she was aloof from her MPs, Badenoch has begun inviting in small groups for lunch. Well, platters of shop-bought sandwiches.

When I pointed out to one invitee that Badenoch famously declared last year that she hated sandwiches (in line with just 1% of the British public), they replied “oh no, the MPs had sandwiches, Kemi had something hot brought in”.

John Glen, Badenoch's PPS, floats case for cutting pensions tax relief for high earners

Phillip Inman

Phillip Inman is a senior Guardian economics writer.

John Glen, Kemi Badenoch’s bag carrier (parliamentary private secretary), has raised the prospect of the Conservative party taking away pension subsidies from better off taxpayers.

Glen, who joked that his appointment in July as PPS had turned him into a slave, said there was a case to answer when the public finances were constrained and the level of pension subsidy had reached £50bn.

At a fringe meeting, Glen, who sits on the Commons Treasury committee, said:

We spend £40bn to £50bn on tax relief and £15bn to £20bn goes to people who pay the higher rates of tax. We need to have an honest discussion about what the overall burden of tax should be.

We have a system that is based on pension savings being exempt on entry and exempt on accumulation but taxed on exit. What we need to do is ask wha we can afford and what is fair.

It is not the party’s policy to have a single rate. There would obviously be an opportunity to change the rate.

But philosophically, the question is about the role of the state. There are lots of people receiving 40% relief and building penion pots that are much more than securing just a reasonable pot alongside their triple lock pension. The question is, are there better ways to spend that money?

Government pension subsidies are based on tax relief, which means those that pay the highest rates of tax gain the most from tax relief.

A flat rate subsidy of 25% or 30% would increase the subsidy for standard rate taxpayers while cutting it for those who pay higher rates of tax.

Ulster Unionist leader criticises Badenoch's proposal to leave ECHR

Lisa O’Carroll

Lisa O’Carroll is a senior Guardian correspondent.

The Ulster Unionist party has condemned Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch’s intention to leave the ECHR if she is voted into power.

The UUP helped negotiate Good Friday agreement peace deal which is undermined by the convention.

Mike Nesbitt, the UUP leader, said:

The Ulster Unionist party negotiated the 1998 agreement. Any suggestion of the UK leaving the ECHR, as suggested by Ms Badenoch, would cut across the principles of that agreement, which guarantees access to the ECHR in law, a point the Conservative leader has said herself would be a point of ‘particular challenge’.

Reform UK defends record of its Doge unit after report says cost-cutting won't stop Kent raising council tax

Reform UK has reject claims that its efforts to find savings in Kent council have been disappointing.

Referring to a story in the Financial Times today (see 7.59am), Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader, said:

Reform’s pledge to slash millions from Kent Council’s budget has turned out to be nothing but smoke and mirrors.

Just like his idol Elon Musk, Zia Yusuf has spectacularly failed to deliver what Doge promised. It turns out cribbing the notes of dodgy American tech billionaires is no way to run a council.

But a Reform UK spokesperson insisted the party’s Dolge (Department of Local Government Efficiency) was having an impact. The spokesperson said:

Our team in Kent county council have already done some fantastic work to clean up the mess left by the Kent Conservatives and reduce the county council’s debt by £66m in their first five months in office. The majority of that has come from savings as a result of their Dolge unit.

This includes implementing a ‘no more borrowing’ policy which will reduce their debt by a further £33m by March 2026, scrapping KCC’s net zero renewable energy Programme to save £32m over 4 years and stopping the move to a new council building which has avoided an additional £14bn of borrowing.

Referring to reports that Kent is likely to raise council tax by 5%, the maximum amount, a Reform source argued that most councils were expected to do that and claimed that not raising council tax could lead to an authority losing government grant money.

Andrew Rosindell calls for pact with Reform UK, saying many Tories like him will lose their seats without one

The Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell has called for his party to form a pact with Reform UK to defeat Labour at the election.

In an interview with GB News, Rosindell said:

Our electoral system can’t accommodate two parties that are broadly conservative. That means a divide in the vote and the calamity of another Labour government for five years, or even worse, a Labour government propped up by Liberal Democrats, Greens, Plaid Cymru, SNP, fruit and nut, and whoever else is around to prop Keir Starmer up in office. No, thank you.

I would much rather see people of like mind on the right of centre to work together … We need to get everyone working together to rescue our country from the disaster of this left-wing socialist government.

Rosindell, who represents Romford, said, without a pact, many Tory MPs, including him, faced defeat at the election.

I’m worried about many of my colleagues who will not come back as MPs, including me. At the moment my seat would almost certainly go to Reform. I think the whole of Essex would go Reform.

Asked if he would stay with the Tories or defect to Reform before the electon, Rosindell said he wanted both parties “to think about what’s best for our country”.

At the Politico fringe, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, was asked by Dan Bloom the Theresa May question – what was the naughtiest thing he hads ever done? His answer was more interesting than hers.

Philp replied:

When I was a student at University at Oxford in the 1990s, OJ Simpson, remember him, came to speak at the Oxford Union, and he there was no press.

So I was very enterprising. I smuggled a load of recording equipment into the place, before the security cordon went up, recorded the entire thing, retrieved the recording devices afterwards, and then sold the recordings to various American news stations for a decent amount of money, in cash.

And I sold it simultaneously to ABC, NBC and CBS, all of whom thought they were getting it exclusively.

Former Tory Brexit secretary David Davis says he does not support ECHR withdrawal

Randeep Ramesh

Randeep Ramesh is the Guardian’s chief leader writer.

David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, has told a fringe meeting at the party conference that he is opposed to the party’s decision to leave the European convention on human rights.

Speaking to the Guardian, Davis, who is one of most prominent libertarians in the party, Davis said:

I don’t trust any British government – Conservative Labour, coalition – to have entirely clean hands on civil liberties, torture and rendition, surveillance, 90 days detention without charge, all these things. And parliament is getting weaker and weaker. So that’s why I want to have some external agency.

Davis said he was also concerned about the problems withdrawal from the ECHR would create in Northern Ireland.

It won’t destroy [the Belfast/Good Friday agreement] but it will cause issues and it will force a renegotiation with the Irish demanding things. On European trade policy, it would give the option to the Europeans of withdrawing certain aspects.

Davis also believes that that efforts being made by several European countries to reform the ECHR, including the Labour government in Britain, may lead to changes.

Philp plays down concerns proposed Tory removals force will adopt 'heavy-handed' tactics used by Trump's Ice

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, has played down concerns that the Trump-style removals force proposed by the party will adopt some of the thuggish and lawless tactics used by Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), its US counterpart.

Speaking at a fringe meeting at the conference, where he was being interviewed by Politico’s Dan Bloom, Philp said:

There are some examples in the US where they have clearly used tactics that are too heavy handed, and people families have been separated. We don’t advocate that sort of approach.

We do advocate zero tolerance for illegal immigration and anyone entering this country illegally, no matter what their purported excuse, will get removed within a week.

Philp told the same meeting there was another area where he would like to see the UK move closer to the US model. In the US there are thousands of government jobs which an incoming president can give to political appointees. In the UK the civil service in independent, and cabinet ministers are only allowed to bring in a handful of political appointee (special advisers, or “spads”) to help them. Philp said he would like to see this number increased.

I could imagine a few dozen people [as party political advisers] coming into a big department would make quite a big difference to ministers’ ability to get things done.

Helen Whately, shadow work and pensions secretary, suggests term 'disabled' being applied too widely if 25% of people qualify

Helen Whately, the shadow work and pensions secretary, has suggested the term “disabled” is being over-used if it applies to around a quarter of people.

She made the claim in her speech in which she defended the Tory plan to cut benefits – which the party now says could save £23bn a year. (See 8.09am.)

She said:

We are here because we know we have a really important job to do – if not us, who?

But millions of people right now, are sitting on the sofa at home.

Millions have got themselves a sick note from the GP and signed onto sickness benefits with just a form and a phone call.

Millions are getting benefits for anxiety and ADHD, along with a free Motability car.

TikTok videos tell you how - and some people even pay for VIP services to boost their chances of a successful benefits claim.

Yes, there are people with serious illnesses and disabilities,

But one in four people now describe themselves as disabled, so what does the term even mean?

In claiming that the term disabled is used too widely, Whately is just echoing an argument made by Kemi Badenoch, who made a very similar comment earlier this year.

There is an explanation for the ‘one in four’ figure (24%, to be precise) in this DWP report. It is based on the definition of disabled in the Equality Act, which says a person is considered to have a disability if they have a physical or mental impairment that has ‘substantial’ and ‘long term’ negative effects on their ability to do normal daily activities.

In her speech, Whately also claimed she had a “common sense” plan to cut welfare spending.

I’ve got my common sense plan for savings.

Fix the ‘sick note’ system, bring back face-to-face assessments, end sickness benefits for low level mental health problems, stop the abuse of Motability, and put British citizens first in our benefits system – just living here is not a reason to get money from taxpayers.

And that’s not all.

We will change our sickness benefit system, so it helps those who really need help and stops turning people into victims.

We will make the benefits cap do what it should, so that families on benefits aren’t better off than those in work.

And we’ll tackle the massive hike in housing benefit.

All that gives you billions of savings off the benefits bill.

Helena Horton

Helena Horton is a Guardan environment reporter.

Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, has been accused of a Reform UK-style anti-business measure by experts.

She has pledged to scrap the the renewables obligation (RO) scheme, under which many wind farms receive fixed subsidies for 15–20 years. (See 11.27am.)

Coutinho referred to these subsidies as “the biggest racket going”, adding:

Our energy system is not here to prop up the profits of multi-million-pound wind developers at billpayers’ expense. It’s here to deliver cheap, reliable energy for the country.

However, one of the reasons the UK has historically been a favourable place to invest is its strong contract law, meaning that when a business signs a contract it knows the terms will be honoured.

Ripping up existing agreements would run contrary to this.

Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit said:

If what is being proposed is to terminate contracts with renewable energy suppliers under the renewables obligation, unless there is an alternative in place, this kind of policy instability, akin to what Reform has proposed, would deter investors not just in renewables, but across the board from investing in the UK. This uncertainty would make financing more risky pushing up costs of investment, making everything in turn more expensive.

Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform, faced criticism from business leaders when he proposed a similar policy, to scrap the contracts for difference scheme under which renewables companies agree a price per megawatt hour for their power.

Even the wind power sceptic energy analyst Kathryn Porter, who writes for the Telegraph, has said that cancelling existing schemes would dent investor confidence.

New analysis has also found that renewables including wind power cut electricity prices by up to a quarter in the last year.

No 10 says claims government interference led to collapse of Chinese spying case 'all untrue'

Claims that government interference led to the collapse of a major Chinese spying case are “all untrue”, Downing Street has insisted. PA Media reports:

Ministers also retain confidence in England and Wales’ chief prosecutor following the case, according to No 10, as he based his work around the previous Conservative government’s policy on China.

The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry was dropped on 15 September, sparking criticism from Downing Street and MPs from across both sides of the political aisle.

The decision reportedly came after senior Whitehall mandarins met to discuss the trial, including national security adviser Jonathan Powell and the Foreign Office’s top civil servant Sir Oliver Robbins, according to the Sunday Times.

In order to prove the case under the Official Secrets Act, prosecutors would have had to show the defendants were acting for an “enemy”.

But Powell reportedly revealed the government’s evidence would be based on the national security strategy, which does not use that term to describe China, so it could not be used in court.

“The suggestion that the government withheld evidence, withdrew witnesses, or restricted the ability of witnesses to draw on particular bits of evidence are all untrue,” the PM’s press secretary told reporters at a lobby briefing this morning.

Among those who have heavily criticised the collapse of the case are the Tories, who have said ministers now have serious questions to answer.

But sources within government said evidence in the case had to relate to the period when the alleged incidents took place – between 2021 and 2023 – when the Conservatives were in power.

Senior Tory figures at the time – including the party’s current leader, Kemi Badenoch – did not refer to China as an enemy, only as a “challenge”, informing the evidence.

Stephen Parkinson, chief prosecutor in England and Wales, had said the CPS had determined the proceedings had to be stopped because of an “evidential failure”.

Downing Street was asked if the prime minister remained confident in Parkinson’s ability to do the job.

“Yes. It is obviously for the CPS to take decisions on the evidential threshold which they take cases forward, and they obviously judged that that threshold was met at the time,” a spokesperson said.

“It’s obviously up to them to keep that under review and to take their own decisions. But very clearly, the government’s evidence did not materially change, not least because it was based on the previous government’s policy, and previous governments’ policy can’t change.”

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

Unexpected benefits While increased housing values, visitor spending, and business activity may be fairly obvious economic benefits of parks, the Metroparks study also quantified some more unexpected and less tangible impacts.","This story is part of a series exploring how parks serve as engines of exploration, education, play, and equity. It is made possible with support from Huron-Clinton Metroparks and the City of Detroit.

Alicia Powell says she gets “choked up” every time she brings her food truck, Wetzel’s Pretzels, to vend at an event in one of Detroit’s newer parks. Powell, who often vends along the Joe Louis Greenway and at Spirit Plaza, says she doesn’t recall having “these beautiful greenspaces” when she was growing up in the city. Now, she says, she not only appreciates the new parks’ impact on her own business, but she feels like she’s “participating in this beautiful transformation” for the city overall.

“You have to have these greenspaces and recreational space for people,” she says. “… It makes these neighborhoods more attractive. And hopefully it brings value to the area, and then other people start investing more. But it starts with the city providing these spaces.”

Powell both exemplifies and summarizes several of the myriad economic benefits parks and greenspaces contribute to the communities surrounding them. Beyond simply providing a place for people to unwind in nature, parks also have demonstrable positive impacts on local businesses, property values, tourism, environmental management costs, and even medical bills.

“Parks offer an opportunity for maximizing investment in neighborhoods, so building or investing in a park really draws additional resources to that area, and we see that with the Joe Louis Greenway,” says Leona Medley, executive director of the Joe Louis Greenway Partnership. “It allows us to think about programming, … building on transportation networks, thinking about commercial corridor redevelopment, really focusing on neighborhood stabilization strategies, and preserving existing residents while also attracting new ones. And so we continue to see parks, as an economic development catalyst, produce good results around the city.”

Alexa Bush, the city of Detroit’s planning director, says parks “only add value to any of the other types of more traditional economic development activity.”

“I think having this opportunity to be in a really high-quality public space, a park, a natural area, adds to that value, and I think people recognize it even if they don’t name it as such,” she says. “… It only adds to the excitement, the density, the value of the vertical development that goes along with it.”

Attracting residents and visitors

One of the primary economic impacts of parks is their ability to attract both residents and visitors to the areas surrounding them. Amy McMillan, CEO of the Huron-Clinton Metroparks, says parks are “inseparable” from economic development – particularly in Michigan, where she says “quality of life” should be the “primary driver” of efforts to market the state as “an incredible place to live.”

“There have been studies for decades that demonstrate the influence that being next to well-maintained parkland and open space has on property values,” she says. “And so I think they’re inextricably linked, and that is not often enough realized when talking about economic development.”

Data back up McMillan’s assertions. A 2020 Journal of Leisure Research review of 33 studies found an average property value increase of 8-10% for properties adjacent to parks. And a 2020 study produced for the Metroparks by the Trust for Public Land found an additional $68 million in residential property value for properties within 500 feet of Metropark locations.

Similarly, parks are a boon to visitor attraction and visitor spending. The Metroparks study found that the parks system generates $92 million annually in visitor spending. Studies commissioned by the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy have found $82 million in annual visitor spending along the Detroit Riverfront, which has seen considerable revitalization over the past decade-plus.

Bush credits parks and greenspaces such as the Detroit Riverwalk and Campus Martius as major drivers of the revitalization of downtown Detroit.

“I think we’ve had that synergy between creating these really wonderful public places that work for big events [and] work for tourists, but they also support residential life downtown,” she says. “Those have all really, I think, served to reinforce one another.”

Business benefits

Parks also have significant positive implications for local business. For example, the Metroparks study found that the recreation economy in the Metroparks’ five-county service area supports 272 sporting goods stores generating $678 million in annual sales.

“People are buying bikes. They’re getting their bikes fixed. They’re buying golf clubs,” McMillan says.

Beyond the direct impact of park visitors buying supplies to support their recreational activities, parks can also be a catalyst for small, locally-owned businesses like Powell’s.

“It’s great for us – money in our pocket – and then it’s great for the residents,” Powell says.

Sandra Epps, owner of the Detroit-based face-and body-painting business Sandy’s Land, agrees. She says Joe Louis Greenway events have helped increase her business, with Tuesday yoga sessions on the greenway providing a particularly “huge boost.”

Epps says she was “excited” to learn that a section of the Joe Louis Greenway will be built near seven lots she’s acquired at the intersection of Fenkell Avenue and Log Cabin Street to build a butterfly garden and doll museum.

“New parks and greenspaces are creating a new resurgence in communities throughout Michigan, but especially in the city of Detroit,” she says. “And this is exciting to see and be a part of this new expansion and positive transition in the city of Detroit.”

Parks can draw new commercial activity to a neighborhood, which can require careful strategy to ensure that existing residents benefit from their new greenspace instead of being pushed out by it. Bush says the city of Detroit has been “highly intentional” about engaging Detroit business owners and community members in shaping the way new park investments affect their communities. One example of this is the 2025 Joe Louis Greenway Neighborhood Planning Study, which takes a highly granular neighborhood-level approach to planning investments in the communities surrounding the greenway.

The study was heavily shaped by community feedback. Medley says some neighborhood residents wanted to prioritize commercial corridor development around the greenway, while others did not. She and city staff have worked to be responsive to those needs.

“I think one of the most powerful strategies that we’re employing is … to ensure that we are understanding the current makeup of the neighborhoods, while also engaging with the residents to ask questions about what are some of the impacts that they want to see from a project like this, and then working … to really develop that strategy,” she says.

Unexpected benefits

While increased housing values, visitor spending, and business activity may be fairly obvious economic benefits of parks, the Metroparks study also quantified some more unexpected and less tangible impacts.

One of these is reduced health care bills. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for physical activity, The Trust for Public Land conducted a telephone survey to determine how many adults were using Metroparks “at a frequency and intensity that would result in health care cost savings.” The study found 9,030 adults ages 18-64, and 7,600 adults 65 and older, using the parks in this manner. Based on previous research into the health care savings associated with regular intense exercise, the Trust for Public Land assigned an average annual health care savings of $1,250 to the younger group and $2,500 to the elder, estimating the parks system’s total annual health benefit to users at $30.3 million.

“The opportunity to improve the health of our workforce, the impact that that has on the bottom line for companies, is not too often discussed,” McMillan says. “I think that is one of those opportunities that is hugely missed because we so often take it for granted.”

The Metroparks study also quantified the economic impact of the parks system’s environmental benefits. The many acres of pervious (i.e. non-paved) surfaces in each park hold significant benefit for absorbing stormwater, slowing its runoff, and filtering out pollutants. Calculating the total amount of stormwater runoff mitigated by the parks and multiplying it by the cost ($0.11 per cubic foot) of managing that water otherwise, the study found the Metroparks generate a $30.3 million annual savings in stormwater management alone. Similarly, the study found that the Metroparks remove 793,000 pounds of pollutants from the air annually, saving $2.25 million primarily in health care costs.

McMillan notes that, while the study was focused on the Metroparks, similar benefits will result from any park.

“They’re great for outdoor recreation when the weather’s good, and then they manage storm water when the weather is bad,” she says. “That presents a huge savings to local communities as a whole, and individual property owners that struggle with flooding.”

Given the many ways parks can positively impact the economies surrounding them, McMillan says it’s important not to become “complacent” about the natural resources around us. She notes that developing new parks and managing existing ones are “super intentional things” that “don’t happen by themselves.”

“It’s a virtuous cycle when you invest in public parks because it pays so many benefits to people individually, to the businesses, and we’re all the better for that,” she says.",https://djq2xymdufr22.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/05203607/IMG_FootTruck_20251002_Selections-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 12:08:01.577659

The weeds are where it happens Klein and Thompson are clear that their book does not offer specific policy solutions.","In the introduction to their bestseller Abundance, authors Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson write that the book is “dedicated to a simple idea: to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. That’s it. That’s the thesis. It reads, even to us, as too simple.”

Klein and Thompson are right on both counts.

They are right that addressing the challenges of the climate crisis, affordable housing shortages, prohibitive healthcare costs, and stymied scientific innovation–all topics discussed in the book–will require ramped-up creativity, cooperation, funding, and planning. They are also right that their prescription for this need is too simple, at best.

The book focuses on the proper role and scope of government regulation, arguing that in many situations, government should simply get out of the way. Meanwhile, the warping, smothering influence of corporate money and power lurks on every page unacknowledged, like a monster Klein and Thompson refuse to see.

Scarcity is indeed a choice, as the authors say, but not one being made by overzealous regulators or litigators. Scarcity is a choice made by those who profit from imposing it on the rest of us. The problem is not chiefly a regulatory bottleneck–it is a boot on the neck of progress, competition, innovation, and millions of Americans who struggle to survive, by those enriched by the status quo. Abundance is a detailed indictment of the wrong suspect, which only serves the interests of the real culprits.

A book that hit a nerve

Abundance has garnered significant attention in political and policy circles and has spent more than six months on the New York Times bestseller list, and with good reason. Klein and Thompson are talented writers and the book includes earnest, trenchant observations.

At a time when progressives face constant assault for ineffectual messaging, Abundance feels like a lifeline, offering an alluring vision of a progressive future and identifying past liberal overreach as the barrier to achieving it. In that scenario, it is within liberals’ power to achieve the future “we all want.” Unfortunately, this apparent oasis is a dangerous mirage.

Rose-colored glasses

The original sin of Abundance is careless nostalgia. The book is premised on a rose-colored remembrance of a time when the United States “built things.”

To be sure, the United States has seen periods of explosive growth in manufacturing, housing, highways, and more–in part thanks to lower density, world wars, untapped resources, and undeveloped land. It is true that it only took about five years to erect Hoover Dam. It is also true that scores of workers died during construction.

The “golden ages” of US development came at the cost of lives, neighborhoods, air and water quality, biological diversity, and public health; these costs were largely paid by the poor and those living in Indigenous and front-line communities.

Klein and Thompson are self-described liberals and acknowledge the need for laws protecting the health and wellbeing of people and the environment, but it is difficult to reconcile that with their yearning for the good old days.

Any fair critique of our current regulatory system must begin with a clear-eyed assessment of the devastating, unsustainable, and unjust impacts on people and the planet wrought by oil companies, developers, mining companies, and highway builders before regulations were promulgated to govern them. Abundance fails to do so.

The elephant in the room

In addition to the authors’ averting their eyes from the realities of corporate money and power, they also write in a vacuum divorced from the current political reality.

There is no bill or Executive Order that could pass this Congress, or be signed by this President, to “cut red tape” that would be even remotely responsible. While Klein and Thompson offer their views on the need to speed permitting in good faith, the Trump Administration and the current Congress have already begun to adopt their talking points in the worst faith possible. Big Oil, Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Developers have enormous sway over the agenda in Washington, and they are more than happy to glom on to abundance talking points to maintain wildly profitable scarcities.

Nothing demonstrates this more powerfully than repeal of significant portions of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). While neither law was perfect, the IIJA included billions for new infrastructure development and the IRA included funding and tax incentives in support of sustainable electricity generation, clean transportation, green buildings and energy efficiency, sustainable manufacturing, environmental and climate justice, agriculture, forestry, land conservation, and more. In other words, Congress had enacted much of the abundance agenda.

And then, backed by millions from industry, the Trump Administration and the new Congress repealed virtually all of it (including provisions that were clearly benefiting red states) and replaced it with a budget bill designed to help old industries kill new ones. “Red tape” did not reach up and stymie a new age of abundance, wealthy special interests did, and any permitting “reform” passed now will only benefit those same old power players.

To focus on a utopian future where the biggest barrier to “the world we all want” is an inefficient regulatory process, while ignoring the stranglehold that monied interests have on American progress, fails to meet the moment.

The weeds are where it happens

Klein and Thompson are clear that their book does not offer specific policy solutions. Rather, they are offering a “lens” through which these issues might be examined. This feels inadequate. Permitting reform is not a new issue. Dozens of legislative proposals on the topic exist and the authors should reckon with them.

It turns out, every time lawmakers pushing permitting reform put pen to paper, the resulting legislation is the same: some combination of provisions that truncate public participation, limit judicial review, and privilege fossil fuel development even more. In many cases, the proponents of development are already benefiting from an approval process that skirts public awareness and effective judicial review, and they just want to write those shortcuts into law.

To give a recent example, last month the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted to “cut red tape” and approve three new Entergy gas plants to power a data center for Meta. From the beginning, the proceeding lacked transparency and skipped crucial state-mandated measures aimed at saving money for ratepayers. Review by an Administrative Law Judge of the final deal is typically part of the process, but Commissioners rushed a final vote before the judge could even issue a recommendation to the Commission.

A process that was even slightly less rushed would have allowed the judge to express an opinion about whether this proposal was truly in the “public interest” and allowed the Commissioners to attach bare-minimum safeguards for ratepayers as conditions of approval. Instead, regulators hurriedly granted the wishes of Entergy and Meta.

This is not the “future we all want.” This is abundance for Entergy and Meta’s shareholders at the expense of millions of Louisianans and the environment. If the “lens” described in Abundance can be used to justify this kind of irresponsible permitting, it is not a new vision: it is just a new weapon available to the old guard.

The corporate interests which benefit when these proposals become law once claimed such legislation was necessary to “create jobs.” Over time, the messaging evolved through “energy independence” to “energy dominance.” More recently, “national security” and the need to “beat China” have been the alleged justifications. Now these same special interests can claim we need to bar access to the courts and shut the public out of permitting decisions to achieve abundance.

The future we all want

UCS is a nonpartisan science advocacy organization. We advocate for robust science; accountability for fossil fuel corporations; Environmental Justice; democracy; clean energy; healthy and sustainably produced food; clean transportation; and a safer world. And at every turn, the forces lined up to oppose our advocacy are well-funded, powerful, entrenched special interests who profit from a lack of progress on any of those fronts.

Our experience tells us that curtailing the ability of regulators to place even minimal limitations on the appetites of those special interests will not unleash a new era of progressivism: it will only help the rich get richer.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Blog-Thumbnail-Target-Missed-its-Mark.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 10:00:53.935647

The automaker delivered 710,347 vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, according to company data released Tuesday. That figure reflects balanced gains across gasoline-powered and electric lineups. SUVs such as the Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain and Buick Envista all set records, while full-size pickups and large SUVs continued to drive profits. Through nine months, GM has sold 2.2 million vehicles, its strongest start to a year in more than a decade.

10 Coolest Cars That Rocked Pop-Up Headlights

The standout metric, however, was in EVs. GM delivered 66,501 electric vehicles in the third quarter, its highest volume yet and more than double last year’s pace. Year-to-date EV deliveries now total 144,668 units, cementing GM’s role as the No. 2 EV seller in the U.S., behind Tesla. Analysts credited expanded Ultium-based products, better availability, and competitive pricing.

Still, the strong results come with caveats. The federal $7,500 EV tax credit ended earlier this year under the Trump administration, prompting GM and Ford to quickly launch their own incentive programs of the same value. Analysts say those automaker-backed discounts helped sustain momentum into September, but it remains unclear whether demand will hold steady without federal support.

At the same time, GM’s profitability has lagged. The company reported a 35% income drop for the first half of 2025, citing rising costs, tariffs, and heavy EV investments.

Early state leadership A few governors have already taken a stand to communicate that their states are still open for solar business.
Solar advocates will need to play defense to mitigate the damage.","The Trump Administration’s attack on renewables has rocked the solar industry this year. The full impact of anti-solar legislation and executive orders may not be fully understood until 2026, when the residential tax credit ends, material restrictions begin and start-construction deadlines arrive for the large-scale ITC.

Instead of abandoning all hope, solar advocates are shifting focus to state action.

“Federal government, Congress, they’re walking away from these opportunities. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t an opportunity here,” said Sachu Constantine, executive director of Vote Solar. “We’ve long made the case that the actual decisions about deployment, about what resources go into our grid, are made at the state-level.”

It’s not the first time strategies have shifted. During Donald Trump’s first presidency, a “blue wave” in 2018 awarded many governor seats to Democrats. Solar advocates zeroed in on state policies then, mostly pushing for renewable portfolio standards (RPS) requiring utilities to add solar to their portfolios. Now, enormous data center energy demand combined with overall home electrification are creating new, urgent priorities.

“It’s a more mature industry than it was back then. RPS is not really the driving factor these days,” said Sean Gallagher, senior VP of policy for SEIA. “It’s economics and the need for speed, and the attractiveness of solar and storage in terms of both affordability and reliability.”

State budget sensitivity

HR1 didn’t just decimate solar incentives. It stripped money from the states for crucial programs like Medicaid, student loan funding, SNAP benefits and school meals. States will be pressed to find money for many social programs impacted by HR1, so funding for renewable energy may be hard to come by.

Luckily, many efforts that could help reduce the overall cost of solar may not cost states much at all.

“A lot of this is not brand new, but it’s sort of a renewed emphasis on these nuts and bolts, things that states really can do to both facilitate and expedite bringing more resources online,” Gallagher said.

SEIA outlines some main objectives for all solar markets in its “Post-HR1 State Policy Roadmap.” For the larger market, these include enforcing interconnection timelines by penalizing utilities not in compliance, developing “flexible interconnection” policies to bring more solar online without requiring major grid updates and streamlining requirements for solar + storage projects on state lands.

On the small-scale front, SEIA is especially focused on helping residential installers navigate a post-25D market. The group will encourage AHJs to adopt automatic instant permitting via SolarAPP+, ensure policy is in place for companies to adopt third-party-ownership structures to capture the 48E ITC and work to expand statewide virtual power plant options.

“How can we really reduce cost, particularly in the residential sector, so that we can transition solar from a product that’s sold to a product that’s bought?” Gallagher said of SEIA’s focus.

Early state leadership

A few governors have already taken a stand to communicate that their states are still open for solar business.

“It’s what we’ve seen historically — when there’s been disruptions at the federal level, the leading states will step in and ensure that their trajectory toward their goals is at least maintained, if not further supported,” said Kevin Cray, VP of existing markets and regulatory affairs at the Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA).

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued executive actions over the summer to help residents determine which renewable energy tax credits they qualify for, as well as ensure state agencies cut red tape and prioritize renewable energy projects.

“We must provide confidence to the clean energy industry that Colorado is open for business as tariffs, shifting federal rules, supply chain crunches and market uncertainty risk delaying investment in these affordable domestic energy resources,” wrote Polis in his executive letter.

CCSA worked directly with Polis’ office to offer recommendations for supporting solar in the face of federal uncertainty and was pleased to see its main points reflected in the letter.

“Some of the recommendations around flexible interconnection and stuff like that were very specific, and I think create some of that near-term certainty needed for investments to still move forward,” Cray said.

In Arizona, Gov. Katie Hobbs put forth an executive order in September called “Removing Barriers to Delivering Affordable Energy for Arizona,” with goals of streamlining permitting and speeding energy deployment, including renewables. It establishes the Arizona Energy Promise Taskforce, which will develop plans to facilitate large-scale growth and expand Arizona’s clean energy economy.

SEIA and CCSA see these actions as great examples for other states to follow, especially Colorado’s specificity.

“That’s something that we’re certainly running state to state with at this point — trying to get other governors, administrative agencies, etc., to take similar steps as far as some of the exact provisions of the executive action,” Cray said.

Playing defense

While states that already lead on solar will continue to do so, influential oil and gas companies in others will be looking to take full advantage of the support of this “drill, baby drill” administration. Solar advocates will need to play defense to mitigate the damage.

“What’s unfortunate in some of those red states is that the big actors — let’s say the Duke [Energys] of the world, the Georgia Powers, the Southerns, FPLs — they know that solar is the best option. But they also know that in this environment, with the rhetoric coming out of the federal government, they can continue to try to cram some gas into the rate base,” Vote Solar’s Constantine said.

“Wherever we can, we want to get into the planning process early — the Integrated Resource Plans, where the regulators approve or shape the procurement plans for the utilities,” he continued.

Some of those negative actions are already popping up. Although Arizona’s governor supports solar power, the Arizona Corporation Commission unanimously voted to repeal the state’s RPS the month before she put forth her executive order. And the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada recently voted to approve a new rate design that changes the solar net-metering structure to 15-minute netting and adds mandatory demand charges to all customers. Instead of balancing solar production against usage over a full month, customers will now only get credit for excess energy within each 15-minute window. SEIA said the decision “discourages private investment in reliable, affordable, clean energy at a time when the grid needs every electron it can get to power Nevada’s economy.”

Still, the country needs massive amounts of new energy on the grid, and it needs it quickly. The U.S. Energy Information Administration is forecasting continued average electrical consumption growth of 1.7% through 2026, after growth was nearly flat from 2005 to 2020. Solar has consistently been the fastest-growing source of electricity to meet that demand. Advocates plan to cut through the administration’s rhetoric and stick to those facts to win as many policy battles as possible in this trying time.

“We have to bring a real clear focus now on the economic proposition that solar provides and the speed to power that we can do. We have our work cut out for us. But, as you saw at RE+, I think the industry feels like we’re going to figure out a way to manage through this,” Gallagher said.",https://news.energyjobline.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/energy_jobline_icons-300x300.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 11:05:31.967298

Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline.
Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects.
The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.
It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.","The most cost-effective and quickest way to conserve the Colorado River’s shrinking water supply amid persistent drought and rapid population growth is changing how states handle the largest use of water on the river: agriculture.

Agriculture uses about 80% of the river’s water, but the good news is that paying farmers not to use water allotted to them has proved to be remarkably cost-effective.

That’s according to a comprehensive study examining 462 federally funded Colorado River conservation and supply projects using available spending data from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.

The study, published in the Journal of the American Water Resources Association last week, was conducted by UC Riverside’s School of Public Policy in partnership with the Utah Rivers Council.

The water projects examined – ranging from large-scale infrastructure such as reservoirs and wastewater treatment plants to agricultural water use – totaled about $1 billion in federal funding between 2004 and 2024.

“How much water is actually being saved for every dollar we are spending?” asks Mehdi Nemati, an assistant professor of public policy, co-author of the study. “If we want to be more efficient or gain more water saved per dollar spent, then answering this question matters.”

“The big message is not all water savings are equal. Some projects saved water at a fraction of the cost of others,” he continued.

Agricultural conservation programs conserved water for as low as $69.89 per acre-foot. On average, agricultural conservation programs cost about $417 per acre-foot, while local supply projects —such as reservoirs, wells, and wastewater treatment facilities—cost more than $2,400 per acre-foot on average. (An acre-foot is the amount of water needed to cover one acre of land to a depth of one foot, or about 325,851 gallons.)

“Spending money to conserve water within the agriculture sector seems to be one of the most cost-effective ways. There’s also a lot of room to improve and save more water in this sector,” Nemati said. “About 80% of the water goes to agriculture. If you’re using a big share and it’s more cost-effective, then that’s going to need to be the target.”

Historically, farmers have been reluctant to lower their water use out of fear the government might take their water permanently. But the study found that agricultural conservation programs, particularly those that provided financial incentives to promote behavioral changes among farmers, were successful at delivering water savings at a relatively low cost.

The most common type of agricultural conservation program was paying farmers who rely on the Colorado River to reduce their water use on crops during certain non-critical periods, saving an average of 747 acre-feet per year at a cost of about $140 per acre-foot.

Paying farmers to temporarily leave their fields empty – particularly for water-intensive crops like alfalfa – produced an average annual water saving of 17,500 acre-feet per year at an average cost of about $193 per acre-foot, according to the study.

“Grass, alfalfa, corn pasture, these are all water intensive crops. That’s where we get our most savings per dollar, and there is huge room for savings. I would say these are low hanging fruit,” Nemati said.

Other programs studied paid farmers to replace flood irrigation with precision methods such as drip or sprinkler systems, which demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements while maintaining agricultural productivity.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spent about 30% of water conservation funding between 2004 and 2024 on agricultural projects.

Agricultural conservation projects had an average lifespan of about three years, meaning once those short-term projects end water savings are expected to gradually decline.

Water-intensive crops are where the savings are

Much of the funding used to pay farmers to conserve Colorado River water was provided by the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, which helped double agricultural water conservation from 1.5 million acre-feet of water to over 3 million acre-feet of water, according to the study.

Water recycling and treatment facilities also proved to be a cost-effective way to conserve substantial amounts of water in the long-term, despite higher initial construction costs. Water recycling and treatment facilities had an average lifetime cost of $385 per acre-feet with an average annual water savings of about 18,600 acre-feet.

Despite the large potential for water savings through water reuse projects, only about 7% of the bureau’s water conservation funding was spent on reuse projects. California got the lion’s share of that funding, about 80%. Upper Basin states received only 4% of reuse funding, while Tribal areas received no funding.

There’s a lot of room for improvement in water recycling across states that rely on the Colorado River. One recent study found that Upper Basin states – Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico – recycled less than 5% of their water, as compared to Lower Basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada– which recycled more than 30% of their water.

The study also revealed a major disparity in federal funding for water conservation projects between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin states.

Between 2004 and 2024, Upper Basin states only received about 6% of overall water conservation spending by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, while about 75% was directed to the Lower Basin, and about 19% was designated for Tribal areas, some of which extend across both regions.

Nevada received nearly $6 million for 28 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of roughly 1,500 acre-feet at a cost of about $3,800 per acre-foot.

It’s a stark contrast to Upper Basin states like Colorado, which received about $610,000 in federal funding for 47 water conservation projects for an average annual savings of about 2,100 acre-feet at a cost of about $285 per acre-foot.

It’s an example of how federal dollars could be more efficiently used to conserve water across the Colorado River Basin by rethinking funding priorities.

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

The total electrical generation from coal-fired power plants has decreased, while wind power generation has increased.
Efforts are ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions from existing baseload power plants and other energy generation sites through capture and sequestration methods.
Natural gas production is also growing in the Bakken region in western North Dakota.
Located near the existing Pioneer Generation Station northwest of Williston, PGSIV is Basin Electric’s largest generation project built in North Dakota since the 1980s.","Electricity generation in the U.S. has been growing rapidly this year as a result of increasing demands for power from data centers and industrial customers, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The agency expects that total U.S. generation by the electric power sector will grow by 2.3% this year and another 3% in 2026. Solar power is expected to supply the largest share of the increase in both years.

North Dakota produces significantly more energy than is consumed, and the state is a net exporter of energy. Overall, energy consumption has increased over the past decade, primarily through the growth of the industrial sectors, according to a September 2024 draft research report of the state’s energy security and resilience plans by the Energy & Environmental Research Center for the North Dakota Department of Commerce. The total electrical generation from coal-fired power plants has decreased, while wind power generation has increased. Efforts are ongoing to reduce CO2 emissions from existing baseload power plants and other energy generation sites through capture and sequestration methods.

Most of the electricity produced in the state is generated by coal-fired power plants, although electricity generation from renewable wind power has grown quickly over the past 10 years. Natural gas production is also growing in the Bakken region in western North Dakota.

Taking advantage of the increased natural gas production, Basin Electric Power Cooperative will build a natural gas-fueled combined-cycle power plant in Williams County, called Bison Generation Station. The need for the station was determined through the co-op’s load forecasting and power supply planning process, a release states. This includes an annual load forecast, which is a cooperative effort among distribution members, generation and transmission members, and Basin Electric for its entire service area.

“Basin Electric’s 2024 Load Forecast highlighted strong oil and gas-related growth in the Bakken region, in addition to growth across Basin Electric’s service territory ,” said Benjamin Hertz, Basin Electric’s manager of power supply planning. “Bison Generation Station addresses the growing energy demands of member electric cooperatives, which serve a wide variety of traditional load sectors including agriculture, oil and gas, ethanol, manufacturing and residential.”

Crews began initial site grading in August under the observation of North Dakota Public Service Commission’s third-party inspector. The grading work was done this summer and fall to prepare the site for the planned construction start in 2026.

The flagship resource for Basin Electric’s membership will be capable of providing a long-term dispatchable supply of generation to the area, the release states, which can be delivered across the co-op’s service territory in the Southwest Power Pool.

Another project for the utility is the newly completed Pioneer Generation Station Phase IV. The natural gas-fueled generation facility is a combination of combustion turbine and reciprocating engine units that provide dispatch flexibility while addressing near-term load growth and long-term grid stability in the Bakken region, a release about the project states. Located near the existing Pioneer Generation Station northwest of Williston, PGSIV is Basin Electric’s largest generation project built in North Dakota since the 1980s. It will generate approximately 580 megawatts (MW) of electricity.

Gavin McCollam, Basin Electric senior vice president and chief operating officer, said the successful completion of the PGSIV project – on time, under budget and with a great safety record – is exactly what the team strives for every single time.

Operations at the renovated building are expected to begin in Q1 of 2026.

LAFAYETTE, La. – MMR Group announced it is growing its Louisiana footprint with a $55.2 million investment for a new assembly facility in Lafayette Parish that will expand production of electrical components used in high-growth sectors such as data centers and semiconductors.

The company is expected to create 196 direct new jobs in Lafayette over the next 10 years with an average annual salary of $85,000 and retain approximately 3,000 current positions across the state. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 335 indirect new jobs, for a total of 531 potential new job opportunities in the Acadiana Region.

“For more than 30 years, MMR Group has helped power Louisiana’s economy, and this expansion proves how vital our homegrown companies are to the state’s success,” said Governor Jeff Landry. “This administration is committed to ensuring that MMR, and all Louisiana businesses, benefit from the historic momentum we are seeing across our state, turning growth into opportunity for every region and every family.”

The retrofitted facility will allow MMR to produce modular systems on site, all critical elements in the construction of AI and data centers throughout the nation.

The investment bank also raised its price target on Ford by 33.3% to $12.
Ford‘s shares have closed at $12.67 on Friday and have surged nearly 30% year to date.
According to Jefferies, Ford‘s strong compliance with US fuel economy and emissions rules, combined with earned regulatory credits, has kept its compliance costs low.
Houchois also raised the firm’s price target on Detroit automaker General Motors, from $50 to $55, while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock.","Jefferies upgraded Ford‘s stock rating from Underperform to a Hold rating on Monday, noting the Detroit automaker’s shift in EV strategy for the upcoming months.

The investment bank also raised its price target on Ford by 33.3% to $12.

Ford‘s shares have closed at $12.67 on Friday and have surged nearly 30% year to date.

Analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a new research note — obtained by PriceTarget — that Ford‘s management had already mentioned a “multi-billion opportunity” for the company given “looser” GHG (greenhouse gas) and CO2 regulations.

This allows the company to concentrate on selling more profitable petrol and diesel models — especially pick-up trucks and SUVs, which make up a large portion of its US sales.

Jefferies expects Ford “will refrain from providing 2026 guidance until next year,” after the company suspended its 2025 guidance in May, citing the uncertainty of the US tariffs’ impact.

By then, Ford said it expected to take a $1.5 billion hit caused by Trump’s tariffs.

However, the analyst said that the automaker “could comment on potential mix benefits starting in Q4 and a shift in EV strategy.”

Last week, the company announced that it delivered a record 85,789 electric vehicles in the third quarter, as demand jumped ahead of the EV consumer credit deadline on September 30.

“We already assumed lower losses from model e,” Houchois noted, as Ford both shifts EV exposure to Europe, “where unit losses are lower,” and as the company normalizes “spending on the Universal Platform scheduled for 2027.”

In August, the analyst had already said that the automaker should be able to materially reduce losses at its Model e electric vehicle unit from 2026, pointing to Q2 results that showed all incremental revenue over Q1 coming from Europe, while divisional losses held steady.

Ford announced in August that it will invest “approximately $5 billion” to develop a new EV platform and launch a midsize four-door electric pickup in 2027 with a target starting price of $30,000.

According to Jefferies, Ford‘s strong compliance with US fuel economy and emissions rules, combined with earned regulatory credits, has kept its compliance costs low.

In a earlier note, Houchois raised the firm’s 2025 adjusted EBIT estimate for Ford by 2% to $6.9 billion, with its Credit division offsetting weaker Pro segment results.

They also lifted its free cash flow forecast by 12% to $2.7 billion on a higher internal Credit dividend — though still below company guidance.

On Monday, Houchois wrote that 43% of Ford‘s US volume is in full size pick-ups and SUVs, while estimating that 60 to 80% of North American sales and profits are coming from Ford‘s Pro and Blue divisions.

“Loosening current constraints” on a mix of higher CO2 mix models, like the Raptor and ST-Line, “should enable Ford to offset tariffs and improve earnings next year.”

Jefferies expects Ford “to remain committed to an electrification strategy,” saying that it should benefit from a longer adjustment period.”

Given Friday’s closing price of Ford shares, the new price target implies a downside of 5.3%.

Houchois also raised the firm’s price target on Detroit automaker General Motors, from $50 to $55, while maintaining a Hold rating on the stock.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cqdam.web_.2400.webp?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-06 10:01:14.409826

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.
And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.
“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.
The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.","U.S. government support of sustainable aviation fuel has waned, shifting the impetus for increasing its production to the states. But progress continues.

“It’s a pivot,” says Keith Sawyer, Avfuel manager of alternative fuels. “The focus had been typically on the federal government; now investors are including what may or may not be offered by states in their calculations, in their rates of return on investment in facilities.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) that became law with President Donald Trump’s signature on July 4 amended the existing 45Z clean fuel production credit (CFPC) to benefit biofuel producers instead of blenders and extended it for two years through 2029. Added to the tax code during the Biden administration through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the CFPC was set to expire in 2027.

The continuation of the tax credit is cause for some optimism that ongoing development of SAF capacity is supported—given that one of Trump’s early actions after becoming president in January was to pause funding disbursements under the IRA, which was considered a major achievement of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda.

Trump’s executive order was slowed by legal challenges, but the OBBB approved by the Republican majority in Congress contains a section that rescinds unobligated balances of the FAA’s Fueling Aviation’s Sustainable Transition (FAST) grant program, also established under the IRA.

The Biden administration had announced $291 million in FAST grants in August 2024, primarily for 22 projects “that produce, transport, blend or store sustainable aviation fuel.” The largest single grant—$50 million—went to Martinez Renewables LLC, a 50/50 joint venture of Marathon Petroleum and SAF producer Neste, to fund the conversion of a Marathon facility in Martinez, California, for renewable fuels production.

Neste confirmed to BCA that the grant was rescinded by the FAA earlier this year before any funds were disbursed.

Under the OBBB, the CFPC has been modified; the value of the credit for production of “neat” or pure, unblended SAF declines from $1.75-per-gallon to $1-per-gallon after 2025, aligning it with the credit for renewable diesel. And the CFPC will apply only to SAF that is derived from renewable feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada. Sugar cane, soybeans, tallow, used oils and greases sourced outside of North America won’t qualify.

“It’s a focus on North American supply and very centric to the U.S,” says Sawyer.

The modifications and extension of the CFPC through 2029 represent “a significant win for agriculture-linked, domestic renewable fuels” derived from corn, soybeans and other biomass-based feedstocks, affirms the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Also welcoming the new 45Z credit as one of the OBBB’s “America First” energy provisions was Americans for Clean Aviation Fuels, a coalition that joins Airbus, Airlines for America, Delta Air Lines, and NBAA representing the aviation industry with agriculture groups and energy companies ExxonMobil and BP.

Ready to explore how your facility qualifies for New Jersey manufacturing tax credits?","Governor Phil Murphy signed the Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program into law on August 13, 2025. This marks New Jersey’s most significant manufacturing investment in recent history.

The program allocates $500 million in New Jersey manufacturing tax credits. But these aren’t standard tax incentives. They’re transferable, stackable, and designed to reward manufacturers who think long-term.

Why New Jersey is betting big on manufacturing now

The New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) has already approved 431 applications through its Manufacturing Voucher Program, distributing over $66.2 million. These companies committed to investing $252.7 million in return, nearly four times the state’s contribution.

That’s the multiplier effect New Jersey wants to replicate at scale.

The state faces increasing pressure from federal tariffs and supply chain disruptions. This program utilizes $500 million from existing Aspire and Emerge credits, redirecting them specifically toward manufacturing job creation and in-state production capacity.

Understanding New Jersey manufacturing tax credits

The credit calculation follows a specific formula. You receive the lesser of three amounts:

Formula 1: 0.1% of your total capital investment × number of new full-time jobs created

Formula 2: 25% of your total qualified capital investment

Formula 3: $150 million (program maximum per project)

Let’s make this concrete. Say your facility plans a $50 million equipment upgrade and will create 100 new positions.

Formula 1: ($50M × 0.001) × 100 = $5 million

Formula 2: $50M × 0.25 = $12.5 million

Formula 3: $150M (not applicable)

You’d receive $5 million in New Jersey manufacturing tax credits under this scenario.

The clean energy carve-out creates first mover advantage

$100 million in tax credits during the first two years are reserved exclusively for clean energy product manufacturers. This includes solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen production.

After two years, unused clean energy credits roll into general manufacturing allocation. This creates a window where clean energy manufacturers face less competition for funds.

If your facility produces components for renewable energy systems, you’re competing for a smaller pool initially. That improves your odds significantly.

Bonus credits stack and they add up fast

The base credit is just your starting point. New Jersey offers stackable bonuses for companies holding state business certifications, operating in Opportunity Zones, or maintaining collective bargaining agreements.

These bonuses can add up to 5% to your total credit. On a $10 million award, that’s an additional $500,000.

Bonus eligibility categories:

Minority and Women Business Enterprises (MWBE) certification

Veteran-Owned Business (VOB) certification

Opportunity Zone location

Collective bargaining or labor harmony agreements

Multiple bonuses can apply simultaneously. A MWBE-certified manufacturer in an Opportunity Zone with union representation qualifies for multiple stacked benefits.

What “Qualified Business Facility” actually means

Your project must center on a physical manufacturing facility in New Jersey. The minimum capital investment threshold sits at $10 million.

Capital investment includes:

Manufacturing equipment and machinery

Facility construction or expansion

Technology systems supporting production

Technology systems supporting production

It excludes

Working capital

Inventory

Non-manufacturing administrative spaces

The facility must remain operational in New Jersey for 10 years. This isn’t a short-term play.

Job creation requirements go beyong headcount

You must create at least 20 new full-time positions. But quantity isn’t enough, these positions must meet specific wage requirements.

The program emphasizes “good-paying jobs“. While exact wage thresholds aren’t published yet, expect them to align with prevailing wage standards for manufacturing in New Jersey.

The program also requires partnerships with New Jersey educational institutions or workforce entities. This ensures your hiring connects with local talent development infrastructure.

Environmental standards are non-negotiable

Every participating facility must comply with minimum environmental and sustainability standards. These requirements recognize that modern manufacturing success depends on sustainable practices.

Expect documentation requirements around:

Energy efficiency measures

Waste reduction protocols

Emissions management

Water conservation practices

Green manufacturing isn’t just good for New Jersey manufacturing tax credits eligibility, it’s increasingly what customers demand.

Credits are issued over five years not upfront

Your total credit award gets distributed over a five-year period. Annual disbursements depend on continued compliance.

You must maintain:

Required job levels

Facility operations in New Jersey

Educational/workforce partnerships

Prevailing wage standards

Environmental compliance

Fail any requirement, and that year’s credit is forfeited. This structure protects taxpayer investment while ensuring manufacturers deliver promised benefits.

The transferability feature changes everything

These credits are transferable, meaning you can sell or assign them.

For manufacturers without sufficient tax liability to use credits immediately, transferability creates liquidity. You can monetize credits through sale to companies with tax liability.

This transforms credits from future tax savings into current capital, exactly what growing manufacturers need.

Unused credits can be carried forward for 10 years, providing additional flexibility for facilities with variable tax liability.

Applications open soon on first-come, first-served basis

The NJEDA will accept rolling applications through March 1, 2029. But the $500 million pool operates first-come, first-served.

Early applications have strategic advantages:

Less competition for available funds

More time to gather documentation

Ability to adjust project plans based on feedback

Projects already in planning stages should accelerate preparation. Every month of delay means more competitors enter the queue.

What should manufacturers do right now?

Assess project timing: Can you reach the $10 million capital investment threshold? Do you have expansion plans that could be accelerated?

Review workforce plans: Will you create at least 20 new positions? How do wages compare to prevailing standards?

Identify partnership opportunities: Which New Jersey educational institutions or workforce programs align with your hiring needs?

Document sustainability measures: What environmental standards does your facility already meet? Where can you strenghten compliance?

Calculate potential credits: Run the formulas with your actual investment and job creation numbers. Understand your realistic award range.

The strategic context: Why this matters beyond tax savings

New Jersey positions itself as having “the most diverse and inclusive innovation ecosystem in the nation“. This program advances that vision through targeted manufacturing support.

For manufacturers, New Jersey manufacturing tax credits represent more than tax relief. They signal where the state is investing infrastructure, workforce development and regulatory support.

Facilities that establish themselves now gain access to an ecosystem being actively built around manufacturing success.

Next steps for your facility

The NJEDA hasn’t opened applications yet. But preparation determines success.

Companies that win competitive funding programs share common traits: they start early, document thoroughly and align projects with program priorities.

Tesla has teased an October 7 event, likely to unveil a more affordable Model Y and sustain sales.

Tesla expects the more affordable Model Y to be 20% cheaper to manufacture and aims to reach an annual production of 250,000 units in the U.S. by 2026.

The teaser follows record quarterly deliveries ahead of the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, but analysts warn that sales may slow without incentives.

On Sunday, Tesla teased an event on October 7, sending shares up 2% in premarket trading as investors and analysts speculated that the company may unveil a long-awaited, more affordable electric vehicle.

The teaser, a nine-second video posted on the social media platform X, showed a vehicle with its headlights illuminated in a dark setting. A second video hinted at the scheduled date with “10/7” at the end, stoking anticipation for the announcement.

Analysts expect Tesla to unveil a lower-cost version of its Model Y, which the company had previously delayed in the U.S. market. In June, Tesla announced that it had completed the “first builds” of the vehicle, with plans to begin selling it in the fourth quarter and gradually ramp up production. The stripped-down Model Y is projected to cost roughly 20% less to produce than the refreshed version.

The teaser follows Tesla’s record quarterly deliveries for the three months ending September, fueled by a surge in purchases before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. However, analysts warn that sales may slow in the coming months without the incentive. Wall Street estimates Tesla’s deliveries will climb to 1.85 million vehicles in 2025, with the new model contributing about 155,610 units by 2026, according to Visible Alpha data.

Tesla faces mounting pressure from an aging vehicle lineup. The automaker has not introduced a new mass-market model in years, relying instead on incremental updates to the Model 3 and Model Y. The company’s most recent major launch, the Cybertruck, has underperformed, prompting the company to offer discounts on its inventory. A U.S. recall filing in March showed that 46,096 Cybertrucks were built between its November 2023 debut and early 2024.

The October 7 event is viewed as a pivotal moment for Tesla to sustain sales momentum and capture buyer interest amid rising competition and the impending end of federal EV tax incentives.

The move adds a third production site to existing facilities in Edina, Minnesota and Jubail, Saudi Arabia, positioning the company to meet rising demand across the Asia-Pacific region more efficiently and sustainably.

The agreement, scheduled to close in Q4 2025, forms part of DuPont’s long-term strategy to strengthen regional manufacturing and reduce the distance between production and end use.

It directly supports DuPont’s flagship water technology brand, FilmTec, which produces high-efficiency membranes used in reverse osmosis water purification.

""This acquisition aligns with our strategy to enhance our global manufacturing capabilities for FilmTec RO elements and better serve our customers in China and the Asia Pacific region,"" explains Jeroen Bloemhard, President of DuPont's Healthcare & Water Technologies segment.

""With an expanded global manufacturing footprint, DuPont remains dedicated to providing solutions that purify and reclaim water sources, particularly in regions facing water scarcity and resource challenges.""

Local manufacturing to support resilient water supply chains

Reverse osmosis is a pressure-driven process that removes salts, minerals and dissolved solids from water. It is widely used across sectors such as power generation, food production and municipal water supply.

With growing industrial demand and increased urbanisation across the Asia-Pacific region, DuPont sees regional production as essential for fast and reliable delivery of water treatment technologies.

By manufacturing FilmTec RO elements locally in China, DuPont says it can reduce delivery lead times, simplify logistics and better navigate market-specific regulations.

The newly-acquired Sinochem site is already qualified to produce FilmTec membranes for use in China and the wider Asia-Pacific market. The goal is to localise supply for regional customers while increasing flexibility and lowering operational risk.

DuPont’s approach is based on matching production capabilities with geographic demand. It allows the company to serve its core customers, industrial users, municipal water authorities and food and beverage manufacturers, through shorter supply routes and improved regional agility.

The localisation strategy also plays a key role in supporting supply chain continuity. In an environment where global logistics are often strained and regulatory conditions evolve rapidly, the company says having regional manufacturing nodes is now essential.

Water treatment and the energy transition

DuPont’s broader water technology portfolio already purifies more than 50 million gallons of water per minute across 112 countries, through a combination of membrane and resin products.

The technologies are used in desalination, demineralisation and water reuse applications.

FilmTec, as the core brand for RO membranes, is widely recognised for delivering high performance in demanding conditions. The company continues to focus on the intersection of water and energy challenges.

DuPont’s water technologies are used not only in traditional industrial applications but also in energy-related sectors, including lithium extraction and green hydrogen production. Both areas require large volumes of purified water and are central to future clean energy strategies.

By adding a localised manufacturing base in China, DuPont can respond more effectively to these emerging demands. The move also supports sustainability by reducing reliance on long-distance shipping, which lowers the carbon footprint of supply and improves the speed of delivery for critical components.

The acquisition strengthens DuPont’s ability to supply essential infrastructure components at a time when water scarcity is intensifying and pressure to reuse industrial water is rising.

The combination of regional production, reliable technology and application-specific expertise positions DuPont to address both environmental and operational challenges in a growing market.

Preparing for rising water demand in Asia-Pacific

The Asia-Pacific region is facing one of the fastest increases in demand for advanced water treatment solutions. Industries and governments alike are investing in solutions that can support growing populations, climate resilience and circular water use.

Reverse osmosis is central to these efforts, offering a proven method for turning previously unusable water sources into clean, usable water.

With this acquisition, DuPont is aligning its operations with these long-term trends.

The decision to build regional resilience through local manufacturing is not just a cost-saving measure, it is also a forward-looking approach to securing water supply chains for sectors that increasingly depend on reliable purification technologies.

By reinforcing its FilmTec manufacturing network in China, DuPont is aiming to meet regional needs quickly, adapt to local conditions and deliver RO elements more sustainably.

As demand for clean water and reuse solutions grows, DuPont’s expanded footprint could play a key role in enabling more efficient and secure water systems across Asia-Pacific.

The Sinochem facility looks set to serve as a strategic hub in DuPont’s effort to balance global supply capacity with localised market response.

Through this model, the company is working to ensure its technologies can be delivered where and when they are needed most, while building supply chains that are both robust and responsible.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8a15e740bc3ecfb1d7e9c3456e7d691a:f235d9d7d5a5552548c185af57ffb45a/reverse-osmosis.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:00:15.884580

Although EPA risk evaluations are based on theoretical and conservatively modeled conditions that are often criticized, the draft evaluation demonstrates a shift in the EPA's position as it relates to D4. For the first time, the agency has concluded that D4 may pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment under certain circumstances. The EPA found that D4—a chemical precursor widely used to produce various silicone chemicals and an ingredient in certain personal care products—presents unreasonable risk to human health via several potential exposure pathways that are covered under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Key findings include:

Human Health Risks

Unreasonable risks were identified for workers across 23 conditions of use, and for consumers under one condition of use, when recommended personal protective equipment is not used.

Environmental Risks

D4 was found to pose unreasonable environmental risks under seven conditions of use.

No Risk Identified

Over 30 additional conditions of use were evaluated and found not to present unreasonable risks to human health or the environment.

The conditions allegedly associated with elevated risk primarily involved manufacturing, processing, and industrial uses of D4 and its derivatives in adhesive, sealant, paint, coating, corrosion inhibitor, and solvent applications. Notably, the conditions of use considered by EPA are theoretical and conservatively modeled exposure scenarios that do not account for the use of personal protective equipment and other safeguards utilized to reduce chemical exposure in industrial and environmental settings. Therefore, they may not represent actual exposure scenarios for this chemical.

In light of EPA's draft evaluation, companies operating in industrial sectors should continue to monitor future developments concerning D4 and consult counsel as appropriate. Companies can also submit comments to EPA on the risk evaluation until 17 November 2025. EPA will hold a virtual public meeting about the risk evaluation in early December 2025.

(Nasdaq: NUAI) (“New Era,” or the “Company”), a developer and operator of next-generation digital infrastructure and integrated power assets, today announced the commencement of Phase Two engineering for Texas Critical Data Centers LLC (“TCDC”), its flagship data center and power development project located in West Texas. In addition, on October 3, 2025, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission providing an update on its financial status.

Phase Two Engineering Underway

New Era recently announced the completion of Phase One engineering for the TCDC project [read here], its joint venture with Sharon AI Inc. TCDC has now advanced into Phase Two engineering, focusing on detailed site planning, site clearing, and infrastructure integration for the data center campus. TCDC is collecting bids for site clearing, with work expected to begin within the next 60 days.

TCDC also highlighted significant progress on obtaining air permits. The data center site is located in an air-quality attainment zone, a positive factor differentiating it from other data center projects. TCDC is pursuing a minor source air permit, a streamlined process that allows up to 250 tons of emissions per year and can typically be approved within 90 days. By comparison, a major source air permit under current air emission standards can take 18 months or longer. TCDC believes its flexibility to develop multiple power islands under minor source air permitting standards provides another key competitive advantage, setting its data center campus apart from other developments.

Land Expansion

TCDC plans to close on the acquisition of the additional 203 acres previously announced within 60–90 days, expanding the site to 438 contiguous acres and further strengthening its land position for long-term scalability. With this land expansion, TCDC’s West Texas data center campus is now being designed to ultimately scale to 1 GW or above, supporting the surging demand for AI and GPU-driven digital infrastructure.

Project Timeline

Questioning the Science President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.
In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.
Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.
Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.","The Trump administration’s plan to revoke a key finding that certain greenhouse gases pose a risk to human health removes one of the most potent tools for emissions regulation from the last two decades, according to former EPA air office leadership.

The proposal to nix the 2009 endangerment finding is on a fast-track for finalization, and former leaders of the Environmental Protection Agency say it will claw back US climate progress and create a vacuum of strong GHG regulations.

“The political leadership is essentially performing a lobotomy on itself,” according to Joe Goffman, who led the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation under President Joe Biden. “The surgery began when they essentially shed all of the climate staff in the last couple of months.”

Three former EPA Administrators—William Reilly, Christine Todd Whitman, and Gina McCarthy—wrote to current Administrator Lee Zeldin Sept. 22, expressing opposition to the endangerment proposal and urging him to “follow the law, the science, and EPA’s mission” by withdrawing the revocation plan.

Following through with the plan, in combination with the agency’s decision to end greenhouse gas reporting requirements, jeopardizes emissions enforcement under the Clean Air Act, Whitman said in an interview with Bloomberg Law.

“The whole point behind all of this is to stop regulating, the irony that’s lost on most people, that we are banning Tylenol, but we don’t seem to care about air pollution,” Whitman said, referencing unproven claims from the Trump administration about the alleged dangers of the pain and fever reducer.

Questioning the Science

President Donald Trump’s endangerment proposal is just one controversial item in a long list of plans to deregulate oil and gas companies and pave the way for heavy industry expansion and a boon of AI infrastructure.

The EPA is also looking to cut its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which would end agency insight into how much GHG pollution is coming from large emitters across the country.

In the decades before Trump, the agency turned down many petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding with “robustly reasoned denials” according to Goffman.

Supporters of Trump’s plan to kill the finding this time around echo some of the justifications used in unsuccessful petitions of the past, namely that the finding puts undue regulatory pressure on industry and is based on faulty or incomplete scientific record.

The proposal itself relies heavily on a Department of Energy report that casts doubt on the extensive scientific record on climate change, claiming that carbon-induced warming “might be less damaging economically than commonly believed, and excessively aggressive mitigation policies could prove more detrimental than beneficial.”

Creating Uncertainty

Staff who served during the agency’s early climate work in the late 90s and early 2000s fought for the type of change the endangerment finding eventually brought to the EPA’s air rulemaking regime, and see major backsliding on climate mitigation without such a crucial tool.

Before the endangerment finding, climate work was a volunteer-led effort, which is where Jeremy Symons, an EPA career staff member from 1994 to 2001, began his career at the agency.

But those efforts “were not getting the kind of emissions reductions that science was clearly showing would be needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tail pipes and smoke stacks,” Symons said.

The revocation proposal is currently just past its public comment period, and working its way to finalization. Once final, legal challenges are all but inevitable, which many clean air experts say hurts industry as much as public health with prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

Regulating emissions moving forward without the finding amounts to “chaos,” according to Symons.

“It’s the worst case scenario for our safety,” he said. “It’s the worst case scenario for business, because the one thing that hurts everybody is having this chaotic wrecking ball approach that nobody thinks will stand up over the long term.”",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/9eece9d/2147483647/crop/5996x2311+0+177/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2Fc4%2F72754f4d49ad98904a2e0d6fb29e%2Fdec3-smog.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:28.819086

Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good.
I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact.
I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too.
They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them.","But I don’t think this is a reason to be pessimistic. I see it as cause for optimism, because humans are very good at inventing things. In fact, we’ve already created many tools that are reducing emissions. In just the past 10 years, energy breakthroughs have lowered the global forecast for emissions in 2040 by 40%. In other words, because of the human capacity to innovate, we are on course to reduce emissions substantially by 2040 even if nothing else changes.

And I am confident that more positive changes are coming. I’ve been learning about global warming and investing in ideas to stop it for the past 20 years. I’ve connected with unbiased scientists and innovators who are committed to preventing a climate disaster. Ten years ago, some of them joined me in creating Breakthrough Energy, an investment group whose sole purpose is to accelerate clean energy innovation. We’ve supported more than 150 companies so far, many of which have blossomed into major businesses such as Fervo Energy and Redwood Materials, two of this year’s Companies to Watch. [Editor’s note: Mr. Gates did not participate in the selection process of this year’s companies and was not aware that two Breakthrough investments had been selected when he agreed to write this essay.]

Yet climate technologies offer more than just a public good. They will remake virtually every aspect of the world’s economy in the coming years, transforming energy markets, manufacturing, transportation, and many types of industry and food production. Some of these efforts will require long-term commitments, but it’s important that we act now. And what’s more, it’s already clear where the opportunities lie.

In the past decade, an ecosystem of thousands of innovators, investors, and industry leaders has emerged to work on every aspect of the problem. This year’s list of 10 Climate Tech Companies to Watch shows just a few of the many examples.

Although much of this innovation ecosystem has matured on American shores, it has become a global movement that won’t be stopped by new obstacles in the US. It’s unfortunate that governments in the US and other countries have decided to cut funding for climate innovations and reverse some of the policies that help breakthrough ideas get to scale. In this environment, we need to be more rigorous than ever about spending our time, money, and ingenuity on efforts that will have the biggest impact.

How do we figure out which ones those are? First, by understanding which activities are responsible for the most emissions. I group them into five categories: electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and heating and cooling for buildings.

Of course, the zero-carbon tools we have today aren’t distributed evenly across these sectors. In some sectors, like electricity, we’ve made a great deal of progress. In others, like agriculture and manufacturing, we’ve made much less. To compare progress across the board, I use what I call the Green Premium, which is the difference in cost between the clean way of doing something and the conventional way that produces emissions.

For example, sustainable aviation fuel now costs more than twice as much as conventional jet fuel, so it has a Green Premium of over 100%. Solar and wind power have grown quickly because in many cases they’re cheaper than conventional sources of electricity—that is, they have a negative Green Premium.

The Green Premium isn’t purely financial. To be competitive, clean alternatives also need to be as practical as what they’re replacing. Far more people will buy EVs once you can charge one up as quickly as you can fill your tank with gasoline.

I think the Green Premium is the best way to identify areas of great impact. Where it’s high, as in the case of jet fuel, we need innovators and investors to jump on the problem. Where it’s low or even negative, we need to overcome the barriers that are keeping the technologies from reaching a global scale.

A new technology has to overcome a lot of challenges to beat the incumbents, but being able to compete on cost is absolutely essential. So if I could offer one piece of advice to every company working on zero-carbon technologies, it would be to focus on lowering and eliminating the Green Premium in whatever sector you’ve chosen. Think big. If your technology can be competitive enough to eventually eliminate at least 1% of global emissions per year—that’s 0.5 gigatons—you’re on the right track.

I’d encourage policymakers to bring this sector-by-sector focus on the Green Premium to their work, too. They should also protect funding for clean technologies and the policies that promote them. This is not just a public good: The countries that win the race to develop these breakthroughs will create jobs, hold enormous economic power for decades to come, and become more energy independent.

In addition, young scientists and entrepreneurs should think about how they can put their skills toward these challenges. It’s an exciting time—the people who begin a career in clean technology today will have an enormous impact on human welfare. If you need pointers, the Climate Tech Atlas published last month by Breakthrough Energy and other partners is an excellent guide to the technologies that are essential for decarbonizing the economy and helping people adapt to a warmer climate.

Finally, I’d encourage investors to put serious money into companies with technologies that can meaningfully reduce the Green Premium. Consider it an investment in what will be the biggest growth industry of the 21st century. Companies have made dramatic progress on better and cleaner solutions in every sector; what many of them need now is private-sector capital and partnerships to help them reach the scale at which they’ll have a real impact on emissions.

Transforming the entire physical economy is an unprecedented task, and it can only be accomplished through markets—by supporting companies with breakthrough ideas that beat fossil fuels on cost and practicality. It’s going to take investors who are both patient and willing to accept the risk that some companies will fail. Of course, governments and nonprofits have a role in the energy transition too, but ultimately, our success will hinge on climate innovators’ ability to build profitable companies.

If we get this right—and I believe we will—then in the next decade, we’ll see fewer news stories about missed emissions targets and more stories about how emissions are dropping fast because the world invented and deployed breakthrough ideas: clean liquid fuels that power passenger jets and cargo ships; neighborhoods built with zero-emissions steel and cement; fusion plants that generate an inexhaustible supply of clean electricity.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bill-Gates_Headshot_social.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 08:00:20.095043

Now we're taking our biggest international leap yet. We've just launched our first African energy fund with the goal of mobilising £250 million over the next three years to bring clean energy to communities across the continent.

Unlocking Africa’s Renewable Potential

Africa is home to nearly 40% of the world's renewable energy potential. Yet this energy-rich continent receives just 2% of global clean energy investment. Millions of people still lack reliable electricity despite sitting on some of the planet's best solar and wind resources.

That’s exactly what we want to change. To supercharge the energy transition across Africa’s sun-soaked landscapes, we’ve launched the Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund with an initial £60 million and an ambitious plan to grow it to £250 million over the next three years. From rooftop solar and battery storage to electric vehicle charging and smart grid upgrades, the fund will back projects that light up Sub-Saharan Africa.

A Different Approach to Investment

We want to do this right. That's why we're working with investors who share our mission and who understand that positive impact and investment go together. These include family offices, foundations, and individuals who care about building something meaningful alongside financial success.

We're also working with fund design experts to create more flexible investment structures than typical infrastructure funds, ensuring our approach works for both investors and the communities we're supporting.

Creating Opportunity, One Community at a Time

While our new Octopus Energy Power Africa Fund is our most ambitious leap in Africa yet, it’s far from the beginning of our journey there. In partnership with Idris Elba’s Akuna Group, we’re building Sierra Leone's first wind farm to bring clean, affordable energy to the area and kick-start a new wave of green economy,

Across Africa, brilliant minds are developing the next breakthrough energy technologies. To celebrate and support their innovation, we’ve launched the Africa Energy Entrepreneurship Awards in partnership with the King’s Sustainable Markets Initiative.

And we are also working with MOPO, a solar-powered battery company renting power-bank-style units on a pay-as-you-go basis, helping households and businesses unlock economic opportunities that were previously out of reach.

Global problems require global solutions

You might wonder what an African solar farm has to do with British energy customers. The answer is everything. Climate change doesn't respect borders. Every solar panel installed in Kenya reduces global carbon emissions. Every wind turbine in South Africa means one less coal plant needed anywhere else.

The global energy transition benefits everyone. By generating power where the sun shines brightest and the wind blows strongest, we can make the most of abundant renewable potential. This means driving down energy costs quickly while building a clean energy system that benefits all.

When we help power a hospital in Ghana or connect a school in Kenya to the grid, we're part of building a fairer, cleaner world. Africa's energy demand is expected to grow faster than anywhere on Earth. The choice we make now about how to power that growth will shape the climate for generations.

The Energy Revolution Goes Global

We've proven that renewable energy can be cheap, reliable, and popular. Our customers love our clean tariffs and innovative products. like The Collective, where people can invest in local wind and solar projects from £25.

Now we're scaling that success globally. Africa could become a clean energy superpower with its abundant sunshine, strong winds, and growing energy demand. Expanding access to renewable energy doesn’t just power homes; it powers opportunity. It enables entrepreneurs to thrive, businesses to grow, and communities to build sustainable prosperity for the future.

Our job as a global energy disruptor is to help local communities and investors make that happen.

In fact, it’s now building the world’s largest enhanced geothermal power plant, Cape Station, in southwestern Utah.
Southern California Edison, Shell Energy North America, and others have agreed to buy electricity from the 500-megawatt–capacity project starting next year.
As of 2022, the US had almost 4,000 megawatts of installed geothermal energy, meaning Cape Station would be equivalent to around 12% of the country’s geothermal capacity.
Caveats Any fracking project comes with the risk of earthquakes—a hazard that has plagued previous geothermal efforts in South Korea and Switzerland.","By harnessing heat from deep below ground, Fervo promises 24/7 clean geothermal energy—potentially anywhere. The company uses fracking techniques to create geothermal reservoirs capable of delivering enough electricity to power massive data centers and hundreds of thousands of homes.

Some places on Earth hit the geological jackpot for generating electricity. In those spots, three conditions naturally align: high temperatures, plentiful water, and rock that’s permeable enough for fluids to circulate through.

Enhanced geothermal systems aim to replicate those conditions in far more places—producing a steady supply of renewable energy wherever they’re deployed. Fervo’s approach centers on two key techniques borrowed from the oil and gas industry.

First, the company uses fracking, pumping high-pressure water to crack open the deep, hot rock. Second, in addition to drilling down, Fervo also drills sideways. This means Fervo can access more hot rock in each well.

Combining these strategies with special diamond drilling bits that rapidly chew through rock means Fervo can drill faster and cheaper than previously thought possible for geothermal. As a result, the cost of its electricity could be competitive with—or even more affordable than—other sources like coal or nuclear power.

Fervo has already shown that its technology can deliver power at commercial scale. In 2023, its Project Red in Nevada demonstrated its 3.5-megawatt capacity and began feeding electricity into the local grid that powers Google’s data centers.

Key indicators

Industry: Geothermal energy

Founded: 2017

Headquarters: Houston, Texas, US

Notable fact: In June, Fervo announced it had drilled its hottest and deepest well to date: a well plunging 15,765 feet deep and reaching 520 °F (271 °C).

Potential for impact

Geothermal plants provide low-emissions power and need less land to produce the same amount of electricity as other renewable energy sources and coal-fired power stations. And unlike weather-dependent wind and solar, geothermal can be a round-the-clock energy source for the grid. That could be a major benefit as AI and data centers push electricity demand higher across the US and around the world.

Fervo was featured on the 2023 edition of this list and has made steady progress since. In fact, it’s now building the world’s largest enhanced geothermal power plant, Cape Station, in southwestern Utah.

Southern California Edison, Shell Energy North America, and others have agreed to buy electricity from the 500-megawatt–capacity project starting next year. That’s enough energy to power more than 400,000 average-sized US homes. As of 2022, the US had almost 4,000 megawatts of installed geothermal energy, meaning Cape Station would be equivalent to around 12% of the country’s geothermal capacity.

Fervo also benefits from a rare political sweet spot: US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was one of Fervo’s early investors while at the energy services firm Liberty Energy, has listed geothermal as one of his top priorities.

Caveats

Any fracking project comes with the risk of earthquakes—a hazard that has plagued previous geothermal efforts in South Korea and Switzerland.

Fervo reduces that risk by fracking wells in smaller stages. This strategy, which involves pumping fluid into the rock in sections, reduces the risk of large fractures that can trigger significant seismic activity. Fervo also operates dozens of seismic monitors around its sites.

Lengthy review timelines could still slow the company’s progress. Planned expansions to the Cape Station project took about three years to go through the federal permitting process, and developments on federal land can take more than 10 years to get approval. Without streamlining, future projects may be subject to the same waiting game.

Next steps

The first phase of Fervo’s Cape Station in southern Utah is slated to go online in late 2026 and will be capable of generating 100 megawatts of electricity. A second phase will add another 400 megawatts of capacity in 2028.

Fervo says that it has already secured enough land in Utah to support up to 10 gigawatts of geothermal development.","https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fervo-Energy_Cape-Station_3.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2025-10-06 08:00:36.197056

The country’s clear and coherent approach, exemplified by the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, outlines a long-term commitment to significantly increasing the share of renewable and clean energy in its power mix to not only meet growing domestic demand but also to lead international climate action efforts.

The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 aims to triple the contribution of renewable energy and invest between AED150 to AED200 billion by 2030. This initiative targets increasing the installed clean energy capacity from 14.2 GW to nearly 19.8 GW by 2030, while also rising the clean energy share in the total energy mix to 30 percent by that date. The strategy is set against a backdrop of a rapidly growing economy and rising energy demand, balanced by a clear focus on environmental responsibility and economic sustainability. Key goals include reducing emissions from water and energy sectors to achieve net zero by 2050, eliminating clean coal from the energy mix, increasing energy consumption efficiency by 42 to 45 percent compared to 2019, and creating 50,000 new green jobs by 2030. Through this, the UAE plans substantial financial savings while fostering significant investments to sustain economic growth.

Expanding capacity and reducing carbon emissions

The leadership of the UAE under the wise guidance of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, is foundational in these accomplishments. With the declaration of 2023 as the Year of Sustainability under the theme ‘Today for Tomorrow,’ the UAE has reinforced its commitment to integrating sustainability principles across all sectors.

Flagship projects demonstrate the country’s commitment to clean energy and technological advancement. The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, the world’s largest single-site solar park, is pivotal to the UAE’s renewable energy landscape. Scheduled to reach a capacity of 5,000 MW by 2030 with investments around AED50 billion, this massive solar park supplies clean energy to over half a million homes and significantly reduces carbon emissions. The park’s ongoing expansion in 2025, along with other solar projects nationwide, highlights the UAE’s relentless push to boost solar capacity by an additional 800 MW this year alone.

Addressing renewable power stabilization challenges

Furthering its advanced technology credentials, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is partnering with international firms to deploy cutting-edge energy storage solutions, including large-scale battery systems. These measures address the key challenge of stabilizing renewable power supply and underpin the UAE’s efforts toward secure, reliable clean energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, green hydrogen pilot projects show Dubai’s ambition to diversify its renewable energy portfolio beyond solar and wind, targeting decarbonization across sectors like transportation and manufacturing.

Another cornerstone of the UAE’s clean energy leadership is the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant, the first nuclear power station in the Arab world, which exemplifies the country’s diversified approach to clean and sustainable energy. Alongside nuclear and solar, the UAE is advancing technologies in energy efficiency, carbon capture, and sustainable urban development, including the globally recognized Masdar City—a smart city built around principles of sustainability and environmental stewardship.

Integrated blueprint for sustainable growth

The UAE’s strategic clean energy efforts are recognized internationally. Industry leaders such as Helmut von Struve, CEO of Siemens UAE and the Middle East, emphasize the critical role of data-driven technology in managing the renewable energy transition efficiently. Frédéric Godemel, Executive Vice President at Schneider Electric, lauds the UAE’s integrated blueprint that combines smart technology and sustainable growth, while Arshad Mansoor, CEO of the Electric Power Research Institute, points to landmark projects as evidence of the UAE’s potential as a global energy leader.

Investment in clean and renewable energy is a significant pillar of the UAE’s economic diversification. The UAE government aims to mobilize between AED150 billion and AED200 billion in investments by 2030, creating 50,000 green jobs which contribute to the country’s transition to a knowledge-based, sustainable economy. This economic shift also generates considerable financial savings, expected to reach AED100 billion by 2030, underscoring the cost-effectiveness of clean energy adoption alongside environmental benefits.

Comprehensive energy mix strategy

A look at the broader UAE national clean energy framework shows the country’s commitment to ambitious targets, including achieving a 50 percent clean energy contribution to the overall energy mix by 2050, as outlined in the national energy policy updates. This includes a combination of renewable, nuclear, and clean energy sources, reducing the carbon footprint of power generation by 70 percent, and increasing energy consumption efficiency by 40 percent. The UAE’s energy grid emission factor target stands at an impressively low 0.27 kg CO2 per kWh by 2030, highlighting the country’s advanced environmental standards and achievements.

UAE’s leadership extends beyond national borders, investing heavily in international renewable energy projects, particularly in Africa, reinforcing its role in the global clean energy landscape. These outward investments showcase the UAE’s ambition to scale knowledge, technology, and finance in renewable energy globally, further cementing its reputation as a pioneer in climate action.

The World Green Economy Summit 2025, held recently in the UAE, underscored the country’s role as a central platform for dialogue and partnership on clean energy investment and emissions reduction. This summit brought to the fore discussions on innovative solutions and sustainable energy pathways, reinforcing the UAE’s vision to be a global nexus for green economy development.",https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/uae-clean-energy-1-1-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-06 08:00:25.653969

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development.
The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.
“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers.","LUBBOCK — Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company co-founded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers”

Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water”

Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill, along with a series of executive actions targeting climate and clean energy programs, are disrupting clean energy manufacturing, supply chains and deployment that had been surging this decade.

Notably, these actions include curtailing tax credits that had driven hundreds of billions of private dollars into clean technologies, making it more difficult to build new energy projects and stopping nearly completed projects in their tracks. These steps actually run directly counter to many of the Trump administration’s own economic and energy goals.

Instead of reducing electricity prices, the bill is projected to increase them by making the quickest-to-build and most affordable new power sources more expensive at a time of rising electricity demand. Instead of restoring America’s manufacturing base and supply chains, the slow deployment will undermine private investment into new clean tech factories planned across the country and their supply chains. And instead of positioning the U.S. to better compete in global industries, the bill effectively cedes key 21st century technologies such as batteries, electric vehicles and energy infrastructure to China.

While these issues have become unfortunate fodder in the culture wars, they were always economic. You can see that in the effort major businesses from across the U.S. economy made throughout 2025, as they pressed Congress to maintain clean energy incentives. And it’s why, amid rising energy prices and economic change, businesses should continue to advocate for clean energy policy that helps to meet energy demand and sustainably grow the economy. In this difficult political environment, climate and clean energy policy must focus on building up U.S. industry and innovation by advancing affordable, reliable, homegrown clean power.

For sustainability professionals, this is an opportunity to better align key corporate functions with policy priorities and help guide your company’s support through the rest of this Congress. Here are some key policy areas where companies should advocate.

Extend and simplify tax credits

Trump’s big bill takes sharp aim at wind and solar power, rapidly phasing out tax credits for these energy sources if they don’t start construction by next summer or aren’t up and running by the end of 2027. At the same time, the administration has imposed unreasonable restrictions on many wind and solar projects and changed qualification rules, making it harder for projects to get started in time to claim what remains of the tax credits.

These actions threaten to dramatically slow down deployment of wind and solar power — the most affordable and quickest-to-build energy sources — at a time when the nation needs all the energy it can get as quickly as possible to affordably meet surging demand.

Businesses should call on Congress to provide greater stability and a longer runway for wind and solar power. We need that affordable power to meet the increasing energy demand for data centers, artificial intelligence and new manufacturing facilities. Restoring the incentives will also support new manufacturing jobs as companies work to reshore supply chains to make these technologies in the U.S.

As the general public and lawmakers from both parties recognize the need for new power sources to prevent skyrocketing utility bills and investments shifting abroad, businesses can play a powerful role in advocating for extended incentives and cutting bureaucratic red tape to accelerate the build-out of solar and wind power.

Make American transportation cutting edge

Congress is due to renew its every-five-year transportation infrastructure funding in 2026 to strengthen the nation’s roads, bridges, railways and more. Not only is this an opportunity to fund critical projects and repairs, but it also presents an opportunity to fully modernize U.S. infrastructure and the transportation systems that companies across the economy depend upon.

Businesses should call for this legislation to support jobs and innovation in industrial materials that are central to our infrastructure such as asphalt, concrete and steel. Incentives for cleaner industrial processes will further support investment and jobs that are already taking root across the country, positioning the U.S. to lead the world in building materials that are in growing global demand.

It is also a timely opportunity for companies that want greater access to electric vehicles to advocate for policies that expand access to them, and for the U.S. auto industry to secure policies that help it compete in a changing global economy. New investment in mining, processing and refining critical minerals would shape domestic supply chains for batteries, while further deployment of charging infrastructure would support wider-spread adoption of the innovative and cost-saving vehicles they are building.

Meet the economic moment with smart permitting

Red tape holds up investment, so meeting the nation’s surging energy demand and supporting domestic manufacturing will require smart policy changes that make it faster and easier to build. Businesses especially need new transmission infrastructure to reliably deliver affordable power, and the U.S. must also find ways to responsibly source our growing need for critical minerals. In each case, it will take reforms that make it more efficient to secure permits and increase certainty for businesses and investors as they take these projects on.

Bipartisan momentum for federal permitting reform has grown in recent years. While negotiations fell short in the last Congress, the need has only increased. Republicans and Democrats have a real opportunity to negotiate responsible reforms that support homegrown clean power and advanced manufacturing to meet the nation’s energy, economic, and national security needs. Businesses are well-suited and well-positioned to help bridge the political divide and make the economic case for action.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/trellis_editorial_clean_energy_1470x894.png,N,,2025-10-06 06:59:38.628712

A new report by Penn State researchers offers a brilliant, equitable solution: turning streetlights into charging stations. The idea has the potential to change the way cities extend electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure—faster, cheaper, and more equitably.

Power Where It’s Needed Most

For most people, public charging will be the sole true public choice. For apartment dwellers and condo residents, home charging is not an option. Without a garage or driveway space, overnight charging is nearly a luxury. That’s a tremendous barrier to EV adoption, even as sales continue to grow. By 2040, electric vehicles are projected to represent 11% to 28% of all vehicles on the road. But if charging is not as convenient as parking, that growth could make entire neighborhoods obsolete.

“Most apartment and multi-unit building residents, especially in urban and downtown settings, do not have access to special home EV chargers,” said Xianbiao “XB” Hu, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Penn State. “Luckily, the streetlight pole is already energized and usually municipally owned, so working with them is pretty straightforward.”

Streetlights already line streets where cars park. They’re connected to the electrical grid and publicly owned, meaning that cities can upgrade them without expensive trenching or construction. By placing charging equipment on existing poles, you can construct curbside charging that’s both practical and fair—providing clean transportation to those who’ve been left behind in the EV revolution.

Building a Real-World Test

To make the shift from theory to practice, Penn State partnered with Recharge Kansas City, an alliance of the City of Kansas City, the Metropolitan Energy Center, a nonprofit institution, local utility Evergy, and the U.S. Department of Energy. They built and pilot-tested 23 street lighting charging stations along Kansas City, Missouri. They selected each site using a three-part framework that emphasized demand, technical feasibility, and social equity.

The research, which appeared in the Journal of Urban Planning and Development under the American Society of Civil Engineers, monitored performance for a year, between January and December 2023. Scientists were curious to know how the streetlight chargers compared with the old ones in terms of speed, expense, and environmental advantage.

According to the findings, the new plan bettered expectations even more. The updated streetlights charged faster, cost less to install, and helped lower emissions by minimizing gasoline usage. Because they drew power directly from city power lines, these chargers also saw less competition from multiple users, compared to busy commercial locations.

Smart Data Meets Street Smarts

To find where chargers should be sited, the research team developed a two-tiered siting model that combined artificial intelligence and local knowledge. They first worked with six years of data from 455 installed charging points in Kansas City to train a predictive model that forecasted weekly charging demand. The model considered factors like traffic flow, land use, trip generation, and the number of nearby points of interest—everything from grocery stores to apartment complexes.

Next was the equity layer. The community sought to see chargers not just go where they’d be busiest, but also where they’d be most needed. “We thought about equity, in this case, as proactive engagement with the community to offer just and equitable access to the streetlight charging advantages,” said co-author Yang “Chris” Song, a former Penn State doctoral student who now works as a data scientist for ElectroTempo.

After merging the data with on-the-ground surveys, they chose the 23 most optimal sites—those that were in balance between expected demand and access to underserved neighborhoods. The installations that arrived at the final stage underwent safety inspections, engineering approvals, and regulatory testing to guarantee dependable operation.

Why Streetlights Make Sense

Retrofitting streetlights is very cost-effective. Because the poles are already installed and energized, installation is inexpensive relative to building new stand-alone stations. Municipalities also save time and public money from digging sidewalks or adding new electrical conduits.

Local control is also a plus. Cities can map charger networks based on public goals—lowering emissions, supporting local business, or increasing neighborhood convenience—without lengthy negotiations with individual property owners. That control simplifies scaling and makes it easier to balance equity with efficiency.

And since streetlights are near daily destinations, charging can easily be integrated into the daily routine. As your car charges, you can stop to shop, dine, or catch up with friends nearby. The effect is a system that doesn’t feel like “refueling” at all, but rather like an ordinary aspect of city life.

Proving It Works

Once chargers were in place, the research team measured performance against that of normal charging stations. The researchers used a statistical test called the Mann–Whitney U test to confirm whether any differences in reliability and speed were real. The analysis found no significant performance differences—proving streetlight chargers can match standard stations for efficiency while being less expensive and available to more people.

The pilot, lasting one year, also revealed valuable insights on user behavior. Because the chargers were accessible and visible, on the curb and handily within reach, drivers made consistent and frequent use of them.

The researchers tied that convenience to measurable gasoline savings and lowered greenhouse gas emissions. With the passage of time, those benefits could be an important factor in helping cities achieve climate goals.

A New Model for Urban EV Access

Most prior research on charger placement attempted to maximize utilization or minimize travel distances—good goals, but ones that tend not to prioritize social equity. The Kansas City pilot broke new ground by marrying advanced data modeling with a strong focus on equity.

“We wanted a model that cities could quickly adopt,” Song said. “Scalability was the largest factor in why this matters. It’s not only for Kansas City—it’s for cities in general.”

Other researchers participating in the project included postdoctoral fellows Yuyan “Annie” Pan and Tianjia Yang, and doctoral student Yuxin Ding. Through their collaboration, they created a scalable, reproducible model for cities to expand EV availability without burdensome infrastructure costs.

The success of the initiative proves that cities do not need to start from square one to build a fair and effective EV network. They merely need to look up—to the streetlights that already illuminate the streets.

Practical Implications of the Research

Converting streetlights to electric vehicle charging stations can rewire the approach to public infrastructure in cities. Recycling infrastructure is cost-effective, speeds up deployment, and brings charging to everyone — renters to multifamily dwellers.

This approach also encourages cleaner air and lower emissions, particularly for city communities most affected by car pollution.

Implemented broadly, streetlight charging can make going electric more just and sustainable, turning a humble utility into a climate action and economic justice force.

So far, it’s not working out that way.

Nationwide, that push by Silicon Valley is gobbling up energy, increasing average customers’ electricity bills and threatening progress on decarbonization. In Virginia, data-center developers warned the utility Dominion Energy at the end of last year that their upcoming projects would need 40 gigawatts of electricity—the energy equivalent of increasing Virginia’s households nearly fourfold.

Dominion plans to respond by building more natural gas power plants, which could raise utility bills for households and businesses both here and beyond the Mid-Atlantic state.

Virginia’s legislators certainly took notice. At least 33 unique bills were introduced in the last session to address various data-center dilemmas, an Inside Climate News analysis found.

“We are practically providing data centers for the entire world and I don’t want that cost to be borne by ratepayers in my district,” said state Del. Shelly Simonds, a Democrat representing the port city of Newport News.

But almost all of the bills ran aground, meeting cumulative resistance from tech businesses, local governments, labor unions and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Of the four that made it into law, only two were more than a symbolic measure.

The data-center growth spurt was already putting pressure on the state’s power supplies before this year. Virginia overtook California, the most populous state, in 2023 to emerge as the top importer of electricity, driven by rapid growth in commercial power consumption.

That means the impact of Virginia’s data-center decisions extends to the wider region. It shares an interconnected grid with much of the Mid-Atlantic, and that grid’s operator is increasingly under pressure from state governors as costs spike.

“Virginia cannot produce the amount of power needed for the data centers, so we’re going to have to pipe in power from neighboring states. And if Maryland is enhancing its grid and building infrastructure, then odds are Marylanders are going to be paying for that when the power is coming here,” said Del. Ian Lovejoy, who sponsored four data-center bills last session, none of which passed.

The skyrocketing power demand is also creating hurdles for the state’s ambitions to completely wean its two largest electric utilities off planet-warming fossil fuels in the next few decades. Many data centers also have on-site diesel generators that are meant for backup power but are being run more frequently, worsening air quality and prompting noise complaints from residents.

As a result, “the rapid growth of data centers [has] surpassed all environmental issues in Virginia practically, so it’s something that demands our attention,” Simonds said.

But the failure last session of nearly all 33 bills on the subject, most without even getting a hearing, underscores the challenge of legislating on data centers in a state home to the greatest number of them.

Legislative roadblocks

The most ambitious of the five data-center bills that the Virginia General Assembly passed was vetoed by Youngkin.

That bill would have required jurisdictions considering a data-center proposal to mandate a noise study if the site is close to homes and schools, and to review with the local utility any electric substation upgrades that would be needed.

The majority of bills, 22, never even made it out of committee. That’s the stage where a bill must get approval from a smaller group of legislators before it advances to the full chamber.

Some of the bills had bipartisan backing. But interviews with a dozen state lawmakers pointed to a range of hurdles—chief among them a muscular lobbying effort by tech companies as well as the fraught politics of treading on the decision-making domain of local officials.

Nineteen of the 33 bills were primarily sponsored by Democrats, while Republicans were the primary sponsors of the other 14. Geography, rather than politics, helps explain who pushed for change.

“In areas that are affected most egregiously by overdevelopment of data centers, you have bipartisan support for regulation,” said Lovejoy. The Republican’s district covers part of Prince William County where a local rezoning fight is unfolding over an upcoming 1,700-acre data center corridor.

“It’s when you move away from the blast zone of the impact of the data centers, people become less concerned,” Lovejoy said.

The legislative proposals covered a variety of issues: improving transparency, reforming tax incentives, protecting ratepayers, increasing state oversight and overhauling data-center siting and zoning.

Two bills that would have required data centers to disclose their often-massive water and power usage died in committee. Another seven bills that sought to change the tax incentives for data centers—some by requiring clean energy use, higher energy-efficiency or wage minimums—also all died in committee.

A handful of bills sought to explicitly protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of infrastructure that will be built to accommodate data-center growth. Under the current system, everyone pays. Two of those measures got merged, and variants passed in the House and the Senate. But the chambers could not resolve the differences.

One ratepayer-protection measure did make it into law, and it’s a meaningful change—but only for the roughly 700,000 customers served by the state’s nonprofit electric co-operatives, a fraction of the total customer base in Virginia. The new law creates a path for the co-ops to create an affiliate to serve large electricity users in order to reduce their impact on average ratepayers.

Of three bills attempting to increase state oversight, one became law—after an amendment wiped out nearly all the extra oversight it would have brought.

The original version would have required electric utilities to create a separate classification for data-center customers. The enacted version requires the state utility regulator to exercise authority it already has: to determine whether existing customer classifications are reasonable when considering rate increase requests from Dominion or Appalachian Power Co., the state’s biggest electric utilities.

Dominion now has a rate case before that regulator, the State Corporation Commission, with the powerful utility and big tech companies squabbling over what fair rates for data centers should be.

“The issue is none of this stuff has enough teeth,” said Del. Michelle Maldonado, a Prince William County Democrat who voted for the weakened bill and had sponsored one of her own that stalled. “What ultimately got passed was a significantly watered-down version.”

Del. Irene Shin, a Fairfax County Democrat, proposed the bill about the State Corporation Commission. She thinks the law it became sends “a clear signal to the SCC with what the General Assembly wants them to do.”

Those wants include “safeguards that protect ratepayers like your normal, average Virginia family, and prioritize their protections over what the big corporations need,” Shin said, “because we’re talking about billion-dollar corporations, multi-billion-dollar corporations that can absolutely afford to pay the cost of getting the energy that they need.”

Her region is taking a hit from the Trump administration’s big cutbacks to federal employment, and she’s worried about further economic consequences to residents from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Adding the proposed increase to Dominion customers of about $20 every month for typical households starting next year, she said, is “insane.”

Del. David Reid, a Democrat who represents part of Loudoun County, sponsored two of the four data-center bills that made it to the finish line.

The first offers an incentive for large electricity users to install battery storage.

He also sponsored legislation to build transmission lines with advanced conductor technology to deliver power more efficiently. What ultimately made it into law was diluted from a requirement to a suggestion: to “consider the prudency of using advanced conductors.”

“I was probably trying to accomplish much more in the earlier version, and then you get to the point where it’s like, OK, we can all agree to this this year,” Reid said, pointing to varying perspectives that crop up during the session. “The process works. It’s just that sometimes, in Virginia, it doesn’t work very fast.”

Over a dozen bills, more than for any other data-center issue, would have changed how localities handle siting and zoning for the facilities. None of them made it through.

One was vetoed. Another was voted down by the Senate. Two were turned down in committee, and the rest languished and expired without making it even that far.

The bill vetoed by Youngkin, which would have required a noise study and information about substation needs from data centers, had been more ambitious in an earlier iteration. Initially, the measure would have required details on the electricity generation within a locality that would serve any proposed data centers.

“The bill that we started with, that I wanted, does not look very much like the one that passed,” said Del. Josh Thomas, a Democrat representing parts of Prince William County, who sponsored the measure in the House.

In his explanation for vetoing it, Youngkin said the bill “limits local discretion and creates unnecessary red tape” and warned it “could chill investment and hinder economic development.”

“Do we need to make sure that citizen voices are heard? Yes,” the governor said afterward at an event announcing a $9 billion investment from Google. “Do we need to make sure that local leaders are empowered to make decisions about where they go? Yes. Should that be decided in Richmond? Absolutely not.”

Thomas said his constituents are frustrated about seemingly inexplicable siting decisions being made locally, and they wanted state intervention.

“The current Republican administration in Virginia has made it very clear that they are unabashedly and, at times, irrationally pro-data center,” Thomas said. “Why we would continuously build industrial sites that have diesel generators on top by schools is beyond me but yet the industry keeps pushing to have that happen.”

Following the money

The downfall of data-center legislation in Virginia speaks, in more ways than one, to the role of money in politics, advocates and state lawmakers told Inside Climate News. The state is among the minority of states that set no contribution limits on campaign finance.

“Nobody’s immune to taking a lot of money,” said Ashish Kapoor, senior energy and climate advisor with the Piedmont Environmental Council, an advocacy group.

Dominion, which opposed two of the data-center bills, is the top political donor in the state. The company contributed more than $13 million to both parties from 2024 through Aug. 31, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project. Powerful Silicon Valley giants have also poured money into the state in recent years, through the Data Center Coalition—which testified against many of the 33 bills—and associated political action committees.

The Data Center Coalition and Dominion Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

“Anything that makes it more difficult to lubricate the wheels of commerce from data-center development that people are making a lot of money off of is going to be met with the typical sorts of issues in subcommittees where some of these bills go to die,” Kapoor said.

Another source of pressure: localities that reap the financial benefits of this data-center growth.

“We essentially have inadvertently created a monstrous money-making machine for local governments,” said Simonds, the Newport News delegate. “A huge number of cities and localities across Virginia are lining up to have a data center because of the tax revenue.”

Loudoun County, for instance, collected $733 million, almost a third of its total tax revenue, from data centers in the 2023 fiscal year. That kind of revenue allows local governments to avoid taking the unpopular step of raising real estate taxes.

“There’s a lot of folks in rural parts of the state, we’re all for data centers,” said Del. Terry Kilgore, the Republican House minority leader representing parts of several counties in Southwest Virginia, an area that has struggled to recover from the downturn of coal.

The political cost for state lawmakers to be seen as stepping on the authority of localities is especially high during a big election year. Virginia, with a Democratically controlled Senate not up for election until 2027, will vote on a new governor and all 100 House of Delegate members in November.

“The General Assembly doesn’t like to get involved in local siting issues because they don’t want to open that can of worms, so to speak,” said Lovejoy, the Prince William County delegate.

The result is an uncoordinated system in which local decisions about data centers create fallout for the power grid that will affect everyone’s pocketbook if the state doesn’t intervene.

“It’s like an orchestra where you’ve got certain instruments playing loud and unwieldy and then you’ve got other areas where they’re not playing at all,” Simonds said. “We need somebody to be the conductor of this orchestra.”

There’s also an unlikely political alliance at play.

“You have businesses and unions agreeing on something. And that doesn’t happen that often. But it’s happening over data centers,” Lovejoy said.

The support of organized labor is largely coming from the construction trades and electrical workers’ unions. In Virginia, data centers support an estimated 74,000 jobs and generate $5.5 billion in labor income, according to a study by the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

Most of these jobs, however, don’t last beyond the construction stage. And “there are other unions that might be really concerned with what’s going on,” said Kasia Tarczynska, senior research analyst at Good Jobs First, a policy group that seeks to hold companies and governments accountable on economic growth.

“For example, public sector unions might be concerned that the states are losing revenue and there’s less money” to hire teachers and firefighters, she said. Virginia forgoes close to $1 billion in yearly revenue over its tax exemptions to attract data centers.

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership contended there’s a 14 percent average annual local and state tax return on the exemption incentive for the years 2022 through 2027. But there’s spirited debate across the country about whether states dangling incentives would get this development either way. And that return on investment figure doesn’t account for the extra power costs.

Economic overdependence on data centers might also prompt companies with job-intensive investments to look elsewhere with more available power supplies, Tarczynska added.

Climate and costs

The huge increase in expected demand for power is throwing a wrench in the state’s progress toward fulfilling its legal mandate of using 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2050. The General Assembly set that target in the Virginia Clean Economy Act of 2020.

“You can’t have your cake and eat it too,” said Sen. Russet Perry, a Democrat whose district encompasses parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties. “You can’t continue to not regulate and to sign off on these massive data centers, each one of which often requires more power than your average city, and simultaneously say, ‘OK, we’re going to get to 100 percent clean energy on this deadline.’”

Del. Rip Sullivan, a Fairfax County Democrat, was the primary sponsor of that clean-energy law in the House. He thinks all is not lost.

“I’m not blind to the fact that it makes the road steeper, makes the challenge harder,” he said. But “if we were to put as much energy—pardon the pun—political energy into accelerating the Clean Economy Act as some opponents that you see are putting into trying to kill it, if we put all that energy into trying to improve it and meet those goals, I have every confidence we could meet them.”

One of his bills this year, which made it through the legislature but was vetoed by the governor, would have set targets for how much energy storage capacity utilities must build or buy in the next couple of decades. If enacted, it would have been a market signal for energy storage companies to come to Virginia, he said.

Ratings from the regional grid operator show solar’s effective load carrying capacity, its ability to produce energy when it’s most needed, is as low as 33 percent without storage but as high as 75 percent when paired with it.

Asked for his views on battery storage, Youngkin cited the costs of the technology, supply chains dominated by China and “great alternatives” that are available.

“If people want to invest in battery storage, God bless them. All of the above—we need everything. But to mandate what the answer is based on misinformed facts, I firmly believe is a mistake,” Youngkin said.

Meanwhile, the way that electricity rates are set by utilities and approved by state regulators is putting a disproportionate burden on households and businesses.

“We are effectively seeing customers across the Mid-Atlantic subsidizing the electrical infrastructure that’s needed for Northern Virginia’s data centers,” said Cathy Kunkel, a North America energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a global think tank with a mission to accelerate the energy transition.

Multiple state lawmakers spoke of their constituents’ electric bills while explaining their motivations for sponsoring data-center legislation.

“You have certain counties getting rich and then in other places, like my city of Newport News, I have constituents hopping mad about their energy bills going up,” Simonds said.

Thomas, the Prince William County delegate, was also concerned about declining property values. “Residents who were living in an area first, and then a data center was built later, had pretty much lost their largest wealth-building tool, which is their home value that’s plummeted because now there’s an industrial building a hundred feet from their back deck,” he said.

Legislators hoping to raise oversight to shield their constituents aren’t giving up. Sen. Danica Roem, a Prince William County Democrat, said her work for the next session can begin with the 13 Senate members who voted for a water-protection bill introduced by Sen. Richard Stuart, a Republican who represents parts of the Middle Peninsula northeast of Richmond. They just need eight more votes to get the bill out of the Senate.

“I need to bring in four more Democrats. Richard needs to bring four more Republicans,” Roem said.

House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) and Senate Democrat majority leadership did not respond to requests for comment.

Ultimately, voters can influence what happens next.

“The pushback has to come from the ground and it has to come from the people,” Piedmont Environmental Council’s Kapoor said. “The more these legislators, whether they’re rural or urban, feel the pushback from their constituents, those [proposed bills] will have increasing resonance.”

From Sullivan’s perspective, it’s not too late for Virginia to chart a nation-leading course that avoids sticking residents with the tab for data centers, from their electric bills to the climate consequences.

“This is an immense challenge, and it is going to take a concerted effort to meet that challenge,” he said, “but the difficulty of the challenge should only embolden us rather than cause us to give up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_6367-1024x6831759742649.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=FfJat6wE,N,,2025-10-06 08:01:38.981613
