Climate resilience requires more than levees and carbon markets.

Without a new legal and policy framework that connects digital equity to climate resilience, America’s most vulnerable communities will remain dangerously exposed—and unheard.","Equal access to technology is a necessary but overlooked part of responsible environmental regulation.

As the United States braces for what is likely to be another record-setting hurricane and wildfire season, one critical issue remains largely overlooked in emergency planning: the digital divide. In many of the country’s most climate-vulnerable areas, particularly across the American South, limited internet access is silently undermining disaster resilience and deepening environmental injustice.

Although climate policy discussions frequently highlight emissions reduction and energy transition, policymakers often overlook a foundational requirement for adaptation: access to information. In communities without broadband or digital literacy, missing a weather alert, failing to register for evacuation, or not knowing how to apply for disaster aid can be a matter of life or death. This disparity is not simply about convenience—it is about rights and survival.

The Undivide Project, which I direct, launched the Ten States Project to study the digital disparity. Our team conducted interviews with emergency managers, surveyed national and regional stakeholders, and reviewed over 190 laws and policies related to disaster response, digital infrastructure, and environmental justice. From this study of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, and five other states, we found that digital exclusion is not adequately recognized in disaster law and communities without digital access are being structurally excluded from resilience planning.

These communities—many of which are predominantly Black and low-income—are not just underserved; they are systematically excluded from the tools, information, and legal protections necessary to survive a climate emergency. The failure to treat broadband access as an essential utility and emergency service is worsening the climate resilience gap in America.

Our legal review revealed that most state emergency statutes focus almost exclusively on reactive measures, such as declaring a state of emergency, activating the National Guard, or suspending regulations. Fewer than 10 percent of the legal instruments we analyzed mentioned environmental justice. None explicitly addressed digital access.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) does not currently fund broadband infrastructure as a disaster resilience strategy, despite increasing reliance on digital registration, alerts, and reporting. Without policy change, communities already marginalized by race, income, and geography will remain last in line for assistance—and first in line for disaster impacts.

Consider Alabama’s Black Belt region, where more than 30,000 homes have failing septic systems that are worsening due to increased rainfall. A now-terminated U.S. Department of Justice investigation found that the state’s failure to address wastewater infrastructure in Lowndes County constituted a civil rights violation. Residents in this region are also among the least digitally connected in the nation—many do not have reliable access to email or internet-enabled devices. When disaster strikes, they are cut off twice––first by infrastructure, and then again by information.

In Louisiana, redistricting disputes have diluted the voting power of Black communities along the Gulf Coast, while toxic industries continue to expand in “cancer alley.” In Texas, communities of color disproportionately suffered during the Great Freeze of 2021, and many were left without digital access to information about warming centers, emergency benefits, or infrastructure outages. These cases are not outliers—they are the product of a systemic failure to integrate digital equity into environmental and disaster law.

Climate resilience requires more than levees and carbon markets. It demands governance models that recognize digital infrastructure as essential to disaster response, community agency, and adaptive capacity. Legal scholars and regulators must begin treating broadband like electricity or water—a necessary condition for public safety and access to emergency services.

We propose a new framework: digital equity as a climate adaptation imperative. This means incorporating digital inclusion into the legal definitions of “resilience” and “mitigation” in state and federal codes. It means requiring environmental justice assessments to include digital exclusion. It means directing resilience funding to places where climate and digital vulnerability overlap.

Some states are taking steps in this direction. Virginia passed the Environmental Justice Act in 2020, which defines “fenceline” vulnerable communities and created an Office of Environmental Justice within its emergency management agency. North Carolina incorporated digital infrastructure planning into its resilience funding strategy. But without federal agency action and statutory mandates, these state efforts remain fragmented and insufficient.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and FEMA should recognize digital infrastructure as eligible under mitigation grant programs. This includes broadband deployment, hot spot expansion, and digital literacy training for disaster preparedness.

Environmental regulators across federal agencies should treat digital access as a factor in environmental justice reviews. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could update its—recently removed—equity screening tools to include digital exclusion as a risk multiplier.

To supplement agency efforts, the U.S. Congress should modernize disaster law to reflect digital dependence. Updating the Stafford Act for example, to include digital equity and removing administrative barriers to broadband resilience projects would expand legal protections to communities that are currently excluded.

Voting rights protections enacted by Congress should also include digital participation safeguards. Communities must be able to engage in climate-related policy debates and disaster planning. Digital disenfranchisement undermines civic engagement and climate governance.

Ultimately, the digital divide is not just a technology issue—it is a governance issue. It reflects who has access to safety, who is heard in times of crisis, and who is left behind. As we prepare for a future of escalating climate extremes, we must ensure that digital equity is part of every emergency plan, every resilience policy, and every legal reform.

Environmental and disaster regulators have a responsibility to act. Without a new legal and policy framework that connects digital equity to climate resilience, America’s most vulnerable communities will remain dangerously exposed—and unheard.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Sanders5.19.25-2177991924.jpg,N,,2025-05-19 04:08:42.671668

Donald Trump has instructed federal agencies to stop enforcing certain regulations. This move impacts areas like energy efficiency and environmental protection. The Department of Energy plans to eliminate some appliance standards. The EPA has reduced enforcement actions against the fossil fuel industry. Critics question the legality of these actions. Some legal experts believe this approach is unprecedented.

President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to halt the enforcement of numerous regulations, effectively sidelining laws he deems unfavorable, raising significant concerns among legal experts, environmental advocates, and civil servants.

Over 40 regulatory changes have been proposed at the Department of Energy, aiming to eliminate water and energy efficiency standards for household appliances such as faucets, clothes washers, and microwave ovens.

The administration estimates these changes will save taxpayers $11 billion, positioning it as the largest deregulatory effort in the department's history.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has also seen a significant reduction in enforcement actions, particularly those impacting the fossil fuel industry.

Live Events

The agency has initiated 19 fewer cases per month on average compared to the Biden administration's last year in office.

Critics argue that these moves bypass lawful rulemaking processes, potentially violating laws such as the Administrative Procedure Act.

Richard Revesz, former head of the White House regulatory affairs office under President Joe Biden, stated, ""They're making across-the-board decisions not to enforce whole categories of standards, and it is of very dubious legality.""

The administration's actions have also impacted the Labor Department, where enforcement of equal employment opportunity laws has sputtered. Employees report that work at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs has ground to a halt, even though much of it is still mandated by laws from the 1970s that have not been overturned.

These enforcement slowdowns have led to reduced hiring in legal sectors that defend companies against regulatory actions.

Stephen Springer, a managing partner at a legal recruiting firm, noted, ""CFPB enforcement work is dormant completely. I don't think anybody expects those enforcement areas to be particularly busy for the next three years.""

Legal experts warn that the administration's approach, choosing not to enforce laws the president dislikes, is unprecedented and legally dubious. Peter Shane, an emeritus law professor at Ohio State University, remarked, ""To my knowledge, no other president has taken that kind of stance.""

“The EPA’s Brownfields Program has the power to transform and revitalize communities, including those in Southwest Virginia.

“This EPA Brownfield Assessment grant for $500,000 helps the Town of Pulaski conduct an assessment of hazardous or polluted sites that can be potentially redeveloped for economic and social gain in Southwest Virginia.”

BACKGROUND

Congressman Griffith is chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment.

In March of 2025, Congressman Griffith chaired a hearing on the EPA’s Brownfields Program. Scott County Native and LENOWISCO Executive Director Duane Miller testified to the panel and discussed the Program’s importance to Southwest Virginia communities.

The Brownfields Program empowers states, communities and other stakeholders to work together to prevent, assess, safely clean up and sustainably reuse brownfields.

A brownfield site is real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant.

Brownfield Assessment grants provide funding for brownfield inventories, planning, environmental assessments and community outreach.

Congressman Griffith’s e-newsletter on the Program can be found here.

The automaker revealed this week it was “re-evaluating” its electrification strategy amid a turbulent and uncertain time for the auto industry.

Also: Subaru Trailseeker Is Faster Than A WRX But No One Knows If It’s A Wagon Or SUV

Look at Subaru’s US website and you’ll find just one EV: the recently facelifted Solterra. A second, the Outback-sized Trailseeker that made its debut at last month’s New York Auto Show, is scheduled to be added to the range for 2026. But we’re unlikely to see many more EVs join it any time soon.

Tariffs and Tax Credits: The Great Unknowns

Aside from a general concern about a slowdown in the rate of EV takeup, Subaru, like every other automaker, is hamstrung by a lack of clarity from the US regarding its long term position on both import tariffs and EV tax credits. Nobody knows what the tariff situation will look like six or 12 months from now or whether tax credits will be scrapped or not.

Subaru estimates Trump’s tariffs could cost it $2.5 billion this year because, although the company does have a plant in Indiana, it only builds around half of the 700,000+ cars the brand sells in the US each year, Auto News reports. The remainder have to be imported, an d while Subaru could theoretically push the US plant’s current 345,000-unit annual capacity to 500,000, its supplier base can’t handle more than 370,000 units without a major upgrade.

Overseas Production and Shifting Plans

That means the Trailseeker will probably have to be built overseas, Auto News suggesting production will take place north of Tokyo. Subaru also had planned to create a new EV-only plant, but is rethinking that strategy, too. It now says it might have to add combustion vehicles into the mix at the new site.

Plans to simplify EU sustainability reporting and due diligence rules lack sound economic analysis

Tabled in February, the European Commission’s omnibus proposal remains the talk of the day in sustainability policy circles. The EU executive is seeking to water down multiple laws, including the recently adopted Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

The CSDDD was only agreed on last year, and trade unions, civil society and progressive companies had considered it as a game-changer towards sustainability in global supply chains. However, the commission has started to question its own approach.

The legislation was intended to force large European and foreign companies to comply with human rights standards. The CSDDD looks likely to be significantly weakened in the name of competitiveness and economic performance, even though the commission’s unpredictable behaviour will do nothing to create trust in EU economic governance.

While many companies had already started to prepare for the newly established legislation, they now face substantial uncertainty. Indeed, the commission’s behaviour fuels fundamental uncertainty about the overall direction in the bloc in terms of sustainability policies. Will the EU remain a progressive international standard setter, or will it join a race to the bottom that it will never be able to win?

Today, in a statement co-signed by more than 80 economists from 11 EU member states, we express our concern that the commission’s proposal lacks substantial arguments and seems to be rooted in short-sighted political tactics rather than in sound economic analysis.

A value-based modern economy

Contrary to what the commission is arguing, sustainability legislation is less of a burden and more of an opportunity for European companies. In times of erratic “Trumponomics”, a clear and lasting approach to sustainability could enhance the EU’s position as a value-based modern economy that builds its wealth not on a systematic abuse of human rights abroad.

Much of the commission’s arguments used to weaken the support for the CSDDD focus on compliance costs for companies constituting an administrative burden. Most regulations come with associated costs. However, the commission’s own research has shown that compliance costs for large companies are a negligible percentage of revenues generated. The costs, however, are only one side of the equation.

The EU directive, in supporting compliance with human rights, also offers opportunities to reduce significantly the costs of economic activities that companies generate for third parties — so-called negative externalities.

The externalisation of costs harms local livelihoods and exporting economies and can also harm the economy more broadly. Human rights abuses such as poverty wages, unhealthy work conditions and the use of harmful pesticide create additional costs for society and are, unfortunately, too common in many economies of the global south. They also prevent affected countries from diversifying their economies and claiming a larger share of the value produced in global value chains.

The second political argument by the commission, that the CSDDD and the CSRD harm European competitiveness, also evaporates at closer scrutiny.

The sluggishness of the European economy can hardly be attributed to laws that have not yet been implemented or that have just entered into force. Restrictive fiscal policies and a systematic lack of investments in public goods, including infrastructure, a conflict-ridden global environment, and an export-oriented global model — now in crisis also due to US tariffs — are much more significant explanations.

Yet, these are much harder problems to solve. They require proper economic and industrial policies, rather than populist political moves pretending that cutting compliance costs will bring EU economies back to growth. On the contrary, a stable commitment to maintain a strong focus on sustainability in Europe is likely to provide a reliable context for European companies to adapt their long-term strategies and to promote sustainable growth.

In conclusion, the idea that sustainability obligations only create costs for companies is misguided. Legislators should also look at the benefits that the CSDDD will have for European economies and for the economies of its trading partners. Overall, the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs by far.

Economic choices are political choices. With the omnibus proposal, the commission is cheering short-sighted populist calls and deviating attention from the big challenges the European economy faces. By continuing to allow for external costs and human rights abuses in supply chains, the EU risks falling back on its regulatory achievements in terms of sustainability.

The European parliament and the European Council can still stop the watering down of sustainability legislation. The failure to do so will come at a cost to us all.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/6ccca3b6-3d87-4cbf-85fd-e0138b543336.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 22:00:06.914106

This development, part of an extended partnership with LG Energy Solution, aims to create a future where a Chevrolet Silverado EV could be as affordable as a V8-powered Silverado 1500.

We've heard claims like these before, and they often come with extended timelines, but GM seems to believe this breakthrough can be brought to the market very soon.

A New Shape For A New Mineral

The core of this innovation lies in a shift in battery chemistry and design. GM's new LMR prismatic cells will utilize more affordable manganese in place of pricier nickel. Cobalt, another expensive material, will also see its role diminished. According to Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of propulsion and sustainability, the ultimate goal is to achieve price parity between electric and gas vehicles.

Physically, the new LMR prismatic cells are notably larger than the pouch cells currently used in vehicles like the Silverado EV, with each new cell weighing between six and eleven pounds and resembling an old DVD player in shape. GM anticipates it could reduce the number of modules required in a large EV battery pack, from 24 to just six. Despite the focus on costs, GM also claims these LMR cells boast 33 percent higher energy density than comparable lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) prismatic cells. These can be found in vehicles like specific models of the Tesla Model 3.

Strategic Sourcing, Diverse Applications

This new LMR technology is slated to first appear in GM's electric pickups and full-size SUVs launching in 2028. It is one part of GM's broader battery strategy, which involves deploying different battery chemistries for different vehicle types. More affordable LFP cells might be used in entry-level EVs where maximum range is less critical, such as a potential next-generation Chevy Bolt. High-nickel NMCA cells would be reserved for premium vehicles where customers would demand the most range, like the big and luxurious Cadillac Escalade IQ. The LMR cells are designed to be a middle ground, offering a balance of cost and range for popular segments.

To support this development, GM is also investing in its supply chain. In 2023, the company partnered with Element 25, investing $85 million to build a facility in Louisiana that will process manganese mined in Australia. GM says that its long-term domestic battery production strategy is not in reaction to recent developments with tariffs, and dates back several years.

Validation of the new LMR cells is scheduled to occur in 2027 at GM's Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren, Michigan. The company is already fine-tuning the production processes for these cells, from mixing raw materials to creating electrodes from ultra-thin aluminum sheets. While the specific manufacturing locations for the LMR cells have not yet been announced, GM's existing Ultium Cells joint venture with LG Energy Solution has already produced over 100 million battery cells at plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

Importantly, General Motors assures that future vehicles equipped with these new LMR prismatic cells will maintain capabilities such as rapid DC fast-charging and will also be covered by the existing 100,000-mile battery warranty, ensuring that cost savings do not come at the expense of core EV necessities.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/chevrolet-silverado-ev.png,N,,2025-05-18 21:01:59.083302

This week, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 Global EV Outlook, in which it projects that the share of plug-in car sales in the U.S. will increase from 10% today to 20% in 2030. That may sound like healthy growth—until you consider what the IEA had expected before the newly elected Republican trifecta began dismantling pro-EV policies.

In last year’s report, the organization estimated that EVs and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would make up 55% of U.S. car sales by the end of the decade. Even in that rosier scenario, China would still be eating America’s lunch by a wide margin. Now, it won’t even be close.

From day one of President Donald Trump’s second term, the IEA notes, it became U.S. policy to “eliminate subsidies and other policy measures influencing markets in favour of EVs.” Here’s a quick recap of where things stand.

Congress is in the early stages of repealing the $7,500 clean-car tax credit, a key driver of EV affordability and sales. The Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency are each expected to relax tailpipe-pollution regulations that push automakers to clean up their fleets. There’s an effort underway to strip California of its ability to set an EV sales mandate, a framework that 11 other states and Washington, D.C. follow. And the federal government has effectively frozen billions of dollars in funding intended to beef up the nation’s charging infrastructure.

Meanwhile, China has already created the infrastructure and industry required for rapid EV sales growth. The IEA now projects that EVs and PHEVs will make up 80% of the country’s car sales by 2030, thanks to improvements in vehicle affordability, policies that make them cheaper to buy and government support for building out charging stations. This year, the IEA revised up its 2030 EV outlook for China by around 14 percentage points.

Europe is projected to leave America in its dust too, with an electric share of sales nearing 60%.

Other researchers who watch this space now see a similarly stunted trajectory for the U.S. EV sector, at least compared to what could have been.

In an April report, the International Council on Clean Transportation found that eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax credits for EV buyers and manufacturers would depress plug-in car sales by 1.1 million units in 2030. It also projected that an IRA repeal would cost the U.S. 130,000 jobs across the vehicle manufacturing, battery and charging industries by that year.

Having a vibrant EV industry isn’t just about selling more clean cars or cutting planet-warming emissions. America’s competitiveness is at stake too, said Peter Slowik, the ICCT’s U.S. passenger vehicles lead and a co-author of the report.

“Long term, we will get to 100% [zero-emission vehicles]. And the question is: Who will be the winners and who will be the losers?,” he told InsideEVs. “When we do get to 100%, are U.S. vehicles going to be a bunch of imports from European automakers and China automakers and automakers from elsewhere? Or will we be able to preserve or even increase our market share?”

The ICCT still expects U.S. electric car sales to grow—albeit more modestly—in a no-IRA scenario, with demand propelled mainly by declining vehicle costs and technological improvements. ""There will be no turning back, even if incentives went away,"" Slowik said.

But the rest of the world isn’t sitting still. EV sales globally are projected to skyrocket, no matter who sits in the White House or how they feel about electric cars.

This year, the IEA expects a record 20 million plug-in car sales worldwide, accounting for around 25% of overall sales. By 2030, that number should hit 40 million—28 million EVs and 12 million PHEVs—or over 40% of global sales.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P306OA/s1/ford-f-150-lightning-mustang-mach-e.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 23:03:23.130195

However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.
The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.
While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles.
""We feel good about where pricing is versus where we started the year, so we've assumed things remain constant from here,"" Jacobson said, according to Inside EVs.","Inside EVs reported that General Motors is not planning to raise prices due to the current administration's tariff policies.

""We now expect pricing to be relatively consistent for the remainder of the year."" GM CFO Paul Jacobson stated, according to the report.

This announcement is surprising. Several of GM's EVs are assembled in Mexico, so the company is bracing for a huge cost impact in the billions of dollars. However, according to the Inside EVs report, GM is currently planning to hold steady on consumer pricing through the rest of the year.

The article cites that the Equinox EV is currently the most affordable EV in the U.S. and that GM credits its Mexico build location for keeping costs so low. The low price, coupled with the vehicle's 300-plus mile range, has made Chevrolet the fastest-growing EV brand in the country.

GM said it is expecting a $4 billion to $5 billion impact based on the current tariff policy, affecting imports from Korea, Mexico, and Canada. It plans to offset some of the costs with ""self-help initiatives"" and increased U.S. production of battery components, according to the report.

Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an EV has environmental and financial benefits. EVs do not produce air pollution that contributes to the warming of the planet, so it is a more eco-friendly transportation choice. EV owners can say goodbye to rising, fluctuating gas prices, saving money over time.

Some EV skeptics cite the negative environmental effects that are a result of the pollution created during the battery manufacturing and charging process. While there is an environmental impact, the process is getting cleaner over time and has minimal negative effects in comparison to the 16.5 billion tons of fuel required for powering traditional gas vehicles. Roughly 30 million tons of minerals are dug up annually for the more affordable energy transition to EVs, and these minerals can often be reused, further reducing the environmental impact.

Jacobson is confident that GM's wide EV lineup – from the $35,000 Equinox EV to the $130,000 Cadillac Escalade IQ – will help the company maintain pricing.

IRA Labor Policy The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment.
Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.
As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created.
Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.","“It’s unfathomable to us. Unfathomable. In the history of our union hall, 134 years, we’ve never even come close to these numbers.” Trent Mauk, a training specialist at the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters (UA) in Michigan, said these words to Washington Post reporter Jeff Stein just over a year ago.

Mauk was referring to the massive growth in membership the union experienced thanks to the construction of two new electric vehicle battery plants. These plants were a direct result of the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in 2022. Before the IRA, UA members had to travel for work and experienced long bouts of unemployment. After its implementation, their apprentice program jumped from fifty trainees to almost two hundred.

With its reputation as an ambitious climate bill, it’s easy to overlook the IRA’s role in creating opportunities for unions in the clean energy sector. The building trades, often unfairly portrayed as uniformly opposed to climate action, have seen a substantial number of real jobs materialize for their members. This has translated into more general political support for clean energy development.

Key components of this legislation are now under threat as Republicans close in on their goal to extend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), a $4 trillion tax cut for the rich. Paying for this primarily through cutting social programs like Medicaid is proving politically complicated. Republicans are now setting their sights on IRA tax credits, many of which are directly responsible for creating union jobs, as an area for cuts in the budget reconciliation process.

Building trades unions have started to speak out in favor of maintaining IRA tax credits for clean energy. Salvaging as many of these unionized projects as possible will be important to lay the groundwork for progress in the future under more favorable political conditions. Beyond the bread-and-butter gains for union members, positive experiences on these jobs can garner deeper political buy-in for green jobs going forward.

With roughly 60 percent of proposed IRA projects located in Republican districts, the fight over the IRA presents an opening to build unlikely coalitions in places conventionally viewed as hostile toward progressive environmental policy.

State-level coalition work helped build momentum for the passage of the IRA in the first place, and states will continue to be important battlegrounds over the next four years. Labor unions have an opportunity to aggressively mobilize their membership to defend good jobs, and environmental activists should join them.

IRA Labor Policy

The IRA doesn’t represent the leftist dream version of a Green New Deal through direct state investment. Instead, it relies on tax credits to entice private investment in clean energy development. Relying on capital to make investments for the public good is always a shaky gambit.

Despite these limitations, some of the tax credits were cleverly designed to encourage the use of union labor. Companies receive a 30 percent tax credit if they pay their workers a prevailing wage for their region. More importantly for the building trades, companies also need to hire a designated number of union apprentices. These apprentices receive paid classroom instruction and on-the-job training.

It’s hard to deny that the legislation, whatever its limits, has been putting union members to work. Ethan Link, assistant business manager for the Southeast Laborers’ District Council, told Heatmap that it’s been like “night and day” since the passage of the IRA. Solar developers are proactively reaching out to the union about working together on projects. This has set off a virtuous cycle where, as a result, the union is investing in more solar training for apprentices.

The Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council was able to double its apprenticeship program as a result of the IRA. Kent Miller, the union president, believes that IRA incentives made Wisconsin’s four biggest utilities agree to employ union labor on all future clean energy projects.

Similar examples can be found across the country, from the growth of union offshore wind jobs off the coast of New England to a slew of wind and solar projects in Illinois.

The tax credits supported over $220 billion in manufacturing investment, and manufacturing employment increased by about 750,000 during the Biden administration. In March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that construction job openings were up by 111,000 from last year.

The GOP Attacks, Labor Speaks Out

The early drafts of GOP budget proposals reveal a party intent on derailing this progress. The House Ways and Means Committee put forward a plan to begin phasing out the clean energy tax credits in 2029 and have them completely expire in 2032. Under the current IRA law, the tax credits would expire in 2035, but only if greenhouse gas emissions went below 25 percent of 2022 levels.

More perniciously, the proposal essentially kneecaps the tax credits by changing an important provision. Currently, a project only needs to begin construction by a certain year to qualify for the tax credit. But Republican lawmakers want to require that projects be “placed in service” before 2032.

This change will hurt nuclear and geothermal energy development the most, since these projects require long-term planning, investment, and construction. If anything, this proposal will benefit short-term solar developers, the sector Republicans claim to dislike the most. The Trump administration is further destroying its own stated ambitions for nuclear energy (which is heavily unionized) via its Department of Government Efficiency–inspired assault on the Department of Energy.

Divisions over the IRA among Republicans have been brewing for a while, however. Many GOP lawmakers cannot ignore the investment and job growth the bill has already brought to their states. In August, eighteen House Republicans sent a letter to House speaker Mike Johnson imploring him to leave the tax credits in place. Then, in April, four Republican senators wrote to leadership cautioning “against the full-scale repeal” of IRA tax credits.

As the coalition against the IRA shows cracks, building trades unions have become more outspoken about the good jobs the IRA has already created. Last month, the Maine Building and Construction Trades Council hosted a press conference to highlight the growth of clean energy jobs in the state and demand that Congress hold on to the tax credits.

According to the Maine Labor Climate Council, there are 145 utility-scale projects in operation or development across the state that are eligible for the tax credits. “Mainers across the state have benefited from these important investments, from ironworkers building wind farms in Aroostook County to electricians installing battery plants in Lincoln and Gorham to the many solar fields spread across the state,” said Kilton Webb, a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 567.

James Harrison from the Utility Workers of America penned an op-ed in the Detroit News about the development of the region’s largest battery storage facility. The project shows that these jobs can maintain the standards of the fossil fuel jobs that came before them.

“The new clean energy jobs that are coming to our community need to be as good as the coal jobs were, with family-supporting wages and good benefits. I have hope that we can get there due to the historic clean energy investments that are coming through the Inflation Reduction Act,” Harrison wrote.

More union leaders are recognizing that the clean energy transition is not a pipe dream; it’s already creating jobs, and the IRA was the key. “My fellow members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 46 in Western Washington are buying their first homes or getting out of debt after a job on a new clean energy project,” wrote Nicole Grant, IBEW Local 46 political director in Washington, in the Seattle Times.

The IRA became a labor bill almost as much as a climate one. As divisions over the Republican budget continue, a window of opportunity has emerged to build a coalition of labor and environmentalists to defend union jobs. Building trades unions can use the occasion to mobilize members to pressure Republicans reliant on IRA funds for their district.

Through the tireless work of organizations like the Climate Jobs National Resource Center, powerful labor climate coalitions at the state level have formed over the last decade. Despite the unfavorable political environment nationally, states can continue to make progress toward the development of more unionized clean energy jobs. Activists can start now by working to preserve the best of the IRA.",https://images.jacobinmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/17173009/GettyImages-1244828341.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 23:03:30.597519

In his first term, President Trump raised the idea of a $1 trillion infrastructure plan — at one point raised to $2 trillion — but time after time grand announcements were followed by — nothing. “Infrastructure week” became a running joke.

However, the state of the nation’s infrastructure is no joke and there was a bipartisan desire to actually get something done after decades of neglect. Thus, in 2021, President Biden signed the $1.2 trillion bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).

Along with the Chips Act and the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, they formed the Holy Trinity of Bidenomics.

When President Trump returned to office in January he signed a pair of executive orders freezing selected grants under these programs. His “Unleashing American Energy” order was all about fossil fuels and an attempt to stop grants supporting renewable energy.

Angst and lawsuits followed. In April, federal Judge Mary McElroy ruled these grants had to be unfrozen. Executive orders can’t undo Congressional appropriations. Little by little, grants announced, but not obligated. started to move.

The backlog is substantial at more than 3,000 grants and Republicans have not missed the opportunity to criticize the Biden administration’s management.

For example, states were to receive $5 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations nationwide by 2030. As of February this year, when the Trump administration froze the program, $3.3 billion had been allocated but only $40 million had been spent and precious few chargers had been built.

Note that the president froze the electric vehicle charger program before he held a publicity event for Elon Musk’s Tesla cars on the White House lawn.

However, that program and many others are an illustration of the problems that now confront the Trump administration: Federal agencies that don’t cooperate; state governments that have varying degrees of competence and capacity; and the difficulty of working with a stew of local governments, private sector partners and local interest groups.

Rather than using the IIJA as a political cudgel to beat the already vanquished Biden administration, the Trump administration has an opportunity to demonstrate its managerial chops — though given its chaotic character no one should hold their breath.

It is also an opportunity for the president to take credit for any completed projects, which is a given.

At an “Infrastructure Week” event hosted last week by the American Society of Civil Engineers, West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelly Moore Capito, the chair of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, stressed the opportunity and challenge of implementing the IIJA.

High on her agenda is streamlining the permitting process, increasing the safety and reliability of surface transport and figuring out how to pay for a sustained effort to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure given that revenue from the federal gas tax is declining thanks to more fuel efficient cars and the increasing numbers of electric vehicles.

ASCE puts out an annual report grading the nation’s infrastructure, and in its March report there was good news and bad news. The good news is that the overall grade was the highest it has been since 1998. The bad news is that the grade is C.

Illinois has already received billions from the IIJA and should receive more. There is a good deal to do. The ASCE report notes that 41% of the roads in Illinois are rated as poor or fair condition and that its grades for roads, drinking water and transit systems are all D-.

Can we find the better bipartisan angels of our nature to get some work done?

This story was reported by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates the powerful interests stalling climate action.

As an ice storm slicked roads across eastern Michigan on February 6, representatives from four houses of worship arrived at the offices of Democratic US Sen. Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs. Powered by renewable energy, the hubs offered residents shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan—and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne executive director Steve Wasko says his organization—which provides meals, clothing, daycare, and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood—has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels, and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States—including in Detroit, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia—that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills—a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for nonpayment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15 percent of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households—roughly 23 million people—struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major US cities, including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15 percent or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14 percent of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades, despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump’s administration has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored.

The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist—and perhaps even deepen. “The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see.

Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44 percent of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage, and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45 percent of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70 percent between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45 percent—and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods.

“I think 70 percent or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit. Programs in 24 states and Washington, DC, support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one—the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa—is dedicated to low- and medium-income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50 percent of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief—only 9 percent of it is shaded, compared to 20 percent of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate-income households. “We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand. “Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Los_Angeles_redlining.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-05-18 18:04:25.256216

According to a Wall Street Journal report, GM told staff in an internal email, “We need your help!”GM warned that aggressive emissions rules could hurt business by limiting consumer choice and making vehicles less affordable. Employees were encouraged to contact senators using talking points aimed at revoking a waiver that lets California set its own stricter emissions standards.

How the Wheels Have Turned

That same California rule was once backed by GM, which had pledged to sell mostly electric vehicles by 2035. However, market conditions have shifted significantly since GM committed to that plan. EV demand has cooled considerably. Sales of electric vehicles fell 5% in April, while overall U.S. car sales jumped 10%, according to Motor Intelligence. EVs now make up just 7% of the market nationwide.

In California, the EV leader, zero-emission vehicles currently account for about 20% of new car sales, far below the 35% target the state set for 2026. Rising costs, fewer discounts, and the potential loss of federal tax credits make EVs less appealing to price-conscious buyers.

Even GM has had to dial back its ambitions. It scrapped its plan to build 400,000 EVs by mid-2024, delayed the launch of a new Buick EV, and postponed opening an electric truck factory. Ford (F), Stellantis (STLA), and Toyota (TM) have also slowed their EV rollouts.

Carmakers Rally Against ‘Unrealistic’ EV Mandates

Still, GM says it’s committed to electric vehicles and continues to invest in new models. A company spokeswoman said GM supports one consistent emissions standard nationwide that considers actual market demand. The lobbying push included workers in Michigan and other key states where lawmakers’ offices reportedly had received calls from GM employees.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major carmakers, is backing GM’s stance. It warns that California’s goals are unrealistic and could lead to job losses.

Supporters of California’s waiver say the state’s geography and environmental challenges justify stricter rules. But some Democrats, even from states with the ban, are starting to push back. They say the timeline is too ambitious and burdens consumers.

As one Long Island Toyota and Lexus dealer put it, EVs remain out of reach without subsidies. “The customers just aren’t there.”

and analysis of the writer:

As the summer travel season kicks off, thousands of Arizonans are hitting the road, many in vehicles still running on dirty fossil fuels like gas and diesel. But many of us travel cleaner, quieter, and smarter thanks to electric vehicles. I’m one of them, and I can tell you firsthand: Once you experience the benefits of driving electric, there is no turning back.

While EVs are a key way to help Arizonans save money on fuel and maintenance, the current Trump administration has missed the opportunity to make these cost-saving solutions more accessible. Fortunately, the available federal tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) make it more affordable for consumers to switch to cleaner transportation, including up to $7,500 for qualifying EV purchases. I purchased my used pollution-free electric vehicle and proudly display my Arizona “Clean Air — Blue Skies” plate. It’s more than a license tag — it’s a sign of pride.

While these tax credits have helped people make the leap, these incentives, along with federal EV infrastructure grants from the IRA and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that support building out public charging stations in Arizona, are now in limbo. The grants, which include the U.S. Department of Transportation’s National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program and Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program, are designed to make EV charging more accessible, reliable, and widespread.

Arizona was allocated $76.5M through the NEVI program, but the current administration’s funding pause is delaying key projects statewide and putting the next phase on hold. Some of the communities impacted by the delay include Payson, Show Low, Lake Havasu City, Maricopa, Overgaard, Fort McDowell, Page, Bisbee, Douglas, Sierra Vista, Superior, Wickenburg, and Bullhead City, among many others. These rural communities have long lacked EV charging stations. Located near highways and transit stops, these stations would serve historically disadvantaged areas and expand access to clean transportation. Without urgent leadership, Arizona risks losing momentum and leaving rural communities behind.

As more Americans consider switching to electric, we need confidence that a reliable charging network is growing with demand. I’ve noticed improvements in public charging recently, and networks opening up to other brands (like mine) has been a game-changer. But we’re not done yet.

In Arizona, where long commutes, rural highways, and range anxiety make EV infrastructure even more critical, these federal investments mark the difference between progress and falling behind. Ensuring consistent funding and timely rollout of charging stations is essential for building trust and making EV adoption more appealing.

Driving an EV helps me save money. In Green Valley, I power my home and charge my EV with solar panels — something the IRA also supports with a 30% IRA tax credit for installation. That means virtually no fuel costs, even as gas and electricity prices rise, especially during the hot summer. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, EV drivers can save as much as $14,500 in fuel costs over 15 years.

With smart planning tools like PlugShare and my car’s built-in navigation, I’ve taken 1,000-mile road trips with ease. The ride is smooth, the drive is quiet, and best of all, it’s affordable — plus, my wife and I feel good knowing we’re contributing to a cleaner, healthier future.

For those still hesitant about EVs, especially in rural areas, technology has made finding chargers easier than ever. However, expanding access depends on continued federal investment. With more support, charging could become second nature, no matter where you live. That’s why we need Arizona lawmakers to accelerate, not stall, funding for pollution-free vehicles and EV infrastructure.

Let’s not lose our momentum. According to the American Lung Association’s State of the Air 2025 report, 84% of Arizonans live in areas with unhealthy air — yet 62% of voters support investing in charging infrastructure and incentives to make electric vehicles more affordable.

As we celebrate National Clean Air Month, take advantage of IRA programs and tax credits that support cleaner air, healthier communities, and greater energy independence. Visit PlugInAmerica.org/arizona to learn more about pollution-free vehicles and EV tax credits.

The money is supposed to come from a $10 million grant from the EPA as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. But Apfel says those funds are now frozen.

“Unfortunately, the EPA and Lee Zeldin, they don’t want to disperse the money,” Apfel said. [They say] it doesn’t meet the current administrations polices. But we really think families can benefit from the money.”

Th GGRF was set up in 2022 as part of the inflation reduction act. It allocated $27 billion to the EPA for clean energy projects that would lower greenhouse gas emissions.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin released a video about cuts to the GGRF.

""We won't be funding left wing ideological pet projects like the past administration,” said Zelden in the video. ""Today, the Green New scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success.""

Genesee Co-Op is one of 108 credit unions across the county affected by the funding freeze. Currently, access to the money is tied up in court. An appellate court is expected to decide by late May whether EPA has the authority to terminate the awards. It’s a decision that could affect thousands.

“Higher income people have been able to afford this for a while through tax credits,” said Apfel. ""They can afford the cost of the loan but lower income people really haven’t been able to access this.”

The new fully electric version of the Escalade – a first for the iconic Cadillac nameplate – is a gilded beast, tricked out with every luxury feature you could desire. I’m not used to this much luxury in a car (but I could easily get used to it). I’m driving the Escalade IQ Luxury 2 for a week. The following is a brief first-take review.

Size: It’s a luxury yacht on wheels

As a yardstick, I’ll compare it to two other giant high-profile electric vehicles, the Cybertruck and GMC Hummer EV.

Tesla Cybertruck (AWD): ~18 feet (length) / 6,600-6,900 lbs (weight)

GMC Hummer SUV EV: ~16.4 feet / 8,500 to 9,000 pounds

2025 Cadillac Escalade IQ: ~18 feet (length) / 9,300+ lbs (weight)

Speed / torque: don’t let the size fool you

Before the IQ arrived, I had just finished a test drive of the Cadillac Optiq, a compact crossover EV at the other end of the size/weight spectrum. So, I expected a step down in speed and torque. Nope. Despite the 9,000 pound+ weight and three rows of seats, the IQ keeps up with the much smaller (5,000-pound) Optiq. That’s with the acceleration features toggled on (Velocity MAX and sport mode). That was a surprise considering its size. Cadillac says the IQ does 0-60 in under 5 seconds. I believe it now. It produces 750 hp and 785 lb.-ft. of torque with Velocity Max.

Goodbye range anxiety

The IQ is rated at 450 miles of range. I have never test driven an EV with this kind of range. It changes everything. No more ABCs (always-be-charging) – a state of mind that afflicts every EV driver. And, when you do need a charge, the charging rates are very fast based on my testing at Tesla Superchargers. GM estimates 100 miles of range in about 10 minutes at a public DC Fast Charging station. So far, I’ve been charging at between 300 and 350 miles, so I haven’t gotten the rates that GM publishes. (With EV charging, when the battery’s charge exceeds 70-80 percent, charging rates drop off.) But even when I charged from 350 to the max of 450, it was fast. As fast as the rates on a Lucid EV I drove last year.

Public Charging: Tesla Supercharger heaven

The Escalade IQ I have came with a Tesla NACS adapter. I’ve been charging exclusively at Tesla Supercharger stations. Pure plug-and-play, i.e., you plug in and it just works. As a rule, I avoid Electrify America (when I can) based on years of frustration.

Sumptuous luxury

Curved Pillar-to-Pillar LED Display: A 55-inch curved LED display makes navigating information much easier than other EVs I’ve tested.

AKG Studio Reference Audio System: The Escalade IQ offers an available 36-speaker AKG Studio Reference audio system.

Rear-Seat Entertainment: Dual 12.6-inch displays with streaming to keep rear passengers entertained.

Driving experience

Air Ride Adaptive Suspension & Magnetic Ride Control: this adjusts the vehicle’s height and damping for handling various driving conditions. And Four-Wheel Steering improves maneuverability at low speeds and stability at high speeds.

GM Super Cruise Vs Tesla Full Self Driving

I’ve tested the most recent Tesla Full Self Driving (FSD) updates 3 times in the past two months on the new Tesla Model Y “Juniper"" and once on the Cybertruck. Tesla’s FSD is amazing. It’s basically a robotaxi = the driver is the passenger. The problem is, it’s not flawless. That always makes me a little nervous – and I’ve had few mishaps with FSD in the past. I like the middle ground that GM has settled on with Super Cruise. GM leaves the local driving to you while offering true hands-free driving on the highway. Once you’re on the highway, Super Cruise will handle steering, acceleration, braking, and lane changes. In my testing of the IQ’s Super Cruise on Los Angeles highways, it does 90 percent of the driving on 118, 405, and 5.

Why is Super Cruise important?

Think of Super Cruise as a tedium reliever. Let’s say you’re taking a long trip that involves hours of yawn-inducing highway driving. That’s where Super Cruise takes over. It does the dull driving for you. I know people who have resisted any kind of driver assist until I explain to them what it’s for. Then they actually try it and are immediate converts.

China is gearing up for an electric revolution in its heavy truck sector, predicting that electric vehicles (EVs) will make up half of the market by 2028, a sharp rise from 10% in 2024.

What does this mean?

China’s push towards electric heavy trucks signals a seismic shift in its transportation and energy sectors. The announcement by CATL, a leader in battery manufacturing, underscores the growing penetration of EVs, driven by innovations like battery-swapping technologies. This transition threatens traditional fuel demand as LNG trucks also gain traction. CATL’s new facility in Shandong is pivotal, showcasing a 60 gigawatt-hour leap in energy storage and EV battery production. This plant is crucial to building Shandong’s 100 billion yuan lithium battery industry, poised to invigorate the local economy while enhancing China’s position in green technology.

Why should I care?

For markets: Recharging economic dynamics.

The shift to electric heavy trucks coupled with LNG alternatives presents mixed prospects for investors: opportunities in EV technology may invigorate markets, while oil and traditional fuel sectors could face headwinds. As Shandong becomes a battery hub, the region's economic landscape might attract new investments and potentially drive growth in related industries.

The bigger picture: Electric aspirations on a grand scale.

And that happens at every traffic light, every intersection… We are sure you have also wondered why you paid for something they sold you as a “wonder”. Well, we have good news for you: the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) wants to eliminate the federal incentives that pushed half the planet into having this annoying system that has nothing to do with protecting the environment, which is what they claimed at first.

This was announced by the EPA Administrator himself, Lee Zeldin, with a message that leaves no room for doubt: “Where your car dies at every traffic light so companies can boast about being eco-friendly… The EPA approved it, everyone hates it, so we are going to fix it”. That’s it. Here’s the full story!

What is Start-Stop and why does everyone hate it?

The invention was very simple: when the car stops, the engine turns off. As soon as you release the brake or press the accelerator, it starts again. The idea was to reduce emissions and save fuel, especially in the city. But does it really work? Most people hate it because it delays the reaction time for quick starts, the air conditioning loses power, and of course, the starter motor suffers more than it should. Not to mention that actual fuel savings are minimal.

Almost all cars come with this system enabled by default. So, if you don’t want to be “stopping and starting” at every light, you have to manually disable it every time you start the car. Annoying, right? Hence so many complaints.

Where does it come from?

This start-stop technology became popular supposedly to save fuel, and it spread across Europe and the United States during the Obama Administration. Although it was not mandatory to include it, its use became widespread because federal regulations incentivized its implementation in vehicles.

But… does it really save anything?

According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Start-Stop can reduce consumption by 7% to 26%, but beware: this depends on traffic conditions, and for the most part, it only saves fuel during city trips with frequent stops. If you drive on highways, the system is practically useless.

Why does the EPA want to eliminate it now?

This initiative from Zeldin is part of a broader review of the regulations affecting the automotive industry. Basically, they are looking to eliminate measures that, in practice, do not provide significant benefits to consumers.

On social media, the proposal has been met with applause. Most comments agree, appealing to common sense.

The beginning of the end for Start-Stop?

Hopefully. Although the system is not mandatory by law, federal incentives made almost all brands include it as standard, and it is very annoying. If the EPA removes those “bonuses,” manufacturers will likely stop installing it in large numbers.

However, Zeldin’s proposal has sparked a bigger debate: do these regulations really benefit the consumer? Isn’t it time to listen more to those who actually buy the cars?

For now, Start-Stop has its days numbered. And many drivers won’t miss it.",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/epa-stop-start-rollback-2025.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 12:10:44.236784

But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more.
“Nobody wants PFAS in their drinking water, and it’s important for everyone to voice their concern to their elected officials that rolling back drinking water protections is harmful.” Stoiber added that, while regulatory mandates may shift, it’s always good to know what is in your drinking water.
Homeowners can call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or by visiting www.epa.gov/safewater/labs for additional testing resources.","(NEXSTAR) — As President Donald Trump’s EPA prepares to roll back some of the safeguards against so-called “forever chemicals,” some Americans might be wondering what they can do to protect their drinking water.

The EPA said on Wednesday it will weaken some of the limits that were put in place under former President Joe Biden last year to minimize PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.

Limits on three types of PFAS, including what are known as GenX substances found in North Carolina, will be scrapped and reconsidered by the agency, as will a limit on a mixture of several types of PFAS.

The Biden administration’s rule also set standards for the two common types of PFAS, referred to as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. The EPA will keep those standards, but give utilities two extra years — until 2031 — to comply.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for certain, newer types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

Health advocates praised Biden’s administration for the limits. But water utilities complained, saying treatment systems are expensive and that customers will end up paying more. The utilities sued the EPA.

The EPA’s actions align with some arguments in the utilities’ lawsuit. They argued the EPA lacked authority to regulate a mixture of PFAS and said the agency didn’t properly support limits on several newer types of PFAS that the EPA now plans to rescind. They also sought the two-year extension.

Precautions experts suggest taking

“The news of weakening the PFAS regulations was truly a betrayal to all communities,” Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist with the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG), told Nexstar. “Nobody wants PFAS in their drinking water, and it’s important for everyone to voice their concern to their elected officials that rolling back drinking water protections is harmful.”

Stoiber added that, while regulatory mandates may shift, it’s always good to know what is in your drinking water. People who get their water from a private well may want to get their water tested, Stoiber said, especially if the home is near an area with PFAS contamination.

Residents who get their drinking water from a municipal supply can also have it tested, either by a county health department or a state-certified laboratory, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Homeowners can call the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at (800) 426-4791 or by visiting www.epa.gov/safewater/labs for additional testing resources.

Stoiber and others at EWG have been maintaining a ZIP code-searchable database with the environmental group’s findings from samples collected between 2021 and 2023.

“Once you know what contaminants are in your water, it will help you to select an effective water filter,” Stoiber said. “One of the easiest and most effective ways to reduce your exposure to environmental contamination is to filter your drinking water. Reverse osmosis and activated carbon filters are most effective for removing PFAS.”

Evidence of harm builds and so does the cost

Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -– among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science has advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels has become clearer.

The Biden-era EPA estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion to implement each year. Water utility associations say the costs, combined with recent mandates to replace lead pipes, will raise residents’ bills and fall hardest on small communities with few resources.

The Biden administration did work to address cost concerns. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS, and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters.

While the Clean Air Act issue is complicated, other battles may be simpler.
Beyond defending itself in the courtroom, California can also use legislation to go on the offensive, according to Creasman, of California Environmental Voters.","Less than six months into his second term as president, Donald Trump has initiated or proposed more than 150 actions that experts say are detrimental to the environment, which range from cancelling climate grant programs to loosening regulations that govern air and water quality.

Many of these actions have been part of the president’s larger goals of reining in government spending, increasing energy independence and restructuring federal agencies. But some also appear to target one state in particular: California.

Long known as a nationwide leader in climate and environmental policy, the Golden State has been in Trump’s crosshairs since his first administration, when he sparred with Gov. Gavin Newsom over issues such as forest and water-supply management. In recent months, Trump has escalated his California-specific efforts, including vowing to block the state’s ability to set strict tailpipe emission standards — a battle that has wound all the way up to the Senate.

Many of the president’s actions in the first 100 or so days of this administration have not only called out California by name, but also disproportionately targeted it. A leaked list of pending program cuts from the Department of Energy includes 53 projects in California — more than any other state — as well as more projects in blue states than red ones.

In April, the president named California in an executive order directing the Department of Justice to seek out and “stop the enforcement of” state laws that address climate change, in which he described California’s first-of-its-kind cap-and-trade program as an unfair means of punishing businesses for their use of fossil fuels.

Experts say it’s not surprising that the president is coming for California’s environmental progress. Trump received record donations from oil and gas companies during his campaign. Meanwhile, California, a Democratic stronghold, has set aggressive climate targets that seek to limit those industries and transition the state to carbon neutrality by 2045.

“One hundred percent, California is targeted,” said Mary Creasman, chief executive of the nonprofit California Environmental Voters. “It’s along the same lines as everything we have seen from this president: political retaliation at every turn toward anybody who disagrees with him on anything — and California disagrees with him on a lot.”

But California also has the tools, means and motivation to to fight back, Creasman and others said, including through litigation and legislation.

Already, the state has filed or joined nearly 50 legal actions against the current administration, at least seven of which pertain to the environment.

Among them is a lawsuit challenging the president’s declaration of a national energy emergency, which calls for for increased fossil fuel production, waived environmental reviews and the fast-tracking of projects in potentially sensitive ecosystems and habitats.

“These procedures misuse authorities meant for disaster response and bypass important health and environmental protections for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta wrote in a statement about that case.

Bonta has also joined a lawsuit against the administration’s plans to freeze federal funding for a number of programs that Trump has disparaged as “woke,” including environmental measures. Other suits challenge attempts to claw back funding for the construction of electric vehicle charging stations across the country; wind energy development; and the AmeriCorps program that deploys young people to disaster-relief organizations.

The California attorney general has also joined a motion to defend the Environmental Protection Agency’s chemical-accident safety rules from state and federal efforts to weaken or repeal it, and has signed onto an amicus brief opposing mass federal layoffs at agencies such as the EPA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

State lawmakers — including Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla — have thrown their hats in the ring as well, penning letters to the heads of various agencies in opposition to climate grant cuts at the EPA, the closure of the federal disaster tracking system and other issues.

Such challenges are a critical line of defense for California and other states working to preserve climate progress, said Pete Maysmith, president of the League of Conservation Voters, a D.C.-based nonprofit advocacy group.

“We have to litigate, we have to organize, we have to win elections,” Maysmith said. “We need our champs in Congress — many of whom call California home — to stand up and fight against things like trying to revoke the clean air waiver that California has had for 50 years.”

Indeed, the battle over clean air waivers is among the state’s most ferocious fights so far.

For decades, California has been granted special authority to set its own vehicle-emission standards by utilizing waivers issued by the EPA. Clean Air Act waivers have been fundamental to the state’s efforts to limit greenhouse gases and transition to electric vehicles, such as its ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.

But Trump has moved to block the state’s authority to do so, and earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives agreed with him. Now the battle is set for a vote in the Senate, which could happen as soon as this week.

Cliff Rechtschaffen, a member of the California Air Resources Board, believes the president is targeting the state in part because of its special authority.

“I think California stands out because we are the leader on so many things, including our clean car and zero-emission vehicle standard,” Rechtschaffen said. Should California lose the Senate battle, the state will challenge it in the court system, he said.

California can achieve a similar outcome without the waivers, Rechtschaffen said, such as raising registration fees or imposing taxes on heavily polluting vehicles — a tactic deployed in Norway that resulted in nearly all new cars purchased there last year being electric vehicles.

California could also consider instituting a statewide “indirect source” rule that would require ports and other facilities to limit pollution in the surrounding area, which could, for example, compel trucking companies using those ports to deploy low- or no-emissions vehicles.

While the Clean Air Act issue is complicated, other battles may be simpler. That includes Trump’s bid to halt the state’s cap-and-trade program, which sets limits on companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and allows them to sell “credits” for unused emissions to other companies.

Experts say he does not actually have the authority to end California’s program.

“It’s not really something that Trump or the attorney general can do. If you want to stop the enforcement of state law, you have to go to court, and that’s the jurisdiction of the court,” Maggie Coulter, a senior attorney with the Climate Law Institute at the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, said about the executive order.

Rechtschaffen agreed, noting that the state does not need federal authority to maintain a cap-and-trade program. Neither the EPA nor Congress has created a national cap-and-trade program that preempts state programs, “so it’s completely lawful under state law, and I don’t see anything under current federal law that would threaten our program,” he said.

Beyond defending itself in the courtroom, California can also use legislation to go on the offensive, according to Creasman, of California Environmental Voters.

The state is already flexing its legislative strength with two 2023 laws slated to go into effect next year. Senate Bills 253 and 261 will require large corporations that do business in California to measure and publicly disclose their carbon emissions. Creasman said the laws leverage California’s market size to help push national policy, and could be a model for similar efforts in the future.

Another law winding through the state legislature, Senate Bill 684 — known as the “Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act” — would require fossil fuel polluters to pay for their share of damages and disasters caused by their emissions. The funds would be put toward projects and programs to prepare for and respond to climate change.

“As we see the federal government starting to shrink resources, ‘Polluters Pay’ is a really important mechanism,” Creasman said.

Should the federal government succeed at rolling back protections under the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act and other rules, California could also consider a concept known as “trigger laws” to restore state standards set under the previous administration, Creasman said.

Trigger laws become enforceable only by specific events or conditions. One recent prominent example was when several states used the laws to trigger immediate abortion bans in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.

This combination of weapons in California’s arsenal — litigation, legislation and a large economy — mean California can mount a good defense when it comes to the environment, Creasman added.

“It is dangerous to not approach this moment with the gravity and reality of what we’re in — and what we’re in is a fight for our lives,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dadf5c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3982x2091+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F36%2F62%2Fb9174d6f4e7b9432d38f224aefaa%2Ftrump-39377.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 12:10:46.646770

“The issues related to resiliency persist regardless of where they can be tied to climate change,” Vander Woude said.
“We’re focusing on the end result, not any ideological issues.” NIRPC deals with local priorities as well as federal priorities, Vander Woude said.","Trump administration edicts were woven like a thread through Thursday’s Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission meeting as the commissioners weighed how to continue pursuing local governments’ values without jeopardizing grants.

Director of Transportation Tom Vander Woude ran through changes in an update of last year’s Unified Planning Work Program, which outlines information about transportation spending. Among the language changes were removing tasks associated with climate change. And rather than referencing executive orders that relate to issues like environmental justice, the document now refers to the original legislation that prompted the executive orders that had been issued.

President Donald Trump’s flurry of executive orders so far this year have reversed previous presidential edicts aimed at preventing climate change or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.

Gary Councilwoman Lori Lathan, newly appointed to the commission, kick-started a discussion of how the agency can continue to push for things like air quality improvement without referring to climate change or otherwise running afoul of Trump’s edicts.

“When they say advice, is that something that we’re required to make those changes,” she asked.

“Do we have to do them? Yes, we kind of do,” Vander Woude said, because those federal agencies oversee grants.

Various memos and formal communications with the U.S. Department of Transportation, all contracts and grant agreements have to comply with the new standards, he said.

Latham asked why the NIRPC document approved Thursday would refer to the legislation instead of executive orders.

The executive order related to environmental justice, for example, was rooted in civil rights legislation from the 1970s, Vander Woude said, so the document can refer to discrimination based on that legislation.

Congress makes laws; executive orders deal with how agencies implement them but don’t reverse the laws themselves.

Regarding climate change, NIRPC will focus on air quality rather than climate change.e

Under the Biden administration, there had been a movement for greenhouse gas analysis, but that since has been stopped by the Trump administration, so NIRPC and other agencies can’t do that anymore, Vander Woude said.

If organizations like NIRPC can’t enact programs to protect constituents, who will, Beverly Shores Town Council President David Phelps asked.

Lake County Surveyor Bill Emerson Jr., who chairs NIRPC’s Environmental Committee, said a resolution proposed by his committee and unanimously adopted at the meeting addresses this issue.

The resolution, on page 380 of a massive agenda packet for the meeting, noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had announced the cancellation of over 400 grants, the effects of which are still being figured out.

The resolution says NIRPC “reaffirms its commitment to protecting and improving environmental quality of life in Northwest Indiana including, but not limited to, improving air quality including greenhouse gas reduction, community tree planting initiatives, brownfield redevelopment, environmental justice capacity planning and natural hazards readiness planning.”

Vander Woude said even though the bulk of NIRPC’s work involves channeling federal funds for local governments in Lake, Porter and LaPorte counties, the agency also serves as a council of governments.

NIRPC can still pursue those activities without using federal funds to do so, Executive Director Ty Warner said.

Impacts like resiliency, previously directly tied to climate change, can still be examined. “The issues related to resiliency persist regardless of where they can be tied to climate change,” Vander Woude said. “You can deal with the impact; you can’t necessarily draw it back to that.”

That’s getting the job done without semantics getting in the way, Porter County Council President Andy Vasquez said.

“I think that’s exactly what we’re trying to do,” Vander Woude said. “We can describe it in various ways, but ultimately it’s about moving forward our vision, our values.”

“I think we’re going to have to be creative if we’re going to maintain our environmental justice and social justice focus,” Chesterton Councilman Jim Ton said. “If you don’t proceed with some of this, it’s going to be gone forever.”

That’s focusing on the end result without attributing it to causes, Warner said. “We’re focusing on the end result, not any ideological issues.”

NIRPC deals with local priorities as well as federal priorities, Vander Woude said. “We’re responsive to both.”

“I personally don’t see substantial changes in the actual work being done,” he said.

Lake County Councilman Randall Niemeyer urged the commission to focus on the nuts and bolts and stay out of the weeds on this issue. “It’s more window dressing than anything with the rhetoric,” he said. Focus on projects that have good results for the region, he said.

May 18, 2025 - By Mark Olalde - Days after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency sent an email to the entire workforce with details about the agency’s plans to close diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and included a plea for help.

“Employees are requested to please notify” the EPA or the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s human resources agency, “of any other agency office, sub-unit, personnel position description, contract, or program focusing exclusively on DEI,” the email from then-acting Administrator James Payne said.

No employees in the agency, then more than 15,000 people strong, responded to that plea, ProPublica learned via a public records request.

Trump has made ending diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility programs a hallmark effort of his second term. Many federal employees, however, are declining to assist the administration with this goal. He signed an executive order on his first day back in office that labeled DEI initiatives — which broadly aim to promote greater diversity, largely within the workplace — as “illegal and immoral discrimination programs” and ordered them halted. His pressure campaign to end DEI efforts has also extended to companies and organizations outside the government, with billions of dollars in federal funding for universities frozen as part of the fight.

Corbin Darling retired from the EPA this year after more than three decades with the agency, including managing environmental justice programs in a number of Western states.

“I’m not surprised that nobody turned in their colleagues or other programs in response to that request,” he said, adding that his former co-workers understood that addressing pollution that disproportionately impacted communities of color was important to the agency’s work. “That’s part of the mission — it has been for decades,” Darling said.

Payne’s note to agency employees listed two email addresses — one belonging to the EPA and one to the Office of Personnel Management — where EPA employees could send details about DEI efforts. ProPublica submitted public records requests to both agencies for the contents of the inboxes from the start of the administration through April 1.

The Office of Personnel Management didn’t respond to the request, although the Freedom of Information Act requires that it do so within 20 business days. The agency also did not answer questions about whether it received any reports to its anti-DEI inbox.

The EPA, meanwhile, checked its inbox and confirmed that zero employees had filed reports. “Some emails received in that inbox did come from EPA addresses but none of them called out colleagues who were still working on DEI matters,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement in May.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“The optimist in me would like to believe that maybe it is because, as an agency, we are generally dedicated to our mission and understand that DEIA is intrinsic in that,” a current EPA employee who requested anonymity said. “On the flip side, they’ve done such a good job immediately dismantling DEIA in the agency that folks who are up in arms might have just been assuaged.”

Although DEI programs are often internal to a workplace, the administration also put a target on environmental justice initiatives, which acknowledge the fact that public health and environmental harm disproportionately fall on poorer areas and communities of color. Environmental justice has been part of the EPA’s mandate for years but greatly expanded under the Biden administration.

Research has shown, for example, that municipalities have planted fewer trees and maintained less green space in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of people of color, leading to more intense heat. And heavy industry has often been zoned or sited near Latino, Black and Native American communities.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was confirmed in late January, has boasted about cutting more than $22 billion in environmental justice and DEI grants and contracts. “Many American communities are suffering with serious unresolved environmental issues, but under the ‘environmental justice’ banner, the previous administration’s EPA showered billions on ideological allies, instead of directing those resources into solving environmental problems and making meaningful change,” he wrote in an April opinion piece in the New York Post.

The EPA spokesperson said employees with more than 50% of their duties dedicated to either environmental justice work or DEI were targeted for layoffs. The agency “is taking the next step to terminate the Biden-Harris Administration’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Environmental Justice arms of the agency,” the spokesperson said.

EPA environmental justice offices worked on a range of initiatives, such as meeting with historically underserved communities to help them participate in agency decision-making and dispersing grants to fund mitigation of the carcinogenic gas radon or removal of lead pipes, Darling explained.

“A sea change isn’t the right word because it’s more of a draining of the sea,” Darling said. “It has devastated the program.”

Amber Markham is director of external affairs at The Nature Conservancy.

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, and nine of their House Republican colleagues are calling on Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith to save the clean energy tax credits passed under the Inflation Reduction Act. We agree — repealing these tax credits is a direct threat to Iowa’s economy, workforce, and energy security.

Here in Iowa, those very same clean energy tax credits are already delivering results. They’re helping small businesses in Fairfield cut costs, giving farmers near Ames tools to improve their bottom line, and training electricians in Sioux City for high-skilled, good-paying jobs. They’re putting solar panels on barns, boosting local economies, and keeping family energy bills manageable — all while building a more stable power grid.

A recent study commissioned by the Nature Conservancy found that clean energy tax credits will support more than 2,300 jobs in Iowa every year through 2032 — that’s $116 million in wages and nearly $240 million added to our state’s economy annually. And these jobs aren’t just short-term. They include long-term careers in manufacturing, engineering, transportation, and energy operations for Iowans.

A repeal of the clean energy tax credits would undo our progress. It would mean higher costs for families and businesses — projecting a 7% to 10% increase in energy bills by 2026, according to national projections. It would slow job growth, shrink opportunity, and make us more reliant on the same fossil fuel volatility that’s cost Iowa consumers and businesses dearly in the past.

When you combine clean energy with traditional power sources, you get lower costs, fewer price spikes, and more energy resilience in times of extreme weather that strain our power grid. The clean energy tax credits help to make this resilience and economic prosperity happen; it’s about having a diverse energy mix that works better for everyone while boosting local economies.

Clean energy is now one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the country and it’s helping keep young people in Iowa by offering skilled, meaningful work in their own communities. These investments are not red or blue. They’re just smart policy.

We know how to lead here in Iowa. We’ve led the country in wind energy, 13 GW, and are now charting a path forward in solar, storage, and other technologies. We innovate. We adapt to emerging technologies that uplift working families. And when we see something that’s improving the lives of our neighbors, families, and friends, we don’t tear it down — we build on it.

This is a critical moment to continue building for the future. Congress has the power to either preserve the momentum we’ve created and safeguard clean energy tax credits that enable Iowa to prosper or send our state back to a time with more expensive energy and fewer job opportunities for young Iowans, and shrink a burgeoning high-skilled industry. We urge Iowa’s representatives to protect these tax credits, support our clean energy workers, and keep Iowa’s economy charging forward.

This would all happen even if the Reconciliation bill increases U.S. oil and gas production and fossil fuel prices decline.
Add it all up, and the Reconciliation bill is a bad deal for our country.","The “One Big Beautiful Bill” moving through the United States House of Representatives is being advertised as an economic engine, but that rhetoric masks its reality.

The current bill text would grind our economy to a halt by stealing 830,000 jobs by 2030, costing America more than $1 trillion in GDP by 2034, and increasing power prices 50% by 2035 according to new Energy Innovation analysis of energy-related provisions of the 2025 House Reconciliation bill.

By killing off existing clean energy tax incentives, Congress would kneecap our ability to build new power generation fast enough to meet soaring energy demand. Electricity demand is forecast to increase up to 15.8% in the next four years, with 128 gigawatts of new load expected on the grid as the AI race heats up. But the Reconciliation bill text would force expected clean energy capacity additions to fall dramatically – 114 GW by 2030 and 302 GW by 2035 - right when we need it most.

Warning signs are flashing for our economy: Inflation is rising and 82% of Americans are already worried about a potential recession. Clean energy is what’s available right now, and it cuts costs for families and businesses. But this bill would destabilize our economic competitiveness and set us back years against China and other economies to meet rising global demand for energy technologies.

America’s economy and families simply can’t afford this bill.

America’s Manufacturing - And GDP - Could Fall Off A Cliff

Last week, the House of Representatives released its 2025 budget Reconciliation legislation. Bill text passed out of several committees would repeal existing clean energy tax credits, claw back unobligated funding, expand oil and gas leasing, repeal certain Clean Air Act programs.

The sum of these parts would weaken our economy, not strengthen it, primarily by targeting existing clean energy tax credits passed by Congress in 2022. To date, these credits have generated $321 billion in new private investment across nearly 2,400 domestic clean-energy facilities, representing 4.7% of all U.S. private investment in the first quarter of 2025, with an additional $522 billion in private sector investment announced but not yet spent across more than 2,200 facilities.

The current Reconciliation legislation undercuts these 7,000 projects, risking billions in investments, dampening economic growth, eliminating jobs, and raising energy bills for people and businesses. Just the threat of repeal has already led investors to cancel $6.9 billion worth of projects between January and March 2025.

If the bill’s changes were fully implemented, that manufacturing growth would fall off a cliff as developers would cancel a significant number of announced clean energy manufacturing facilities, dramatically decreasing clean electricity generation deployment – costing America $1.1 in lost GDP between the budget reconciliation window of 2026-2034. That’s even worse than simple Inflation Reduction Act repeal.

Clean energy investment was worth $2.1 trillion in 2024, and while America’s clean energy economy has boomed since 2022, ceding this economic opportunity by killing off a fast-growing industry will hand that investment and jobs growth to competitors like China and the European Union.

Reconciliation Risks An Energy Crisis And Massive Job Losses

Losing out on all that clean energy manufacturing and deployment doesn’t just harm our overall economy, it also cuts off our ability to build new generation fast enough to meet electricity demand that’s surging due to data centers, manufacturing, and electrification.

The Reconciliation bill would dramatically decrease power generation capacity additions, costing the country 114 GW of new clean energy generation by 2030 and 302 GW by 2035, risking an energy crisis when we need new power more than ever.

Clean energy is the fastest option for utilities to meet rising demand – it composed 90% of all new capacity added to the grid in 2024, with solar and battery storage alone making up 84% of all new generation and renewables hitting 17% of total U.S. electricity supply.

But while gas has risen to become the nation’s largest source of electricity at 40% of total generation, new gas plants face massive hurdles to coming online because turbine manufacturers facing delivery backlogs until at least 2029. “To get your hands on a gas turbine right now and to actually get it to market, you’re looking at 2030 or later,” said John Ketchum, CEO of NextEra, one of America’s largest utilities.

And don’t forget jobs. The combination of cancelled manufacturing facilities and cancelled clean energy projects would cost our economy more than 830,000 jobs in 2030 and nearly 720,000 jobs in 2035. Not only would manufacturing and construction jobs disappear, but all the related jobs that depend on people working would suffer too – think the restaurant serving lunch, the stores selling uniforms and tools, and the destinations where those workers spend their vacations.

American Families And Businesses Forced To Pay More

But the real economic danger lurking in the Reconciliation bill’s text is the price American families and businesses would have to pay.

Decreased clean energy generation plus higher fossil fuel prices from increased gas exports and oil demand would force consumers to pay more than $16 billion more in annual energy costs in 2030 and more than $33 billion more in 2035 – an average of $120 more per year for American households in 2030 and $230 per year in 2035. Meanwhile fuel and operations and maintenance costs for businesses would spike $65 billion in 2030 and $94 billion in 2035.

This would all happen even if the Reconciliation bill increases U.S. oil and gas production and fossil fuel prices decline. Price reductions from higher fuel production are more than offset by greater demand for those fuels and higher electricity costs, forcing households to pay more for their energy. More internal combustion engine vehicles on the road means more demand for gasoline and diesel, while increased reliance on burning gas to generate electricity tightens supplies – on both, higher demand increases prices.

And while gas has been relatively cheap in recent years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts gas prices will rise 91% by 2026 with “additional risk over the forecast period” from new liquefied natural gas exports.

Even new clean energy would become more expensive due to the Reconciliation bill’s proposed tax credit changes, as utilities and power market operators are forced to pay more for new generation, passing that increased cost directly through to consumers.

A shocking 34% of U.S. households had to cut back or skip necessary expenses in the past 12 months to pay energy bills, while 23% have been unable to pay part of all of their energy bill during the same time. Todd Brickhouse, CEO of North Dakota’s Basin Electric Power Cooperative, told Congress the “removal of [tech-neutral energy tax credits] will not allow utilities to plan for and avoid increased costs, and this will also immediately harm ratepayers.”

Reconciliation: One Big Beautiful Bill America Can’t Afford

With inflation rising, American households simply can’t afford another hit to their budgets. With a recession looming, American workers can’t afford to lose good jobs. And with tariff-induced trade wars on the horizon, American companies can’t afford to lose our domestic supply chain.

Zach Colletti, of St. Petersburg, is executive director of Florida Conservatives for Clean Energy.","As Florida continues to experience economic growth and an influx of new residents, our energy demands are increasing rapidly. To meet this challenge, we must adopt energy policies that align with the conservative principles that have made our state the greatest in the nation: reducing costs for consumers, fostering job creation and ensuring energy independence.

As we work to bring manufacturing and energy production back home, we must prioritize smart clean energy tax policy that delivers results. These measures help grow our economy, drive private investment and ensure greater energy security for consumers, businesses and especially our military.

Smart tax policy helps spur significant investment in our state’s economy. Florida is rich in renewable energy potential, and the state has a growing clean energy economy that has generated tens of billions of dollars in statewide investment, over 40,000 jobs and billions of dollars in household income. Companies are establishing manufacturing facilities, creating high-paying jobs and strengthening our domestic supply chains.

A wholesale rollback of policies that are working as designed would be a direct hit to Florida’s growing energy economy. According to data from the U.S. Energy and Employment Report, Florida ranks third in the nation for clean energy employment, with 175,572 jobs across sectors like solar, energy efficiency, grid modernization and electric vehicles.

In 2023 alone, clean energy employment in Florida grew by 5.9%, nearly 2.5 times faster than overall state job growth. Clean energy job growth in Florida has also consistently outpaced the broader economy for the last five years — proving that this sector is not only critical to reducing energy costs, but also to fueling stable, long-term employment across the state.

Florida is rapidly emerging as a leader in clean transportation. According to the same study, we are home to over 12,900 electric vehicle jobs. This marks a steady increase of nearly 18% growth over two years. These jobs are spread across manufacturing, maintenance, logistics and supporting services — creating opportunities not just in major metros, but in small towns and conservative districts as well. These aren’t abstract policy wins — they’re real jobs for real Floridians, driving innovation, reducing fuel costs and bringing advanced industries into our communities

At Conservatives for Clean Energy, we advocate for pragmatic, market-driven energy policies that strengthen our economy, protect consumers and modernize our infrastructure. Supporting pragmatic policies that support clean energy generation in our state is consistent with these values. These policies are not handouts; they are strategic investments that enable businesses to plan, invest and grow within our state.

As discussions about energy tax policy continue, it’s imperative that reforms prioritize business and market certainty. We must not undermine the key drivers that are revitalizing our economy and powering our future.

Protecting these investments is the conservative, pro-growth and America First approach. Let’s continue to build on that momentum — for our workers, our families and our future.

The Plan for Change, a partnership between the two European powers, outlines plans to develop new clean energy manufacturing jobs.
It also supports the development of the U.K.’s renewable energy capacity, including offshore wind and grid development.","With plans for a green transition, millions of workers in the oil, gas, and coal sectors have become concerned for their jobs, with news of massive cuts as the energy reliance in several countries shifts away from fossil fuels. However, there could be significant potential for these workers to be retrained for positions in the renewable energy sector, based on their existing skills and experience. Further, taxing the oil industry could help provide the money needed to fund this move.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, when global oil production fell to a record low due to a decrease in demand coupled with widespread government orders to stay at home, oil and gas jobs began to decline. Several oil and gas companies went bankrupt during the pandemic, leading to a sharp decline in jobs. Meanwhile, oil companies began to invest heavily in advanced technologies, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, to allow operations to continue running with fewer workers.

Despite the increase in oil and gas output since the pandemic, jobs are still being cut across the sector. In the United States, while crude output soared, employment figures fell during five of the first six months of 2024 due to improved operational efficiencies. This trend is expected to continue as companies invest further in advanced technologies and efficiency improvements across the industry. In addition, the eventual global shift away from fossil fuels to renewable alternatives will contribute to a reduction in oil, gas, and coal jobs as roles in the renewable energy and nuclear power industries increase.

A May publication from Oil Change International (OCI) suggests that making the U.K. windfall tax on oil and gas companies permanent could provide enough financing to help North Sea workers transition to jobs in the renewable energy sector. By cutting subsidies to oil and gas producers, enough money could be raised to spend on the transition to a low-carbon economy, the report states. Approximately $2.5 billion a year is required to support the retraining of oil and gas workers, as well as to establish new infrastructure and green jobs in a “just transition”.

The report suggests that $1.46 billion would contribute to developing the wind industry and creating new green jobs, while $585 million would be invested in adapting ports to make them capable of building and maintaining offshore wind turbines, and $432 million would go towards training oil and gas workers.

The U.K.’s windfall tax is a levy on oil and gas producers that was introduced in 2022 when oil profits were soaring. The Labour government has said that the tax, also known as the energy profits levy, will be extended to March 2030, instead of expiring at the end of 2025 as originally planned. The government increased the tax to 38 percent in November, much to the dismay of many oil and gas companies.

The recent report suggests that making the windfall tax permanent could raise as much as $2.66 billion a year. Rosemary Harris, a senior campaigner at OCI, stated, “Transitioning to a renewable energy economy is one of the greatest opportunities the U.K. has to create secure, well-paid jobs for energy workers and build a fairer future.” Harris added, “But right now, the government is failing to meet the challenges facing workers and communities. As jobs disappear and the cost of living soars, communities are being left behind. This plays right into the hands of those who wish to weaponise the government’s inaction for their own profits, under the guise of caring about workers.”

OCI also wants the government to close tax loopholes, such as the “carried interest” provision in capital gains tax, which allows private equity fund managers to pay a much lower investment tax rate than they would if they had to pay income tax on it. This could raise around $651.7 million a year, according to the analysis.

In May, the U.K. Energy Ministry Ed Miliband secured a Green Industrial Partnership with his Norwegian counterparts, Ministers Terje Aasland and Cecilie Myrseth. Miliband met with several energy companies to deepen bilateral relations and boost clean energy investment in the U.K. The Plan for Change, a partnership between the two European powers, outlines plans to develop new clean energy manufacturing jobs. It also supports the development of the U.K.’s renewable energy capacity, including offshore wind and grid development. Research suggests that closer cooperation on the clean energy transition in the North Seas could lower bills, create up to 51,000 jobs, and add up to $47.9 billion to the U.K. economy.

With fossil fuel jobs in decline, governments worldwide must prepare for a just transition, supporting the retraining of oil, gas, and coal workers to prepare them for roles in the clean energy sector. However, achieving this shift will require high levels of funding for retraining programmes and related infrastructure. Recent research suggests that, in the case of the U.K., financing could be raised by making the windfall tax on oil and gas companies permanent.

This has opened up opportunities for entrepreneurs and the industries serving these markets, from power generation, storage and distribution to the underlying electrical cables that connect everything into the grid. Here are three companies striving to make the clean transition happen.

Ramping up renewables

Having grown up in Venezuela, entrepreneur Carlos Guinand understood first-hand both the power and the pitfalls of fossil-fuel economies. Today he is cofounder of Sonnedix, a global producer of renewable energy. He set out on his mission to build the company at a time when renewables were still lesser-known technologies. Nevertheless, Guinand had a strong vision for the future.

He says: “In the early 2000s, it was clear that the energy system needed to evolve. When I looked at the renewable energy space, I saw an industry at the intersection of several powerful forces: the environmental imperative, the financial fundamentals driven by falling technology costs, and the geopolitics around energy. But more personally, it brought together my two biggest passions: people and technology. I’ve always been deeply curious about the future and ‘what’s next’, how technology reshapes the way we live, and how people drive that change.”

Sonnedix owns renewable energy plants and sells electricity. The company develops, builds, and operates globally, primarily in solar, with storage playing an increasingly important role. Launched in 2009 with a 1MW project in Spain it now has 11,000 MW of controlled capacity around the world.

Clean energy commitment

Sixteen years ago, however, renewable technology was still in its infancy. Institutional capital was still in the process of maturing its understanding of the asset class, and the market was highly fragmented. The challenges were real, from navigating nascent regulatory frameworks and building trust in a technology that was not fully understood, to managing prices that still needed to be proven they would drop.

Guinand says: “We take a deeply responsible approach to our communities, the land we use, and how we produce energy. Today, we have over 11,000 MW of controlled capacity globally and in 2024 alone we produced enough renewable energy to power approximately 1.8 million households.

“We’ve also built a team of more than 650 people. I’ve always believed a big part of our job is to hire those who are smarter than us – you never want to be the smartest person in the room – and that’s how we grow.”

The hidden electrification infrastructure

Electrical cables might be the unseen component in many of these evolving industries, but they are nonetheless fundamental to the proper functioning of almost all new advances associated with modern life.

Eland Cables connects projects across the world’s burgeoning green power network, and power and control systems, equipment and infrastructure. Executive director JS Pelland has steered the company through a 400% growth in turnover over the last 10 years to over £300 million today. This growth has arisen predominantly from supplying power cables to industries as diverse as railways, renewable energy and data centers.

A former finance executive originally from Québec, Pelland moved to London and took over what was then an SME-sized electrical cable supply company as part of a management buy-out from an LSE-listed conglomerate nearly 20 years ago.

It was a meeting of minds and the start of a friendship with fellow board members that saw him join the business as an owner and director, beginning a journey of innovating and expanding what has become Europe’s fastest-growing cable supplier to critical infrastructure.

Its Cable Lab has become a center of technical excellence in the cable industry, working with clients that include Network Rail, BAA, Vodafone, Eurotunnel, Siemens and UK Power Networks on large-scale electrification and decarbonization projects.

Pelland says: “With the ongoing transition from burning carbon molecules to the transmission of electrons as a source of power, cable suppliers such as Eland Cables have been presented with a unique opportunity to collaborate with industry leaders on shaping the world’s changing power landscape. The future of our business is intrinsically linked to the pace of the 21st century’s technological advancement and adoption.”

New life for retired EV batteries

Second-life battery storage systems reduce diesel reliance in off-grid communities, enabling commercial and industrial organizations to manage peak demand and EV charging loads. Moment Energy, founded by four engineers who met while building electric racing cars at university, is repurposing retired EV batteries to address grid resilience and renewable integration challenges.

The company is on a mission to repurpose every retired EV battery by 2030 and is building North America’s first second-life battery gigafactory. Moment Energy partners with automakers and utilities to create circular economies, with systems already powering remote sites across Canada and expanding into grid-scale applications.

CEO and cofounder Edward Chiang’s conviction about energy reliability was solidified in 2018. He was working on nuclear energy research for the Canadian government near Ottawa when a tornado hit. “We lost power for 24 hours,” he says. “Witnessing the local grocery store discarding food, and the hospital powerless was a stark wake-up call that ignited my passion to ensure everyone has access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy.”

Clean energy for all

Moment Energy was launched in 2020. Beyond the drive for energy access, the team was also confronted by a significant environmental challenge: what to do with retiring electric vehicle (EV) batteries. “We discovered that only about 5% of these batteries were being responsibly recycled,” says Chiang. “This presented a clear opportunity to create a circular economy solution.”

He points out that EV batteries often retire from vehicles with significant remaining capacity; an average of over 80%. Instead of heading prematurely to recycling, which can be costly and complex, the company repurposes them into battery energy storage systems (BESS), which extends their useful life for another 10 to 15 years.

To date, the company has raised a total of $52 million, including a $3.5 million seed funding in 2021, a $20.3 million DOE grant, and a $15 million Series A in 2025. While its initial large-scale manufacturing expansion focuses on North America, its global vision is to enable all retired EV batteries to be repurposed by 2030, an opportunity driven by an estimated 953 GWh of available batteries.

Chiang says: “Our aim is to enable broader repurposing efforts, not only through our own manufacturing but also by providing our battery management system (BMS) technology to other companies as well as our certified battery testing services, which are crucial for EV battery repurposing. We believe that clean energy is a fundamental human right, and our team is committed to making clean, reliable, and affordable power accessible to everyone across the globe.”",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68299445c1b9e5774afe1ad0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-05-18 10:05:21.116853

The Central Iowa Power Cooperative — known as CIPCO — is one of Iowa’s participants in the Energy Star program.
On average, Energy Star appliances can save homeowners 20 to 50 percent on the monthly energy bill to operate that appliance, compared with standard appliance models, Martin-Schramm said.
He said Energy Star laundry machines typically use about 20 percent less energy and 30 percent less water than typical washers; Energy Star refrigerators are about 15 percent more efficient than the federal minimum standard.
“If Energy Star goes away, that push to make an ultra-efficient appliance might go away,” Slager said.","If the Trump administration ends the Energy Star program that for decades has clearly marked home appliances that meet energy efficient standards, consumers would have to do more legwork of their own to research products or risk paying higher utility bills.

Under his proposed federal budget, President Donald Trump is asking that Congress eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency’s entire Atmospheric Protection Program, which houses the offices that run Energy Star. The EPA did not confirm to reporters it was ending the program — CNN was the first to report it was, based on unnamed sources — but said the reorganization “is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.”

A home that buys Energy Star products can save $450 a year on energy costs, the program says. While energy efficient products would remain on the market if the program ends, it would fall to consumers to find them since they would no longer feature the familiar label. And incentives for manufactures to meet the standards could dwindle with the program’s demise, some energy experts predict.

Consumers “may give up and buy products with less efficiency that will cost them more in energy expenses,” said Tom Carsner, political director for the Iowa City Area’s chapter of the Sierra Club.

The IRS and local utilities rely on Energy Star’s standards for tax credits and rebates for purchasing efficient products could put “their future in doubt,” he said.

“Homeowners may be discouraged (from) buying heat pumps, solar panels or insulation without the standards that help them save money,” Carsner said. “It will cost consumers more and will further damage our environment.”

How the program works

Administered by the EPA, the Energy Star program works as a voluntary labeling program on appliances — with over 80,000 products earning the certification.

If an appliance meets efficiency standards set by the EPA, the manufacturer can choose to add an Energy Star logo. The designation means consumers and businesses can purchase the approved products to save energy.

Kerri Johannsen, energy program director with the Iowa Environmental Council, said the program has “filled a critical gap in consumer choice and information” since its inception in 1992 under the administration of then-President George H.W. Bush.

“The program also provides tools and standards for businesses, schools and local governments that want to keep energy bills as affordable as possible,” she said. “This is critical with rising electricity rates in Iowa, where many parts of the state are in the 90th percentile or higher for the portion of income they pay for energy.”

According to an April 2022 report from Energy Star, Iowa has about 120 businesses and organizations participating in the program that helps them become more energy efficient. Additionally, nearly 50,000 homes and apartments in Iowa are Energy Star-approved — scoring 75 or higher on a scale of 1 to 100 that shows how their energy consumption compares with similar facilities across the nation.

The Central Iowa Power Cooperative — known as CIPCO — is one of Iowa’s participants in the Energy Star program. While ending the program would not directly affect the cooperative, it would its members.

“We are participants in the sense that we support our member cooperatives in being participants,” said Kerry Koonce, vice president of communications and corporate relations for CIPCO, based in Cedar Rapids, a generation and transmission electric cooperative owned by 13 rural electric cooperatives and associations. A member — for instance, a rural electric cooperative — “would be the one that would be offering a rebate to somebody, if it was Energy Star.”

Local impacts

If the program were shuttered, Koonce said one of the biggest challenges for utilities and electric cooperatives would be educating customers.

“It'll take a re-education of people, of just things to look for so that you understand how to look at ratings and make sure they are energy efficient,” she said. “I think you would see more (education efforts) coming out, but some of that's going to come from the manufacturers, too, because they want to make sure they you buy their product.”

Alliant Energy spokesperson Morgan Hawk said the company “always encourages” customers to implement energy efficiency tips to reduce their energy usage and save on their bill.

Hawk said that a list of “do-it-yourself” cost savings tips can be found at alliantenergy.com/waystosave. He said that customers also are encouraged to monitor their energy usage and set up high-usage alerts through their Alliant accounts.

“In addition, Alliant Energy has been offering energy efficiency programs for customers for nearly 35 years,” Hawk said in an emailed statement.

He said customers can visit Alliant’s website and click on the “Ways to Save” tab at the top to explore a variety of options, including instant discounts, rebates and the Alliant Energy Marketplace with energy-efficient products.

Geoff Greenwood, spokesperson for MidAmerican Energy, said the company will “continue to closely follow developments relating to the timeline and scope of changes from the EPA to better understand any impact those changes could have on the energy efficiency programs that MidAmerican offers to customers.”

If the EPA follows through on shuttering the program, Jim Martin-Schramm, policy analyst in Winneshiek County with the Clean Energy Districts of Iowa, said low-income consumers would pay a price.

“In Iowa, approximately 25 percent of all ratepayers are low-income households getting by on incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level,” he said.

On average, Energy Star appliances can save homeowners 20 to 50 percent on the monthly energy bill to operate that appliance, compared with standard appliance models, Martin-Schramm said.

He said Energy Star laundry machines typically use about 20 percent less energy and 30 percent less water than typical washers; Energy Star refrigerators are about 15 percent more efficient than the federal minimum standard.

“It is hard to understand why the Trump administration would want to eliminate the Energy Star program, given that it simply provides consumers with valuable information and does not limit their choices in the marketplace,” Martin-Schramm said.

Tim Slager, president and owner of Slager Appliance, said that about 85 percent of the appliances in his three storefronts — in Iowa City, Cedar Rapids and Dubuque — are Energy Star-certified.

He said that since so many appliance models are Energy Star approved, not too many customers ask anymore about appliance efficiency. But a decade ago, before energy efficient thinking was mainstream, customers inquired about it much more often.

“If Energy Star goes away, that push to make an ultra-efficient appliance might go away,” Slager said.

Siemens Mobility’s Commitment to Net-Zero Operations

New Piccadilly line trains for Transport for London, which will transform rail travel across the capital, are being assembled at the Goole site, before they start to enter service by the end of this year. Siemens Mobility also plans to build all future mainline trains for the UK at Goole, including new battery bi-mode trains that it has calculated could save Britain’s railways £3.5 billion and 12 million tonnes of CO2 over 35 years.

Finbarr Dowling, Siemens Mobility Director of Localisation, said: “Our vision from the very outset was for the Goole Rail Village to be net zero in its operations by 2030, with this state-of-the-art facility playing a central part in our mission to transform rail travel and transport in the UK. “This strategic focus has informed the development of a state-of-the-art rail cluster that leads the way on decarbonisation for the industry, with facilities that are streets ahead of many across the sector. It also underpins everything we do at Goole, ensuring that our buildings, energy generation and consumption, how we work, and travel to and from the site all minimise our carbon impact. That is hugely important for us, as a business committed to the highest sustainability standards, as well as to our customers, stakeholders and partners as they strive for excellence in environmental responsibility.”

Investing in Green Energy: Solar Panels and Energy Efficiency

Siemens Mobility’s investment of up to £240 million in the Goole Rail Village represents a significant commitment to the North of England, with the site featuring manufacturing, components, logistics, innovation, and office facilities, establishing it as a centre of excellence for rail technology in the UK. Global rail technology leader Siemens Mobility has installed 1,700 solar panels across the three manufacturing buildings at the Goole site, which have now been connected and are capable of generating up to 1MW of clean energy – the equivalent of powering more than 150 homes.

Sited on the trucking, final assembly, and commissioning buildings, the £2 million solar array covers almost 20,000 m2 (215,000 sq ft) of roof space and is producing sufficient energy to meet the site’s needs. Green energy produced by the panels during the site’s non-production hours, such as during weekends, is exported back to the grid, while any additional energy required during peak times is exclusively from renewable sources.

Sustainability Measures: Air Source Heat Pumps and Electric Vehicles

Siemens Mobility has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions in its own operations by 55 per cent by 2025, and 90 per cent by 2030, with the production of its own renewable energy at sites such as Goole playing a vital part in that transition. The solar array complements other sustainability measures which are contributing to the Goole site’s low carbon credentials. Siemens Mobility has invested £2 million to install more than 40 localised air source heat pumps to heat the production facilities at Goole, an initiative projected to cut its carbon output by 980 tonnes per year, an 88 per cent reduction. The business is also electrifying its vehicle fleet and rolling out EV charging points across the Goole site to ultimately install around 70 chargers, one for every 10 parking spaces. All employees are encouraged to adopt greener methods of transport, such as cycling, using public transport, or car sharing.

Future Investments and Job Creation at Goole Rail Village

The latest phase of the Rail Village will see the addition of a Bogie Assembly and Service Centre, representing an additional investment of up to £40 million, which means Siemens Mobility’s overall investment will total up to £240 million, bringing up to 1,000 new jobs to the site, as well as around 1,700 supply chain opportunities. David Harris, Siemens Mobility Construction Project Manager, said: “Our carbon reduction strategy for the Goole Rail Village has been implemented over a number of years. We’ve considered how best to minimise our carbon footprint at every stage, including throughout the development and construction phases. With the rail manufacturing facility now operational, we’re seeing the full benefits of building sustainability into the project from day one.”

Siemens Mobility’s Integrated Rail Hub: The Goole Rail Village

Overall, Siemens Mobility is investing up to £240 million in the Goole Rail Village, a site that spans 67 acres, the size of 35 football pitches. London Underground’s new Piccadilly line trains will be assembled at Goole before they start entering passenger service from 2025. This investment will bring up to 1,000 new jobs to the East Riding of Yorkshire, as well as around 1,700 supply chain opportunities, promoting localisation and helping to serve other global markets by 2030. The Goole Rail Village is a fully integrated rail hub, consisting of the Train Manufacturing Facility which assembles and commissions trains, the Components Facility where Siemens Mobility maintains gearboxes, traction motors, and other parts for train and tram fleets, the Logistics Centre warehousing facility, and the Rail Accelerator and Innovation Solutions hub for Enterprise (RaisE) business centre. With additional investment of up to £40 million, all of this will be joined by a Bogie Assembly and Service Centre, which will incorporate and expand Siemens Mobility’s current capabilities to overhaul bogies from UK trains.

Supporting Local Supply Chain and Yorkshire Businesses

Siemens Mobility has supported the local supply chain wherever possible, contracting Leeds-based GMI Construction for the build of the Goole factory, Components Facility, and the warehouse. The GMI supply chain is based entirely in the UK, with over 70% of it based in Yorkshire. Several components for the Piccadilly line trains will also come from local Yorkshire and UK suppliers, such as the exterior lighting from LPA Lighting, just 25 miles away from the Goole factory.",https://www.manufacturingmanagement.co.uk/media/knaerjhw/436.jpg?width=1002&height=564&v=1dbb910c1bd8540,N,,2025-05-18 10:05:34.223209

Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be ""shut down"" without government help over energy pricing.
The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.
Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in ""constructive discussions"" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.
He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.","The UK's largest gas storage facility could be closed if the government does not help support a redevelopment of the site, the boss of the company which owns it has told the BBC.

Centrica chief executive Chris O'Shea told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that its Rough storage facility would be ""shut down"" without government help over energy pricing.

Centrica - which owns British Gas - says the site is set to lose £100m this year, and it wants to invest £2bn in the facility so it can use it to store more gas, including hydrogen.

The government said the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica but it was open to discussing proposals.

The Rough facility is off the coast of East Yorkshire, and accounts for about half of the capacity the UK has to store gas.

It was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this month, Centrica said it was in ""constructive discussions"" with the government for a support mechanism that would allow investment in the Rough site to proceed.

The company is seeking a ""cap and floor"" pricing mechanism. This means that if energy prices fall below a certain level its revenues will be topped up, but prices would be capped if they rise too high.

""What we're asking for is simply for the government to help create the conditions which will unlock £2bn of investment,"" Mr O'Shea told the BBC.

""It will create thousands of jobs in the construction phase, and it will safeguard the jobs of very highly skilled colleagues that are offshore.""

Without this investment he said the site would be decommissioned ""and we'll lose this resilience"".

He said the UK currently has 12 days of gas storage, of which Rough provides six.

""So if we don't have Rough anymore, then we go down to six days. Now, if we take Rough to full capacity, we will go up to about 25, or 30 days.""

A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said while the future of Rough was a commercial decision for Centrica, ""we remain open to discussing proposals on gas storage sites, as long as it provides value for money for taxpayers"".

Last week, Mr O'Shea said the way that the energy pricing mechanism worked meant that building of renewables would not ""materially"" reduce UK electricity prices from current levels.

He told Laura Kuenssberg on a visit to the North Sea platform that decarbonisation was important and also a ""huge economic opportunity"".

However he added that ""the price we see today for electricity is the same as the price that we're given to new renewable developments"".

""Therefore, that new renewable development will not bring down the price.""

He added that he thought the government's 2030 target for clean energy was ""very challenging, but I think it's right that the energy secretary has set a very stretching target"".

""It's not impossible, no, but it's not easy.""

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: ""As shown by the National Energy System Operator's independent report, our mission for clean power by 2030 is achievable and will deliver a more secure energy system, which could see a lower cost of electricity and lower bills.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2260/live/7b57ca50-33ba-11f0-b50a-8f193c97c723.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 10:05:39.229305

Energy firms will pay millions of pounds to improve communities where they’re building solar and wind farms, Ed Miliband is set to announce.

The Energy Secretary will this week reveal how locals will directly benefit from living near offshore wind or solar farms - with a cash boost for projects to upgrade football pitches, training programmes and transport links.

It comes as Mr Miliband vowed to the Sunday Mirror that Net Zero policies would make Brits better off.

Clean energy developers will be required by law to pay into a community fund, channelled into projects that can have a real impact - with local families in the area deciding where the money should be spent.

Projects that could be funded through the scheme include new community centres, funding for education bursaries and apprenticeships, grants to small businesses and energy efficiency work for local homes.

Community arts projects and sports and recreation facilities could also receive funding.

The level of payments will range depending on the size of the infrastructure project - from tens of thousands a year for small farms up to millions for larger developments.

“If you live near an offshore wind or solar farm, your local community should benefit from supporting this nationally critical mission,” Mr Miliband told the Sunday Mirror.

“The Prime Minister’s mission to become a clean energy superpower is creating good well-paid jobs in these areas, building the infrastructure we need to get energy bills down for working people.”

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror during a visit to a solar farm in Hull, which entirely powers a local hospital during the summer, saving the NHS up to £200,000 a month, Mr Miliband said the government's plan isn't just about fighting climate change - it's about cutting bills.

“Here’s the way I think about this,” he said. “The public are with if you can combine action to create clean energy with tackling the cost of living crisis - and that is absolutely at the heart of our mission.

“Our mission is about cutting bills for people, cutting costs for people and transitioning to clean energy - not about raising people’s bills.”

Tate Reeves does have the option to tack those measures onto the special session slated to happen by June 30.
A special session is one of the governor's most powerful tools to shape policy debates in the Legislature, but the process itself is costly.
A special session taking place outside the Legislature's regular meeting schedule costs roughly $100,000 per day.","During a press luncheon sponsored by the Mississippi State University Stennis Institute for Government on Monday, May 12, Mississippi Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson told reporters the state isn't doing enough to regulate a fast-growing solar industry in Mississippi.

""It is the farmer's land. It is the farmers' decision … on these matters,"" Gipson said. ""The concern is, at some point, how much is enough, and how (are solar projects) going to impact our long-term food supply and our agricultural backbone… .""

Gipson, who has led the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce since 2018, has at various times expressed concern with the development of agricultural land through Mississippi for non-agriculture uses.

Since 2017, the solar industry has grown rapidly in Mississippi, with more than $4 billion in private investment for dozens of projects throughout the state, as reported by the Clarion Ledger.

Gipson said specifically the state is doing little in the way of regulating those projects via permitting processes before they break ground.

""I think there needs to be a policy that makes sense,"" Gipson said. ""As it is, we've got 82 different counties with 82 different positions on what solar projects are needed … It's a patchwork situation that has given rise to a huge surge in these projects that are eroding our farmland.""

The state does, however, already regulate all energy generation projects. Notably, the state, in partnership with the Environmental Protection Agency, requires air quality permits in addition to power plant regulations set forth by the Public Service Commission and other air- and water-quality regulations.

Projects do also need certain permissions from the Public Service Commission before a solar project can connect to the grid.

Senate chairman suggests adding suffrage bills to special session

During an interview about the more than 70 suffrage bills lawmakers failed to pass before ending the 2025 regular session early, a high-ranking senator said he would support the governor adding suffrage measures to an upcoming special session.

In the 2025 regular session, not one suffrage restoration request for those who have been disenfranchised for various felony convictions made it through both chambers.

Senate Judiciary B Committee Chairman Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, and several suffrage bill authors said it was a shame the Legislature didn't pass any suffrage restoration bills this year and pegged the outcome on political squabbles between House and Senate.

Fillingane also apologized to those who had lawmakers file those bills on their behalf and said Republican Gov. Tate Reeves does have the option to tack those measures onto the special session slated to happen by June 30.

In early April, the Legislature gaveled out the 2025 regular session early because of a stall on state budget negotiations. That stemmed mostly from debates over when the state's $7 billion budget should be hashed out, whether to use state dollars to fund local projects and if lawmakers should establish recurring revenue for the state retirement system.

In 2024, lawmakers passed a near-record number of suffrage bills after an effort to automatically restore suffrage to nonviolent felony holders died in the Senate.

Reeves, a Republican, has the power to call lawmakers back to the Mississippi State Capitol and vote on a new state budget, but he also has the power to add on any other item to the agenda and force lawmakers to consider.

A special session is one of the governor's most powerful tools to shape policy debates in the Legislature, but the process itself is costly. A special session taking place outside the Legislature's regular meeting schedule costs roughly $100,000 per day.

Reeves, because of that fact, has kept recent special sessions to one-day affairs for large economic development projects.

Reeves has said nothing is totally off the table for a special session. He also said he wants House and Senate leadership to have a finalized budget agreement before he calls them back in to vote, which as of May 14 had not yet happened.

Former Democrat Party chair dies

Former state senator Mississippi Democratic Party Chair Johnnie E. Walls Jr. died Saturday, May 10, according to an announcement by the state Democratic Party. He was 80.

A Clarksdale native, Walls Jr. served in the Mississippi State from 1993 to 2010 and then as a judge in the Bolivar County Circuit Court district from 2011 to 2016.

Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons in a Facebook post said Walls was a dedicated public servant.

""Judge Walls leaves behind a powerful legacy of integrity, wisdom and dedication to public service,"" Simmons said.

“Look for the Energy Star.” Most Americans know that is excellent advice to anyone appliance shopping. That little blue label saves American consumers roughly $40 billion a year in energy costs every year.

With the program’s modest price tag – less than one percent of the EPA’s total spending – Americans save a whopping $1,250 for every single dollar spent on Energy Star. And Americans know that little blue symbol means less wasted energy and cleaner air. It helps families stretch their paychecks and do right by the planet at the same time.

Since the Energy Star public-private partnership began in 1992, it has helped save American households and businesses more than $500 billion on energy costs. It has more than 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions (roughly the equivalent of annual pollution from 933 million cars). And it has done so while empowering consumers with better information – not by taking anything away. What that looks like at the local level is homes and businesses in a large city like Chicago saving $116.6 million a year in energy costs, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 539,500 metric tons.

Now, Donald Trump wants to get rid of it. Virtually no one thinks that would be wise.

In March, a large group of manufacturers and industry associations joined a letter calling on Environmental Protections Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to keep the popular EPA program. The US Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, and others said, “eliminating [Energy Star] will not serve the American people,” and they pointed out that because of consumers’ high awareness of the program – to the tune of 90% brand awareness – the results if it is eliminated would be “decreased features, functionality, performance, or increased costs” of appliances.

Energy Star certified homes typically save around $450 per year on energy bills. In 2020 alone, the program’s emissions reductions amounted to more than five percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions. That year, the program’s energy savings also improved health outcomes for communities by preventing 210,000 tons each of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollutants, and 20,000 tons of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The public health benefits from those reductions in air pollution were estimated to be as high as $17 billion!

Further, the estimated annual market value of Energy Star product sales is more than $100 billion. And of domestic energy efficiency jobs, about 35% are in the manufacturing and installation of Energy Star products. As of 2020, that was more than 790,000 American jobs.

In his latest attack on common sense, Trump is trying to eliminate one of the federal government’s most successful, least controversial, and most popular consumer protection tools.

Ending Energy Star is not a serious policy move. It is performative politics at its worst. It is “virtue signaling” to fossil fuel extremists from a man desperate to please his donors while punishing regular people for choosing clean, affordable options.

Targeting the program as part of some sort of ideological deregulation agenda doesn’t even make sense because it is not a regulation. It does not force anybody to buy or produce anything. It is simply a voluntary, science-based labeling system. It helps consumers compare appliances and other products based on their energy efficiency. It helps Americans cut down their energy bills. And it helps reduce pollution that hurts our lungs and heats our planet.

That is why Americans across the political spectrum support it. It is an example of our government doing something simple, effective, and bipartisan. At least, it used to be.

Donald Trump’s push to dismantle this program is a perfect example of how MAGA hardliners have turned their backs on the very people they claim to represent. This is not about freedom or choice. It is about controlling the market to benefit fossil fuel interests. It is about keeping consumers in the dark. And it is about making sure families have fewer tools to protect themselves from rising costs.

Ask yourself: why, in the middle of what Trump and his allies keep calling an “energy emergency,” would you go out of your way to kill a program that helps people save so much money energy? The only people who benefit are the fossil fuel executives who profit when homes and appliances waste more of it.

When people waste energy because they unknowingly buy inefficient products, the fossil fuel industry makes more money.

That is the whole ballgame. It is a rigged system that leaves working Americans with higher bills while big polluters cash in. The Energy Star label helps consumers break that cycle.

Cutting Energy Star would be a betrayal of the millions of Americans who are already struggling to afford groceries, gas, and electricity. It would hurt seniors trying to stay warm in winter. It would hurt young families buying their first refrigerator. It would hurt renters in cities and homeowners in rural towns alike. No one benefits – except the lobbyists and the oil barons.

Energy Star gives every American the chance to choose better, smarter options. Scrapping it to score cheap points with the same special interests that are holding our country back defies common sense.

Americans deserve leaders who will fight to keep our bills low, our homes efficient, and our future sustainable.

Brad Little issued his own executive order in line with Trump’s, aiming to ramp up logging with the same “rationale” as the Trump order, combatting increased wildfire danger.
The order appears to replace federal responsibility for forest management in that of the state.
Decades of fire suppression by the USFS has led to a buildup of denser forests in some western dry forests.
The amount of timber sold from logging USFS lands in the U.S. from 2014 to 2023 has varied between 2.8 and 3.2 billion board feet a year.","On March 1, President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.” The order claimed “onerous Federal policies” have hindered domestic timber production and that expanding logging was a matter of protecting “national and economic security.” It ordered the secretary of the Interior and head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), who oversee the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) respectively, to develop a plan to expand timber targets and streamline permitting “to suspend, revise, or rescind all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, settlements, consent orders, and other agency actions that impose an undue burden on timber production.”

The responsible departments and agencies were instructed to find categorical exclusions to the National Environmental Policy Act and use “emergency regulations” to circumvent the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

After Trump’s order, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service continued the assault on endangered species by proposing a new rule that would redefine “harm” under the ESA to only include directly killing species, replacing the current definition that includes destruction of a species’ habitat. Habitat destruction is the greatest source of species extinction.

In April, USDA head Brooke Rollins directed the stripping of forest protections on more than half of all national forests and called for expanding timber production by 25 percent to address a “wildfire emergency,” and restore forest “resources.” A report from the Associated Press says the directive “exempts affected forests from an objection process that allows outside groups, tribes and local governments to challenge logging proposals at the administrative level before they are finalized.”

A map of forests Rollins has targeted includes all national forests in Washington State and California, and large sections throughout the west and other parts of the country. It even includes some wilderness areas. These forests contain some of the most cherished old-growth and mature forest ecosystems remaining in the U.S.

In the Pacific Northwest, millions of acres of older and mature forests and old-growth dependent species like the northern spotted owl were finally protected by the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in the 1990s after a century of logging that had reduced the forest to about a fourth of its historical extent. The NWFP happened as a result of intense forest defense and protest by Earth First! and many other environmental groups, studies by forest ecologists and court injunctions. The idea that these forests of immense trees, stunning natural beauty, rich biodiversity and crucial reserves of carbon sequestration could now, once again, be opened to logging is stomach-turning.

In late April, Idaho Gov. Brad Little issued his own executive order in line with Trump’s, aiming to ramp up logging with the same “rationale” as the Trump order, combatting increased wildfire danger. The order appears to replace federal responsibility for forest management in that of the state.

Jeff Juel, forest policy director for Friends of the Clearwater (FOC) said, “The state of Idaho has not earned the trust of the American public to manage forests while preserving old growth, assuring wildlife populations are robust and healthy, or maintaining hunting and fishing opportunities.… They are, on the other hand, experts at clearcutting and making state lands resemble a war zone.”

Climate Change and Wildfire

Trump’s order called for “forest management and wildfire risk reduction projects” to “save American lives and communities.” Yet none of the administration’s orders even gave lip service to the overwhelming preponderance of evidence that climate change is the main driver of more severe wildfire that has resulted in the destruction of whole communities in the west in recent years, including parts of Los Angeles.

Dominick DellaSala, chief scientist with Wild Heritage, whose stated mission is to protect and restore forests and safeguard biocultural diversity around the world, told Truthout that Trump’s policies are “a double whammy on the climate. By beginning the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, they’re going to continue to drill for fossil fuels and increase our emissions to the atmosphere. At the same time, they’re talking about an executive order that would increase logging on 280 million acres of forests across the U.S., bypassing the nation’s … landmark environmental laws, even the Endangered Species Act.”

DellaSala led an international team of scientists in doing the first nationwide mapping of mature and old-growth forests in the U.S. Their analysis found these forests sequester 9 percent of the nation’s total emissions.

“These big, fast-moving fires are the combination of extreme fire weather caused by anthropogenic climate change interacting with heavily logged landscapes. So it’s that double whammy again, by doing more logging and contributing to more emissions, you have a feedback on fire weather over the long run, that’s what’s really driving these big fires,” DellaSala told Truthout. “The latest climate attribute models are showing now that we can explain a lot of the causality around these big fires because of the increase in spring and summertime temperatures, especially heat domes, high winds and extreme droughts.”

As the Trump administration cited wildfire mitigation as a reason to increase logging to “save communities” from wildfire, it was busy axing programs, agencies and employees who were researching or seeking ways to combat the climate crisis driving increased wildfire. Trump also declared an “energy emergency” justifying elimination of government environmental regulations on energy production.

Wildfire Science and “Mitigation”

A growing body of knowledge in fire ecology understands wildfire is a natural phenomenon that ecosystems have evolved in relation to. Trees and plants have evolved strategies for flourishing with fire — such as conifers which have serotinous cones that require fire to open them so seeds are distributed.

Fire plays a key role in ecosystem restoration. It is increasingly understood among fire ecologists that a century of fire suppression in the U.S. has failed, and has been damaging in preventing fire from playing its role in maintaining forest health.

Traditionally, Indigenous cultures in the U.S. burned the landscape to control larger, more dangerous wildfires and to generate better growing conditions for native plants they harvested. Cultural burning is credited by most scientists as well as tribes with helping maintain healthy forest ecosystems and biodiversity.

A member of the Karuk tribe in California told CalMatters “Fire, for us, is not just a tool — it’s a lifeline, a means of renewal, and a vital part of our culture.” Indigenous burning was suppressed in California and in the U.S. as a whole in the 19th century by the government as part of destruction of Native culture, theft of land and genocide.

Wildland fire is a very complex phenomenon. Different types of forests have very different fire regimes. Degrees of fire intensity differ greatly between forests and even within forests of the same general type, depending on rainfall, climate, and other factors. Historically, fire intensity varied, even within forest patches.

Decades of fire suppression by the USFS has led to a buildup of denser forests in some western dry forests. In the era of climate crisis, this has contributed to more intense and widespread fires. There is basic agreement among scientists on the role of climate change as a prime driver that must be addressed. Many agree on the need to curtail fire suppression in the backcountry to help restore the natural function of fire on the landscape. Steps here include allowing certain backcountry fires to burn and to increase prescribed burning, especially during seasons of lower fire risk.

There’s also a clear need to develop programs for home hardening, vegetation clearing near structures and better escape plans for threatened communities.

But the science on using mechanical thinning of forests to manage wildfire is not settled. There is ongoing debate about how effective it is at lowering the severity of wildfire or its threat to communities. Disagreements remain over the degree and type of thinning that should occur, where and when it should be done if at all, if it should only be undertaken in tandem with prescribed burning and whether it is beneficial or harmful to the ecosystem.

Scientists do in general agree that if done, thinning should focus on dry forests, removing smaller trees and protecting more fire-resilient older and mature trees. A USFS study showed that older forests that have been protected from logging to preserve nesting area for the northern spotted owl under the NWFP can act as “fire refugia,” burning at lower intensity than surrounding landscape. A 2016 study in Ecosphere showed forests with high levels of protection from logging in dry and mixed-conifer forests burn with lower intensity than unprotected forests or those subjected to logging, even though they generally contain more forest biomass.

Forest Service Fuel Treatment

No matter the scientific debate, the reality is that over recent decades, government policy has largely continued to rely on fire suppression. This strategy has failed to lower the risks to communities or to save forested ecosystems. At the same time, the USFS has, in recent years, begun to use thinning and prescribed burning on hundreds of thousands of acres of land each year and has plans for tens of millions more.

Environmental groups that are watching this on the ground say some mitigation projects have been done more judiciously and can be helpful, but now a great deal of USFS projects are just clear-cutting of forests to produce revenue for timber companies.

Karen Coulter of Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project (BMDP), which works to protect and restore the ecosystems of the Blue Mountains and Eastern Oregon Cascades, told Truthout she has been monitoring public lands in eastern Oregon and southwest Washington for 33 years. She said in the 1990s, average timber sales were smaller-scale, legitimate commercial thinning. “Sometimes I could agree with it. Because it was thinning from below, and it wasn’t hacking down the large trees and so forth. It was more reasonable. Now it’s virtual clear-cutting, much more intense logging, and it’s on a landscape scale.”

BMDP’s website has many photos of USFS projects termed “free selection,” “commercial” thinning or “understory removal” in the Malheur and Umatilla National Forests that are essentially clear-cuts. Everything is mowed down. Some of these include old-growth trees.

Right now, the organization is contesting a USFS project in an Inventoried Roadless Area, (public lands without roads that have high conservation value), that includes Walla Walla, Washington’s, municipal watershed and old-growth trees. They say logging here could cause damage to water quality for the city and streams that support threatened salmon, steelhead and bull trout.

Nick Cady is the legal director with Cascadia Wildlands (CW) in Eugene, Oregon. CW works to defend and restore wild ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest. Cady told Truthout that another issue is often Forest Service proposals are turned over to timber companies to execute, giving them leeway. Meanwhile, he said the BLM is “just logging as much as they can.”

Cady said of USFS “mitigation” proposals, “If you log to maximize value, you dramatically increase fire risk. That is what the data on the ground has shown time and time again…. So if you say you’re going to maximize logging to improve fire, it’s just not real.”

USFS did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

In Montana, the Alliance For The Wild Rockies recently sued and stopped a USFS project planning to cut and burn 15,000-45,000 acres covering the whole eastern side of the Bitterroot National Forest over 20 years, claiming “categorical exclusions” from protecting threatened species.

The amount of timber sold from logging USFS lands in the U.S. from 2014 to 2023 has varied between 2.8 and 3.2 billion board feet a year. Expanding timber production by 25 percent would increase sales to 3.75 billion board feet a year from its current 2024 level of around 3 billion board feet.

Internal USFS documents obtained by WildEarth Guardians (WEG) show top officials under both Trump and former President Joe Biden have pressured foresters to streamline the process for timber sales. At a June 2017 meeting, the USFS leadership team for the Pacific Northwest said the head of USFS was calling to “increase our restoration activities” so as to “increase acres treated and volume output as a consequence.”

USFS has also been undertaking plans to revamp the NWFP in ways that would increase the cut of older trees. One proposal would, among other things, change the age of trees protected in wet forest Late Successional Reserves from 80 to 120 years, opening up 824,000 acres to logging. WEG says this would “eviscerate the entire concept of [the reserves] which were originally intended to provide large blocks of older forests for species like the northern spotted owl.”

What’s Next?

The Trump regime now threatens to worsen the devastation of some of our most important older forests, gutting the most fire-resilient ecosystems, increasing the threat of climate change and more dangerous wildfire. It does so while slashing environmental protections across the board and gutting key agencies and programs that offer some protection to humans and the planet.

Cady and Coulter both told Truthout that the regime is going to run into all kinds of problems with accomplishing their plan — shuttered lumber mills, previous legal decisions against timber interests in court and real difficulties with the process of designing these sales after firing thousands of forest service employees.

Cady said Cascadia Wildlands has “a massive body of supporters” that can be mobilized to act regardless of decisions in the courts. He said, “People live here, they don’t want massive amounts of logging.”

In cooperation with court challenges and active public engagement by these and other groups, forest defense efforts including active tree sits have increasingly jumped off in Pacific Northwest forests recently. These include two tree sits in southern Oregon on BLM land, one of which helped precipitate a court ruling canceling logging in the Poor Windy Project in May 2024. Another tree sit has just begun to protect legacy forest on Department of Natural Resource land in Washington State near the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula.

Coulter said what Trump’s order is attempting “would be illegal and challenged in court, but the problem is their strategy seems to be that they could wrench these destructive timber sales through first before there’s any final legal outcome. And this is kind of what they’re doing, is wrecking everything as fast as they can, dismantling the agencies,” she said. “We need to raise the profile of the forest defense movement…. We need to raise the profile of forests, along with everything else that they’re targeting.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-1355168071-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-05-18 05:01:40.690782

AP National Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency came under bipartisan criticism Wednesday over his agency’s actions to cancel billions of dollars in congressionally approved spending to address chronic pollution in minority communities and jump-start clean energy programs across the country.

Nearly 800 grants were awarded by former President Joe Biden’s administration under the 2022 climate law, which directed the EPA to spend $3 billion on grants to help low-income and minority communities improve their air and water and protect against climate change. The law allocated another $20 billion under a so-called green bank program to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects nationwide.

Funding for both programs was abruptly terminated by the Trump administration in actions that Democrats have denounced as illegal and unconstitutional.

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has illegally withheld, or impounded, climate-law funding despite a decades-old law that explicitly prohibits such actions by the executive branch. Repeated court rulings, including by the Supreme Court, support the power of Congress to set federal spending levels.

Zeldin’s budget maneuvers “endanger communities by making it harder to address pollution and climate chaos,” Merkley said at a hearing Wednesday.

Varied approaches to questioning the EPA chief

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, chair of a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the environment, also criticized Zeldin, saying funding freezes approved by his agency — including to grants intended for rural communities in Alaska — were “somewhat indiscriminate.""

Murkowski questioned whether severe budget cuts proposed by President Donald Trump were “serious.” Many of the proposals, such as an 88% cut to a state revolving fund for clean water, are likely to be reversed by Congress, she said.

The EPA’s approach under Zeldin is “problematic,” Murkowski added. “EPA has not adhered to our guidelines and has been largely unresponsive to questions,"" she said.

Zeldin told Murkowski she has a special phone number for his office and can call him any time.

His exchanges with Democrats were less friendly.

“So you understand that when you impound funds, you’re violating the law?"" Merkley asked Zeldin, a former New York congressman who took over at EPA in January.

“No, Senator, we are going to follow all statutory obligations,’’ Zeldin replied. “We absolutely disagree with you very strongly.’’

Asked under what authority the money was being withheld, Zeldin cited “policy priorities” under Trump that differ from Biden-era views.

“But it wasn’t the Biden administration that passed this law. It was Congress,’’ Merkley shot back. ”And so, this is in the law as written, and it’s signed by the president, and yet you’re defying it.’’

Zeldin said he rejected Merkley’s premise, adding, ""We couldn’t possibly disagree more strongly with what you’re saying.’’

If he can’t follow his oath of office, Zeldin should resign, Merkley said, a suggestion Zeldin immediately rejected.

Accused of trying to ‘burn it down’

Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state said Zeldin and Trump shared an approach when it comes to EPA: ""Burn it down.’’

Money being withheld by EPA would pay for things like heat pumps to reduce energy costs and pollution, wildfire preparedness and infrastructure upgrades to protect drinking water from floods and earthquakes, Murray said. ""Blocking this funding is hurting communities everywhere,’’ she said.

Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff asked Zeldin why he had canceled a $19.8 million grant to Thomasville, Georgia, to replace a wastewater collection system and build a community health clinic.

“Is a new health clinic for Thomasville woke?” Ossoff asked, noting that the grant was approved under an environmental justice program the EPA has terminated.

Zeldin again cited policy priorities before Ossoff, a Democrat, cut him off. ""You hurt my constituents,’’ he said.

Zeldin later said grants to Thomasville and towns in Alaska and Washington state may be restored if language about environmental justice and diversity is removed, in accordance with an executive order by Trump.

Zeldin declined to provide specific goals for EPA staffing under his tenure, but appeared to acknowledge claims by Merkley and Murray that staff totals could return to a level last seen under former President Ronald Reagan. The EPA had fewer than 11,000 employees in 1983, compared to more than 15,100 in 2024.

The failed US administration is pulling every lever it can to keep the promises it made to the fossil fuel companies that paid to get it elected. EV purchase incentives? Gone. Level 3 charging infrastructure? Kaput. Tax credits for companies that manufacture batteries? History. Production credits for critical materials? Forget about it. The oilygarchs paid to get their guy elected and now they are cashing in. As a result, you might think the EV revolution in the US is over, but you would be wrong.

The latest Global EV Survey from the IEA shows the US is clearly falling behind virtually every other country when it comes to adopting electric cars, but there still were more EVs sold in America last year than the year before — although, admittedly, the percentage change was small. Now JD Power is out with its latest EV survey, which finds that the same amount of Americans — about 25 percent — are considering buying or leasing an EV this year as last year. Is that a big deal? It may not seem so at first, but when you consider all the negativity about EVs coming from the MAGAlomaniacs, it is good news.

In a press release on May 15 announcing the results of the survey, Brent Gruber, the executive director of the EV practice at JD Power, said, “Despite the market volatility, EVs have found a solid ground for consumer consideration. To further capitalize on that interest and spur adoption moving forward, the industry needs to have products that meet consumer needs and wants at prices that are affordable. Additionally, the industry should better educate consumers about EV ownership to ease concerns — many of which, such as those related to public charging, are less problematic than they might seem when it comes to actually owning an EV.”

Thanks for that, Ben. In fact, CleanTechnica has a whole section of its website that is devoted to educating people about charging and range concerns. Just a few days ago, we published an article about EV charging and range that was designed to answer some of the common questions people who have not yet made the move to battery-powered vehicles often have.

The JD Power survey found potential customers were a little less concerned about purchase price and cost of ownership this year than they were last year, but the perceived lack of charging infrastructure was still a concern for more than half of the people who participated in the survey. Younger people were more interested in buying an EV, while older Americans were less so.

“Much of the recent growth in the EV space has been fueled by products from mass market brands, which demonstrates the pent-up demand for more affordable products,” Gruber said. People in the Midwest are least enthusiastic about driving an EV, which Gruber attributes to concerns about cold weather charging and loyalty to traditional automakers.

Toyota C-HR EV Returns As AWD EV

Toyota has gotten fairly poor reviews for its inelegantly named bZ4X, which has been updated and is now simply called the bZ. (It’s still a stupid name.) Toyota announced recently it is bringing back the C-HR — a model that was quietly withdrawn from the US market a while ago due to poor sales. Now the model name is being resurrected for 2026, but the new car will be a battery electric with AWD, 338 hp, and a range of about 290 miles from a 67 kWh battery. That is pretty good, if true. The Chevy Bolt with the 65 kWh battery has a range of 265 miles. It will be interesting to see what the official EPA rating is when the car goes on sale.

The new C-HR shares the same e-TNGA platform used by the bZ. Toyota claims the C-HR will sprint to 60 mph in 5.0 seconds. It will have an 11 kW onboard charger, a NACS charge port, and a peak charging rate of 150 kW. Does that make the C-HR a standout? No, it does not, but it makes it a competent electric car that is little bit smaller than the bZ snd shares much of its interior with the larger model. Car and Driver says it should start at around $35,000, with the upmarket XSE trim beginning at around $38,000.

Affordable SC01 Sports EV Introduced In China

Have you ever dreamed of an affordable battery electric sports car that is about the size of Mazda MX5 (Miata)? If so, the JMEV SC01 introduced recently in China may be just what you are looking for. Backed by Xiaomi, the SC01 is similar in size to the Lotus Exige. The tube frame sports car solves the battery weight problem by stacking the battery behind the seats, much the way the Fiat X 1/9 or Lamborghini Miura placed the engine in those cars to achieve a nearly 50/50 weight distribution. The SC01 is actually an inch or so lower than the Miata and the seats are as low as possible in the chassis, thanks to the battery pack not being mounted beneath the floor as it is in most EVs.

The best part is that the SC01 will sell for the equivalent of $31,000 in China, according to InsideEVs, which claims the sporty EV will weigh just over 3,000 pounds (1,365 kg). It will have two electric motors, one for each rear wheel, with a combined output of 429 hp (320 kW). With its 60 kW NMC battery, the car is expected to have a range of 323 miles (520 km) as measured by the Chinese test cycle. Check out the video below for more about the SC01.

Hyundai To Manufacture EVs In Saudi Arabia

Finally in EV news from around the world today, Hyundai Motor Manufascturing Middle East announced in a press release on May 14, 2025, that its joint venture between PIF — the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — and Hyundai Motor Company has begun construction of the King Salman Automotive Cluster within King Abdullah Economic City.

PIF owns a 70% stake in HMMME, with Hyundai holding the remaining 30%. The manufacturing plant, Hyundai’s first facility in the Middle East, will roll out its first vehicle by the fourth quarter of 2026 and will have an annual production of 50,000 vehicles, including both conventional and electric vehicles. The partnership is one in a series of PIF initiatives designed to establish Saudi Arabia as a global automotive presence. Lucid also manufacturers its Air electric sedan in King Abdullah Economic City.

Wongyun Park, Vice President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Middle East, emphasized that HMMME is driving change and paving the way for a new industrial future in the region. “The facility will become a platform for growth and industrial excellence in the heart of the Kingdom.” Electrive reports the Lucid Air is assembled in Saudi Arabia from semi-knock-down kits manufactured at the Lucid factory in Arizona. There is no word on whether Hyundai will follow a similar strategy.

That completes our survey of EV news from around the world for today. What have we learned? Simply this: Despite the pigheaded policies of those in the US who want to drag the country backward into the 19th century, the EV Revolution is gaining momentum everywhere, even in America. Maybe it is taking a little longer to reach the tipping point many of us would like to see, but it is happening nonetheless. The future of transportation is electric, despite the best efforts of the fossil fuel industry and its stooges in government to hold back progress for one more month, one more week, and one more day.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Toyota-C-HR.png,N,,2025-05-17 22:59:55.193106

Prior to April, the six-month average was 7.4% of average transaction price.
Brand that led average transaction prices at $114,000 At General Motors, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands all posted higher average transaction prices in April compared with March, with little change to incentives, Cox reported.
April was the best sales month this year for both brands, pushing the overall industry average transaction price higher.","The average transaction price for new vehicles in April reached $48,699, a 2.5% increase from March and a 1.1% increase from April 2024.

Incentives offered by automakers decreased to their lowest point since the summer of 2024 as demand surged.

While tariffs on imported vehicles and parts are being implemented, some automakers are adjusting sticker prices, while others are holding steady for now.

As car buyers rush to get in front of tariffs — which are widely expected to boost sticker prices — the flood of demand has been pushing new vehicle prices ever higher, with the trend unlikely to stop any time soon, experts said.

In Cox Automotive's Auto Market Report published May 13, Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said the trend of rising prices continues into May.

“May so far looks like a continuation of April, with urgency to buy diminishing, but the retail vehicle market and the U.S. economy both holding up relatively well,"" Smoke said.

The job market is ""good enough so far,"" but hiring is slowing, Smoke said, noting that borrowing money to buy a car is getting more expensive. He said the number of low-interest rate deals has decreased by 7 percentage points year-over-year, with interest-free loans also declining.

Smoke's remarks come on the heels of a report from Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book published May 12 showed the average transaction price for new vehicles in April surged 2.5% to $48,699 compared with March. Prices rose 1.1% compared with April 2024. Cox said it was the strongest April sales since 2021.

The buying frenzy meant automakers did not have to offer big discounts. Cox said new-vehicle sales incentives fell to about $3,262, or 6.7% of the average transaction price. That's down from 7% of the average transaction price in March. Cox said incentives were at the lowest point since the summer of 2024. Prior to April, the six-month average was 7.4% of average transaction price.

'Pricing landscape is varied'

On April 3, President Donald Trump put a 25% tariff — the tax an importer pays on a good when it crosses international borders — on all imported vehicles to encourage more U.S. manufacturing.

Trump was set to then enact 25% tariffs on all imported parts starting May 3. But on April 29, the administration modified the tariffs on foreign auto parts. In a complex formula, the executive orders Trump signed will now allow automakers to be reimbursed for some of those tariffs for the next two years to give them time to find domestically sourced parts.

Still, a Michigan economics group, calculating tariff impact, has estimated that the least-impacted vehicles will still face a $2,000 tariff-induced price hike and the most impacted will see a $15,000 impact.

Cox Executive Analyst Erin Keating explained that new car prices are rising on the heavy demand to get the goods before manufacturer's suggested retail prices go sky high to offset carmaker's tariffs costs.

“Ever since President Trump announced auto tariffs 47 days ago, the cost of new cars has been steadily climbing,"" Keating said. ""Even though there was a surge in shopping and sales early on, the manufacturer’s suggested retail prices haven’t budged. The pricing landscape is varied depending on the automaker, car segment and specific models — some are cutting incentives, others are in high demand, and the supply isn’t evenly distributed across the board.”

Here's how it played out in April

Ford Motor Co. has been running a national employee-pricing program that started in early April and runs through July 6. The Dearborn-based automaker is relying on a message of “holding prices steady” and touting its “built in America” leadership.

Cox said Ford brand prices and incentives in April were mostly unchanged from March with one standout: The Maverick pickup, which Ford assembles in Mexico, saw lower prices in April. Ford's incentive spending on the Maverick increased to an all-time high of 6.6% of average transaction prices on record monthly sales of 20,183 Mavericks sold in April, Cox said.

In early May, Ford said it is hiking prices on three of its Mexico-produced models effective May 2, becoming one of the first major automakers to adjust sticker prices in response to tariffs. Prices on the Mustang Mach-E all-electric SUV, Maverick and Bronco Sport will increase by as much as $2,000 on some models.

Brand that led average transaction prices at $114,000

At General Motors, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands all posted higher average transaction prices in April compared with March, with little change to incentives, Cox reported. Buick, however, saw lower prices and higher incentives in April.

Import brands Acura and BMW also held prices lower and increased incentive spending last month compared with March.

In the ultraluxury segment, sales of Porsche and Land Rover models accelerated in April because both brands will face higher future costs given 100% of their vehicles are imported, Cox noted. The average transaction price for Porsche led the industry in April at above $114,000, with Land Rover just behind at $113,000. April was the best sales month this year for both brands, pushing the overall industry average transaction price higher.

Car buyers even flocked to all-electric vehicles last month. The Kelley Blue Book team initially estimates new EV prices in April to be $59,255, a 3.7% increase from the year-ago period and a 0.2% increase compared with March. Cox said the March EV average transaction price was revised lower to $59,132.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/10/PDTF/83033073007-041025-dfp-car-iventory-rg-01.jpg?crop=2399,1351,x0,y140&width=2399&height=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-17 21:04:35.527526

Dodge will launch gas-powered Chargers later this year.

Dodge is pulling the plug, so to speak, on its base model electric Charger Daytona, the R/T, as it deals with slow sales, but don’t expect what appears to be a limited-edition run of vehicles to turn into collector’s items, according to a key industry watcher.

“Rarity does not make a collectible. You need to have demand for it,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions. “You can’t presume that this will be a Charger Daytona of 1970. They couldn’t sell those originally and years later they were collectible.”

Fiorani said it’s risky to bet on a car of today becoming something that brings big dollars in the years to come, even when the numbers of those made and sold are relatively small.

Still, Dodge will continue to offer the more powerful and expensive electric Charger Daytona Scat Pack for the upcoming model year, even as it prepares to launch several gas-powered versions.

While it’s not clear how many Dodge Charger Daytonas will be produced this year, so far the sales picture is showing a fairly light impact. Electric Charger sales — the company did not distinguish between versions — for the first three months of this year were at 1,947. Granted, they were just beginning to arrive in showrooms in January after months of delays.

However, the automaker likely had higher hopes. Fiorani noted that he’d recently driven by a Dodge dealership and saw a row of Chargers waiting to be sold.

In a statement, Dodge CEO Matt McAlear said “production of the Dodge Charger Daytona R/T is postponed for the 2026 model year as we continue to assess the effects of U.S. tariff policies. The Charger’s flexible, multi-energy STLA Large platform allows us to focus on the Charger Daytona Scat Pack’s performance as the world’s quickest and most powerful muscle car, add the new four-door model to the Charger mix for the 2026 model year and lean into the new Charger SIXPACK models that will launch in the second half of the year.”

Sixpack refers to the engine, the inline-six Hurricane, which will come in 550-horsepower or 420-horsepower variants.

The current electric Scat Pack promises a peak power base of 630 horsepower with a limited push-button burst to 670 horsepower called the Power Shot. The Dodge website lists the Scat Pack all-wheel drive with a starting price of $73,985, excluding destination charge.

Adding gas-powered versions to the lineup is not a surprise, as Dodge had previously said that was the plan. However, the decision, reported earlier by MoparInsiders.com, to end the electric R/T’s run so soon does highlight how the market has changed, both in terms of the slower adoption of electric vehicles and President Donald Trump’s embrace of tariffs. The Charger Daytona is assembled at the Windsor Assembly Plant in Ontario, but the batteries initially were to come from South Korea.

Fiorani offered some perspective on the potential tariff impact, however.

“Everybody is leaning on tariffs for every change in production or sales, whether real or not,” he said.

Market realities are, however, what they are.

“The idea that an internal combustion engine version would hit the market better at the moment is a strong one,” according to Fiorani. “Buyers haven’t warmed up to EVs as a performance vehicle yet, especially since every EV is a performance model now.”

Fiorani noted also that the company's planned shift in production volume toward the gas-powered Charger would also take the focus off the less expensive EV version — the R/T was listed with a starting price of $59,595, not counting destination.

“(They) kind of want to focus on the vehicle that will make money versus the entry-level models that will sell on price,” Fiorani said.

The moves for Dodge follow news that Ram is also adjusting its electric plans. Crain's Detroit Business, citing a memo to suppliers, reported this week that the electric Ram 1500 REV would be delayed until summer 2027, a year later than what the automaker told the Free Press in January, and the extended range Ramcharger is being pushed from later this year to early next year.

The company, in a statement provided by spokesman Nick Cappa, cited ""slowing consumer demand for half-ton"" battery electric pickups and noted that ""we also are extending the quality validation period for the Range Extended Ram to support a successful launch and the highest build quality.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/12/07/PDTF/76839718007-img-2572.jpeg?crop=5711,3213,x0,y535&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-17 21:04:39.963638

The EPA is expected to be given powers to impose stiff penalties on companies caught breaking environmental laws.

“We did go to the election, committing and recommitting, in fact, to having an independent EPA, and we need such a body with teeth,” Mr Watt told Sky News Sunday Agenda.

“But in terms of the details around the model of that, that is something that I'll be consulting on.

“I think it's a little premature for me to be making those kind of decisions before I've had an opportunity to meet with a range of interest groups on this.”

Former environment minister Tanya Plibersek had negotiated the legislation in 2024 before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese scrapped the deal.

The government then went into the federal election promising to establish the EPA once more.

Mr Watt said the early contact he has made with business, mining and environment groups showed “goodwill” on behalf of stakeholders.

“Our current environmental laws aren't working for the environment or the business community,” he said.

“The groups that I've been speaking with from across the spectrum agree with that. They agree that change needs to be made.”

However, the opposition has strongly criticised the lack of detail in Labor’s environmental reform agenda.

In a statement issued on Saturday, shadow environment minister Jonno Duniam said Mr Watt “needs to tell Australia exactly how he intends to reform the broken EPBC Act”.

“It’s a bit rich for the new Environment Minister to demand that the Opposition support their laws without providing one skerrick of detail,” he said.

Hopefully, Bollinger doesn't meet the same fate as Fisker and other recent startups, but it's not looking good.","A U.S. district judge has granted former Bollinger owner and CEO Robert Bollinger's request to put his former company into court receivership after its new owners failed to come to a meeting regarding an unpaid loan between the two parties, which is only the latest in a long string of disasters for the once-promising commercial electric truckmaker.

The company initially planned to produce the B1 pickup and B2 SUV, but its boxy creations have not seen the success of Rivian's R1T and R1S, despite being much simpler. They didn't even make production, so Bollinger pivoted to commercialization to survive, but even that doesn't appear to be enough to stop it from circling the drain.

Bollinger's History In Brief

Robert Bollinger founded the company 11 years ago in New York with a plan to produce a body-on-frame electric truck and SUV clearly inspired by and modeled in the style of the original Land Rover Defender off-roader. A few years in, the company realized it should move to Detroit, Michigan, and it eventually dropped plans for its smaller SUV and truck in favor of larger commercial vehicles it dubbed the B4 and longer-wheelbase B5. Bollinger then left the company as CEO 11 months ago after he sold it to new owner Mullen Automotive Inc., which has since reported a $115 million net loss on revenue of $2.9 million in Q4 of last year.

Then The Trouble Started

Bollinger sued Mullen over an unpaid $10 million loan agreement in March, and when the company failed to send a representative to a meeting in May, the judge sided with the former CEO. ""A receiver is in charge of the company,"" Robert Bollinger told Automotive News. ""The main goal is to sell the company as a going concern. Most of the assets are in my possession,"" he said. Mullen must propose a deadline for a liquidation plan within 30 days now. All of Bollinger Motors' assets have been frozen, and Mullen no longer manages day-to-day operations for the company.

""Mullen did an amazing job of funding us and getting us to where we are,"" Bollinger said. ""There’s a lot of interest in the product, and the best possible outcome is for the company to continue as it is.""

There Are Not Many Bollinger EVs Out There Yet

So far, Bollinger Motors has reportedly only built 40 Class 4 so-called B4 commercial vehicles, a majority of which have reportedly not been sold and are sitting at the company's headquarters in Michigan. They retail for around $135,000 with an all-electric range of around 185 miles. So far, $148 million has been invested in the startup, about $3 million of which was granted from the state of Michigan. The automaker currently has 100 employees, and the former CEO reportedly has personally guaranteed their incomes will be sustained in the near term while the company gets sorted.

In the lawsuit, the county sought damages to cover costs associated with climate change, including repairs to infrastructure damaged by increasingly severe storms and flooding.
At an hours-long hearing in March, attorneys for the fossil fuel companies argued that the county lacked standing to bring such claims in county court.
“Is it bigger than this little old judge in Bucks County?” Corr joked during the hearing.
“It’s about Bucks County surviving it.” The Bucks County Commissioners voted in January 2024 to hire the DiCello Levitt law firm on a contingency basis to pursue potential environmental claims.","Bucks County Court of Common Pleas Judge Stephen Corr has dismissed Bucks County government’s lawsuit against major fossil fuel companies.

The ruling was issued late Friday and brings a halt to the county’s efforts to hold a number of major companies financially responsible for climate change-related damages in the county.

Bucks County filed the lawsuit in March 2024 and alleged that organizations, including Shell, BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and the American Petroleum Institute, were aware of the climate impacts of fuel products but engaged in a decades-long campaign to mislead the public.

In the lawsuit, the county sought damages to cover costs associated with climate change, including repairs to infrastructure damaged by increasingly severe storms and flooding. The county has seen a number of serious flooding incidents in recent years, including the deaths of seven people in Upper Makefield Township.

At an hours-long hearing in March, attorneys for the fossil fuel companies argued that the county lacked standing to bring such claims in county court.

“Is it bigger than this little old judge in Bucks County?” Corr joked during the hearing.

In his decision, Corr sided with the fossil fuel companies’ arguments for dismissal.

The judge stated that “Pennsylvania cannot apply its own laws to claims dealing with air in its ambient or interstate aspects.” He concluded that the court lacked the necessary jurisdiction to hear the case.

The judge’s ruling aligns with the companies’ argument that there have been juridical challenges in similar cases across the country.

Theodore J. Boutrous, Jr., counsel for Chevron Corporation, issued a statement Saturday morning after reviewing the decision.

“As Judge Corr declared, his decision joins the ‘growing chorus of state and federal courts across the United States, singing from the same hymnal,’ concluding the ‘our federal structure does not allow Pennsylvania law, or any State’s law, to address’ climate change lawsuits. The court also got it right when it expressed ‘concern about the manner in which the Commissioners went about hiring counsel and filing this lawsuit,’ and found that ‘the conduct of the Commissioners violated the spirit of’ Pennsylvania’s open government act,” Boutrous said.

Beyond the jurisdictional issue, Corr also expressed “concern about the manner in which the commissioners went about hiring counsel and filing this lawsuit,” finding that their conduct “violated the spirit of Pennsylvania’s open government act,” known as the Sunshine Act.

In his written decision, Corr called the hiring of the law firm a “cryptic summary” of the agenda and noted the lack of public discussion or commissioner comment on it prior to the filing.

The judge stated that the lawsuit’s focus was primarily on “emissions,” a matter he deemed to be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government through the Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). He noted the frequent use of the word “emissions” in the complaint compared to the terms “deceptive” or “deception.”

Corr’s decision noted that the claims raised by Bucks County were “so intertwined with emissions” that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. He emphasized that “our federal structure does not allow Pennsylvania’s law, or any state’s law, to address the claims raised in Bucks County’s complaint.”

A county spokesperson declined comment Saturday morning on the decision.

Dan Flynn, an attorney for the county, said during the March hearing that the case was similar to those against big tobacco.

“It’s not about solving climate change,” Flynn said. “It’s about Bucks County surviving it.”

The Bucks County Commissioners voted in January 2024 to hire the DiCello Levitt law firm on a contingency basis to pursue potential environmental claims. The vote, part of a consent agenda, was approved by all three commissioners, two Democrats and one Republican.

Republican Commissioner Gene DiGirolamo initially supported the lawsuit.

DiGirolamo spoke in support at the 2024 press conference announcing the lawsuit. However, he later stated he “would like to withdraw my support for the lawsuit.”

Wisconsin Public Radio, © Copyright 2025, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.","The Environmental Protection Agency awarded more than $12.4 million in brownfield grants to Wisconsin communities Friday for cleaning up and redeveloping contaminated sites.

The EPA said it’s part of $267 million awarded nationwide to transform polluted sites into housing and business developments to promote economic growth. The move comes as the agency has halted funds for environmental justice and climate work and reorganizes as part of cost-cutting measures by the Trump administration.

“EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

The Trump administration has sought to rein in more than two dozen environmental regulations in favor of oil and gas projects, saying it lowers costs for Americans and businesses.

EPA Regional Administrator Anne Vogel said the grants will protect public health and the environment “while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.”

The money will go to nine local, state and tribal entities. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Milwaukee Redevelopment Authority and city of West Allis will receive between $650,000 and $3 million in supplemental money for revolving loan funds to finance redevelopment projects.

In Milwaukee, the city’s redevelopment authority will use $650,000 to fund cleanups at the Compass Lofts, the Tempo Hotel and the Historic Patterson Place. The agency will also receive $500,000 for cleaning up a site that’s being leased by the nonprofit Jewish Community Center for a food pantry. The money will be used to clean up the site and a 50,000-square-foot warehouse that’s contaminated with volatile organic compounds.

Six other communities and the Oneida Nation will receive anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million to conduct environmental assessments or cleanups. They include the cities of Kenosha, Racine and Brillion.

The move comes as Zeldin has said the EPA canceled $1.7 billion in grants as part of efforts by the Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency to slash funding, programs and the federal workforce.

Trump has also proposed cutting the agency’s 2026 budget by more than half and cutting staff to levels not seen since the Reagan administration. Environmental advocates have said that will affect the agency’s ability to address contaminated sites.

Early on, the versatile internal combustion engine overtook the venerable horse and buggy. Later, the automatic transmission revolutionized motoring by largely replacing the manual gearbox, and all the steps it took to drive. As time progressed, safety features like padded dashboards, crumple zones, three-point seatbelts, and airbags made cars exponentially safer than they were in prior decades. And today, we’re living in another period of great technological transformation as automakers strive to make their vehicles more efficient than they’ve ever been before.

Slowly but surely, vehicle manufacturers are moving away from fossil fuel-burning engines to electric drivetrains. Progress has been irregular, coming in fits and spurts, varying greatly from country to country. But like it or not, personal transportation is going electric, which provides numerous benefits, like greatly reduced maintenance, much improved vehicle refinement, and, of course, vastly better efficiency, though EVs are still not perfect. Batteries are the weak link. They’re staggeringly expensive, can weigh thousands of pounds, and the range even the best packs can provide leaves much to be desired. Addressing these downsides, companies like Toyota are working to develop next-generation solid-state batteries that could revolutionize transportation, just like internal combustion did more than 100 years ago.

In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including Car and Driver, The Harvard Gazette, Renogy, and Oil & Energy Online.

Toyota’s SSB Breakthrough Redefines What EVs Can Do

The benefits of solid-state batteries are numerous and impactful. These power-storage systems promise far greater energy density, which translates into significantly lower weight and dramatically increased vehicle range, the very definition of a win-win. Solid-state batteries can also charge much more quickly, should last far longer, and they even provide greatly enhanced margins of safety as they’re much less likely to catch on fire than existing lithium-ion designs. Solid electrolytes should not be flammable, but liquid or gel ones can ignite.

Promises Up To 745 Miles On A Single Charge – More Than Doubling Most EVs Today

Those are just a few of the reasons why automakers including Honda, the Hyundai Motor Group, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, and, yes, even Toyota, are developing solid-state batteries, but that’s not all. Supplier companies including CATL, LG Energy, Panasonic, Samsung, and many others are all working on this technology, as are researchers at numerous academic institutions.

Highlighting just how massive a leap forward solid-state energy storage technology will be, Toyota said that by the end of this decade it should have developed a battery that will provide a whopping 745 miles of range on a single charge. That’s a staggering amount, more than twice as much as some very good electric vehicles offer today, a huge upgrade, but that’s not the limit, oh no.

The Japanese automaker estimates the second-generation of its solid-state battery design could provide around 932 miles of range. Assuming this sort of energy reservoir doesn’t weigh 47,000 pounds and cost more than a mansion in Malibu, the technology could absolutely revolutionize transportation. Imagine an all-electric Camry or RAV4 that was affordably priced and could travel nearly 1,000 miles on a single charge. The world would be completely changed if Toyota pulled off something like that.

Achieves This With A More Compact, Lightweight Battery Design

Thanks to greater energy density than even the best lithium-ion batteries available today can provide, solid-state packs are significantly lighter and more compact. These improvements will help engineers further enhance vehicle performance and efficiency, as mass is the enemy of acceleration, handling, and braking.

Bulky battery packs eat into passenger and cargo space, but solid-state designs can improve vehicle packaging, too. An example of the efficiencies that can be gained by switching to a solid-state design, Toyota mentioned in a press release that the battery in the bZ4X utility vehicle is around 6 inches tall (150 mm), but in the future, that measurement could be reduced to around 4.7 inches (120 mm), and maybe even 4 inches (100 mm) in a sportier model where a low roof height is desired. That is a significant size reduction, especially if the range offered remains significantly improved. Having a smaller battery pack means there can be more room for passengers and cargo.

Solid-State Chemistry Unlocks Major Advantages

As mentioned above, solid-state batteries provide greater energy density, are safer, last longer, and can charge much faster than lithium-ion packs with liquid or gel electrolytes. As Toyota succinctly summed up in a media release, “Solid-state battery technology is a potential cure-all for the drawbacks facing electric vehicles that run on conventional lithium-ion batteries, including the relatively short distance traveled on a single charge as well as charging times.”

Uses A Solid Electrolyte Instead Of Liquid, Improving Safety And Stability

As the name suggests, solid-state batteries have an electrolyte that is, you guessed it, solid. Opposed to liquid electrolytes, this allows ions to move faster inside the individual battery cells, plus this configuration is much more tolerant of high temperatures and voltages. These important attributes improve longevity and safety, plus they’re key to increasing energy density.

The benefits of this technology are so great, that Toyota is putting enormous resources into commercializing solid-state batteries. In fact, the automaker has been researching this technology since way back in 2012, and as of a couple of years ago, Toyota has been awarded more than 1,000 patents in this field. Undoubtedly, that figure is even greater today, as engineers have continued to work on perfecting this tantalizing but challenging technology.

Enables Faster Charging, Higher Energy Density, And Longer Lifespan

Since solid electrolytes aren’t nearly as flammable, the risk of battery fires is greatly reduced. If a car’s pack ever ignites, it’s an absolute nightmare for firefighters to contend with, requiring thousands upon thousands of gallons of water to extinguish, and even then, there’s a risk that damaged packs could reignite before disposal, for instance.

And if that weren’t bad enough, lithium-ion battery fires also release torrents of acrid – and poisonous – fumes, plus certain lithium-ion chemistries produce oxygen when heated by flames, which just accelerates how quickly these packs burn. The fire hazard is so great, in fact, one safety expert even thinks it’s best to just allow lithium-ion batteries to burn themselves out rather than trying to extinguish the flames.

Aside from concerns around fires, solid-state batteries should last far longer than their conventional counterparts while charging much quicker, too. Reportedly, today’s standard lithium-ion batteries can usually be charged 1,500 to 2,000 times before their usefulness is depleted. Solid-state batteries, however, can survive many times more charging cycles than that, perhaps up to 10,000, a huge difference that highlights the fundamental ruggedness of this design.

Charging Times Could Shrink Dramatically

Since ions can move around much faster within solid-state batteries than in comparable cells made with liquid electrolyte, these packs can charge dramatically quicker. In fact, the speed difference between conventional lithium-ion batteries and solid-state packs is absolutely staggering. This technological breakthrough pretty much eliminates the time difference between recharging a battery and pumping gas into a vehicle’s tank, solid-state is that big a deal.

Toyota Claims Potential 10-Minute Fast Charging With SSB Tech

Just how quickly can one of these fancy new batteries charge? Assuming you can find a DC fast charger that puts out enough juice, Toyota expects its design to go from a 10-percent state of charge to 80 percent in 10 minutes or less. Other estimates put the 0-to-100-percent time at as little as 15 minutes. For context, the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5, one of the fastest-charging EVs available today, can go from a 10-to-80-percent state of charge in around 20 minutes when hooked to an appropriate power source. That means Toyota’s new solid-state battery charges roughly twice as fast, an incredible performance.

Reduces One Of The Biggest Friction Points In EV Ownership

That commendable charging speed makes the ownership experience so much better by addressing perhaps the biggest pain point with electric vehicles. Today, DC fast charging can be anything but. Charging speeds are often significantly reduced if there are other vehicles juicing up at the same time, It’s often difficult to find an available – and more importantly, functional – charger, and it can sometimes be a challenge to find a charger that puts out enough power for your EV. The Ioniq 5 mentioned earlier should top out somewhere around 257 kW. Plugging into a 150-kW charger is not going to provide the best experience, even though that may be all that’s available at certain times.

Of course, solid-state batteries can’t magically address all these issues, but the technology is still a huge upgrade over existing energy-storage systems. And the experience will only get better as public infrastructure expands and improves.

Sets The Bar For The Next Generation Of Electric Vehicles

Today’s crop of electric vehicles is something of a mixed bag. Offerings from the Hyundai Motor Group are phenomenal, as are certain aspects of Teslas. GM and Ford both have some solid, if not quite segment-leading EVs, and then there’s Toyota, which is, unfortunately, behind the curve in electrics. The company’s bZ4X and Lexus RZ utility vehicles are neither compelling nor particularly competitive, but future models could leapfrog the competition if Toyota can commercialize affordable and reliable solid-state batteries.

Could Outperform Traditional Lithium-Ion Batteries In Almost Every Metric

This exciting new energy-storage technology is superior to the lithium-ion batteries available today in nearly every way. Solid-state batteries should last longer, charge faster, provide superior energy density for greater range and lower weight, and they should be significantly safer, too.

Of course, there are a few issues holding back solid-state batteries, problems that Toyota and other researchers are racing address. These batteries tend to be expensive, longevity has been a serious weak point with prototype designs, and there are myriad manufacturing challenges to tackle. The good news is, these problems are being sorted out. In fact, Toyota is aiming to commence limited production of solid-state batteries late this year. Commercial manufacturing could come online by 2027 or 2028, which, in automotive terms, is literally right around the corner, since it usually takes between three and five years to introduce a new vehicle.

Signals A Leap Forward Not Just For Toyota, But The Entire EV Industry

They’re not quite ready to hit the road in meaningful numbers, but solid-state batteries are poised to arrive in short order. It remains to be seen which automaker, supplier company or potentially even academic institution will be the first to commercialize this revolutionary technology, but given the progress it’s made and the statements it’s shared, Toyota could very well be first.

If the Japanese firm crosses the finish line before its competition, Toyota will have a huge advantage in the electric vehicle space, though probably not for long. Other companies will eventually unlock the secrets of solid-state batteries and level the playing field once more, which is not necessarily good news for Toyota, but it’s great for drivers around the world that are looking for more efficient vehicles.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/how-toyota-s-745-mile-ssb-could-set-the-standard-for-the-next-decade.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 23:00:12.604078

The EPA concluded that the requirements of its Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), an emissions-control program, were stringent enough to make compliance with CSAPR a better-than-BART alternative. Consequently, states participating in CSAPR were excused from complying with BART itself. The National Parks Conservation Association and others (conservationists) (plaintiffs) challenged that EPA determination. They argued that because CSAPR was promulgated under a different section of the Clean Air Act, it would take effect regardless of BART. Consequently, the EPA needed to consider the reduction in emissions that would be achieved by CSAPR and BART combined versus the reduction that would be achieved by CSAPR alone to determine whether CSAPR constituted a better-than-BART alternative. In conjunction with adopting the rule amendment, the EPA also disapproved certain state implementation plans (SIPs) that relied on the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), a predecessor to CSAPR that had been overturned. The EPA issued federal implementation plans that would apply in the disapproved states until the states came up with new plans that incorporated CSAPR. Utility Air Regulatory Group, certain states, and others (industry and state parties) challenged the EPA’s disapproval of the SIPs, arguing that even though CAIR itself was no longer effective, if meeting CAIR’s requirements constituted a better-than-BART alternative in prior years, then it must still be considered a better-than-BART alternative.

""We ask for the same consideration for the same reason,"" the petition states, namely, potential contamination of the same sole source aquifer.","A Barnstable group petitioned the EPA to review Avangrid's offshore wind projects due to drinking water concerns.

The petition cites potential threats to the Cape Cod sole source aquifer from substations and underground cables.

The group argues the EPA has legal grounds to intervene under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other regulations.

Save Greater Dowses Beach, a Barnstable-based group with members across Cape Cod and New England, is appealing to the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene in what it sees as a serious threat to the region’s drinking water from offshore wind development.

The organization recently submitted a petition from 37 Barnstable residents. They are asking the agency to conduct an impartial review of Avangrid Renewables’ offshore wind projects, which would bring electrical cables ashore and connect them to large substations in Barnstable.

""Our objections to these cable landings are many, but the danger posed to human health and safety is at the top of our list. That naturally includes protecting the sole source of drinking water for the people of Barnstable and Cape Cod,"" said Susanne Conley, SGDB chairwoman and co-founder.

Avangrid declined to comment on the petition.

Petition questions substation sites on sole source aquifer

The petitioners are specifically questioning the substations in Avangrid's New England Wind 1 and New England Wind 2 projects, formerly Park City Wind and Commonwealth Wind. They say the proposed sites sit on land vital to recharging the Cape Cod Sole Source Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to 250,000 year-round residents — and many more in summer — and are near areas set aside to protect future water sources.

They also express concern about the already completed substation in the industrial park off Industrial Drive in Hyannis, which supports the Vineyard Wind project.

""We’re asking EPA to consider the cumulative environmental hazard of three extra high voltage substations built over the aquifer,"" Conley said, adding the group believes the Vineyard Wind substation ""should never have been built in such close proximity to an apartment complex.""

A plea for 'legally required' federal review

The group argues that the EPA is legally required to review the plans under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, which calls for federal oversight of any project using federal funds that could affect a sole source aquifer.

Even though the wind projects aren't directly funded by the government, the group asserts that they depend on significant federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act to cover about a third of their costs, which top $5 billion. The petition argues that an earlier EPA decision not to intervene was based on an overly limited view of what counts as federal funding and asks the agency to take another look under the current leadership.

The petition also highlights the agency's responsibilities under the Clean Air Act of 1970, as well as its own Sole Source Aquifer program.

“The EPA cannot simply ignore its responsibility under the Sole Source Aquifer Program,” the petition states, pointing out that ""the health and well-being of the residents of Barnstable and the surrounding region of Cape Cod are at stake.""

The petitioners cite ""significant hazard to public health,"" asserting the projects ""all require individual substations that utilize toxic dielectric fluid and potential use of sulfur hexafluoride, of SF6, a toxic greenhouse gas that lingers in the environment.

The developer has said that state-of-the-art containment systems — described publicly as a “bathtub” — would prevent any leaks from getting into the soil or water table. But the petition cites expert testimony warning that fires, explosions, and even truck accidents during transport to and from the substations could cause serious spills that could permanently contaminate the aquifer.

Concerns about heat, toxins, and water quality

The group also worries about the heat that underground high-voltage cables would generate. Engineers say the cables can radiate temperatures up to 180°F, and although they’ll be buried in concrete, they’ll lie at the same depth as Barnstable’s drinking water pipes.

""This has caused serious concerns for the COMM Water Commission, which is currently incommunication with the proponent to determine the extent of thermal effect on the drinkingwater of three of the town’s seven villages,"" such as bacterial growth, according to the petition.

The water commission and the developer are currently negotiating the terms for an independent study to determine how the duct banks may affect water quality, according to the petition.

""This level of uncertainty should be of concern"" to the EPA, the petition states, especially ""given the proponent’s stated desire to begin duct bank construction in the fall of 2025.""

The group further asserts that the overall permitting process for the projects has not treated the town fairly. The state Energy Facilities Siting Board denied the town’s request for “intervenor” status, which would have allowed the town to participate formally in decisions about where the substations would be built.

EPA asked to reconsider scope and precedent

Finally, the petition questions why the EPA did not extend its onshore permitting beyond air quality concerns for offshore operations.

SGDB argues that the EPA stepped in before because of concerns about aquifer contamination — like when a controversial firing range was proposed at Joint Base Cape Cod — and should do so again.

""We ask for the same consideration for the same reason,"" the petition states, namely, potential contamination of the same sole source aquifer.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would gut America’s clean energy production, raising costs for Wisconsin families and killing hundreds of thousands of good-paying manufacturing jobs nationwide. Trump and Republicans promised to lower energy costs. Instead, they are trying to undermine America’s fastest-growing, most affordable energy sources.

Wisconsin has become a solar and grid-scale battery manufacturing hub, with clean energy investments creating tens of thousands of jobs across the state. This Republican bill guts battery manufacturing by imposing impossible red tape and short-changing new and existing battery manufacturers. This bill also effectively repeals tax credits for commercial and utility-scale solar, imposing retroactive tax increases and pulling the rug out from under projects by shortening timelines, adding impossible red tape, and repealing key financing tools. Make no mistake, this bill takes a sledgehammer to Wisconsin’s economy.

The Republican Repeal Bill Will Raise Energy Costs in Wisconsin

• If federal clean energy tax credits are repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, Wisconsin households are expected to see an average increase in energy costs of 5.6% in 2026.

• If clean energy tax credits and key pollution regulations are repealed, Wisconsin households are expected to see an increase in total annual energy costs of $153 in 2030.

• Solar, wind, and battery storage accounted for 93% of all new American energy supply in 2024. Undermining these key energy supplies as demand is skyrocketing would lead to higher energy costs for American families and businesses.

The Republican Repeal Bill Will Kill Jobs and Decimate Manufacturing in Wisconsin

If federal clean energy tax credits are repealed by Trump and congressional Republicans, Wisconsin is expected to lose 5,200 jobs by 2030 and 6,400 jobs by 2035.

Repealing clean energy tax credits would decrease Wisconsin’s GDP by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.1 billion in 2035.

Of the roughly 400,000 new clean energy jobs announced across the country since August 2022, more than half (53%) are located in congressional districts represented by Republicans. Under Congressional Republicans’ plans, all of these jobs are at risk.

Twelve of Wisconsin’s fifteen new clean energy projects are in Republican-held districts, representing 80% of all projects in the state, 96.3% of jobs (2,632), and 45.8% of investments ($2.49 billion).

While some Republicans will attempt to claim that they are simply placing reasonable limitations on these clean energy tax credits, the reality is that they are deliberately making them completely unworkable, with even Senate Republicans such as Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia and Kevin Cramer from North Dakota saying the bill is unreasonable. As SEIA, the primary trade organization for the solar industry, put it: “this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

The moment is now upon us — and the outlook for the IRA after the release of House Republicans’ mega budget bill ranges from bleak to dead, depending on who you ask.

This is just a first draft, and the provisions — including the rollback of key tax credits — are subject to change, likely depending on how effectively members such as Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) push for them (and what happens in the Senate).

Let’s get into it.

The News of the Week: IRA rollback

When Ways & Means Republicans released their portion of the “big, beautiful bill” Monday, clean energy advocates were dismayed. After a lengthy lobbying blitz, Republicans’ approach veered more toward a gutting of the bill — phasing out key credits and hampering the ones that have been preserved — rather than a more fine-tuned one.

Here’s what the bill would do:

Cut two key demand-side credits — 30D, which provides a consumer tax credit for American-sourced electric vehicle purchases, and 25D, a subsidy for rooftop solar — by the end of the year.

Phase down investment and production tax credits starting in 2029, with a full phasedown by 2031. Clean energy advocates were happy to see their tech-neutrality maintained — there were fears that solar, in particular, could be cut out.

Begin to phase down the 45X manufacturing tax credit — a source of financing for critical minerals operations and battery and solar manufacturing — in 2031.

End transferability for tax credits after 2027, a key tool for project financing flexibility that allows companies — many of which do not yet pay taxes or have limited liability because they’re not yet generating income — to sell their tax credits and carry them forward.

Change the eligibility rules for tax credits so that projects must be “placed in service” rather than having begun construction to claim them.

Create a complex web of “foreign entity of concern” provisions, many of which would need to be litigated in rulemaking, that limit companies’ ability to source parts or work with companies that have ownership interests from countries (namely China) that the U.S. has deemed to be national security risks.

The IRA helped create a veritable boom across the country — and in Northern Nevada in particular — in clean energy investment and helped build out U.S. supply chains for renewable parts, many of which had never been manufactured or processed in the U.S. before.

Read more about the IRA’s impact in Nevada, and how an IRA rollback would affect the lithium loop and the solar industry.

In Nevada specifically, the Clean Investment Monitor estimates that companies have announced about $28.3 billion in low-carbon energy investments in the state since the IRA’s passage — which brings jobs and workforce development programs. Of that, $15.4 billion is still unspent. Announced projects that have yet to break ground are the ones that could be most imperiled by the rollback, between the limits on financing and the foreign entity of concern rules, given that some parts and technology do not yet exist outside of China.

“Members of Congress should not be surprised if this bill passes as drafted, and over the next several years, a lot of projects that have been announced that people are excited about are significantly scaled down or do not move forward at all,” said Albert Gore III, the president of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which has lobbied on behalf of tax credits that benefit the electric vehicle and battery supply chain, including for companies in Nevada.

Gore was particularly dismayed by the early phasedown of the manufacturing 45X tax credit and the complete cut of the 30D consumer tax credit. He said that those credits worked in tandem to incentivize automakers to onshore their operations, including sourcing lithium in the U.S.

Nevada, which has the only operating lithium mine in the U.S., has big plans for the critical mineral that exists abundantly in the state and powers EV batteries. Projects such as Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge have received massive federal loans to build mining projects in the state, and have already signed offtake agreements with large automakers.

But industry advocates warn that battery makers and automakers were pursuing American lithium — including Nevada’s — because of the tax credits, which allowed them to source American lithium at a price point that was competitive with foreign-mined and processed lithium.

“I have a hard time thinking that the economic opportunity, the business forecast, the investment forecasts for the lithium loop that that have existed the past couple years in Nevada can endure and continue in the present state, given the demand destruction,” said Harry Godfrey, a managing director at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United.

And even though the most important tax credit to Nevada — the manufacturing 45X credit — was maintained through 2031, Gore cautioned that the early phasedown, the incredibly tight foreign entity of concern provisions and the requirement that projects be in service will hamper future growth, including with announced projects. Mining, refining and manufacturing projects can take a decade, if not longer, to move through permitting and construction phases. Companies may now find the credit — and some of the market demand — gone by the time they’re ready to produce.

And in a macro sense, advocates — and members of Congress — are worried about the bill leading to energy costs rising. The IRA tax credits were intended to allow companies to move more quickly to generate new clean energy to add to the grid and help meet increasing demand. Without that, states may have to rely more on natural gas.

According to a study by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, repealing two key credits (which the Republican bill targeted for early phasedown) could lead to electricity prices being 7.3 percent higher for Nevada households from 2026 to 2032.

Some industry advocates expressed optimism that the proposal would be tweaked. Senate Republicans — several of whom want to maintain subsidies for less mature technologies — have already balked at some of the provisions.

The Nevada Angle

In March, Amodei told me that preservation of 45X (manufacturing) and 30D (consumer EV credits) were red lines for him. On Tuesday, he was less stringent on 30D, saying that the EV industry will continue to grow regardless and that the demand for Nevada lithium is not reliant on the credit.

“We're pushing all the lithium stuff, pushing all the recycling stuff,” Amodei said. “I think there's definitely demand there. I don't think they need that credit to keep their place.”

Industry insiders agreed that the demand for lithium will persist, but that Nevada-made lithium may not be able to compete without the consumer tax credit.

But he and 12 other Republicans passionate about the preservation of key credits have already made a list of demands for leadership — changes to the foreign entity of concern provisions, restoring transferability and going back to the construction standard instead of the new “in service” requirement.

However, none threatened to withhold their vote.

Amodei said he met with advocates this week to formulate a lobbying plan for their most important asks.

“Now we got some time to put together a lobbying plan,” he said. “How do we fine tune this to make it even more [helpful] for the Teslas and Redwood [Materials]?”

The Impact

Growing the renewable energy industry in Nevada has been a bipartisan endeavor at the federal and state levels, with the geographic blessings of lithium and sunshine an appealing pathway to diversify the state’s economy beyond gaming.

This is just the first draft, and much of the negotiating will occur behind the scenes. But I’ll be monitoring how key stakeholders engage with the bill, especially when the Senate gets its say.

Around the Capitol

💦Colorado River concerns — Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) is raising a new concern over the Utah public land sales included in the reconciliation bill. Lee and Rep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ) say the parcels align with a planned route for the Lake Powell pipeline, which brings water from the Colorado River to Utah and could potentially upset negotiations over the river’s water usage.

Lee again called on Amodei to withdraw those portions of the bill.

🏭Apex authorization — Rep. Steven Horsford’s (D-NV) bill — which makes technical corrections to the Apex Site land by allowing Clark County to develop projects that produce hazardous byproducts on the federal land without specific approvals — passed the House by a voice vote.

FTAs are likely to have a significant impact on the direction, pace and competition in India’s EV sector.","India’s commitments on emission reduction, and achievement of net zero emissions by 2070, have laid the foundation for development of a robust EV ecosystem in India. Over the years, India’s EV policies have been focused on increasing domestic manufacturing and incentivising the setup of adequate charging infrastructure, along with facilitating import of critical minerals on concessional duties. From the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles (FAME I) scheme launched in 2015, with a budget outlay of Rs 895 Crore, to FAME-II launched in 2019 with an outlay of Rs 11,500 crore and now, the currently applicable, PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) Scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 Crore - India has predominantly sought to accelerate EV adoption through domestic manufacturing.

Additionally, to strengthen the EV ecosystem and reduce import reliance, the Government in May 2021 launched a Rs 18,100 Crore PLI scheme for advance cell chemistry manufacturing and later in January 2025 launched the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) with an outlay of Rs 16,300 crore. Also, the Union Budget over the last two years has exempted customs duty on critical minerals and capital goods required for EV battery manufacturing.

In March 2024, given the push from global auto manufacturers, particularly Tesla, to provide access to India market, and to attract investments from global EV manufacturers - India introduced the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI). SPMEPCI contemplates that approved applicants would be able to import completely built units of e-4W at a reduced customs duty of 15 per cent provided they meet the conditions set out in the scheme. The conditions set out in SPMEPCI include the requirement to invest a minimum of Rs 4,150 crore in setting up manufacturing facilities in India to manufacture e-4W, and that such facility must be operational within 3 years to achieve a minimum Domestic Value Addition (DVA) of at least 25 per cent by the end of the third year, and 50 per cent by the end of the fifth year. It may be relevant to note that the current customs duty (outside the SPMEPCI) on passenger vehicles (4W) which are of a value lower than USD 40,000 is about 70 per cent and those of a value higher than USD 40,000 is about 110 per cent. Therefore, SPMEPCI offers significant duty concessions albeit subject to certain conditions.

While Tesla appears to have decided to make its much-awaited India entry pursuant to the SPMEPCI, the scheme has received a mild reaction from other global players like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. India is a price sensitive market and for global players whose portfolio comprises of only high-end models, going under SPMEPCI may not seem attractive. They would be required to commit to a significant investment without having a commensurate market share.

Accordingly, the outcome of the ongoing trade negotiations is eagerly awaited by auto manufacturers across the globe. For context - prior to the recently concluded India- UK free trade agreement (FTA), India had 13 FTAs with predominantly South Asian countries, notable exceptions being UAE and Australia, and 6 preferential trade agreements. India is now looking to conclude agreements with US and EU, amongst other major economies.

Further, while the text of the India-UK FTA is yet to be finalised and published, from publicly available information, it appears that the UK auto manufacturers are looking to significantly benefit from lower import duties agreed by India (reduced from over 100 per cent to 10 per cent in a staggered manner) for a certain number of cars. Similarly, India will be allowed to export a quota of EVs and hybrid cars to the UK at concessional tariff, but in stages and within the prescribed quota. It may be relevant to note that once the text of the India-UK FTA is finalised and signed, both countries will need to ratify it before it can come into force and this is expected to take up to a year.

The conclusion of the India-UK FTA negotiations marks a significant milestone in India’s evolving stance on global trade and has set the tone for other trade negotiations. It appears that for other FTAs, the Government of India may consider similar reductions in tariffs (and potential modifications to the SPMEPCI), or even the introduction of zero-duty imports under certain conditions. Additionally, it has also sent a strong signal that while India may be open to tariff reductions, this would happen only in a phased manner giving domestic manufacturers time to scale up.

FTAs are likely to have a significant impact on the direction, pace and competition in India’s EV sector. On one hand, reducing tariffs may provide Indian customers with an array of options to transition out of ICE engines and move to EVs, and on the other hand, it may threaten the domestic EV ecosystem which is still in the nascent phase and where manufacturers have made significant long-term investments based on India’s energy transition goals. Having said so, Indian automakers, such as Tata Motors and Mahindra, are also closely watching the opportunities and the incentives that the FTAs, such as the one between India and UK, provide to export Indian EVs outside India and to create synergies with their global counterparts.

The Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment was awarded the Community Change Grant last July as one of 21 climate change-related projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
“It always feels hyperbolic to say people’s lives are at stake,” said institute director Brian G. Henning.

Citing a change in “administration priorities,” the Environmental Protection Agency notified Gonzaga University on May 2 of the impending cancellation of a $19.9 million grant devoted to climate resiliency in Spokane’s disadvantaged, low-income communities, according to a joint news release from the city of Spokane and the private Jesuit school decrying the move.

The Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment was awarded the Community Change Grant last July as one of 21 climate change-related projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It was the university’s single largest grant award in Gonzaga’s nearly 140-year history, and school and city officials say it would have contributed greatly to the region’s adjustment to the ongoing climate crisis.

Hundreds of low-income homes were to be retrofitted with heat pumps and high-quality air filtration systems, five community centers and libraries were going to be bolstered to serve as extreme weather shelters, and several prospective workers were to be trained for jobs in clean energy – all as a result of the funding.

“It always feels hyperbolic to say people’s lives are at stake,” said institute director Brian G. Henning. “But it’s literally true right now.”

Fearing significant consequences to Spokane residents if the EPA follows through, leaders for the city and Gonzaga University are now calling on the agency to change course. They argue the Trump administration’s move lacks legal standing and jeopardizes the public health and safety of the region.

“We are concerned not only about the process by which this decision was made, but even more so about its very real consequences for the people we serve,” Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh said in a statement. “Our mission is to educate and serve. This grant enables our community to learn how to deal with dangerous climate conditions and help the thousands of community members who lack the ability to protect themselves from the extreme heat and wildfire smoke that is all too common in the Inland Northwest today.”

The plea from the private-public coalition includes a call for federal legislators “to intervene for their constituents by urging immediate reinstatement of the grant,” in addition to stressing its importance and requesting a formal explanation on the legal grounds of the decision – a request Congressman Michael Baumgartner indicated he would not be considering.

“I’ve not been briefed on the project and don’t know much about it, but with $36 trillion in federal debt and a federal 20% budget deficit, some tough decisions need to be made about sending some spending decisions back to the local government level,” Baumgartner said. “It could be that it’s a very good program, but just not one that a broke federal government can afford.”

While Baumgartner appeared to agree with the grant’s termination, Senator Patty Murray came to its defense in a heated budget discussion with Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zelding at a Senate Appropriations Interior Subcommittee hearing Wednesday. In an exchange specifically about the cancellation of the grant to the Gonzaga Climate Institute, Murray pried for details and told Zelding he was “abandoning communities.”

“There was no explanation for that cancellation,” Murray said. “That is a community that saw 19 people die and over 300 people hospitalized during a heat wave a few short years ago, where wildfires are a constant threat. So let me ask you, is it woke to protect people from wildfires and heat stroke?”

“I don’t know if you’re going to get anyone in America to answer yes to the way you put that question out there,” Zeldin responded.

Zeldin did not offer a specific reason for the cancellation, as Murray continued to probe, only stating that “there are hundreds of grants,” and he would need the Spokane award in front of him to discuss details.

Spokane Mayor Lisa Brown said in a statement Friday the work to which the funding was devoted was already underway when the EPA sent their notice. She argued the goals and scope of the program, while receiving bipartisan support, are “not about politics,” but about people and “protecting neighbors and investing in a healthier, safer future for Spokane.”

“The decision to terminate this grant puts lives at risk and undermines locally led solutions to climate and public health challenges,” Brown said. “Make no mistake, recent history shows just how critical this funding is to ensure the health, safety, and economic stability of so many Spokane families.”

More than 150 people statewide, including 20 Spokane County residents, died from heat-related causes during the record-breaking multiday heat wave that blanketed the Pacific Northwest in July 2021. The majority of local heat-wave deaths were elderly people who died in their homes, according to Spokane County Medical Examiner Dr. Veena Singh.

It was the deadliest weather event in state history and drives home exactly why the work covered by the grant was needed, Henning said. In the past 30 years, heat has killed more people nationally on average than tornadoes, floods or hurricanes, according to the National Weather Service.

“It’s only a matter of time before it happens again,” Henning said. “So we’ve been racing against the clock to try and do whatever we can to improve the resilience to the next such event, and these resources were going to make a big difference in helping to do that.”

Nearly 95% of the grant funding was devoted to tangible services and infrastructure improvements, like the establishment of extreme weather shelters and upgrades to qualifying houses, the release states. The Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water, and the Environment was the lead recipient and pass-thru administrator for the funds, but the work was to be spread among several nonprofits and civic bodies, including Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners, the city of Spokane, Spokane Public Library and the Carl Maxey Center.

“It’s really a huge investment that will save lives and make a difference for those people who are most vulnerable,” Henning said. “As you can imagine, spending millions of dollars on infrastructure improvements has a lot of impact on jobs and the economy in an immediate way.”

Around $2.6 million was going to be set aside into the “Community Climate Action Fund,” which is intended to be a resource for community organizations seeking funding to do climate-resilience work. The Gonzaga Climate Institute is encouraging groups to still apply by its May 31 deadline regardless of the uncertainty surrounding the fund’s future, citing a need for ideas and action to address the climate crisis.

The school is “actively recruiting additional funders who might be willing to invest in work proposed through the Climate Fund,” according to a statement on the application portal.

“I understand why people would consider whether or not they want to apply for these funds, but I am strongly of the view that having good ideas that are well formulated, that are shovel ready, is worth everybody’s time,” Henning said. “Because we need these good ideas, and then we can find ways of funding it. We urgently need to do that, so we’ll find other means, over time, if necessary.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/etipN8F_aylNkVfhh0S_E3gz0nA=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/05/16/62daf7e230caf.hires.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 12:11:36.477517

The House Ways and Means Committee portion of the bill, released this week, would gut many of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits.

He may have to buck Donald Trump to protect it.

Since Rep. Juan Ciscomani took office in 2023, electric car manufacturer Lucid Motors quadrupled the size of its plant in Casa Grande, bringing thousands of additional jobs to his economically struggling district. Further east, across Tucson’s suburbs and beyond, utilities, farms and residents are flocking to install solar in a bid to temper rising electricity prices.

And the SunZia transmission line, part of the country’s largest clean energy project, is set to carry gigawatts of wind power across the northern half of his district, transporting much-needed power to Phoenix and California.

But that growth is partly driven by incentives in Democrats’ 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which Trump has derided as the “Green New Scam” and Republican leaders are looking to cut to help pay for a massive tax, border security and energy package.

That is going to force dozens of rank-and-file Republicans like Ciscomani to make a difficult decision: resist Trump’s efforts to gut the IRA or incur the wrath of constituents who could lose billions of dollars in clean energy investments and tens of thousands of new jobs. But these lawmakers also risk drawing the ire of the president and his allies if they slow the final package or vote against it. The House Ways and Means Committee portion of the bill, released this week, would gut many of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits.

For Ciscomani, a rising star in the GOP who holds one of the most competitive House seats in the nation, the decision could be a pivotal one for his political future — and that of his party. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House, Trump endorsed Ciscomani’s bid for a third term last month. But Democrats — who have identified him as one of their top targets — are already preparing their attacks if he votes to cut clean energy programs or limit safety-net programs like Medicaid in the reconciliation package.

So far, Ciscomani has looked to toe the line. He has signed onto two letters urging leadership to preserve at least some of the IRA’s credits, and met recently with Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.), whose committee holds jurisdiction over the credits, to make his case.

“I’ve made it clear what I’m going to be fighting for,” Ciscomani said in an interview.

But he’ll have to make a decision once Republicans bring the full package to the floor, which they aim to do by Memorial Day. Ciscomani, along with other Republicans who have called to preserve the IRA, in March voted for the budget resolution that is allowing the GOP to attempt to pass the package without Democratic votes.

Kirsten Engel, a University of Arizona environmental law professor and former Democratic candidate who narrowly lost to Ciscomani in 2022 and 2024, said the climate law has been transformative for the district — and residents will be closely watching whether Ciscomani votes to protect it.

“It’s one thing to say that you support this — it’s another thing to actually vote in a manner that’s going to make sure that this money actually is available,” said Engel, who is not currently planning another run. “It seems like he’s trying to have his cake and eat it too.”

Ciscomani acknowledged he hasn’t yet drawn any red lines on the clean energy credits. But he emphasized how important they are to companies such as Lucid Motors, which he helped recruit to Arizona a decade ago as an aide to then-Republican Gov. Doug Ducey.

“As much as there are other aspects of the IRA we [Republicans] can disagree with, these tax credits have had an impact in my district — and on job creation, on investment, also national security, because of energy production and having wanted to bring that more domestically,” he said.

The clean energy boom has opened new doors for many of Ciscomani’s constituents, like Ruben Subia. When Subia left the military and returned home to Casa Grande, he figured he would have to follow many of his high school classmates to Phoenix or Tucson for a higher-paying job. But Lucid was hiring for its new factory, offering high-paying jobs right in town and a chance to put his skills in the trades to work. Subia became one of the first 1,000 employees at the plant, which has since expanded to 2,800 after it quadrupled its footprint last year.

The jobs at Lucid have been “life-changing” for many in Casa Grande, giving them the opportunity to buy a car or a house for the first time, said Subia, who now works in human resources. His two brothers, who are also veterans, have joined him at Lucid.

The IRA helped supercharge a manufacturing boom in the city of 64,000, a former agricultural and mining town. Proctor and Gamble and several semiconductor chemical manufacturers have followed Lucid to the area. Two copper mines that could eventually supply Lucid are in development on the city’s outskirts. And Central Arizona College launched a training center just outside town that has prepared thousands of locals to work at Lucid and the other factories.

Population and median income are up, and businesses are streaming back, buoyed by the wages from Lucid, which is now Pinal County’s largest employer. Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande it closed in 2016.

Casa Grande Mayor Lisa Navarro Fitzgibbons, who has lived in the area since the 1970s, said the partisanship around the IRA credits “drives me crazy” because they have only brought jobs and growth to towns like hers.

“As we continue to see some of these cuts and changes in legislation, we are the ones that are struggling and scrambling,” said Fitzgibbons, who signed a letter alongside 15 other mayors in April urging lawmakers to preserve the full suite of credits. Fitzgibbons’ position is nonpartisan.

House Republicans’ proposal would eliminate all of the IRA’s consumer EV credits within two years and curtail the advanced manufacturing credit that has spurred a wave of factory investments across the country.

While Lucid’s factory was planned before the IRA passed, it benefits from the manufacturing incentive for the battery packs it assembles and the consumer EV tax credit for leased vehicles. The company also hopes to claim the EV credit for its upcoming cheaper midsize SUV, planned for 2026 release.

“It’s not that we won’t be here [if the credits are eliminated], but the growth curve will be a lot slower, the job opportunities will be less,” said Adrian Price, Lucid’s senior vice president of operations.

Price said the company aligns well with the Trump administration’s goals of bringing vehicle manufacturing back to the United States. Unlike many other manufacturers, Lucid does its stamping in-house in Casa Grande — meaning its cars enter the factory as massive coils of U.S.-sourced aluminum and drive out ready to be delivered.

But “manufacturing is a hugely capital-intensive business … and you have to be careful about how you invest and grow,” Price said. “Those credits and those opportunities are part of the fabric of how we structure the business to enable us to grow at the fastest rate we can.”

It’s not just Lucid that could feel the pain of the cuts in Ciscomani’s district. The region’s thriving solar industry is helping temper electricity prices amid surging power demand — but a combination of the uncertainty around tariffs and the tax credits has already led companies to pull back, said John Mitman, president of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association.

Utility rates in the region have surged in recent years, Mitman noted. “I think we’ll see even higher rate increases if [the credits for solar] go away, because it is really the primary source of most of that new generation capacity,” he said.

Mitman is founder and CEO of solar developer Obodo Energy, which just completed a 4-megawatt solar installation at a commercial farm in Willcox, an agricultural town in the heart of Ciscomani’s district.

The project, which benefits from the tech-neutral clean electricity credit in the IRA, aims to fully offset power demand from three greenhouses, taking strain off the local grid and allowing the farm to grow more cucumbers and tomatoes, according to Mitman.

As produce-laden trucks make their way to Interstate 10, they pass under the hulking towers of the nearly-complete SunZia transmission line. The 550-mile-long project, expected to begin operations in 2026, will carry 3 gigawatts of wind energy from central New Mexico to power-hungry customers in Arizona.

A SunZia spokesperson said the line itself is not receiving IRA subsidies, but the wind project is eligible for the clean electricity credit for the power it generates. Republicans have proposed restricting that credit and moving up its sunset date.

Just a few miles south of Willcox, Sal Tirrito and his wife Yuri are building their dream property: a farmstead retreat focused around sustainable practices. Opposite the six luxury yurts for overnight guests, Tirrito has plans for a solar canopy over the parking lot, which would power the onsite cafe.

Tirrito was recently awarded a grant for the project under the Agriculture Department’s Rural Energy for America Program, which received a huge infusion from the IRA. But with the future of the funding uncertain, he has decided to hold off for now rather than front the money and hope to get reimbursed given its half-million dollar price tag.

Chris Donat, another Democratic candidate, pointed to the regular demonstrations against the Republican budget bill that Democrats and others are holding outside Ciscomani’s office in Tucson, saying voters are angry their lawmaker has not bucked Trump on clean energy and other issues and is “obviously afraid to stand up for what he at least originally believed in.”

National Democrats are also turning their attention to the tightly contested district. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.) drew more than 10,000 people to a March rally in Tucson for their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour while Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) held a town hall in April to highlight the impacts of potential Medicaid cuts — and point out Ciscomani has not held his own in-person town halls for constituents.

The cuts and limitations to the safety-net health program proposed by House Republicans to help pay for their bill further complicate Ciscomani’s calculus on the clean energy cuts. More than 30,000 adults in Ciscomani’s district are at risk of losing coverage while hospitals could be closed if federal funds dry up, according to research from Daniel Derksen, director of the University of Arizona Center for Rural Health.

Ciscomani was among the dozen Republicans to declare in April they would not vote for a bill that cuts Medicaid for vulnerable populations.

Ciscomani said in the interview that Medicaid is his only red line “so far,” but he dismissed his Democratic opponents’ claims that he would fold on the clean energy credits.

“These Democrats, they’re straight up just grasping at straws at this point,” Ciscomani said.

GOP state Sen. T.J. Shope, who represents Casa Grande and serves as president pro tempore, said he had “no doubt” Ciscomani — whom he has known for a decade — will be able to navigate the difficult decisions on the reconciliation bill.

“If history serves as any indicator, he does a very good job of walking a tightrope,” Shope said. “He does a very good job listening to his constituents.”",https://static.politico.com/1b/f8/047c13134d578d8a06a8ebe448de/main-bikales-azcleanenergy-lead.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 11:04:31.959484

Roy Cooper and current Gov. Josh Stein — hailed it as a victory after years of fighting for clean water in eastern North Carolina.

“This is the best PFAS day I’ve had in a quarter-century,” Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said during a speech at the announcement ceremony.

Just over a year later, much of the progress made on that day to remove the toxic chemicals from Americans’ drinking water, including 66,000 public water systems, could be reversed.

On Wednesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency’s plans to scrap the limits for three of the five PFAS chemicals included in the landmark rule: 10 parts per trillion for PFHxS, PFNA and GenX (HFPO-DA). Limits of 4 ppt for PFOA and PFOS will remain in effect, Zeldin said. The administration is also extending the deadline for public water systems to meet the standards from 2029 to 2031, in an effort to give small and rural water systems more time to comply.

In addition to weakening the PFAS limits, the EPA will also “establish a federal exemption framework” for some utilities, the announcement said. The agency will also establish a new PFAS outreach initiative called PFAS OUT, which will help water systems comply with the EPA’s new limits.

Forever chemicals in the Cape Fear

PFAS are a group of about 15,000 toxic and pervasive chemicals colloquially referred to as “forever chemicals” for their inability to naturally break down in the environment and to build up in the human body. Exposure to PFAS is linked to numerous adverse health effects, including various cancers, heart disease, thyroid disease and reproductive issues.

Chemours, formerly known as DuPont, dumped PFAS and GenX from its Fayetteville Works plant, located on the Cumberland-Bladen County line, into the Cape Fear River for decades, contaminating the water supplies of hundreds of thousands in the Cape Fear River basin. PFAS researchers said in March that residents downstream of the Fayetteville Works plant on the Cape Fear River and those surrounding the facility have PFAS levels between two and four times higher than the national average.

In the EPA’s announcement, Zeldin said that the agency would keep standards in place for PFOA and PFOS, two legacy types of PFAS that have been phased out of production but remain present in water supplies. Both chemicals have been labeled as carcinogens by the World Health Organization, with no safe level of consumption.

“The work to protect Americans from PFAS in drinking water started under the first Trump Administration and will continue under my leadership,” Zeldin said in the announcement. “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.”

Zeldin’s announcement comes as knowledge of the extent and dangers of the PFAS contamination in eastern North Carolina continues to grow. The forever chemicals have leached into water, air and soil in the area surrounding the Fayetteville Works plant. In some areas, garden produce is unsafe to eat. Pets have suffered from ailments that developed after exposure to PFAS, while local residents have been diagnosed with cancers associated with the high levels of PFAS in their blood.

The United Nations has said DuPont and Chemours violated human rights law by polluting the Cape Fear River Basin with the toxic chemicals. Lawsuits against the companies, filed by local residents and governments over widespread water contamination, property damage and personal injury, have piled up. One case with over 2,500 individual plaintiffs is set to go to trial in the coming months, after Chemours and DuPont’s request for summary judgement was rejected by a district court judge on March 31.

Clear water advocacy groups decried Zeldin’s decision, including Emily Donovan, the co-founder of Clean Cape Fear. When she spoke at the EPA’s announcement event last April, Donovan said she was “deeply honored” and “overwhelmed with gratitude.” She criticized the Trump administration’s decision to water down the rules.

“This current administration promised voters it would ‘Make America Healthy Again’ but rescinding part of the PFAS drinking water standards does no such thing,” Donovan said in a statement on Wednesday. “It’s disrespectful to PFAS contaminated communities who have suffered debilitating illnesses and devastating losses. This is a clear victory for the trillion dollar chemical industry — not public health.”

Chemical industry lobbyists, meanwhile, are advocating for the Trump administration to further weaken the rules. The American Chemistry Council, a trade group representing chemical manufacturers that sued the EPA over the 2024 limits, pushed for further deregulation this week.

“EPA’s actions reflect efforts to address the concerns of water utilities and local governments, focus on national drinking water priorities, minimize the impact on water bills, and ensure consistency with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act,” the group said in a statement. “However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences.”

The removal of the GenX limit could also have ramifications for the 2019 Consent Order between Chemours, the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and nonprofit group Cape Fear River Watch. Under the legal agreement, Chemours is required to test residential wells for PFAS contamination upon DEQ’s direction. If the compounds are detected above certain thresholds, Chemours must immediately provide affected households with bottled water or other filtration solutions.

Mike Watters, a prominent clean water advocate from Cumberland County, raised concerns that the removal of the EPA’s GenX limit could also influence or lead to the removal of the EPA’s health advisory for the chemical. The advisory is also 10 ppt, and while not enforceable, it is used by DEQ to determine whether residents qualify for alternative water sources. It applies to North Carolina residents with private drinking water wells in 10 counties, including six counties in the upper Cape Fear River Basin and four counties in the lower Cape Fear River Basin.

“It is very troubling to see this direction by the EPA under Lee Zeldin,” Watters said.

A new data dashboard from the Sierra Club showed more Kentuckians would be at risk for higher exposure to air and water pollution if the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency follows through on plans to loosen several environmental regulations.

Targets for rollbacks include regional haze, greenhouse gas, mercury and air toxin standards, along with wastewater pollution rules and a recently implemented set of rules designed to curb nitrogen oxide emissions.

Julia Finch, director of the Kentucky chapter of the Sierra Club, said coal plants and industries in the Commonwealth would be allowed to emit more pollution into neighboring communities.

“It’s a divestment from the health of Kentuckians,” Finch argued. “As much as the narrative is out there that rolling back regulations on coal will bring jobs into the area, the fact of the matter is, that there’s just no data to support that.”

Nationwide, the dashboard showed more than 532 million metric tons more carbon dioxide would be emitted, along with more than 2,500 more tons of fine particulate matter and 868 more pounds of mercury if the pollution standards are rolled back.

Despite improvements in air quality over the past two decades, Finch added, Kentucky still ranks at the top of states in asthma cases and lung disease. She emphasized children and elderly people are especially vulnerable to the effects of air and water pollution.

“This is not a sacrifice zone,” Finch stressed. “This is not a place to continue to extract resources from. This is a place where people are literally fighting for their lives and fighting for stronger regulation.”

In its annual “State of the Air” report released last month, the American Lung Association ranked Louisville the second-worst city in the region for ozone emissions.

The St-Jérôme, Que.-based manufacturer made the announcement Thursday evening, after a months-long search for a buyer that nearly came up empty.

The agreement comes after the Quebec government refused to inject more public funds directly into Lion Electric, which sought protection from its creditors in December. However, the province announced it would pump nearly $500 million into a subsidy program for electric school buses that will benefit the company.

The consortium of investors is led by Pierre Wilkie, a director of the company, and Vincent Chiara, president of Montreal real estate developer Groupe MACH. Lion Electric will present the deal to a Quebec Superior Court judge on Wednesday.

A previous offer by the group of investors fell through after Quebec Economy Minister Christine Fréchette announced last month that it would be irresponsible to invest more government money in Lion Electric, which manufactured electric school buses and trucks. News reports said the investors were seeking $24 million in public funds.

The province has already invested heavily in the company, and Premier François Legault has said the government stands to lose about $140 million.

After that deal failed, a representative of the court-appointed monitor for the company said Lion Electric would likely face liquidation.

But last week, the investors made a new, reduced offer after receiving confirmation that Quebec would renew its subsidy program for electric school buses, which had expired in March.

""It wasn't easy to get to where we are this morning,"" said Guy Martel, a lawyer representing Lion Electric, during a court hearing on Friday. ""It's a result, but it's still not what we had hoped for at the very beginning of the process.""

Under the terms of the agreement, Lion Electric will preserve its manufacturing plant in St-Jérôme, but will permanently lay off some employees.

On Thursday, the government released details of the new subsidy program for electric school buses, which will now offer rebates of $240,000 on each bus purchase, up from a maximum of $175,000. That program has been a key to Lion's success in Quebec, in part because buses must be assembled in Canada to be eligible.

Quebec is aiming to electrify 65 per cent of its school bus fleet by 2030, and the new program will run until 2028, with a budget of $480 million. The provincial government says there are about 1,600 electric school buses in Quebec, out of a total fleet of around 11,500 buses. About 1,175 of the electric buses were manufactured by Lion.

Even as it renewed the subsidy program, however, Quebec scrapped a requirement in place since 2021 that all new school bus purchases be electric. ""Operators will now be able to choose between electric or thermal … buses to renew their fleet,"" a spokesperson for Transport Minister Geneviève Guilbault said in a statement.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation's air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration's limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can't legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

""The law is very clear that the EPA can't repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,"" said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration's underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

""However, EPA's actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,"" the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA's decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

""This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,"" said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/864a7ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F3d%2F37308cf745ad949a962bae70eb68%2Fap25134487196604.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 11:05:28.943197

OPG says it will be the first commercial grid-scale SMR in North America, with an in-service target date of 2030, and the first new nuclear build in Ontario in more than three decades.

Ontario government support for the CAD$20.9 billion project came after OPG received a Licence to Construct in April from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. The first SMR would cost $7.7 billion. All four SMRS are to be located next to the Darlington nuclear power plant east of Toronto and are expected to be running by 2035.

What are SMRs?

Facing stiff emissions reduction requirements, several countries are starting to re-assess nuclear power and are looking at building plants that are not as expensive, risky, or politically unpalatable as conventional nuclear.

Generally ,less than 300 MWe, SMRs are cheaper and can be built more quickly than large nuclear reactors, which are typically 1,000 MW and have a large footprint. Interest in small reactors is driven by a desire to reduce capital costs and to provide power away from large grid systems.

SMRs are constructed with prefabricated modules and can be transported by truck or by rail — making them ideal for remote locations where a conventional reactor would not be feasible. Another important advantage is they are less likely to overheat, because their small cores produce less heat than those of large reactors. They also have fewer moving parts, including coolant pumps, which reduces the likelihood of failures that could cause an accident. The fuel, steam and generator are all in one vessel.

Their small size and lower cost compared to large nuclear reactors makes Small Modular Reactors more versatile, meaning significantly more utilities will be able to use them.

In Canada, SMRs are considered ideal for deployment to off-grid, remote locations such as mine sites or the oil sands, as well as communities in northern Canada reliant on diesel-fueled generators for electricity.

Small nuclear reactors are also being eyed by industrial producers as carbon-free sources of heat.

Other SMRs in the works

In addition to OPG, other utilities including Saskatchewan’s SaskPower and the Tennessee Valley Authority have expressed interest in building BWRX 300s, as have companies in Poland and Estonia, The Globe and Mail reports.

Meanwhile Westinghouse, which built the world’s first commercial pressurized water reactor in Shippingport, PA, in 2023 announced the launch of a smaller version of its flagship AP1000 nuclear reactor. The unit is, like the BWRX 300, able to generate 300 MW of electricity, versus 1,200 MW for the AP1000. It is expected to be available in 2027, at a cost of USD$1 billion per unit — significantly less than the $6.8B estimated to bring an AP1000 online.

Some of the most advanced research on SMR technology is being conducted in New Brunswick.

NB Power is currently working with two private-sector partners, ARC Clean Technology and Moltex Energy, to advance Generation IV Plus Grid-sized SMR technology for use in the Maritime province.

In 2023, the New Brunswick government signed an agreement with the government of Saskatchewan to further enhance collaboration on the development and deployment of SMRs.

The Western Canadian province is considering the same BWRX 300 Small Nuclear Reactor as Ontario.

While no SMRs have yet been built in the United States, the Department of Energy has announced up to $5.5B in funding.

According to my colleague Felicity Bradstock, an increasing number of tech companies are investing in SMR technology with the hopes of powering their high-energy-demand data centers with clean energy. The sector hopes SMR technology will be available to power several data centers by the 2030s, as their power demand grows in line with the rollout of artificial intelligence and other complex technologies. This has led Google to order seven SMRs, and Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta to follow suit.

Bill Gates’s Terrapower is one of the US companies currently building SMRs. Terrapower broke ground on its first project in Wyoming last August and is awaiting approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, expected by the end of 2026.

Further afield, France announced USD$1.1 billion to develop an SMR design. In the UK, Rolls-Royce is around 18 months ahead of the competition in developing SMR technology.

In the Netherlands, the nuclear startup Thorizon announced a new consortium to develop a molten salt-type SMR.

The firm is currently building a 100-MW Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), Thorizon One, which it hopes to get running in a pilot plant by the mid-2030s. It expects the first prototype to be fueled by a mix of long-lived radioactive waste from existing nuclear facilities and thorium. This will transform much of the long-lived waste into short-lived waste.

MSRs are powered by a radioactive solution that blends fissionable isotopes with a liquid salt. While they can be powered using uranium, they run optimally on thorium, a cleaner, safer, and more abundant nuclear fuel.

The SMR market is expected to grow from $6 billion in 2024 to $7.14 billion in 2030, growing at a CAGR of 3 percent. The Asia Pacific and Americas markets will likely be the main drivers of this growth.

In the past, policies favored traditional energy sources while overlooking the promise of renewables. Today, the focus has shifted entirely to renewable energy while neglectfully disregarding the consequences for the workforce, consumers and the grid. The rapid push toward a carbon-free, all electric grid has come at a high cost—eliminating jobs, driving up energy bills, and, perhaps most concerning, revealing itself to be both unrealistic and unattainable.

For once, Albany has a realistic, forward-looking alternative Senator Kevin Parker (D-Brooklyn), Chair of the Senate Energy Committee along with Senator Sean Ryan (D-Buffalo) and Assemblyman William Conrad (D-Tonawanda) have introduced a package of bills that will, for the first time, shift New York’s energy strategy from subtraction to addition.

Together, this legislative package strikes a smart balance – simultaneously prioritizing jobs, affordable energy, and emissions reductions. We have always known that reducing energy usage is a key component for cutting emissions. One of the most effective ways to do that is through improving insulation and weatherization in homes and buildings. The bill sponsored by Senator Ryan and Assemblyman Conrad would do just that – creating good paying union jobs while reducing emissions. It’s a true win-win scenario.

Meanwhile, Senator Parker has introduced a suite of four bills that reflect a comprehensive vision for our energy future. His proposals would preserve existing natural gas jobs while also creating new ones. Through hybrid heating programs that integrate heat pump technology, accelerating the development of renewable natural gas, supporting clean hydrogen technology and advancing carbon capture projects to reduce emissions.

Together these bills chart a realistic and inclusive path forward – one that maintains vital energy jobs, creates new opportunities in clean energy and efficiency, and continued growth of renewable energy at a sustainable pace.

This package of bills is proof that New York can correct courses. We do not have to choose between jobs and emissions reductions. We can have both. And we can do it without sacrificing the employees that have kept our energy systems running for decades.

With the legislative session quickly drawing to a close, we urge lawmakers to take swift action on this package of bills. New York has always been a leader in innovation.

The moment is now upon us — and the outlook for the IRA after the release of House Republicans’ mega budget bill ranges from bleak to dead, depending on who you ask.

This is just a first draft, and the provisions — including the rollback of key tax credits — are subject to change, likely depending on how effectively members such as Rep. Mark Amodei (R-NV) push for them (and what happens in the Senate).

Let’s get into it.

The News of the Week: IRA rollback

When Ways & Means Republicans released their portion of the “big, beautiful bill” Monday, clean energy advocates were dismayed. After a lengthy lobbying blitz, Republicans’ approach veered more toward a gutting of the bill — phasing out key credits and hampering the ones that have been preserved — rather than a more fine-tuned one.

Here’s what the bill would do:

Cut two key demand-side credits — 30D, which provides a consumer tax credit for American-sourced electric vehicle purchases, and 25D, a subsidy for rooftop solar — by the end of the year.

Phase down investment and production tax credits starting in 2029, with a full phasedown by 2031. Clean energy advocates were happy to see their tech-neutrality maintained — there were fears that solar, in particular, could be cut out.

Begin to phase down the 45X manufacturing tax credit — a source of financing for critical minerals operations and battery and solar manufacturing — in 2031.

End transferability for tax credits after 2027, a key tool for project financing flexibility that allows companies — many of which do not yet pay taxes or have limited liability because they’re not yet generating income — to sell their tax credits and carry them forward.

Change the eligibility rules for tax credits so that projects must be “placed in service” rather than having begun construction to claim them.

Create a complex web of “foreign entity of concern” provisions, many of which would need to be litigated in rulemaking, that limit companies’ ability to source parts or work with companies that have ownership interests from countries (namely China) that the U.S. has deemed to be national security risks.

The IRA helped create a veritable boom across the country — and in Northern Nevada in particular — in clean energy investment and helped build out U.S. supply chains for renewable parts, many of which had never been manufactured or processed in the U.S. before.

Read more about the IRA’s impact in Nevada, and how an IRA rollback would affect the lithium loop and the solar industry.

In Nevada specifically, the Clean Investment Monitor estimates that companies have announced about $28.3 billion in low-carbon energy investments in the state since the IRA’s passage — which brings jobs and workforce development programs. Of that, $15.4 billion is still unspent. Announced projects that have yet to break ground are the ones that could be most imperiled by the rollback, between the limits on financing and the foreign entity of concern rules, given that some parts and technology do not yet exist outside of China.

“Members of Congress should not be surprised if this bill passes as drafted, and over the next several years, a lot of projects that have been announced that people are excited about are significantly scaled down or do not move forward at all,” said Albert Gore III, the president of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, which has lobbied on behalf of tax credits that benefit the electric vehicle and battery supply chain, including for companies in Nevada.

Gore was particularly dismayed by the early phasedown of the manufacturing 45X tax credit and the complete cut of the 30D consumer tax credit. He said that those credits worked in tandem to incentivize automakers to onshore their operations, including sourcing lithium in the U.S.

Nevada, which has the only operating lithium mine in the U.S., has big plans for the critical mineral that exists abundantly in the state and powers EV batteries. Projects such as Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge have received massive federal loans to build mining projects in the state, and have already signed offtake agreements with large automakers.

But industry advocates warn that battery makers and automakers were pursuing American lithium — including Nevada’s — because of the tax credits, which allowed them to source American lithium at a price point that was competitive with foreign-mined and processed lithium.

“I have a hard time thinking that the economic opportunity, the business forecast, the investment forecasts for the lithium loop that that have existed the past couple years in Nevada can endure and continue in the present state, given the demand destruction,” said Harry Godfrey, a managing director at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United.

And even though the most important tax credit to Nevada — the manufacturing 45X credit — was maintained through 2031, Gore cautioned that the early phasedown, the incredibly tight foreign entity of concern provisions and the requirement that projects be in service will hamper future growth, including with announced projects. Mining, refining and manufacturing projects can take a decade, if not longer, to move through permitting and construction phases. Companies may now find the credit — and some of the market demand — gone by the time they’re ready to produce.

And in a macro sense, advocates — and members of Congress — are worried about the bill leading to energy costs rising. The IRA tax credits were intended to allow companies to move more quickly to generate new clean energy to add to the grid and help meet increasing demand. Without that, states may have to rely more on natural gas.

According to a study by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, repealing two key credits (which the Republican bill targeted for early phasedown) could lead to electricity prices being 7.3 percent higher for Nevada households from 2026 to 2032.

Some industry advocates expressed optimism that the proposal would be tweaked. Senate Republicans — several of whom want to maintain subsidies for less mature technologies — have already balked at some of the provisions.

The Nevada Angle

In March, Amodei told me that preservation of 45X (manufacturing) and 30D (consumer EV credits) were red lines for him. On Tuesday, he was less stringent on 30D, saying that the EV industry will continue to grow regardless and that the demand for Nevada lithium is not reliant on the credit.

“We're pushing all the lithium stuff, pushing all the recycling stuff,” Amodei said. “I think there's definitely demand there. I don't think they need that credit to keep their place.”

Industry insiders agreed that the demand for lithium will persist, but that Nevada-made lithium may not be able to compete without the consumer tax credit.

But he and 12 other Republicans passionate about the preservation of key credits have already made a list of demands for leadership — changes to the foreign entity of concern provisions, restoring transferability and going back to the construction standard instead of the new “in service” requirement.

However, none threatened to withhold their vote.

Amodei said he met with advocates this week to formulate a lobbying plan for their most important asks.

“Now we got some time to put together a lobbying plan,” he said. “How do we fine tune this to make it even more [helpful] for the Teslas and Redwood [Materials]?”

The Impact

Growing the renewable energy industry in Nevada has been a bipartisan endeavor at the federal and state levels, with the geographic blessings of lithium and sunshine an appealing pathway to diversify the state’s economy beyond gaming.

This is just the first draft, and much of the negotiating will occur behind the scenes. But I’ll be monitoring how key stakeholders engage with the bill, especially when the Senate gets its say.

Around the Capitol

💦Colorado River concerns — Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV) is raising a new concern over the Utah public land sales included in the reconciliation bill. Lee and Rep. Greg Stanton (D-AZ) say the parcels align with a planned route for the Lake Powell pipeline, which brings water from the Colorado River to Utah and could potentially upset negotiations over the river’s water usage.

Lee again called on Amodei to withdraw those portions of the bill.

🏭Apex authorization — Rep. Steven Horsford’s (D-NV) bill — which makes technical corrections to the Apex Site land by allowing Clark County to develop projects that produce hazardous byproducts on the federal land without specific approvals — passed the House by a voice vote.

In almost all of those cases, the firm found, the money that large energy users paid to electric utilities would not be enough to cover the cost of the equipment needed to serve them.
Electricity demand is expected to grow substantially over the next several decades as technology companies build large data centers for their artificial intelligence businesses.
The rapid increase in data centers, which use electricity to power computer servers and keep them cool, has strained many utilities.
More data centers have opened in Virginia than in any other state.","Individuals and small business have been paying more for power in recent years, and their electricity rates may climb higher still.

That’s because the cost of the power plants, transmission lines and other equipment that utilities need to serve data centers, factories and other large users of electricity is likely to be spread to everybody who uses electricity, according to a new report.

The report by Wood MacKenzie, an energy research firm, examined 20 large power users. In almost all of those cases, the firm found, the money that large energy users paid to electric utilities would not be enough to cover the cost of the equipment needed to serve them. The rest of the costs would be borne by other utility customers or the utility itself.

The utilities “either need to socialize the cost to other ratepayers or absorb that cost — essentially, their shareholders would take the hit,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who is the global head of grid edge research for Wood MacKenzie.

This is not a theoretical dilemma for utilities and the state officials who oversee their operations and approve or reject their rates. Electricity demand is expected to grow substantially over the next several decades as technology companies build large data centers for their artificial intelligence businesses. Electricity demand in some parts of the United States is expected to increase as much as 15 percent over just the next four years after several decades of little or no growth.

The rapid increase in data centers, which use electricity to power computer servers and keep them cool, has strained many utilities. Demand is also growing because of new factories and the greater use of electric cars and electric heating and cooling.

In addition to investing to meet demand, utilities are spending billions of dollars to harden their systems against wildfires, hurricanes, heat waves, winter storms and other extreme weather. Natural disasters, many of which are linked to climate change, have made the United States’ aging power grids more unreliable.

That spending is one of the main reasons that electricity rates have been rising in recent years.

American homes that use a typical 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month paid, on average, about $164 in February, according to the Energy Information Administration. That was up more than $30 from five years ago.

Dominion Energy, a large investor-owned utility based in Richmond, Va., is one of those that Wood MacKenzie expects will spend more on new infrastructure than it will be able to recover from selling electricity to data centers and other large users. More data centers have opened in Virginia than in any other state.

Asked about Wood MacKenzie’s filings, Dominion said that on April 1 it filed a proposal to electricity regulators in Virginia for requiring large-load customers to pay their “fair share” of utility costs.

“Ensuring a fair allocation of costs and mitigating financial risk are not new concepts to the company,” Edward H. Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, said in testimony that Dominion submitted to state regulators and provided to The New York Times. “Addressing both the needs and the risks associated with growth in high-load electric customers with high-load factors is both a public policy and a regulatory priority for Virginia.”

A 2024 analysis by Virginia officials concluded that data centers paid the full cost of the service they received. But that report warned that the addition of many more large users of electricity could raise rates for all users if the state did not make policy changes to protect individuals and small businesses.

Wood MacKenzie’s report found that some states do have policies to protect individuals and small businesses from higher rates. Chief among them is Texas, where customers can pick a power source that is different from the utility that maintains the lines that deliver electricity to their homes.

This arrangement, according to Wood MacKenzie, helps protect individuals from having to pay for grid upgrades that mainly or entirely benefit large users.

Mr. Hertz-Shargel said many utilities also had programs that allowed large electricity users to buy emissions-free energy directly from power producers like solar and wind farms. Such programs, he said, could be refashioned to help ensure that the cost of new power projects is largely or entirely borne by the users responsible for major grid upgrades.

The policies that states and utilities have put in place will significantly reduce risks of spreading the costs of improvements for the large-load customers, but “they do not provide complete protection,” Mr. Hertz-Shargel said. “Only by removing data-center-caused infrastructure from utilities books, such as by allowing large loads to contract with third parties for generation via clean transition tariffs, are both ratepayers and utility shareholders fully protected.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/08/multimedia/00biz-energy-costs-vmwh/00biz-energy-costs-vmwh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 07:02:46.660981

Our proposed action contains more information on the rule and our evaluation. II. Public Comments and EPA Responses The EPA's proposed action provided a 30-day public comment period. During this period, we received no comments. III. EPA Action No comments were submitted. Therefore, as authorized in section 110(k)(3) of the Act, the EPA is approving this rule into the California SIP. The September 25, 2023 version of Rule 1157 will replace the previously approved version of this rule in the SIP. This approval resolves all deficiencies that served as the basis for our June 16, 2023 (88 FR 39366) limited disapproval of the prior version of Rule 1157. We find that submitted Rule 1157 fully satisfies the relevant requirements of section 110 and part D of the Act and cures the deficiencies identified in that document. This action also permanently terminates all sanctions clocks and federal implementation plan clocks triggered by our June 16, 2023 limited disapproval action. IV. Incorporation by Reference In this rule, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference of Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District, Rule 1157, ``Boilers and Process Heaters,'' amended on September 25, 2023, which regulates NOX and CO emissions from industrial, institutional, and commercial boilers, steam [[Page 21237]] generators, and process heaters. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these documents available through https://www.regulations.gov and at the EPA Region IX Office (please contact the person identified in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section of this preamble for more information). V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable federal regulations 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action: Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993); Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866; Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a State program; Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA. In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act (CRA), and the EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 18, 2025. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

Back to Casa Grande For Ciscomani, the stakes are high.
Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande that it had closed in 2016.
Adrian Price, Lucid’s senior vice president of operations, told James that if Republicans eliminate Biden’s tax credits, the company would remain in Casa Grande.","Former President Joe Biden’s climate law helped supercharge a clean energy manufacturing boom in the small city of Casa Grande, Arizona.

Now those economic gains are caught up in the GOP’s internal war over the fate of former President Joe Biden’s climate legacy. And that is creating a tough choice for the swing House district’s Republican representative, Juan Ciscomani, writes James Bikales.

Ciscomani could resist Republican House leaders’ efforts to gut Biden’s hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy tax breaks — helping pay for a small portion of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax and spending megabill. Or he could go along with the cuts, risking the wrath of constituents who could lose billions of dollars in new investments and tens of thousands of new jobs.

Ciscomani is not alone. He is one of a group of Republican lawmakers who for months have been urging their leaders to spare at least some of the tax credits. But now they have to decide how hard to press those demands — and whether they are willing to tank a major part of Trump’s agenda if they don’t get their way.

It’s just one of myriad obstacles facing the megabill, which the House Budget Committee rejected this morning amid hard-line conservatives’ demands for a complete rollback of the clean energy tax credits and steeper cuts in programs such as Medicaid. Now, stay tuned for what version of the bill emerges from the coming weekend of negotiations.

Back to Casa Grande

For Ciscomani, the stakes are high. Since he took office in 2023, electric car manufacturer Lucid Motors quadrupled the size of its plant in Casa Grande, bringing thousands of additional jobs to the former agricultural and mining community.

As James writes, Procter & Gamble and several semiconductor chemical manufacturers followed Lucid to the area. Two copper mines that could eventually serve Lucid are in development on the city’s outskirts. Central Arizona College launched a training center that is preparing thousands of local residents to work at Lucid and the other factories.

Buoyed by the higher wages from Lucid, population and median income are up in the area, and businesses are streaming back. Target announced in February it would reopen a store in Casa Grande that it had closed in 2016. The boom means that many residents can buy a car or a house for the first time, one Lucid employee told James.

Separately, the SunZia transmission line, part of the country’s largest clean energy project, is set to carry massive amounts of wind power across the northern half of Ciscomani’s district, transporting much-needed power to Phoenix and California.

Adrian Price, Lucid’s senior vice president of operations, told James that if Republicans eliminate Biden’s tax credits, the company would remain in Casa Grande. But the company’s growth would slow and job opportunities would dwindle.

“Manufacturing is a hugely capital-intensive business ... and you have to be careful about how you invest and grow,” Price said. “Those credits and those opportunities are part of the fabric of how we structure the business to enable us to grow at the fastest rate we can.”

Power Centers

One word to ruin them all

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposed repeal of the nation’s climate rule for power plants could hinge on a single word: “Significantly,” writes Jean Chemnick.

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act asks EPA to determine whether a power plant “causes, or contributes significantly” to harmful air pollution. Conservative legal experts say that EPA could reinterpret “significantly” to downplay carbon pollution’s role in global warming.

Electricity costs climb, despite Trump’s promises

On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to cut energy costs in half. But retail electricity prices are expected to continue a rapid rise this year, with the average price increasing 13 percent from 2022 to 2025, writes Jason Plautz.

The rate of increase could be even higher in the Pacific region, where prices are forecast to rise 26 percent in that time, as well as in New England and the mid-Atlantic regions, which are both forecast to see 19 percent increases.

Greenland snubs Trump with EU musings

Greenland’s foreign minister has suggested the European Union could develop its coveted mineral resources amid Trump’s threat to seize the island, writes Seb Starcevic.

With its vast caches of rare earths and strategic location in the Arctic, Greenland — a self-ruling Danish territory with a population of around 60,000 — has became an increasingly important geopolitical player whose global profile has been elevated by Trump’s aggressive overtures.

Should we panic, or be grateful?","Sammy Roth, Sammy Roth Climate Columnist, www.latimes.com, sammy-roth",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-05-15/nuclear-reactors-power-los-angeles-should-we-panic-or-celebrate,"That’s right: If you live in Los Angeles County, there’s a good chance your computer, your phone, your refrigerator and your bedside lamp are powered, at least some of the time, by nuclear reactors.
Nuclear plants including Palo Verde generate nearly one-fifth of the nation’s electricity, churning out 24/7, emissions-free power.
The benefits of nuclear reactors are straightforward: They generate climate-friendly electricity around the clock, while taking up far less land than solar or wind farms.
For the record: An earlier version of this column used the wrong name for a nuclear plant in Washington state.
To the extent existing nuclear plants limit the amount of new infrastructure we need to build to replace fossil fuels: good.","The radiation containment domes at Arizona’s Palo Verde Generating Station were, truth be told, pretty boring to look at: giant mounds of concrete, snap a picture, move on. The enormous cooling towers and evaporation ponds were marginally more interesting — all that recycled water, baking in the Sonoran Desert.

You know what really struck my fancy, though? The paintings on conference room walls.

There were five of them, each representing one of the far-flung Southwestern cityscapes powered by Palo Verde. Two showcased Arizona: one for the Phoenix metro area — saguaro cacti and ocotillo in the foreground, freeway and skyscrapers in the background — and one for the red-rock country to the north. Another showed downtown Albuquerque. A fourth portrayed farm fields in El Paso, likely irrigated with water from the Rio Grande.

Then there was an image that may have looked familiar to Southern Californians: Pacific Coast Highway, twisting through a seaside neighborhood that looks very much like Malibu before the Palisades fire.

That’s right: If you live in Los Angeles County, there’s a good chance your computer, your phone, your refrigerator and your bedside lamp are powered, at least some of the time, by nuclear reactors.

The city of L.A., Southern California Edison and a government authority composed of cities including Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena all own stakes in Palo Verde, the nation’s second-largest power plant. In 2023, the most recent year for which data are available, the plant was L.A.’s single largest energy source, supplying nearly 14% of the city’s electricity. The reactors supplied just over 9% of Edison’s power.

During a tour last month, I walked past the switchyard, a tangle of poles and wires where energy is transferred to power lines marching west and east. When all three reactors are running, the yard can transfer “the equivalent of half of the peak [electric demand] of the state of California on its hottest day,” according to John Hernandez, vice president of site services for utility company Arizona Public Service, which runs the plant.

“So it is a massive, massive switchyard,” Hernandez said.

For all the heated debate over the merits of nuclear energy as a climate change solution, the reality is it’s already a climate change solution. Nuclear plants including Palo Verde generate nearly one-fifth of the nation’s electricity, churning out 24/7, emissions-free power. Shutting down the nuclear fleet tomorrow would cause a giant uptick in coal and gas combustion, worsening the heat waves, wildfires and storms of the climate crisis.

Phasing out the nation’s 94 nuclear reactors over a period of decades, on the other hand, might be manageable — and there’s a case to be made for it. Extracting uranium for use as nuclear fuel has left extensive groundwater contamination and air pollution across the Southwest, especially on tribal lands, including the Navajo Nation.

“When we talk about nuclear, thoughts often go toward spent fuel storage, or the safety of reactors themselves,” said Amber Reimondo, energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit conservation group. “But I think an often overlooked piece...has been the impacts to those who are at the beginning of the supply chain.”

Reimondo participated in a panel that I moderated at Palo Verde, part of the annual conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists. She noted that the nation’s only active conventional uranium mill — where uranium is leached from crushed rock — is located in Utah, just a few miles from the Ute Mountain Ute Reservation.

Even during the Biden years, Reimondo said, it was tough to overcome bipartisan enthusiasm for nuclear energy and “get folks to take seriously the impacts that [tribal] communities are feeling” from mining and milling.

“We just haven’t reached a place in this country where we are listening to these folks,” she said.

That dynamic has remained true during the second Trump administration. Just this week, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said his agency would fast-track permitting for a uranium mine proposed by Anfield Energy in Utah’s San Juan County, completing the environmental review — which would normally take a year — in just 14 days.

Burgum and President Trump, like Biden-era officials before them, say it’s unwise for the U.S. to rely on overseas suppliers for nearly all its uranium. But many environmental activists, even some who are fans of nuclear, believe running roughshod over Indigenous nations and public lands is disgraceful. And counterproductive.

Victor Ibarra Jr., senior manager for nuclear energy at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force, said rebuilding the U.S. nuclear power supply chain will require local buy-in — on the front end, where uranium is mined, and on the back end, where spent fuel is stored. Thus far, political opposition has derailed every attempt to build a permanent fuel storage site, meaning nuclear waste is piling up at power plants across the country.

If there’s any hope for more uranium mining and power plants, Ibarra said, it will involve a lot of conversations — conversations that lead to less pollution, and fewer mistakes like those made during the 20th century.

“I think it’s really unfortunate that the nuclear industry has behaved the way it has in the past,” he said.

The benefits of nuclear reactors are straightforward: They generate climate-friendly electricity around the clock, while taking up far less land than solar or wind farms. If building new nuclear plants were cheap and easy — and we could solve the lingering pollution and safety concerns — then doing so would be a climate no-brainer.

If only.

The only two nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in decades came online at Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and cost $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. That was $17 billion over budget.

Meanwhile, efforts to build small modular reactors have proved more expensive than large nuclear plants.

“It would really be quite unprecedented in the history of engineering, and in the history of energy, for something that is much smaller to have a lower price per megawatt,” said Joe Romm, a senior researcher at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media. “We try to make use of the economies of scale.”

Those setbacks haven’t stopped wealthy investors including billionaires Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos from bankrolling efforts to bring down the cost of small modular reactors, in hopes that mini-nuclear plants will someday join solar panels and wind turbines as crucial tools in replacing planet-warming fossil fuels.

I hope they succeed. But I’m not going to spend much time worrying about it.

For the record:

An earlier version of this column used the wrong name for a nuclear plant in Washington state. It’s Columbia Generating Station, not Centralia. Centralia is a coal plant.

Like I said earlier: Love it or hate it, nuclear is already a huge part of the nation’s power mix, including here in L.A. We’ve lived with it, almost always safely, for decades — at Palo Verde, at Washington state’s Columbia Generating Station, at the Diablo Canyon plant on California’s Central Coast. Nuclear, for all its flaws, is hardly the apocalyptic threat to humanity that its most righteous detractors make it out to be.

It’s also not the One True Solution to humanity’s energy woes, as many of its techno-optimist devotees claim it to be. There’s a reason that solar, wind and batteries made up nearly 94% of new power capacity built in the U.S. last year: They’re cheap. And although other technologies will be needed to help solar and wind phase out fossil fuels, some researchers have found that transitioning to 100% clean energy is possible even without nuclear.

So what’s the answer? Is nuclear power good or bad?

I wish it were that simple. To the extent existing nuclear plants limit the amount of new infrastructure we need to build to replace fossil fuels: good. To the extent we’re unable to eliminate pollution from uranium mining: bad. To the extent small reactors might give us another tool to complement solar and wind, alongside stuff like advanced geothermal — good, although we probably shouldn’t spend too much more taxpayer money on it yet.

Sorry not to offer up more enthusiasm, or more outrage. The climate crisis is a big, thorny problem that demands nuance and thoughtful reflection. Not every question can be answered with a snappy soundbite.

Before leaving Palo Verde, I stopped by the conference room for a last look at the paintings: Arizona. New Mexico. Texas. California. It was strange to think this plant was responsible for powering so many different places.

It was strange to think the uranium concealed beneath those domes could power so many different places.

“The health of our clean air, water, forests, and economic progress in the South are all on the line when it comes to this bill.

House committees have labored on the legislation, which runs a whopping 1,116 pages and is titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a nod to Trump himself.

Still, GOP divisions run high. Fiscal conservatives worry the bill doesn’t cut Medicaid spending enough, while Republicans from competitive swing districts warn that they can’t support a bill that would jeopardize access to health coverage and food assistance for constituents.

READ MORE: House Republicans stall spending package for steeper cuts to Medicaid and green energy

Democrats say they will fight what House party leader Hakeem Jeffries calls “this extreme and toxic bill.”

Here’s a look at what’s in and out of the legislative package so far.

Tax cuts for individuals and businesses

Central to the GOP package is more than $5 trillion in tax cuts, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation — costs that are partially offset by spending cuts elsewhere and other changes in the tax code.

Republicans look to make permanent the individual income tax cuts passed in Trump’s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.

To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden’s presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.

But lawmakers from New York, California and other high-tax states say the boost for state and local tax deductions, called SALT, is insufficient. As proposed, it rises from $10,000 to $30,000 for joint filers making less than $400,000 per year. They are pushing for more.

The bill also includes a temporary $2,000 boost to the standard deduction, bringing it to $32,000 for joint filers. And there is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500.

The estate tax exemption raises to $15 million.

Several of the provisions Trump touted on the campaign trail would be temporary, lasting roughly through his second term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That’s also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.

Parents and older Americans face work requirements for food assistance

House Republicans are looking to shift some of the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to the states.

States would shoulder 5 percent of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75 percent of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.

Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.

Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.

At the same time, the legislation would invest $60 billion in new money for agriculture programs, sending aid to farmers.

And new work requirements for Medicaid

A focal point of the package is nearly $800 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program.

To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new “community engagement requirements” of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirement would not kick in until Jan. 1, 2029, after Trump leaves office. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.

READ MORE: House Republicans have unveiled proposed Medicaid cuts. Democrats say millions will lose coverage

Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.

An estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by at least 7.6 million from the Medicaid changes, and possibly more with other changes to the Affordable Care Act.

Applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million.

No taxes on gun silencers, no money for Planned Parenthood and more

Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.

The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.

The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.

Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.

And the bill would allow the Trump administration to remove the tax-exempt status of nonprofits that it says support terrorism. That will create what some nonprofits say is an arbitrary standard to financially punish charities that advocate for issues that don’t align with Trump’s agenda.

‘MAGA’ kids $1,000 savings accounts

“MAGA” is shorthand for Trump’s signature line, “Make America Great Again.” But in this case, it means “Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement.”

For parents or guardians who open new “MAGA” accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.

READ MORE: What would help families have more babies? Here’s what readers said

Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50 percent of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.

Funding for Trump’s mass deportation operation

The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump’s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.

There’s $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There’s also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.

It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum — something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.

Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.

More money for the Pentagon and Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’

There’s also nearly with $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.

It would provide $25 billion for Trump’s “Golden Dome for America,” a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation’s ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.

It also includes $9 billion for servicemember quality of life-related issues, including housing, health care and special pay.

Tax on university endowments and overhaul of student loans

A wholesale revamping of the student loan program is key to the legislation, providing $330 billion in budget cuts and savings.

The proposal would replace all existing student loan repayment plans with just two: a standard option with monthly payments spread out over 10 to 25 years and a “repayment assistance” plan that is generally less generous than those it would replace.

Among other changes, the bill would repeal Biden-era regulations that made it easier for borrowers to get loans canceled if their colleges defrauded them or closed suddenly.

There would be a tax increase, up to 21 percent, on some university endowments.

More drilling, mining on public lands

To generate revenue, one section would allow increased leasing of public lands for drilling, mining and logging while clearing the path for more development by speeding up government approvals.

Royalty rates paid by companies to extract oil, gas and coal would be cut, reversing Biden’s attempts to curb fossil fuels to help address climate change.

In a last-minute add, Republicans also included a provision authorizing sales of hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands in Nevada and Utah, prompting outrage from Democrats and environmentalists.

It looks to me like a perfect storm for energy is coming to the United States. The Trump administration is trying to push energy resources that cannot be built quickly, while attempting to kill some that can. And this is happening just as demand is increasing. I believe we will have severe problems as a result. Let’s consider our biggest energy sources, coal, oil & gas, nuclear, wind, and solar.

1. Reinvigorating coal. According to a post by the US EIA, a quarter of the coal-burning power plants in the US are scheduled to shut down by 2029, and the last time a coal-burning plant was brought online was 2013. Coal plants were closed during Trump’s first term, and he didn’t manage to see any opened up. We can’t expect him to do better now, because the situation is economically even less in favor of coal than it was when he was a presidential newbie.

2. “Drill, baby, drill.” Trump’s solution has a problem. The oil & gas industry, despite the promises Trump made to encourage opening up new oil and gas supplies, seems not to be bothering to drill. A CleanTechnica article, “Trump Promised to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill.’ Big Oil Won’t Let Him,” gives the reason why that is not happening. The oil price, at about $60 per barrel, is too low for the industry to make money. We might suspect that the tariffs Trump imposed on anything imported are not helping.

OPEC is increasing production, and that will keep prices low. CleanTechnica just published a forecast, “US EIA Forecasts World Oil Consumption Growth To Slow.” Supplies are available and prices are too low already, so why would American oil & gas companies increase production?

Also, CleanTechnica has posted many articles showing that manufacturing is flat or declining for internal combustion cars, while it is ramping up for almost all EVs. This is a worldwide phenomenon. It indicates that the oil and gas industry is entering into decline while the world is transitioning to clean power.

Perhaps the best indicator of this is China, which was covered in a recent CleanTechnica article, “Clean Energy Shifts China’s CO₂ Emissions From Growth To Decline.”

3. Pushing nuclear power. Nuclear power is the center of a lot of news activity. Big tech companies want to build nuclear power plants. The problem is that this can’t happen quickly enough to supply them with the power they will soon need.

According to an article at Energy Intelligence, the Trump administration’s answer to the problem is to reduce regulations and speed things up. New executive orders are expected that would circumvent NRC controls, making it possible for the Department of Energy and Department of Defense to take over some of regulatory functionality. That bit of news speaks to a stunning extension of executive power.

Part of the problem for the Trump administration is that it is not just regulations that stand in the way. Small Modular Reactors (SMR) may need to be approved, but that is not all they need. They are to be built in factories, and the factories themselves have to be built. This takes time. And even when the factories are built, turning out functional reactors will not happen overnight.

One other problem for all this is that there will be opposition. The time it will take to get a new SMR built in a factory would probably collide with the next election cycle, and it will be a big issue if it does. My guess is that not many people will like the idea of having a lower level of protections than the NRC has provided.

4. Blowing away wind energy. The Trump administration seems to be out to ruin American wind power. In the process, however, it is teaching the world that investing in the United States is a risky business.

Donald Trump took office and immediately started issuing orders on wind power. New onshore wind farm leases would no longer be offered on federal land. Offshore wind farms, however, have been ordered to stop construction.

Equinor, a Norwegian company, was ordered to halt construction of the Empire Wind project after it had already put $2.5 billion into building the infrastructure necessary to do the job. This is a $7 billion wind farm. Its loss means Equinor was damaged financially, possibly just because Donald Trump really hates wind power. Equinor’s reaction was that it will announce soon whether it will continue the project or withdraw. A story about this appeared at reNews.

Only a couple days after the news from Equinor, we had another story saying that National Grid was writing off $403 million because the Trump administration had created regulatory uncertainty. The story, also reported by reNews, was very similar to the one about Equinor’s losses.

Such developments mean that any company interested in investing in energy, or possibly in anything at all, can find places to do that without risking the losses it might face in the US.

5. Adopting solar power. It can be built, but will it be built fast enough?

Of the five sources of electricity listed above, I expect that only solar can really be built. One problem with that is that the factories making solar cells in the US will not be able to make enough of them, so the cells and panels will have to be imported. But the imported solar cells and panels will have tariffs. This is not ideal, by any means.

The result does not seem good for the United States.

To me, it is clear that in the next three years the amount of energy available in this country will probably not increase as fast as demand. There are countries in the world that would have been willing to help in earlier times, when America really was great, but this president has insisted on bullying everyone in sight, and he does not seem at all bothered by the fact that he is making enemies. This is only made worse by the fact that the people he thinks of as friends are not friends at all.

In short, the policies of the Trump administration look to me like they could create a perfect storm for energy, which is that the demand is increasing faster than the generating capacity. This administration would have to change direction to deal with that, or this country will not have enough energy.

On May 14th, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it plans to delay or rescind PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) drinking water standards established by the Biden administration.

PFAS are a group of human-made chemicals known as “forever chemicals” because they do not easily break down in the environment. They are ubiquitous in our modern world and have been used for decades in everything from non-stick pans to waterproof clothing to fire-fighting foam and beyond. These chemicals accumulate in the body and are associated with a variety of health harms. In 2024, the Biden administration established the first national drinking water standards for five PFAS.

EPA plans on maintaining the standards for the two most common PFAS—PFOA and PFOS—but will delay compliance deadlines for water systems by two years from 2029 to 2031. PFOA and PFOS have a maximum contaminant level of four parts per trillion, which is almost at the lowest level these chemicals can be detected.

EPA will also rescind standards for three other PFAS—PFHxS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA (commonly known as GenX Chemicals)—as well as a health hazard assessment for mixtures containing PFBS.

This announcement was met with mixed reactions. Environmental groups have generally criticized the decision, claiming it will worsen public health. On the other hand, some industry groups have given positive feedback, noting that the new rule will provide necessary time for compliance and an opportunity to better understand these chemicals. The timeline certainly provides some reprieve to water systems needing to meet the required standards. Background PFAS levels are already exceeding the maximum allowable limit in many places around the world. For context, PFAS were detected in Mt. Everest Base Camp snow and meltwater at concentrations up to 26.14 parts per trillion.

The workers at the more than 35,000 firms across the state are the backbone of our economy and make the essential goods that we rely on every day — from paper and medicine, to glass and coffee.

Unfortunately, the magnitude of this sector also makes it a significant source of climate-warming emissions and health-harming pollution, contributing in part to California snatching the top spots for the smoggiest cities in the U.S. for the 25th year in a row. Our state’s industrial sector depends on antiquated and dirty equipment, contributing a whopping 20% of overall greenhouse gas emissions — second only to transportation. Worse, this pollution is concentrated in low-income communities and communities of color that already bear the greatest brunt of environmental harms.

Industrial pollution has been referred to as “hard-to-decarbonize” for far too long. The truth is that nearly half of all emissions from the industrial sector can be eliminated with more efficient electric alternatives that are already commercially available. We can replace fossil-fueled equipment with existing and proven zero-emissions solutions like heat pumps and thermal energy storage, while also creating good jobs, strengthening our electrical grid, and bringing relief to the most polluted communities — and that’s precisely what Assemblymember Garcia’s AB1280 looks to do.

AB1280 would inject sustained funding into the California Energy Commission’s Industrial Decarbonization and Improvement of Grid Operations (INDIGO) program, which supports projects that reduce emissions and improve our grid’s reliability. The bill would also make low-cost loans available from the state’s green bank for industrial decarbonization projects, with requirements for union labor and priority given to projects that improve air quality in environmental justice communities.

The recipients of INDIGO grants were previously able to leverage additional funding from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstration and Loan Programs Office, programs which, now under the Trump regime, are being gutted and wielded to orchestrate the bidding of the fossil fuel industry. Now, dozens of clean manufacturing projects across the country that had been promised funding by the DOE are under threat of being cut — from glass factories in Modesto and Tracy to ice cream factories in Missouri and Tennessee.

As the administration attempts to drag us deeper into climate and pollution crises by locking us into decades of polluting equipment, California can and must move at double speed to forge ahead with a cleaner future — a future where living next to a tortilla chip factory or coffee roaster doesn’t mean you are more likely to get sick and die early, but instead that you have access to union jobs and clean air.

It could hinge on a single word: “Significantly.”

Three EPA administrations — including President Donald Trump’s first — have used Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to curb climate pollution in the power sector. The provision’s language asks EPA to determine whether a new stationary source “causes, or contributes significantly” to harmful air pollution.

Conservative legal experts — including some who worked in past Republican administrations — told POLITICO’s E&E News that EPA could reinterpret “significantly” to play down the role that carbon emissions from U.S. power plants and other domestic sectors have on global warming.

If successful, the argument could be used to undermine the endangerment finding — and the authority it granted to EPA to regulate six greenhouse gases. It would also allow the Trump administration to wage war on a single word — and how it has been used by Democratic administrations — rather than on the trove of scientific studies that offer evidence of the perils that climate change poses to people.

“These kinds of more finessed approaches are certainly smarter than taking on the endangerment finding head on,” said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. “Targeting specific rules is better than trying to tackle all of climate science.”

The White House regulatory office is reviewing a draft rule that would be used to scrap the power plant climate regulations that were finalized last year. The draft was submitted for review in record time — a mere 102 days after Trump’s second inauguration — and is widely believed to exclude a replacement rule for coal and gas plant emissions — a move that would leave the power sector unregulated for climate pollution.

The word “significantly” doesn’t show up in other Clean Air Act sections that govern how EPA weighs the dangers of pollution for the purposes of regulation. For example, the original Obama-era endangerment finding was drafted under Section 202 (a), which directs EPA to regulate pollutants from new motor vehicles if they “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”

Under that section, any level of harmful pollution triggers an endangerment finding, which in turn opens the door for regulation. EPA would likely aim to undo that broader finding, too, at a later date.

But the presence of “significantly” in Section 111 gives EPA more wiggle room. Other language does too, including phrases in the same section that give EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin the task of deciding what “significantly” means.

“‘Contribute significantly’ is not defined in the statute,” said Jeff Holmstead, who served as EPA air chief under President George W. Bush. “It’s the sort of term that the administrator has some discretion on.”

Zeldin is likely to define “significantly” differently from past EPA leaders, such as Gina McCarthy or Michael Regan, both of whom led the agency under Democratic presidents. Adler said EPA would have to account for that change in the rule.

“They will have to defend that change, and they will have to hope that their interpretation of ‘significantly’ is more convincing to the courts than the prior definition,” said Adler.

Future administrations could reverse any changes that Zeldin makes to the interpretation of “significantly.”

Future administrations could reverse any changes that Zeldin makes to the interpretation of “significantly.”

An agency spokesperson declined to provide details about its plans, saying only that the agency “will be kicking off a formal reconsideration of the 2009 Endangerment Finding in collaboration with the Office of Management and Budget and other relevant agencies.”

Attacking a word, not science

The administration’s efforts to repeal the power plant rule — and the endangerment finding — are coming as the power sector’s contribution to climate change has fallen.

EPA’s most recent greenhouse gas inventory, which the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group, released this month after obtaining it through a Freedom of Information Act request, showed that in 2023 the power sector contributed 31 percent of U.S. carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

But that share is trending down.

The power sector released 22.3 percent less carbon from fossil fuels in 2023 than it did in 1990, driven mostly by a transition away from coal-fired electricity. Transportation overtook power generation as the highest-emitting U.S. sector in 2016, and its lead has grown ever since.

The U.S. economy’s overall contribution to global CO2 emissions is also falling. In 2015, when the nation’s first climate rule for power plants, the Clean Power Plan, was finalized, the U.S. was responsible for 14.2 percent of the world’s CO2 emissions, according to Carbon Brief, a U.K. media outlet that covers climate change. In 2023, it was 13 percent.

So, EPA could argue that the U.S. power sector contributes less to the global problem of climate change than it did when the Obama administration first started using Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to regulate it.

“You don’t have to dig into the science, and you don’t need a huge record,” said Holmstead, who is an attorney with Bracewell LLP. “You know what power plant CO2 emissions are. We have great data on that. We know that as a percentage of global emissions, they’re continuing to fall.”

“I don’t think that’s a bad argument,” he said.

If EPA succeeds in defining power sector emissions as not “significant” to climate change, it could have a cascading effect. Other stationary source categories — like oil and gas facilities — could wiggle out of regulatory requirements created by the endangerment finding. Because they contribute smaller amounts of U.S. emissions than the power sector.

But EPA faces some obstacles to doing that. And at least one stems from Trump himself.

A week before Trump left office in January 2021, EPA published a final “significant contribution finding” in the Federal Register that attempted to define any sector that’s responsible for less than 3 percent of overall U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The idea was to identify emissions sources that had contributed too little pollution to warrant regulation. The finding said stationary sources like oil and gas production, iron and steel manufacturing, and landfills all fell comfortably below that threshold.

“It was an effort to protect smaller, but still important source categories from regulation,” said Sean Donahue, an attorney with Donahue Goldberg & Herzog. “It was an effort to pre-exclude them.”

But the finding affirms that power plants meet every possible criteria for being significant contributors of greenhouse gas emissions.

“Although emissions from [power plants] have fallen since the EPA promulgated the 2015 rule, they still remain uniquely large among stationary source categories,” it stated.

The power sector’s contribution to climate pollution was “greater than the emissions of all but four countries,” it noted, making it “the most appropriate place” for EPA and states to look for opportunities to reduce emissions.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the administration’s last-minute finding on procedural grounds. But it could still present a stumbling block for EPA, if it offers a radically different conclusion, said Donahue.

He said such an approach would be “indefensible.”

“Anyone who knows anything about climate change knows that it is inherently produced by multiple sources around the world, and that the only way you mitigate is by attacking at least the largest of those source categories,” Donahue said.

If EPA were to say power sector emissions aren’t significant enough to warrant regulation, he said, “I think you’re basically saying nothing would be.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/11/08/4d910b2b471aa87be8ed09c64c8f/u-s-congress-99592.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 07:03:00.771997

A recent report finds that, by stalling this program, Governor Hochul is keeping money out of New Yorkers’ pockets, slowing the transition to clean energy and preventing much-needed community investments.
Major energy savings for nearly half of the state: By 2035, cap-and-invest could help 46% of New York households upgrade to clean heat pumps — delivering up to $524 million in annual energy savings.
These collective efforts reflect a growing demand from diverse stakeholders across the state to expedite the implementation of the cap-and-invest program.
The Washington program, which has been in place for two years, has already raised $2.5 billion in revenue for community resilience, creating new jobs and funding the clean energy transition.","Last week, New York approved its 2025 budget, which includes $1 billion to invest in clean energy, energy efficiency and other programs that will reduce pollution and save New Yorkers money. Unfortunately, the benefits of these investments are overshadowed by the delayed launch of New York’s cap-and-invest program, which would provide billions more in savings to New Yorkers every year.

A recent report finds that, by stalling this program, Governor Hochul is keeping money out of New Yorkers’ pockets, slowing the transition to clean energy and preventing much-needed community investments. This decision is not just a bureaucratic setback, it’s a choice to withhold critical investments — between $61 and $126 billion over the first 11 years of the program — that will deliver cleaner air and energy savings to New Yorkers.

Key findings: What New Yorkers are missing out on

The report makes it clear: putting a price on pollution through cap-and-invest will generate revenue that can be directly reinvested into New York communities. Delayed implementation of cap-and-invest means New Yorkers are missing out on:

Direct rebates for 83% of New York households: The program would provide direct financial relief to the vast majority of New York families, with 46% fully insulated from any increased energy costs.

Major energy savings for nearly half of the state: By 2035, cap-and-invest could help 46% of New York households upgrade to clean heat pumps — delivering up to $524 million in annual energy savings. The average household could save up to $1,022 each year.

$30 million investment for communities disproportionately impacted by climate change: The program would provide $30 million in grants to invest in community-directed projects, such as green affordable housing, rooftop solar, electric buses and bike lanes, in New York communities most impacted by climate change.

Lower costs for the long term: The report finds that, with a higher price on climate pollution, cap-and-invest could help twice as many New Yorkers adopt money-saving clean energy technologies, while ensuring that most low-and-moderate income households are equally well off, if not better off, in terms of energy costs. Another report, also released this year by Resources for the Future in partnership with the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, corroborates these findings.

Cap-and-invest is essential for New York’s climate progress

Cap-and-invest was recommended by the Climate Action Council as a cost-effective, comprehensive strategy to meet the pollution reduction targets mandated by New York’s landmark 2019 climate law. State law requires the Department of Environmental Conservation to adopt regulations to ensure these targets are met, yet the deadline for finalization passed more than a year ago. Further delays make it more challenging to meet these commitments and postpone pollution reductions that would deliver immediate benefits to communities.

New Yorkers want climate action

Governor Hochul’s decision to delay cap-and-invest contradicts what communities across the state are demanding. Hundreds of organizations, including public health, business, environmental justice and community organizations are calling for swift implementation of the program so that it can start delivering benefits for New Yorkers.

New York Renews, a 370-member statewide coalition, has launched the Fund Climate Campaign and called for the immediate release of cap-and-invest regulations. New Yorkers for Clean Air, a coalition of more than forty organizations, is also urging Governor Hochul to release the anticipated program rules, emphasizing that advancing the cap-and-invest program will protect clean air, invest in infrastructure, lower electric bills and hold corporations accountable.

These collective efforts reflect a growing demand from diverse stakeholders across the state to expedite the implementation of the cap-and-invest program. And New Yorkers aren’t alone in wanting strong climate policies that deliver huge community investments. Voters in Washington state resoundingly defeated a ballot initiative in November that sought to repeal their state’s cap-and-invest program, rejecting the initiative and defending the program by a whopping 24-point margin. Over 500 organizations, including Tribes, labor unions, and businesses, came together to defend the program and the transformative investments it enables. The result of the ballot initiative showed that ambitious climate action is not only possible — it’s popular. The Washington program, which has been in place for two years, has already raised $2.5 billion in revenue for community resilience, creating new jobs and funding the clean energy transition.

New York has the chance to build on this success — and Governor Hochul has the chance to deliver savings for families, good-paying jobs, cleaner air and improved public health for all New Yorkers. At a time when the federal government is moving in the wrong direction, states like New York must step up to fill the void.",https://blogs.edf.org/climate411/wp-content/blogs.dir/7/files//Switchbox-Blog.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 11:05:22.157249

The U.S. nuclear power industry is about to experience its biggest shift in decades. The White House plans to announce new executive orders that could make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) largely powerless. These orders let the Department of Energy (DoE) and Department of Defense (DoD) skip the NRC’s strict rules. This will speed up the construction of new nuclear power plants.

For over 5 decades, the NRC has been the main government agency overseeing nuclear plant safety and licensing. But many experts and industry leaders say the NRC’s complicated rules and slow approvals have stopped new nuclear plants from being built.

The NRC’s licensing process has grown from a simple 50-page document to an overwhelming 1,100 pages. The last approved reactor needed about 12,000 pages of paperwork. It also had millions of supporting documents.

Because of these heavy rules and outdated 1970s standards, the NRC hasn’t approved any new nuclear plant designs since 1978. Former NRC Commissioner Jeffrey Merrifield said the agency “doesn’t know when to stop” with new regulations. This is a major reason why new nuclear projects struggle to move forward.

Why Both Political Parties Support Nuclear Energy

For the first time since President Nixon, both Democrats and Republicans agree on supporting nuclear power. Democrats want nuclear energy to help fight climate change and reach net-zero carbon goals. Republicans see it as vital for U.S. energy independence and creating new jobs.

Nuclear power is key to 3 big goals for the U.S.:

Nuclear Exports. The U.S. can regain leadership in exporting nuclear technology, which is expected to be a $1.9 trillion global market by 2050. Currently, China and Russia control two-thirds of this market.

National Security. Nuclear power supports the supply chain for nuclear weapons and is crucial for defense.

Energy Security. Nuclear energy offers a reliable, self-sufficient power source, helping reduce dependence on foreign energy.

Because of these reasons, Congress has passed multiple laws over the past decade to force the NRC to update and speed up its licensing process. But progress has been slow.

Other countries like Canada and the UK have already updated their nuclear approval systems. Canada is investing heavily in next-generation nuclear technology to amplify its clean power supply.

In 2024, the U.S. Congress passed the ADVANCE Act, which pushes the NRC to modernize. It aims to make reviews for advanced nuclear reactors simpler and faster. Still, the NRC has struggled to implement these changes.

Power Shift to the Department of Energy and Defense

The new executive orders will shift power away from the NRC and give more control to the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense. Both agencies strongly support nuclear energy and have large budgets to back new projects.

In 2022, the DoE started a $6 billion Civil Nuclear Credit Program. It aims to extend the life of current reactors and support new types of nuclear reactors. It’s also giving $1.5 billion to reopen the Palisades nuclear plant—the first such reopening in U.S. history. The DoE’s former secretary, Jennifer Granholm, said the U.S. needs to triple its nuclear reactors by 2050.

RELATED: What Does the U.S. Need to Triple Its Nuclear Capacity by 2050? DOE Explains

The DoD also uses nuclear power for its massive energy needs and owns mobile nuclear reactors. It can take risks that private companies cannot and has a budget that could fund enough nuclear power to cover 85% of U.S. electricity demand.

The DoD and DoE plan to team up and invest in advanced nuclear reactors. They aim to connect a new reactor to the grid in 3 years.

Why This Could Be a Historic Moment

These moves could kickstart a nuclear renaissance in the U.S., similar to the scale of the Manhattan Project during World War II. The government has signed contracts with companies to build advanced reactors by 2029. Billions of dollars in funding are expected to flow to this sector.

Experts believe this push will lower the cost of nuclear energy by about 60%, making it more competitive with other power sources. This could open new doors in uranium mining, nuclear fuel production, infrastructure, and nuclear tech investment.

What This Means for Private Nuclear Companies

The expected executive orders could be a game changer for private companies working on nuclear technology. Startups and energy developers have struggled for years. They deal with long delays, high costs, and complex paperwork to get approval for new nuclear reactors. Some applications have taken more than 10 years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars before a single shovel hits the ground.

With the NRC pushed aside, companies might finally have a faster path to approve and build new designs. This is key for startups creating advanced nuclear reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs). SMRs are smaller, safer, and easier to build than traditional plants.

Now, instead of waiting for NRC approval, companies may be able to work directly with the DoE or the DoD. These agencies are more supportive and flexible. They already have funding programs, partnerships with developers, and a goal to build advanced reactors quickly.

Private firms like TerraPower, X-energy, and Oklo have been waiting for years to move forward. Under the new system, these companies could see faster permits, more government contracts, and easier access to funding. They may even get a chance to work on national defense or grid reliability projects led by the DoE or DoD.

This shift could spark a wave of innovation, job creation, and clean energy development across the country. If it works, it could also encourage more investors to put money into nuclear startups—knowing the government is serious about getting projects built.

The Clock Is Ticking

With the new executive orders expected soon, the nuclear industry and investors have limited time to prepare for this wave of change. Many believe this could be one of the most important energy transitions in decades and offer profitable opportunities for those ready to act.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_1648635610.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 07:03:03.955319

Mammoth Solar South and Central expected to power around 200,000 Midwest homes

Bechtel has been selected by Doral Renewables to deliver three key phases of its 1.3 gigawattAC Mammoth Solar facility in Indiana. As one of the largest solar facilities in the U.S., Mammoth will play an important role in strengthening the U.S.’ supply of reliable, clean energy and boost total solar capacity in Indiana by more than 20%. The project kicked its construction activities to a higher gear earlier this month, and Doral Renewables has now granted Bechtel Full Notice to Proceed (FNTP).

Bechtel will design, engineer, and construct Mammoth South, Mammoth Central I, and Mammoth Central II, which together represent 900 megawattAC of clean energy capacity. Doral and Bechtel kicked off construction preparatory works earlier this year. The commencement of FNTP enables Bechtel to complete design and begin permanent construction works including installing solar panels, power cables, and substations.

“Bechtel is proud to partner with Doral to deliver one of the nation’s largest solar projects,” said Scott Austin, Bechtel General Manager of Renewables & Clean Power. ”A project of this scale depends on strong collaboration with local building trades to ensure access to the skilled workforce needed. We’re working closely with craft professionals, creating high-quality jobs, and being a reliable partner to the community as we help deliver Mammoth Solar and increase the supply of clean, reliable solar power.”

“Thanks to the meticulous planning and collaboration over the past several months, we are now poised to move confidently into construction” said Amit Nadkarni, Doral Renewables SVP of Project & Asset Management. “We remain deeply committed to the highest standards of safety, quality, and environmental stewardship throughout this phase. We are equally focused on fostering strong community relationships, ensuring meaningful local participation from the workforce and vendors, and supporting the county through direct, indirect, and induced economic benefits.”

Bechtel is leading the project’s design and delivery, overseeing all aspects of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, and project management. Over the next two years, the three upcoming phases will include the installation of approximately two million solar modules, one million of which will be US-made. Bechtel will apply its award-winning digital delivery approach and autonomous technologies to streamline construction and enhance project delivery.

At peak construction, the project is expected to create over 1,200 jobs, including at least 15% dedicated to apprenticeships that will provide hands-on training for young professionals and newcomers to the construction industry.

When complete in 2027, Doral Renewables will implement agrivoltaics initiatives across the site which includes integrating on-site livestock grazing and crop cultivation around the panels. This dual-use technique enables local landowners to continue farming operations and maximize land use.

U.S. regulators said Wednesday they will do away with limits on certain types of toxic chemicals in U.S. drinking water, a move that critics warn could expose millions of Americans to dangerous contaminants.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it intends to rescind limits set under President Joe Biden in April 2024 on four types of harmful per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals widely found in drinking water — perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and GenX.

The EPA will keep the limits of 4 parts per trillion in drinking water for two other types of PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), the agency said in a statement.

But, in another move drawing criticism from health advocates, the agency said it will delay the deadline for drinking water systems to comply from 2029 to 2031.

“This is a public health betrayal, plain and simple,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.

“Science is clear: PFAS are dangerous even in tiny amounts. The agency must protect all Americans, not just from two chemicals, but from the entire class of harmful PFAS.”

The four PFAS chemicals the EPA plans to roll back regulations for “are the ones currently in use because industry developed them to replace PFOA and PFOS, so they are the chemicals most likely to increase contamination in the future,” Betsy Southerland, a former EPA senior scientist and a former director in the agency’s Office of Water, said in a statement.

PFAS are types of chemicals that have long been used in a wide variety of products and industrial processes, but many have been linked to health problems that include certain cancers and immune system and reproductive harms.

Countries around the world have been pushing companies to eliminate the use of PFAS, known to be particularly dangerous, such as PFOS and PFOA, but the chemicals remain difficult to eradicate.

A recent study found residents of a Michigan community polluted with PFAS from a paper mill continue to have high levels of the chemicals in their blood, even though the mill closed down 25 years ago.

In Wednesday’s announcement, the EPA said it intends to provide “regulatory flexibility” and establish a new federal exemption framework around PFAS.

The agency said it will still work to hold “polluters” accountable, but the moves to lift limits on certain PFAS will help reduce the burden on water utilities that must clean up contaminated water that comes into their systems.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement.

“At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance. This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants. EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.”

The EPA also said it would defend the PFAS drinking water regulation from ongoing legal challenges from industry groups and utilities “with respect to PFOA and PFOS.”

Public water utilities applauded the EPA action.

“EPA has done the right thing for rural and small communities by delaying implementation of the PFAS rule,” Matthew Holmes, CEO of the National Rural Water Association, said in a statement.

“This commonsense decision provides the additional time that water system managers need to identify affordable treatment technologies and make sure they are on a sustainable path to compliance.”

States and water systems have been struggling to prepare to meet the 2029 compliance date set under Biden, said Alan Roberson, executive director of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators. The EPA plan to push the date back two years will help more systems comply with the rule, Roberson said.

In another PFAS-related regulatory move, the EPA announced May 12 that it intends to grant a nearly year-long delay to PFAS manufacturers and importers to achieve compliance with reporting requirements under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

While companies were supposed to start complying with the requirements this July, the new rule would push that to next April.

The EPA’s announcement also comes after PFAS maker 3M on May 13 agreed to pay up to $450 million over 25 years to settle claims that it contaminated drinking water in New Jersey.

Concerns about the fate of rules to limit PFAS in drinking water have led some states to move to cement protections, with California in February introducing a bill to adopt regulations at least as protective as those in the federal rule.

“After decades of delay, communities across the nation who were poisoned by PFAS polluters believed that help was finally coming,” said actor and environmental activist Mark Ruffalo in a statement.

“Today’s announcement is a bitter reminder that President Trump and his team are always going to put the polluters first. Now, it will be up to state leaders across the nation to make sure people are protected from these toxic chemicals in their tap water.”

A panel of NRC judges heard oral arguments this week to decide whether to hold a hearing.

The five groups — Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, Michigan Safe Energy Future, Three Mile Island Alert and Nuclear Energy Information Service — filed a motion to have the NRC’s Atomic Safety and Licensing Board reconsider several regulatory requirements for the restart going forward.

NuScale Power is in advanced discussions with several potential customers for its small modular reactor technology and could deliver an operating power plant in 2030 “if we get closure on a deal here soon,” CEO John Hopkins said Monday during a first-quarter earnings call.

NuScale remains on track for an expected July approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for its uprated 77-MW electric design, the company said in a news release Monday.

Manufacturing partner Doosan has 12 NuScale modules in production now and could deliver 20 per year as orders materialize, Hopkins said. NuScale envisions four-, six- and 12-module deployments, with plant outputs ranging from 308 MWe to 924 MWe.

Dive Insight:

NuScale continues front-end engineering work as a subcontractor for Fluor Corporation’s 462-MWe power plant project in Romania, but has yet to finalize a module supply deal of its own.

That could change soon, Hopkins suggested Monday, previewing a visit with executives from a prospective customer next month to Doosan’s module forging plant in South Korea.

“Our focus right now is to get closure on near-term contracts. We are no longer chasing or announcing [memoranda of understanding],” he said. “We’re actually in the process of submitting and negotiating term sheets. We’ve got customers that [want] to … touch steel.”

Possible early power customers include large data center operators, other heavy industrial customers and utilities, NuScale said in the Monday news release.

Any deal would involve multiple parties, NuScale Chief Financial Officer Ramsey Hamady said Monday. The module buyer would likely be a power plant operator, which would work with an offtaker, probably a “tier one data center or AI developer,” he said. Other parties could include a site operator, such as a utility, along with capital partners and NuScale’s exclusive plant development partner, ENTRA1.

NuScale’s focus on nuclear technology development and power plant services contrasts with advanced nuclear competitors like Oklo, whose “build-own-operate” business model encompasses a wider range of roles. NuScale’s contribution to SMR projects is akin to “the chip in the Dell computer,” Hopkins said.

Like Oklo, which inked a nonbinding agreement with data center developer Switch for up to 12 GW of capacity over 20 years, NuScale has openly courted IT and AI customers. But its Q1 2025 investor presentation highlighted its power plants’ usefulness across energy-intensive operations like large-scale hydrogen electrolysis, water desalination and brine waste processing, carbon capture and petrochemical production, as well.

It also reiterated the company’s “confidence in a firm customer order by the end of 2025.”

NuScale has about two years of operating runway on its current course, Hamady said. The company has “a few different revenue sources,” including the sort of pre-engineering work it’s doing on the Romanian power project, but a committed power plant project would change its financial outlook “in a positive way,” he said.

NuScale would expect to book about 25% of its revenue from module sales during the deal’s first year — enough to make the company cash-flow positive, Hamady said.

But Hamady cautioned that multiple orders in the first year might be a challenge given the present tightness of the nuclear supply chain. The hope is that supply constraints prove temporary, at least for NuScale.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/PxQ6-z9e8llYNae8IrAm6t8c-rxRT7gPNpyyRZodPhY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjA3OTQ2NjMxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-17 07:03:25.444050

The expansion plans were announced at a press conference with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and representatives from the Illinois Deparment of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO). Damera plans to invest over $31.5 million over four years for its expansion, with support from a Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois (REV Illinois) agreement. This will also create 90 new full-time jobs.

“Over the past six years, Illinois has pushed to solidify our status as a hub of the EV future and put our shoulder to the wheel to get that vision off the ground and on the road,” Gov. Pritzker said. “With this investment of more than $31.5 million–supported by state incentives–Damera will expand into our state and create 90 new full-time jobs. Through our competitive incentive programs, workforce development and other business attraction efforts, the state is bringing in companies like Damera that not only create jobs and opportunity for our people, but commit themselves to our communities.”

The Karsan eJEST has a capacity of 19 passengers and a range of 130 miles. Damera's Illinois facility will include assembly lines, testing zones, quality control, storage and administrative offices, as well as specialized areas for battery assembly, charging infrastructure and sustainability initiatives.

“As we continue to expand Damera Bus USA LLC’s presence in the United States, our commitment to fostering long-term growth and job creation in the Peoria area remains unwavering. This investment not only strengthens the local economy, but also creates hundreds of new opportunities for the community. We are proud to contribute to a vibrant workforce and are deeply committed to supporting the economic prosperity of the region,” said Damera COO Roger D’Hollander. “This investment aligns directly with the BAA waiver application we have put forward that will facilitate our expansion in the U.S. and help reinforce our long-term vision for the future.”

The company met Team Illinois at the SelectUSA Investment Summit in 2024, which is an annual event that offers state and local economic development teams the opportunity to network directly with international companies considering expanding or relocating to the U.S.

“Illinois continues to attract global leaders in clean energy and advanced manufacturing thanks to our skilled workforce, strong infrastructure, and bold vision for a sustainable future,” said DCEO Director Kristin Richards. “Damera’s decision to establish their first U.S. assembly plant in Peoria is a testament our strategic investments through REV Illinois, and it marks another step toward cultivating a greener economy for all Illinoisans.”

The administration's budget proposes eliminating the $326 million ecosystems research program administered by the U.S. Geological Survey.
The program supports the nine regional climate adaptation science centers and a national hub, as well as related research on toxic substances and invasive species.
The center’s researchers also study invasive species such as emerald ash borers and spongy moth caterpillars.
""The impacts of climate change are incredible expensive,"" Johnson said.","Managing invasive plants, protecting salt marshes and conserving the habitats of endangered species are just some of the projects at the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center that are threatened under a federal budget proposal from the Trump administration.

The center — which helps state and local partners across New England develop plans to adapt wildlife, water and land to the effects of climate change — stands to lose all of its funding, as do eight other centers across the country that form a national network focused on meeting the challenges of climate change.

The center’s leadership at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and its partners said the loss would hamper the work of natural resource managers at the local, state, tribal and federal levels who protect natural places that people use every day.

“If you like to watch birds, if you like to fish, if you like to go on walks in the forest, then you probably would care that ecosystems research is being cut at the federal level,” said Bethany Bradley, co-director of the center and a professor at UMass Amherst.

The administration's budget proposes eliminating the $326 million ecosystems research program administered by the U.S. Geological Survey. The proposed cut was first reported by Science Magazine. The program supports the nine regional climate adaptation science centers and a national hub, as well as related research on toxic substances and invasive species.

A White House statement announcing the spending proposal said it ""guts a weaponized deep state"" and eliminates funding for programs including what it calls the ""Green New Scam."" The statement said federal spending would be redirected toward President Trump’s priorities such as increased production of fossil fuels. The budget plan still has to be approved by Congress.

Staff at the center who could be working on upcoming projects or planning for an incoming class of graduate students are instead “ spending a lot of time gaming out scenarios of what happens if we lose funding tomorrow,” Bradley said.

“ It's just a lot of time and effort and mental energy and pain spent on unknowns,” she added.

The center employs 24 people, plus 14 graduate student fellows. Researchers said its focus on science that natural resource managers can use is beneficial to the public, even if it often goes unnoticed.

Brian Yellen, director of the Massachusetts Geological Survey, is working on a center-funded project to study the origins of coastal sediment. He said this research has implications for coastal areas and beaches.

“ Everyone likes going to the beaches. If we cut off all the sediment to the beach, no more beaches,” he said.

Yellen said research into sediment and how it’s changing due to rising sea levels can help natural resource managers in cities and towns make decisions about dam construction, street paving and erosion protections.

The center’s researchers also study invasive species such as emerald ash borers and spongy moth caterpillars. They’ve developed calendars in collaboration with Native American tribal leaders to guide management of invasive insects, provided information sheets that explain scientific research and concepts and hosted events on invasive aquatic knotweed.

“ We hear all the time from the folks that we're working with that things [in the environment] are changing,” said Emily Fusco, deputy director of the center. “Sometimes the science just isn't necessarily there yet, and they need that science developed. And that's really where our researchers come in.”

Fusco worries that closing the centers will harm research on habitats, rising sea levels and invasive species at a time when average temperatures are warming.

“ If we don't have the science to back up the decisions that we're going to be forced to make in the coming years and decades, then we're not gonna be able to make the best decisions,” she said.

Some center researchers wrote in a public statement that cuts would “deal a significant blow” to national efforts to protect biodiversity, and would add “to the economic burden of managing invasive species.”

Native Plant Trust CEO Tim Johnson said the loss of regional hubs like the Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center would create more ""blind spots"" in addressing the pricey effects of climate change.

""The impacts of climate change are incredible expensive,"" Johnson said. ""That's why it's in the interest of the federal government to have regional centers that help to address it and mitigate the risk.""

Yellen said this cut could do the opposite of what the Trump administration says it wants to achieve in terms of increasing government efficiency.

“ If we don't invest in the research,"" he said, ""we're ultimately wasting money on outdated practices that that may or may not work in a changing climate, in a changing environment.”",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/0620_beach-water-quality01-1000x667.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 07:03:57.977143

Schiller,,,,,https://www.curetoday.com/view/epa-deregulation-means-more-air-pollution-and-more-cancer-deaths,"While we will never know why these two particular women developed lung cancer, we do know that the incidence of lung cancer in women who never smoked is on the rise.
Most people know that smoking tobacco is the number one risk factor for lung cancer, but many people are unaware of the environmental factors that can contribute to lung cancer — such as air pollution.
Air pollution is a Class 1 carcinogen, as rated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and one cancer we know for certain that it causes is lung cancer.
Air pollution is responsible for about 14% of all lung cancer deaths worldwide and it can significantly affect the prognosis and treatment of lung cancer patients.
I urge everyone to stand up and call on Congress to protect these critical clean air programs and staff.","Recently, the American Lung Association released the 2025 “State of the Air” report, which shows that more people in more places across the United States are experiencing unhealthy levels of air pollution. This report comes out at a time when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making plans to roll back critical healthy air rules and granting pollution exemptions to power plants.

I am an oncologist and chair of the Steering Committee for Oncologists United for Climate and Health, and I can tell you that dismantling the EPA will result in more people hearing that they are diagnosed with cancer.

You may think that EPA cuts might not impact you, but they will. EPA is responsible for ensuring we all have clean air to breathe (and clean water to drink, among other critical things). These cuts will not only cause asthma, heart disease, etc., but will also increase the number of people who get cancer, and affect their outcomes and care.

There are a few stories that have remained with me throughout my career. I recall a young mother who had never smoked yet was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer at age 35. She was a physician, a mother of two, and a long-distance runner, and died of metastatic lung cancer about two years after her diagnosis. I remember another patient lung cancer– a 32-year-old emergency room nurse with no risk factors, raising two teenage daughters. She was divorced, and desperately worried about what would happen to her daughters when she was gone. Both women were “lucky” in that they survived long enough to see their children graduate high school, but they should have had decades left with their kids.

While we will never know why these two particular women developed lung cancer, we do know that the incidence of lung cancer in women who never smoked is on the rise. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for about 125,00 deaths each year. accounting for nearly one quarter of annual cancer deaths in the country. Even with the many newer, more effective treatments that have recently become available, the five-year survival rate of patients diagnosed with metastatic lung disease is only 6%. Most people know that smoking tobacco is the number one risk factor for lung cancer, but many people are unaware of the environmental factors that can contribute to lung cancer — such as air pollution.

Air pollution is a Class 1 carcinogen, as rated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), and one cancer we know for certain that it causes is lung cancer. Air pollution is responsible for about 14% of all lung cancer deaths worldwide and it can significantly affect the prognosis and treatment of lung cancer patients. It contains very small particles which are particularly dangerous and are widespread. These microscopic particles come from the burning of fossil fuels in factories, power plants, and diesel and gasoline-powered motor vehicles, as well as wildfires, which are becoming more frequent and intense as a result of our changing climate. Unfortunately, we are seeing the direct impacts of climate change in the recent devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, the Canadian wildfire smoke that impacted much of the Midwest and East Coast in 2023, the Maui wildfires later that summer, and too many others.

EPA rules passed in the last four years, including tighter national limits on this pollutant and rules to clean up emissions from cars and trucks, aimed to reduce particle pollution, but these rules are now at risk of being rolled back. I urge everyone to stand up and call on Congress to protect these critical clean air programs and staff.

I think back to my two patients who died too young from lung cancer. We must do more. The bottom line is that if the programs, expert staff and funding for the EPA are eliminated, there will be more air pollution and more cancer. We can — and must — prevent more needless deaths from lung cancer.",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/curetoday/c6dbadff291fa7b20dac44376c1ff6931e0a0f87-1200x1200.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format,N,,2025-05-17 03:00:35.253317

""These setbacks came from the Chamber of Deputies and remained in the report presented.","With specific changes, the new report of Bill (PL) 2.159 maintains the main content of the text approved in the Chamber in 2021, remaining the worst and most radical ever discussed in Congress on environmental licensing, according to experts and environmentalists.

The project is part of the so-called “Destruction Package” and was nicknamed the “Devastation Bill” due to the scope and severity of the possible consequences of its approval.

The opinion is expected to be voted on Tuesday (20), starting at 9 am, in the Senate's Environment Committee, and the following day, starting at 13:40 pm, in the Agriculture Committee. The express determination of the president of the House, Davi Alcolumbre (União-AP), is that it will then be considered in the plenary immediately.

Em technical note Released this Friday (16), the Climate Observatory (OC), the largest network of environmental organizations in the country, details the setbacks of the proposal point by point. It foresees the exemption of licenses for several enterprises and economic sectors, gives states and municipalities the power to increase this list and generalizes self-declaratory and automatic licensing, without prior analysis or control by any environmental agency, among other points.

The Bill also threatens indigenous and quilombola peoples by considering only their territories whose regularization has already been completed, for the purposes of environmental licensing of projects and economic activities that affect them (find out more in the box at the end of the text).

“By irresponsibly prioritizing the exemption from licenses and self-licensing, the proposal has the potential to worsen environmental degradation, representing a serious threat to fundamental human rights. The relaxation of studies, environmental conditions and monitoring could result in disasters and risks to the health and lives of the population, with the contamination of air, soil and water resources, in addition to the displacement of communities and the disruption of livelihoods,” the note says.

“[The opinion] is full of unconstitutionalities, promoting the fragmentation of regulations between states and municipalities and creating a scenario of legal uncertainty that tends to generate, as one of its main effects, a flood of legal proceedings,” it continues. “Instead of establishing clear, legally cohesive and effective rules, as expected of a General Law, the project paves the way for regulatory chaos and increased environmental degradation,” the document continues.

“It is not a question of speeding up licensing, but of imploding licensing,” warns OC’s public policy coordinator, Suely Araújo. “This proposal, if approved as it is, will represent the biggest setback in environmental legislation in the last 40 years, since the Constitution,” she continues.

“By exposing loopholes and weakening inspection, monitoring and impact assessment mechanisms, the text seriously compromises the State’s ability to protect ecosystems and vulnerable populations from economic ventures with socio-environmental impacts!” says Alice Dandara de Assis Correia, a lawyer at the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA).

'Controversial'

Presented on May 7, the opinion is the result of consensus between the rapporteurs in the Environment and Agriculture committees, respectively, Confúcio Moura (MDB-RO) and Teresa Cristina (PP-MS), former Minister of Agriculture under Jair Bolsonaro.

Last year, Moura presented a report that was considered reasonable by civil society organizations and the Ministry of the Environment (MMA). Since then, he has faced pressure to change it from ruralists and the National Confederation of Industry (CNI) as well as other sectors of the federal government. According to a government source, the pressure has increased in recent weeks.

The senator admitted that the new text is controversial. “I believe that the report will not satisfy everyone. There will be many dissatisfied people. It cannot satisfy everyone. No one can do this magic,” he commented.

""We have identified several points that, in our assessment, have always constituted a major setback and a dismantling of the licensing process in Brazil,"" Environment Minister Marina Silva told the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. ""These setbacks came from the Chamber of Deputies and remained in the report presented. We are holding an internal discussion within the government to possibly reverse these setbacks,"" she said.

Initially, there were more than 80 points of divergence between the opinions of the two parliamentarians. Since last year, they have been negotiating among themselves, with the government and ruralists exhaustively in an attempt to reach a consensus text.

The report was expected to be voted on the 7th, but its consideration was postponed to next week by an agreement proposed by the government leader in the Senate, Jaques Wagner (PT-BA). It is possible that new changes will be made to the text by then, according to the rapporteurs.

Pressures

Behind-the-scenes information indicates that Alcolumbre was under pressure to vote on the project quickly. Moura did not deny it. “It was a request from our president Alcolumbre so that we could reach an understanding to facilitate the vote. Otherwise, he would pull the projects and vote in absentia [directly] in the plenary,” he said.

For months, Alcolumbre and the Planalto have been pressuring the Minister of the Environment, Marina Silva (Rede-SP), and the Brazilian Institute of the Environment (Ibama) to authorize the exploration of oil by Petrobras in the mouth of the Amazon. The measure would benefit Amapá, the state of the parliamentarian. The reporter contacted the senator's office, but received no response.

At the CRA session where the text was presented, the discourse on the project was the usual: there would currently be an excess of environmental restrictions and the reduction of bureaucracy provided for in the proposal will bring investment and economic growth. The collegiate is dominated by ruralists.

“We can no longer fall for certain narratives. The environment is important, but we cannot accept that a transmission line cannot pass through the middle of a forest,” said Teresa Cristina.",https://socioambiental.org/sites/default/files/favicon-isa_0.ico,N,,2025-05-17 07:04:07.923297

Higher electric bills The House Republican bill would terminate clean energy investment incentives early, resulting in lower energy supply and higher energy prices for American households and businesses.

The House Republican proposal amounts to sabotage of an entire industry, effectively repealing the incentive effect of federal clean energy tax credits.
That amounts to $75 billion over the next decade in unnecessary expenditures on home electric bills due to the House Republican tax bill.","More expensive gas at the pump

Although many Americans are interested in switching to electric vehicles, the House Republican tax bill would strip away $190 billion over the next decade from households who are trying to buy one, abruptly cutting off the financial support that makes new, used, and leased cars more affordable. Those who do have an electric vehicle would soon be hit with a brand-new federal registration tax of $250 every year. Other sections of the bill terminate federal incentives for building electric chargers and bury the tax incentive program for onshoring battery manufacturing under unimplementable requirements. This creates significant financial pressure to slow electric vehicle sales.

As a result of the termination of these investments, Rhodium’s model finds that there will be between 22 million and 40 million fewer electric vehicles on the road in 2035. That means that roughly one-third of the families who would have switched to an electric vehicle in the coming decade will instead continue to drive gas-powered cars or trucks for lack of the financial support offered by these tax incentives. Considering that operating and maintaining an electric vehicle costs half as much as a gasoline-powered vehicle, this is a significant financial loss for the millions of drivers who will be denied their preferred choice of vehicle.

As for the millions of Americans who will buy new gas-powered cars and trucks in the years to come, this legislation will lead to worse gas mileage. For half a century, the federal government has set fuel economy standards for new cars, but the House Republican bill would repeal both the fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards. Another bill that recently passed the House would make state tailpipe pollution standards illegal. These changes would be an astounding legislative reversal of long-standing policies and would make it harder to find new models with improved gas mileage.

This all adds up to a lot more demand for gasoline. Millions of drivers who wanted to have an electric vehicle will instead continue to pull into the gas station every week, and new internal combustion vehicles will get fewer miles to the gallon than required under current policy. Supplying so much more oil is expensive, and this volume of additional demand is enough to move prices. The House Republican tax bill will raise gas prices 25 cents to 37 cents per gallon by the end of the decade, according to Rhodium’s model—up to double the entire federal gasoline tax that pays for federal highway funding.

As a result of this legislation, Americans will pay the oil industry an additional $339 billion in gasoline revenues by 2035, according to Rhodium’s central forecast. All told, these policy choices are projected to cost the average household $2,400 in unnecessary gasoline expenditures over the next 10 years.

Higher electric bills

The House Republican bill would terminate clean energy investment incentives early, resulting in lower energy supply and higher energy prices for American households and businesses.

Clean energy is the most affordable source of electricity and the primary driver of new power generation, accounting for more than 90 percent of new capacity added to the grid last year. With electricity demand projected to rise significantly in the next few years, in part due to a boom in data centers, continued growth of clean energy will be essential to meeting demand and preventing electricity costs from skyrocketing. By 2040, the U.S. is expected to need more than 700 gigawatts of new renewable energy just to maintain grid reliability. If clean energy incentives are terminated early, new projects will be harder to finance, and the United States risks not meeting the rising demand. In the first three months of 2025, nearly $8 billion in clean energy investments have already been canceled or downsized amid the uncertainty of tax credit continuation.

The House Republican tax bill would sabotage federal clean energy investment in several ways. To convince an investor to finance a project based on the full value of the tax incentive, a project would now need to accurately predict that not only can it commence construction, but that it can actually be placed into service by 2029, despite the uncertainty of the Trump administration’s chaotic permitting regime. Further adding to uncertainty, the proposal requires project planners to anticipate how and when the Trump administration may issue guidance for complicated new requirements about copyright holders, residency, and methods of accounting for so much as a molecule of various minerals for every component involved in the project’s supply chain. And, by curtailing provisions that allow projects to transfer their tax incentives to a wider variety of investors, more clean energy projects would need to seek pricey tax equity financing from Wall Street. The House Republican proposal amounts to sabotage of an entire industry, effectively repealing the incentive effect of federal clean energy tax credits.

The result of terminating federal clean energy investment is that the United States would build about one-third as much wind and solar over the next decade as currently expected. The grid would struggle to keep up with increased demand, which could lead to new factories or data centers being denied access to electricity. This would severely harm the competitiveness of American industry and technology.

For the average household, the termination of federal clean energy investments means that annual home electric bills would jump $70 by 2031, according to Rhodium’s model, due to a persistent increase in the price of electricity generation. That amounts to $75 billion over the next decade in unnecessary expenditures on home electric bills due to the House Republican tax bill. Other analyses predict even higher increases, with the Clean Energy Buyers Association forecasting an increase of $110 in annual household electricity spending by 2026, and Resources for the Future forecasting an increase of up to $145 in annual household electricity spending by 2035.

In addition to paying higher electric rates, many homes may require more electricity than they might have otherwise, as the bill also proposes to eliminate $105 billion in tax incentives for home energy efficiency improvements and for installing rooftop solar. At the same time, the administration is canceling programs such as Energy Star, which informs consumers about which appliances are the most energy efficient, and proposing to repeal several of energy efficiency standards.

Fossil fuels, meanwhile, would continue to receive billions of dollars in subsidies and face no new requirements about their foreign entanglements or supply chains, despite their volatility as an energy source that is vulnerable to manipulation by international cartels and causing terrible harm to the climate and public health.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/GettyImages-2207939968-CROPPED.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:55.250378

Similar findings have environmental groups across the country criticizing a proposal by the Trump EPA to roll back regulations designed to remove forever chemicals from the nations drinking water. The deadline for removing the substances, broadly known as PFAS chemicals, would be extended to 2031. Meanwhile, regulations for a separate chemical class with names like GenX, and PFNA would be temporarily eliminated.

David Lewis is with the nonprofit Save the Bay.

""The Environmental Protection Agency -- since the Nixon administration created it -- has been the first line of defense in protecting public health and our environment from hazardous chemicals, hazardous waste, and trying to keep our water and air clean, so that we can live and survive and thrive. So, dismantling these cornerstone laws and protections for all of us is a big mistake,"" Lewis said.

During a heated senate hearing this morning, democratic lawmakers grilled new EPA head Lee Zeldin on the Trump administrations environmental priorities.

""It seems to me the Trump administration's entire vision for your agency amounts to burn it down,"" said Sen. Patricia Murray of Washington state.

Zelden answered back, claiming early environmental accomplishments.

""I would encourage you to read the announcement that we put out the morning of the president's 100th day that has 100 environmental wins from the first 100 days of the Trump presidency. I don't know if you've had an opportunity to read it yet, Zelden said.

But others pointed to the freezing of environmental grants, which have fallen heavily on nonprofits here in the Bay Area, along with concerns about potentially slow-walking EPA programs approved by congress, like restoration work on San Francisco Bay.

Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon accused the administration of purposely violating the law.

""We're going to treat these laws as suggestions. We're going to freeze these funds for programs we don't like or regions we don't like or congressional districts we don't,"" Merkley said.

Back in the Bay Area, environmental groups are turning to the state--which already has passed its own tougher restrictions on forever chemicals--and hoping to raise public concern among the estimated 158 million Americans who come in contact with PFAS in their drinking water.

""The EPA has been regulating hazardous chemicals and should be regulating PFAs, should be eliminating this from products and also helping us tackle PFAs and microplastics in all the different sources, so that less of it gets into our water, less of it gets into our bodies,"" Lewis said.

Winning the AI race starts with unleashing advanced nuclear energy.

Every technological revolution has been powered by immense energy. Artificial intelligence is no exception.

AI’s future hinges on energy. As U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright put it: “The United States will win the global AI race — but first, we must unleash our energy dominance and restore American competitiveness.”

AI is already changing the way we live and work. It’s taking on the busywork — scheduling meetings and automating tasks — so we can focus on what really matters. Soon, AI won’t just assist us. It’ll be our personal secretary, booking our flights, managing our calendars and handling tedious admin work.

AI, though, is about more than convenience. AI is overhauling industries, accelerating breakthroughs in healthcare and science, optimizing manufacturing and improving infrastructure by detecting faults and preventing maintenance issues before they escalate.

AI’s success depends on high-performance computing power and access to steady, abundant energy. Data centers demand 24/7 electricity — every second of downtime costs millions. Yet AI models are growing at an unprecedented rate, pushing electricity demand beyond what our power grid can handle. By 2030, data centers could consume twice their current share, reaching 4% of global demand, Deloitte forecasts.

To stay ahead, America must secure a resilient, always-on and dispatchable power source — one immune to weather disruptions and pipeline constraints. Nuclear power is the only energy-dense source that checks all those boxes — providing constant, carbon-free and scalable electricity to sustain AI’s rapid growth.

Some argue that AI models will become more energy-efficient, tempering demand. But history says otherwise. Every time technology becomes more efficient, adoption surges. Efficiency gains didn’t slow the rise of personal computers in the 1980s or curb digital expansion — if anything, they accelerated both. AI will follow the same path, pushing electricity demand even higher.

Critics argue that AI development should be slowed or halted, fearing its disruptive impacts on society. While these concerns are valid, the AI race is already well underway. If it can't be stopped, the U.S. must lead in developing AI as a tool for progress and innovation.

DeepSeek, China’s AI breakthrough, rattled global markets by revealing Beijing's AI capabilities. If left unchallenged, China could surpass the U.S. in everything. America cannot afford to find itself one day reliant on Chinese-controlled data centers, AI models, or infrastructure.

AI and nuclear complement each other. AI makes nuclear safer, more efficient and affordable, while nuclear provides the energy AI needs to thrive.

AI is already revolutionizing nuclear operations. Each reactor generates billions of pages of operational data. AI can digitize and analyze these archives, streamlining regulatory compliance, optimizing fuel cycles and enhancing safety through predictive maintenance.

At California’s Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, AI is already in action: streamlining document search and retrieval, reducing the time required to access critical information and boosting operational efficiency. This marks the first commercial use of generative AI at a U.S. nuclear power plant.

Meanwhile, private industry is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy's national laboratories to develop open-source AI models capable of interpreting complex nuclear terminology with unmatched precision. These efforts are setting new benchmarks in nuclear data analysis, giving operators with faster and more accurate access to critical insights.

Even the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission stands to benefit from AI-driven tools. Right now, licensing approvals for new nuclear projects are slowed by fragmented, paper-based systems. AI could streamline these processes by digitizing regulatory records, enhancing their searchability, reducing bureaucratic bottlenecks and accelerating the deployment of advanced reactors.

Nuclear developers and operators, alike, can use AI-driven simulations to improve reactor designs, predict reactor performance, adjust power output in real-time and maximize efficiency. These innovations will lower costs and extend reactor lifespans.

The path forward is clear:

First, ensure rapid deployment of advanced reactors — starting with sustained federal support for the Trump administration’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, matched dollar-for-dollar by industry.

Second, prioritize AI-driven nuclear innovation. America must lead in advanced reactor designs, outcompeting rivals.

Third, recognize nuclear energy as a national security asset, crucial for securing long-term prosperity and security in an increasingly divided and competitive world.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/OL2TrYZVzQoCmtMYRjPvbB5lc0YzeWciPv3byyTEFY0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9EaWFibG9fQ2FueW9uX051Y2xlYXJfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-05-17 07:03:30.698195

With so much attention focused on electrifying vehicles on roadways across the globe, it’s not surprising that their market share is growing.

In fact, a new report from the International Energy Agency said one in four cars sold worldwide in 2025 is expected to be electric, and EVs could account for over 40% of global car sales by 2030 if the adoption of these alternative-fuel vehicles stays on its current trajectory.

Driving electric vehicles has also become more practical, thanks to enhanced battery life as well as the increased prevalence of charging stations in parking lots across America, even in small towns and areas where you might not expect to find them.

With so much going for them, you might assume that it’s all smooth sailing for manufacturers producing electric cars. However, recent news suggests otherwise, as headline after headline shows companies are struggling with these products.

The company had announced last year that it would be developing an electric vehicle supply chain within Canada. This project included spending $15 billion on an electric vehicle plant in Ontario, locating a standalone battery manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ontario, where it currently has facilities in operation, and building new facilities in Ottawa.

The project was slated to result in the production of 240,000 electric vehicles every year after it became operational in 2028.

Now, however, Honda says this isn’t happening – at least not right now. That’s despite the fact Ottawa had offered $2.5 billion in tax credits and Ontario had promised $2.5 billion in indirect and direct support.

While Honda claims the deal isn’t dead, the company did say that it would be on hold for at least two years.

Tariffs and low EV demand kill production

Tariffs may have played a role in the plant delay, with Honda Motor Co. reporting in its recent financial results that new tariffs expected within the United States would hurt the company’s earnings. However, it was likely the weak performance of electric vehicles that played an instrumental role in the decision to delay the new plants.

""Due to the recent slowdown of the EV market, Honda Motor has announced an approximate two-year postponement of the comprehensive value chain investment project in Canada,” Ken Chiu, a Honda Canada spokesperson, said in an email to CBC News. “The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change.""

But Chiara and other investors have made a new offer, which must be approved by the court. Under their plan, Lion would focus exclusively on building electric school buses at its plant in Saint-Jerome.

Article content

The firm has already shut down its bus manufacturing plant in Joliet, Illinois, as well as a battery pack assembly plant in Mirabel, Que.

Article content

The Quebec government has committed to renew a provincial program that gives substantial incentives to buyers of electric school buses, according to a personal familiar with the matter. Lion is the country’s sole manufacturer of such vehicles.

Article content

Lion surged during the electric vehicle boom, but suffered from delays in subsidy and incentive programs in Canada and the U.S., supply chain disruptions and challenges with scaling up the business to profitability.

Article content

As part of its bankruptcy filing, Lion disclosed that it owed more than $244 million to secured and non-secured creditors, according to its court-appointed monitor. National Bank of Canada and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec are among them.

Trump.

The agreements will potentially enable $60 billion of US investments in UAE energy projects across the lifespan of the projects.

The agreements include a landmark field development plan with ExxonMobil and INPEX/JODCO to expand the capacity of Abu Dhabi's Upper Zakum offshore field through a phased development.

ADNOC also signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Occidental to explore increasing the production capacity of Shah Gas field's capacity to 1.85 billion standard cubic feet per day (bscfd) of natural gas, from 1.45 bscfd, and accelerating the deployment of advanced technologies in the field.

The agreements reinforce the shared commitment of the UAE and US to maintaining global energy security and the stability of energy markets. The enterprise value of UAE energy investments into the US is set to reach $440 billion by 2035, as part of the UAE's $1.4 trillion investment plan into the country.

Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology, ADNOC Managing Director and Group CEO, said, ""The deep-rooted bilateral relationship between the UAE and the US is underpinned by our shared commitment to enabling energy abundance and we are reinforcing this commitment through these agreements with US energy majors. We see significant opportunities for further UAE-US partnerships across the energy-AI nexus and we look forward to working with our American partners to unlock long-term sustainable value and drive socioeconomic progress.""

The US is a top priority market for XRG, ADNOC's global energy investment company, and the company is set to boost investments across the American energy value chain focusing on expanding gas, LNG, specialty chemicals and energy infrastructure.

Building on its ambitious investment plans for the US, XRG signed a framework agreement with Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive to evaluate a potential investment in a direct air capture (DAC) project in Kleberg County, Texas. The facility would remove up to 500,000 tons of CO per year using commercial-scale DAC technology, with XRG considering a capital commitment of up to one-third of the project's total development cost.

Abu Dhabi's Supreme Council for Financial and Economic Affairs (SCFEA) also granted a new unconventional oil exploration concession to EOG Resources Inc. (EOG), a leading US-based hydrocarbon exploration and production company. The award for Unconventional Onshore Block 3, which covers a 3,609 square kilometre area within the Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi, is the first award of its kind to a US company and underlines the attractiveness of Abu Dhabi's energy sector and its position as a trusted investment destination. ADNOC will oversee and assist with exploration activities in the concession and has the option to join a subsequent production concession.

The phased field development plan for Upper Zakum will leverage AI and industry-leading technologies and the deep expertise and strong partnership between ADNOC, ExxonMobil and INPEX/JODCO to sustainably grow production capacity and help meet rising global demand with industry leading low-carbon intensity barrels. Upper Zakum is part of the Zakum field which is the world's second largest offshore field.

The plan will upgrade the Upper Zakum's infrastructure to include AI-enabled remote operations, receive power from the UAE's clean energy grid to reduce emissions, and enable the use of artificial islands for drilling activities to enhance environmental protection. Upper Zakum field is located 84 kilometres northwest of Abu Dhabi.

Shah Gas field is one of the world's largest of its kind and is located 180 kilometers southwest of Abu Dhabi. The potential expansion of the facility will provide more gas for domestic industrial growth and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export.

Medicaid Medicaid, the federal health program for kids and people with low incomes, has been a flashpoint during reconciliation talks among Republicans.

House Republicans also want states to pick up more of the tab.
As with many other parts of the package, House conservatives are pushing for the full slate of credits to be eliminated, while moderates are pushing their leadership to preserve some.","Next week, the U.S. House is expected to vote on a reconciliation package that extends the Trump tax cuts, adds new temporary tax breaks, increases spending on defense and border security, rolls back climate action, lifts the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, and more. It would be Republicans' chance to reshape the federal government and social safety nets to carry out big pieces of President Donald Trump’s second-term agenda.

There was good news for Republicans in the package, with some committees cutting more money than tasked and the Congressional Budget Office saying the tax portion would come in under $4 trillion. But for the budget hawk wing of the party, there was plenty of bad. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projected it would add approximately $3.3 trillion to the debt over 10 years, while increasing annual deficits to $2.9 trillion.

While the different pieces passed through committees on party-line votes, different factions of the House Republican caucus are unhappy with various elements. This means it is likely to change before it hits the House floor.

Adding to the uncertainty, Senate Republicans are also expected to change the package, while other provisions included in the bill may not survive that chamber’s Byrd Rule, which states reconciliation must be limited to budget changes, not policy ones.

Still, here’s a look at how some of the elements in the House reconciliation package that could have the biggest impact for Colorado and Coloradans.

Taxes

The bill would extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals. (The business tax cuts were already permanent.) Without this action, tax rates will go back to pre-Tax Cuts and Jobs Act rates, meaning they would increase for most brackets, including raising the top bracket from 37 percent to 39.6 percent.

It increases the standard deductions by $1,000 for a single filer and $2,000 for married filing jointly. It expands the Child Tax Credit to $2,500 per child. The package also includes a number of issues Trump ran on, including ending federal taxes on tips and car loan interest. It does not include no tax on Social Security, but does give seniors an extra $4,000 deduction. These policies, though, are all temporary and would expire at the end of 2028, as Trump leaves office.

Reconciliation would also ends the IRS’s Direct File program, a free online tax filing service that the IRS is in the process of rolling out to states. Coloradans would have been able to use it to file their taxes starting next year. Instead, Republicans want to set up a public-private partnership to replace the free service.

Overall, an analysis by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculated that the tax changes in the Reconciliation package will benefit those in the top tax brackets more so than the lower brackets.

Medicaid

Medicaid, the federal health program for kids and people with low incomes, has been a flashpoint during reconciliation talks among Republicans. It’s one of the country’s most costly mandatory spending programs. Fiscal conservatives had wanted to see drastic changes to pare it back, but other Republicans, worried about the impact on their districts, had warned against cutting too far.

Instead, the House provisions look for savings, in part by, expanding work requirements. People age 19 to 64 would have to work, go to school or volunteer at least 80 hours a month to receive Medicaid, but there are exemptions, such as for pregnancy or people with complex medical issues.

States would also have much more paperwork ahead of them, by having to check eligibility for Medicaid patients every six months, instead of annually.

It also raises copays for people who make between 100-138 percent of the federal poverty level. And would prohibit Medicaid funds from being used at Planned Parenthood clinics or for “gender transition procedures.”

The two biggest provisions that would hit Colorado, however, have to do with immigrants and the so-called provider tax.

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid. But Colorado and 11 other states use state funds to provide health coverage to at least some people without legal status. The government would push states to change their policies by dropping their federal matching rate (FMAP) for Medicaid expansion from 90 percent to 80 percent.

The bill would prohibit Colorado and other states from establishing any new provider taxes or increasing the existing tax, known in the state as the Hospital Provider Fee. States charge the fee to medical providers in order to draw down more Medicaid dollars, which the providers then benefit from. It’s helped keep some of Colorado’s rural hospitals afloat.

The Congressional Budget Office found 10.3 million people nationwide would lose Medicaid coverage, while millions more would lose insurance due to Affordable Care Act changes.

Many of the changes, like expanded work requirements, would not take place until after Trump leaves office. But House conservatives want to see that date moved up so savings kick in faster.

Food Aid

The House bill also expands work requirements to qualify for SNAP, the program often called food stamps, including to those with child dependents as young as 7. Currently, caregivers are exempt from working if they have dependents younger than 18.

House Republicans also want states to pick up more of the tab. The bill would require states to cover 75 percent of administrative costs, up from 50 percent. And, in a first, it would make states pay for the cost of the program, too. Republicans proposed a sliding scale based on a state’s payment error rate; states with lowest error rates would have to cover 5 percent of the cost, states with higher rates would have to pay up to 25 percent.

In FY23, Colorado had a payment error rate of 8.6 percent, while the national average error rate was 11.6 percent. Based on that rate, Colorado would have to cover 20 percent of its SNAP costs, something that the state, which is required to have a balanced budget and has to operate under the revenue constraints of TABOR, would be hard pressed to do.

Energy and Climate

The bill guts several elements of former President Joe Biden’s tax, climate and health law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act. It would rescind unobligated funds for clean energy programs, while promoting increased fossil fuel production. For example, the package creates an expedited permitting process for new wells — if companies pay a $10 million fee, they could get approval within 12 to 18 months and would limit legal challenges to their permits.

It also rescinds unobligated funds for programs related to clean air and greenhouse gas reductions, such as efforts to monitor air pollution in schools, and it ends energy efficiency improvements and clean energy credits for homeowners this year. The package also rescinds tax credits for pre-owned and new EVs at the end of this year. There is a provision that will allow manufacturers to start collecting the new EV credit if they haven’t sold 200,000 new clean vehicles by the end of the year.

It has an early phase out of tax credits for clean electricity production, clean electricity investment, zero-emission nuclear power production, clean hydrogen production, advanced manufacturing production (solar, wind, batteries). This could impact Colorado, where companies in some Republican-held districts have announced low-carbon energy investments fueled by the IRA’s incentives.

As with many other parts of the package, House conservatives are pushing for the full slate of credits to be eliminated, while moderates are pushing their leadership to preserve some.

Public Lands

The bill aims to increase fossil fuel, mining and logging on public lands.

Like with energy permitting, companies will be able to pay a fee for an expedited environmental review, conducted by the government or the company, and would be protected from judicial challenge. There would also be a fee for groups that want to file objections to oil or gas lease sales.

Oil and gas royalty rates would go down from 16.7 percent to the pre-IRA rate of 12.5 percent.

The bill would also prohibit the implementation of two BLM resource management plans in Colorado, one for the Colorado River Valley Field Office and the other for the Grand Junction Field Office. After decades of work, the plans were only finalized in the last year of the Biden administration.

A late amendment allows for the sale of some public lands in Utah and Nevada, stoking fears that this could be just the start of a larger sell-off. Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents Western and Southern Colorado, was the only Republican to vote against the amendment in committee.

Immigration and Border Security

The bill helps support a plan to remove 1 million immigrants per year from the country, and house up to 100,000 in detention centers at a time.

It gives more than $46 billion to construct new sections of a wall along the U.S. Southern border. It also includes more than $6 billion to staff up border patrol and customs officers. And it would require asylum seekers to pay a $1,000 fee to apply to enter the country.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/12/AP24319624163000-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 23:01:49.634169

More: House Speaker Says EV Tax Credits Are Likely Finished

However, if House Republicans succeed in their push, the company’s position could be further strengthened, but at a cost to legacy automakers like Ford and GM. The reason? A looming change to the Federal Tax Credit that currently helps all EV makers sell vehicles.

The Current EV Tax Credit System

At the moment, those who buy a new or used EV in America might qualify for one of two credits. New car buyers can qualify for up to $7,500, and used car buyers can get up to $4,000. These credits are in addition to various state incentives, such as the $5,000 credit in Colorado and $3,500 in Massachusetts.

To be eligible, the vehicle must meet certain requirements, such as North American assembly and specific sourcing of battery materials. SUVs and pickups are eligible for the credit if priced under $80,000, while regular cars must be under $55,000. Income limits also apply: individuals making under $150,000 and couples under $300,000 qualify. For leased vehicles, the credit goes to the leasing company, which often (but not always) passes on the savings to customers, contributing to a rise in EV leases.

That might not seem like a huge chunk of change considering the price of some EVs, but in reality, it plays a huge role in sales. For instance, in 2022, before the introduction of the tax credit, 96,000 EVs were leased. By 2023, that number skyrocketed to nearly 600,000. But a recent budget bill released on Monday proposes ending both the new and used car credits, along with several other non-automotive tax incentives.

A Slower EV Adoption Could Hurt Major Automakers

According to a report from the New York Times, Cox Automotive’s Stephanie Valdez Streaty believes that almost a third of car sales in 2030 will be EVs if the credit stays as it is. However, should the government get rid of it, that figure could drop to just 20 percent. Slowing the adoption of EVs wouldn’t just be a potential backsliding for environmentalists, it could hit big automakers like GM and Ford in a big way.

Those brands are still trying to get to the point where their EV businesses are profitable. And their far from it with their numbers. On the other hand, Tesla hit that mark long ago, so while other players will need to sort out new strategies, it can continue to reap the benefits of being the first to market in the way it was.

Other legacy automakers, such as Toyota, Hyundai, and Kia, have made significant investments in U.S.-based EV production, but they too could face a major setback if the bill passes. The removal of these credits would undermine the financial viability of the incentives that made their business cases profitable.

EV Startups Face Even Greater Financial Pressure

Although Tesla would also be impacted by the removal of the tax credit, it stands to gain in ways its rivals cannot. While Tesla may be able to withstand lower sales, many of its competitors will not have that luxury and could be forced to shut down. Newcomers like Rivian and Lucid, for example, would face immense financial pressure as their sales figures don’t support a profitable business model.

Even smaller, more recent startups like Slate would likely have to review their entire business plan. What, after all, is the point of a tiny EV trucklet with 150 miles of range, no desirable mainstream features, and a price that is as high as a Ford Maverick?

In the grand scheme, while Tesla will undoubtedly be affected, the long-term payoff could be substantial. It may emerge as the dominant force in the EV market with little to no competition to contend with. In other words, instead of having 45% of the EV market’s 33% of car sales, it could end up with double that of the predicted 20%.

In the grand scheme, Tesla will undoubtedly face challenges, but the long-term payoff could be massive. It might emerge as the dominant force in the EV market with little to no competition to contend with in America. Instead of holding 45% of the EV market’s 33% share of total car sales, Tesla might dominate nearly the entire 20% share that EVs are expected to capture in the 2030s if tax credits vanish, while also further extending its technological lead in the field.

If you’re considering a major energy-related purchase, uncertainty around President Trump’s plans to end Biden-era tax credits could end up costing you real money.

During his campaign, Trump was not shy about his stance on the Biden administration's signature energy law, the Inflation Reduction Act, calling it the ""Green New Scam"" and promising to repeal it. Now, that promise is starting to come to fruition.

More than 1.2 million Americans took advantage of the residential clean energy tax credit in 2023, getting money back after buying things like solar panels, home batteries and solar water heaters. More than 2.3 million American taxpayers claimed the energy efficient home improvement credit that same year for things like insulation, air conditioners, home energy audits and heat pumps.

But those credits were expanded as part of the IRA, and now that the campaign is over, all eyes are on the Trump administration as people try to work out what it will mean for the perhaps millions of Americans planning to use them.

Following recent news that tax credits for EVs and solar panels could end under a new proposal, it's understandable that people are concerned. That's why we talked to energy policy experts before Trump returned to the White House to get a sense of which home energy incentives were likely to stick around, which were most likely to disappear and whether any uncertainty should change how you think about those big financial decisions. Keep in mind that the situation is fluid right now, though, with the end of 2025 now looking set to be a watershed moment for any potential changes.

Can Trump eliminate home energy tax incentives?

Not with a single stroke of the pen. Most of the current home energy incentives, especially the big ones for things like electric vehicles and solar panels, are credits embedded in the tax codes. Congress has to change the tax code. Republicans will control both the US Senate and House of Representatives, but with very slim majorities. Because of that, passing legislation could be difficult.

Republican leaders in Congress are eyeing a process called budget reconciliation to tackle the incoming Trump administration's energy policies. That process has a lot of procedural restrictions, limiting what can actually be included in the resulting law, but it skirts the Senate's filibuster rules that would require a 60-vote supermajority for a bill to pass. (Republicans will hold only 53 Senate seats in the incoming Congress.) The IRA passed in 2022 using that same budget reconciliation process.

As to what could be in that bill, it's still up in the air. Legislative leaders have said as much, with House Speaker Mike Johnson saying they expect to take a ""scalpel"" to the IRA rather than a ""sledgehammer."" Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in early December that he doesn't yet know what programs will be targeted, according to E&E News.

""Congress appropriated the funds for the IRA,"" said Sheila Olmstead, a Cornell University professor who served as senior economist for energy and the environment at the President's Council of Economic Advisors in 2016 and 2017. ""To wholesale undo that would require work by the Congress again. [Trump] does have both houses, but by fairly narrow margins. Whether that would be achievable I think is an open question.""

An additional wrinkle is that a lot of the manufacturing investment spurred by the IRA's spending has happened in areas represented in Congress by Republicans, and lawmakers may not want to jeopardize jobs in their districts. In August, 18 Republican members of Congress urged against a full repeal because it could ""create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return.""

Here's what could happen to the biggest consumer-focused incentives.

EV tax credit: Endangered

President-elect Trump's transition team has stated they intend to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles.

The president-elect's closeness with Elon Musk, who owns EV maker Tesla, is unlikely to sway him to keep the credit. Musk said in July that taking away the subsidies would ""only help Tesla.""

If the federal government does eliminate the tax credit, at least one state might make up for it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has said the state could reinstate its rebate for EVs if the credit goes away. ""We will intervene if the Trump Administration eliminates the federal tax credit, doubling down on our commitment to clean air and green jobs in California,"" Newsom said in a statement in November.

Potential policy changes affecting EVs go beyond just the tax credit, Olmstead said. The administration could weaken fuel efficiency standards for vehicles, known as CAFE standards. ""What's driving a significant chunk of demand for EVs are those CAFE standards,"" she said.

Solar tax credit: Uncertain

The biggest single incentive for American homeowners to get solar panels is the residential clean energy credit, which the IRA expanded and extended. It currently provides a 30% tax credit on the cost of installing solar panels (along with batteries, geothermal heat pumps and a few other clean energy products) through 2032, when it starts to phase out. It existed before the IRA as the Investment Tax Credit or ITC, which was created in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, signed by President George W. Bush.

The credit could be scaled back, experts said, especially as Republicans in Congress look for ways to offset the budget impacts of the extension of broad tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration. ""They'll be looking for places to solve that problem,"" Olmstead said.

Gilbert Michaud, assistant professor of environmental policy at Loyola University Chicago, said he didn't expect the credit would be eliminated wholesale.

""Though the Trump Administration may attempt to scale them back, these programs have received significant support from Congress, the private sector and even rural communities in which energy projects are being built,"" Michaud said. ""More broadly, it'd be difficult to chop all of the IRA, and while I do think that they will try, some of these programs and incentives will remain intact.""

A scaling back of the solar tax credit could include an earlier phase-out or stricter requirements, said Zoe Gaston, principal analyst for US distributed solar at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. ""However, it is too early to predict.""

Changes to the solar tax credit would change the calculus for consumers, who currently bank on getting a significant portion of their investment in solar panels back when they file their taxes. It could also affect the availability of solar leases and power purchase agreements, in which a third-party company owns the solar panels on your rooftop and charges you either a lease payment or a per-kilowatt-hour charge. The tax credit, which goes to the company, makes that business model more affordable.

State solar incentives: Largely safe

While Congress might take a scalpel or some cutting object to the federal solar tax credit, it likely won't have any impact on state programs like net metering, in which you get paid for surplus electricity you sell back to the grid.

""It's also important to remember that state and local programs for renewable energy are largely shielded from federal intervention or overriding,"" Michaud said. ""Efforts such as state net metering programs, renewable portfolio standards and rebates and loan programs will stick around even with the change in DC, especially in bluer states.""

If the federal government does restrict incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency, states might pick up some of the slack, Olmstead said. Especially larger, more Democratic states such as California and New York.

Home energy efficiency tax credits: Uncertain

Another component of the IRA was a set of tax credits aimed at home energy efficiency. Under the residential clean energy credit, this includes uncapped 30% tax credits for geothermal heat pumps and solar water heaters. Under the separate energy efficient home improvement credit, it includes tax credits for things like efficient air conditioners, furnaces, water heaters, heat pumps, insulation, electrical system upgrades and more, all of which have caps on how much money you can get back for each.

Any changes to these credits would face the same hurdles as changes to the solar tax credit: Congress would have to do it.

A more likely outcome is that the Trump administration will roll back efficiency standards for appliances and lighting, Michaud said.

The situation is also different for state-administered home energy efficiency rebate programs, which provide additional financial help on top of the federal tax credits. Those programs are run by states using money distributed by the federal government, and the incoming administration could decide not to distribute any money that hasn't already gone out the door.

""If the money's already out the door, I think those programs will continue spending,"" Olmstead said. ""If it's not, anything could happen.""

Should you rush to buy home energy products in case tax credits disappear?

The practical effect of tax credits worth potentially thousands of dollars having an uncertain future is that people may be tempted to rush a purchase to take advantage while they can.

Keep in mind that anything that would qualify for a tax credit is a pretty big purchase, whether it's solar panels, a new HVAC system, a new water heater or a new electric vehicle. Those decisions aren't to be made lightly.

""Regardless of politics, I always suggest that folks make such energy investments if they feel the time is right for them,"" Michaud said.

If Congress does act in 2025 on these tax credits, that change could affect the 2025 tax year, meaning you should be careful assuming you'll get money back in the form of a tax credit for a purchase made starting in January.

Michelle Moore, who was fired March 27 from her board seat by President Donald Trump, spoke to the Chattanooga Times Free Press in her capacity as CEO of an energy nonprofit called Groundswell.

Some Republicans in the House want to fund $5 trillion in tax cuts partially by ending all tax credits for clean energy projects from the Inflation Reduction Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.

Other Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, whose district includes Chattanooga and a nuclear hub in Oak Ridge, want certain tax credits saved.

Fleischmann's district has landed $924 million in clean energy investments since July 2022, according to the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Rhodium Group. Another $349 million in clean energy projects has been announced in the district but not yet spent.

Moore's nonprofit, with offices in Washington, D.C., and Georgia, develops community energy savings and solar projects. An interruption to the tax credits could sink major infrastructure projects announced in the past several years, she said.

In an op-ed Moore wrote May 13 for Power Magazine, she said that U.S. demand for electricity could skyrocket in the next five years.

""When you look at the demand projections, the lack of market certainty places those projects at risk, and that places us all at risk of not having enough energy for the future,"" Moore said in an interview.

Novonix, an Australian battery materials company developing a $1 billion synthetic graphite plant in Chattanooga, has benefited from federal and local tax credits.

The company has said it enjoys strong federal support, though many Republicans have criticized Biden-era incentives to companies building out the electric vehicle supply chain.

Fleischmann was one of 26 House Republicans who sent a letter earlier this month to the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee urging him to maintain tax credits for nuclear projects in particular.

A majority of clean energy investments made or announced after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed are in House districts represented by Republicans, according to the Clean Investment Monitor.

Moore, who got a taste of partisan instability when she was terminated from the TVA board, said she hopes lawmakers of both parties are keeping affordability and reliability of power in mind.

""Economic development isn't about partisan politics,"" Moore said in her interview with the Chattanooga Times Free Press. ""These investments are going where they make sense.""

TVA, a federal utility that's self-funded through sales of electricity, provides power to 10 million people in seven Southeastern states.

Biden nominated Moore to the utility's governing body, where she often advocated for TVA to speed up deployment of renewable energy like solar and battery storage.

Trump directed Moore's termination without publicly stating why after the board selected the utility's former chief operating officer, Don Moul, as its next president and CEO.

The bill that could spell greatly reduced or eliminated clean energy tax credits faced a setback Friday after a group of conservative lawmakers voted against it in committee.

While not as far-reaching as some feared, these initial revisions would result in significant impacts to the clean energy programs and policies enacted through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This only begins the more public phase of a process that will likely stretch over weeks and months as House Republicans shape a bill that can satisfy a diverse party of deficit hawks and moderates from Democratic-leaning districts. With a slim seven-vote majority, Republicans have little room for maneuvering. Getting agreement from a Republican Senate majority could prove equally challenging. This initial bid, then, will likely end up being a worst-case floor for the process ahead.

House Energy and Committee Release

The House Energy and Commerce Committee released their portion of the reconciliation bill on Monday, May 12, and then approved the communications, energy, and environment subtitles as presented on Tuesday night. These portions would claw back $6.5 billion in unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds as well as unobligated dollars from the Environment Protection Agency’s (EPA) Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and the Department of Energy’s (DOE) offices and programs. Republicans have not released information on how much they expect to claw back from each of these programs. The GOP bill would also delay implementation of the IRA’s methane fee for oil and gas companies by 10 years and repeal two Biden administration rules aimed at speeding adoption of electric vehicles.

During the markup on Tuesday, Committee Republicans defeated three amendments proposed by Democrats to the energy subtitle that would have ordered a study on the bill’s impact on energy costs, required the Energy Department’s inspector general to certify that the permitting provisions would not increase corruption, and force the Secretary of Energy to certify that tariffs on energy imports were lower than they were before the Trump administration took office in January 2025. On the environment subtitle, Republicans defeated Democrat amendments aiming to protect funds for environmental and climate justice block grants, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and air pollution reductions at schools.

After a marathon of protests and contentious debate over proposed changes to Medicaid, on Wednesday, May 14, the Committee passed the health subtitle out of committee by a party-line vote of 30-24.

Ways and Means Release

The House Ways and Means Committee also released their bill text on Monday, May 12, and then passed the text along a party-line 26-19 vote on Tuesday night. Regarding the IRA tax credits, the text would repeal the $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicles at the end of 2025, except for manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 EVs since 2009, which would be allowed to continue claiming it through the end of 2026. The legislation also terminates the hydrogen fuel production credit (45V) by the end of the year and would phase out the nuclear power credit (45J) by 2031. The advanced manufacturing production tax credit (45X) would be maintained, though wind energy components would no longer be eligible after 2027. The bill also eliminates transferability for 45X after 2027 and adds a new prohibition on foreign entities of concern (from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran) claiming the credit. There is also a provision targeting the tax-exempt status of terrorist-supporting organizations, which environmental groups have feared Trump might attempt to use to target them. Democrats offered a host of amendments to preserve the tax credits; all were voted down.

On the positive side, the bill maintains the credit supporting carbon capture (45U), while extending subsidies benefiting biofuels that are backed by the fossil fuel and agriculture industries.

Where We Go from Here

The House Budget Committee is scheduled to vote on Friday, May 16, on the legislation combining the reconciliation texts of all committees. A group of 12 Republicans have already written a letter urging changes to the IRA tax credit provisions. The group’s three suggestions include revising the foreign entity of concern provision to give companies more time to reorganize their supply chains, tweaking standards for when companies qualify for credits, and keeping the practice of “transferability” through 2031, when certain incentives would sunset. Industry associations continue to meet with congressional offices this week asking them to preserve the credits.

The House is looking to push the bill through the entire chamber next week before Memorial Day, with Senate action to follow. However, even if House GOP leaders manage to pull the mega bill together, the Senate is poised to revise many of the policies. Already, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) warned that Ways and Means’ proposal to phase out technology-neutral clean electricity tax credits beginning in 2029 would kneecap newer technologies that Republicans favor, like advanced nuclear reactors and geothermal, that are not ready to be deployed at large scale. Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) said she expects the House GOP’s “blanket approach” to the IRA tax credits to change and that “there has been a lot of job creation around these credits.” Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND) agreed there will be “some change” to the tax credits and called the House GOP pitch a “starting point” to negotiations with Senate Republicans. Some Senate Republicans are also pushing back against the proposed changes to Medicaid and are unhappy with state and local tax (SALT) provisions.

Tuesday’s markups represent a significant step in the reconciliation process, but they are unlikely to reflect the final contours of the legislation. With major policy disagreements still looming, the bill is expected to evolve substantially as it moves through both chambers of Congress.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15407_5806.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:10.841778

The Section 48E clean electricity investment credit and Section 45Y clean electricity production credit fare a bit better—the credits would be phased out by 20% each year starting in 2029 and fully phased out after 2031 (depending on when the project is placed in service). The Section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit for the manufacturing and sale of solar panels and batteries (and mining of critical minerals) would also expire for sales after 2031 (for wind energy components after 2027). The Section 45Z clean fuel production credit would actually be extended by 3 years (through 2031), but would only be available to fuel produced from feedstocks that are produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Foreign Entities and Assets.

This morning, Tesla launched a $1,000 off promotion to Lyft drivers who plan to utilize one of the company’s EVs for ride-hailing purposes. The promo applies to all five Tesla models: the Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and Cybertruck.

It is not offered at the point of sale. Instead, to ensure the vehicle is properly utilized for ride-hailing purposes and to prove the discount, Tesla will offer $1,000 in vehicle credits to the Lyft driver after they complete 100 trips on or before July 13, 2025. Delivery must be taken by June 30.

It is an interesting move by Tesla because Lyft, along with Uber, will become a rival in the coming years as the companies continue to develop driverless ride-hailing platforms of their own. Lyft has partnered with May Mobility and Mobileye to develop driverless, fully autonomous vehicles purpose-built for ride-hailing.

Tesla plans to launch its Robotaxi platform next month in Austin, Texas.

Tesla hints at June 1 launch of Robotaxi platform in Austin

Meanwhile, Lyft’s plans are more down the road. Earlier this year, the company said it would launch autonomous rides sometime next year.

For now, the move seems to be just another way Tesla is incentivizing consumers to buy one of their vehicles. Earlier this week, it also launched another $1,000 off promo for teachers, students, retirees, active-duty members, their spouses, and surviving spouses.

Previously, Tesla only offered that discount to military members.

It is unclear why Tesla would be offering these discounts, but it could be more of a thank you or an act of recognition, more than anything. If it were a measure that was taken to increase demand, it would be substantially more of a discount. For example, when Tesla was trying to rid its inventory of legacy Model Y units as the new, updated vehicle was set to be released, discounts were over $5,000.

Tesla may be doing something quite special in the Giga Berlin-Brandenburg complex. Based on observations from a recent drone flyover of the site, it appears that Tesla may also be using FSD Unsupervised to move freshly produced Model Y vehicles to the factory’s staging area.

New Drone Footage

Recent footage of the Giga Berlin complex from longtime Tesla watcher Tobias Lindh included several interesting updates around the Model Y factory. These include a new warehouse that is currently being built, as well as a tunnel is currently being constructed. More interestingly, the drone operator observed that some cars now seem to be moving to Giga Berlin’s distribution area without human drivers.

If the drone operator’s observations prove accurate, it would be quite an impressive accomplishment for Tesla. FSD Unsupervised, after all, has only been confirmed in vehicles that are produced at the Fremont Factory and Gigafactory Texas.

Potential Next Steps

If Giga Berlin is now using FSD Unsupervised to transport some Model Y units from the factory building to the site’s staging area, it might only be a matter of time before Tesla also implements a similar system for Gigafactory Shanghai. The Shanghai-based Tesla plant, after all, is the company’s largest factory by volume, and it also serves as a primary vehicle export hub. FSD Unsupervised could then pave the way for Giga Shanghai to operate in an even more optimal manner.

FSD Unsupervised is the cornerstone of Tesla’s robotaxi business, which is expected to start rolling out in Austin, Texas, next month. Previous reports have suggested that Tesla is pushing hard in its preparations to roll out its robotaxi service this June. Tesla has reportedly even worked and trained with Austin’s first responders from the fire and police departments as part of its robotaxi service preparations.

Tesla has welcomed Chipotle president Jack Hartung to its Board of Directors. Hartung will officially start his tenure at the electric vehicle maker on June 1, 2025.

Tesla announced the addition of its new director in a post on social media platform X.

Jack Hartung’s Role

With Hartung’s addition, the Tesla Board will now have nine members. It’s been a while since the company added a new director. Prior to Hartung, the last addition to the Tesla Board was Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia back in 2022. As noted in a Reuters report, Hartung will serve on the Tesla Board’s audit committee. He will also retire from his position as president and chief strategy officer at Chipotle, and transition into a senior advisor’s role at the restaurant chain, next month.

Hartung has had a long career in the Mexican grill, joining Chipotle in 2002. He held several positions in the company, most recently serving as Chipotle’s President and Chief Strategy Officer. Tesla highlighted Hartung’s accomplishments in a post on its official account on X.

“Over the past 20+ years under Jack’s financial leadership, Chipotle has seen significant growth with over 3,700 restaurants today across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Jack was named ‘CFO of the Year’ by Orange County Business Journal and Best CFO in the restaurant category by Institutional Investor,” Tesla wrote in its post on X.

Tesla Board and Musk

Tesla is a controversial company with a controversial CEO, so it is no surprise that the Board of Directors tend to get flak as well. Two weeks ago, for example, Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm slammed The Wall Street Journal for publishing an article alleging that company directors had considered a search for a potential successor to Elon Musk. Denholm herself has also been criticized for offloading her TSLA shares.

More recently, news emerged suggesting that the Tesla Board of Directors had formed a special committee aimed at exploring a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk. The committee is reportedly comprised of Tesla board Chair Robyn Denholm and independent director Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, and they would be exploring alternative compensation methods for Musk’s contributions to the company.

Tesla definitely seems determined to prove that its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is capable of operating safely anywhere. This was highlighted by the company in a couple of videos posted on social media platform X, which showed the self-driving system in action in Australia and France.

Tesla is expected to roll out a robotaxi service that uses FSD Unsupervised in Austin, Texas sometime next month.

New FSD Unsupervised Demonstrations

To start off Tesla’s recent demonstrations, the Tesla AI Team posted a video of FSD Supervised being tested in Melbourne, Australia. The video was nearly two minutes long, and it featured FSD navigating the city’s busy inner streets. FSD handled the drive without any issues, even performing Australia’s infamous hook turn at one time. The demonstration was received warmly by the EV community, especially since FSD accomplished all this while operating an RHD vehicle.

Another FSD demonstration, this time posted by the official Tesla Europe & Middle East X account, featured the Supervised self-driving system navigating France’s complicated Arc de Triomphe. The area is challenging, considering that it’s one of the largest roundabouts in the country. FSD Supervised, however, expertly handled the roundabout, pausing for cars as needed and maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.

Tesla did place a disclaimer on its recent test videos, stating that “FSD (Supervised) engineering test drive in a prototype vehicle driven by a safety driver. For demonstration purposes only. FSD (Supervised) is a hands-on feature that requires driver control of the vehicle and attention on the road at all times. Future activation and use subject to development and regulatory approval.”

FSD Unsupervised

Tesla is not yet rolling out FSD Unsupervised to consumer vehicles. The company, however, has been using the system to transport cars from the Fremont Factory and Giga Texas’ production lines to their respective staging areas. In Giga Texas, freshly produced Model Y units drive completely driverless for 1.4 miles before reaching its staging lot. The Cybertrucks, on the other hand, navigate a Boring Company tunnel on their way to their staging area.

Tesla is planning on releasing a dedicated robotaxi service using Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised in Austin, Texas this June. Previous reports also suggest that Tesla is hard at work preparing for the rollout of its robotaxi service, with the company reportedly testing 300 vehicles around Austin over the past months. Tesla has reportedly also conducted safety tests and training sessions with Austin’s first responders from the fire department and police as part of its robotaxi service preparations.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tesla-lineup-supercharger-night-scaled-1-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 21:01:59.535191

The Rivian R2 could rival the Tesla Model Y due to growing anti-Tesla sentiment.

The Rivian R2 midsize electric SUV is an entry point to Rivian for the average American driver.

Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN) is one of the few American car manufacturers aside from Tesla that exclusively produces EVs. The company, led by CEO RJ Scaringe, had one of the world's biggest IPOs in recent history, with shares rising as much as 53% in its Nasdaq debut.

The R1T electric full-size pickup truck and R1S full-size electric SUV have impressive specs, but high sticker prices make them unattainable for many drivers. A new Rivian R1T or R1S costs nearly $70,000, which is much more than the average new car price of $49,740, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Rivian's new affordable EV could have a better chance at besting the Tesla Model Y (the company's most popular model). Here's why.

What is the Rivian R2?

The Rivian R2 is an upcoming midsize electric SUV that is more affordable and compact than the R1S. The Rivian R1S full-size electric SUV showcased what the company is capable of from a design and engineering standpoint. Now, the R2 can help the Rivian brand become accessible to more American drivers.

The upcoming Rivian R2 and R3 electric SUVs will include many of the same tech features and capabilities that earned the admiration of auto enthusiasts.

Tesla originally manufactured high-priced performance luxury electric vehicles like the Tesla Roadster. The more affordable Model Y and Model 3 EVs went on to become best-selling models for Tesla, as reported by Hagerty. Will the R2 have the same effect for Rivian as a more affordable alternative to its first models?

How much does the Rivian R2 cost?

According to Rivian, the R2 midsize electric SUV will start at around $45,000. It is expected to qualify for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax incentive, bringing its starting price closer to $37,500. You can reserve an R2 electric SUV for just $100.

The R3 is ""designed with even tighter dimensions and at a lower price point than R2"" says Rivian. The American automaker says that models equipped with larger battery packs are capable of over 300 miles of driving range. Rivian's current least powerful battery pack provides 270 miles of driving range, but the standard R2 could have less range as a smaller model.

When can you get the Rivian R2 electric SUV?

Pre-orders are open but deliveries on the R2 aren't expected to begin until the first half of 2026. So, the market won't see the impact of the R2's arrival until the second half of 2026. That said, anti-Tesla sentiment has been growing due to CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration as senior advisor to the president.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/03/07/PDTF/72886974007-img-8737.jpeg?crop=5711,3213,x0,y856&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-05-16 21:02:02.789626

According to the Coalition, the termination letter stated that their projects no longer aligned with the agency’s objectives.

“This EPA Assistance Agreement is terminated effective immediately on the grounds that the remaining portion of the Federal award will not accomplish the EPA funding priorities for achieving program goals,” the letter said.

In response, EHC’s Executive Director Jose Franco Garcia said in the press release that the grant was terminated “because of who it was going to help – low-income communities of color who have unfairly suffered for generations from toxic, lung-damaging pollution and severe underinvestment.”

“This grant would have helped fund air filters for children with asthma, home upgrades for low-income families, non-polluting buses, and more in these neighborhoods,” he said.

Earlier this year the agency announced its mission was to slash regulations in favor of industry and that it would terminate environmental justice and “DEI arms” of its agency.

The grant paved the road for a number of projects including the decades-in-the-making Boston Avenue Linear Park. It also supported a program to improve air-quality the homes of low-income community members as well as several transportation and workforce development programs.

The Energy Affordability Report, which draws on federal data, says that 37 states have cheaper electricity than Michigan does.
The policy “contribute(s) to higher current electricity prices as utilities pass on the costs of developing new infrastructure,” according to the report.
Higher electricity prices can be a challenge for household budgets, but they also have implications for businesses and in turn, economic development.
Ford Motor Co. cited lower electricity prices there as one reason for its 2021 decision to establish major facilities in those states.","Every American uses electric service, but its price and reliability depends to some extent on the choices lawmakers make. This is a key point of a recent report that gives a snapshot of energy prices and policies in each state. Michigan, the report says, has above-average costs for electricity.

The Energy Affordability Report, which draws on federal data, says that 37 states have cheaper electricity than Michigan does. It is published by the American Legislative Exchange Council, which describes itself as “a voluntary membership organization of state legislators dedicated to the principles of limited government, free markets and federalism.”

State policies affect energy prices in three ways, the report mentions: renewable portfolio standards, net-metering requirements and cap-and-trade systems. Some states have all three policies, a few have none, and the balance, including Michigan, have at least one.

Michigan’s policy imposes a renewable portfolio standard on utilities that requires 50% of the electricity in the state to come from renewable energy by 2030 and 60% by 2035. The policy “contribute(s) to higher current electricity prices as utilities pass on the costs of developing new infrastructure,” according to the report.

A second policy contributing to the state’s above-average costs, the report says, is a net metering system. Under that system, modified in recent years to be a distributed generation program for new participants, utilities must pay customers whose solar panels generate more electricity than they need.

Michigan does not have a cap-and-trade system, which occurs mostly in the Northeast.

The state’s new portfolio standard threatens the electrical grid in Michigan, said Jason Hayes, director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. “The state has chosen to exacerbate its grid problems by expanding its renewable portfolio standard, requiring 60% of all electric supplies to come from renewable sources. Our report, Shorting the Great Lakes Grid, reveals how state governments and utility net-zero plans have pushed grid operators to forecast severe shortages and price increases.” Hayes concluded by saying that policymakers should emphasize the importance of reliability and affordability.

A spokesperson for one of the state’s large utility companies told Michigan Capitol Confidential that economic growth key to making electricity more affordable. “As Michigan loses population and businesses, costs go up for everyone when they’re distributed among fewer customers,” said Tracy C. Wimmer of Consumers Energy. “Smoothing the path for significant economic development — and the accompanying rates those developments would pay over the lifetime of the project — could have significant benefit for all our customers,” Wimmer added.

Policymakers could make energy more affordable by altering the net metering law, Wimmer said. “Changes to current policy that will ensure that the entirety of our customer base is not forced to subsidize the small percentage that can afford to install their own solar will ultimately lower costs for all,” she told CapCon.

Higher electricity prices can be a challenge for household budgets, but they also have implications for businesses and in turn, economic development. Two states that have lower electricity prices are Kentucky and Tennessee. Ford Motor Co. cited lower electricity prices there as one reason for its 2021 decision to establish major facilities in those states.

The report on electricity describes where each state gets its electricity. States vary widely in which resources they use. The coal-producing states of West Virginia and Wyoming use coal the most, deriving 90% and 72% of its electricity, respectively, from it. Natural gas is key in many states, including Delaware and Rhode Island, which derive 89% of their electricity from it. Illinois gets more than half of its electricity (53%) from nuclear and four states get more than half their electricity from hydro. South Dakota is the only state to get most of its electricity (58%) from wind.

Michigan got its power from a variety of sources in 2023, the latest year the report used for its comparisons. Michigan’s energy sources were divided into natural gas (37%), coal (31%) and nuclear (23%). Wind and petroleum made up the balance, at 8% and 1% respectively. Michigan is one of 14 states that does not have a dominant supplier.",https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/media/images/stock/sizes/1200w/shutterstock-2466402309.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 02:01:00.461538

New Hampshire has received more than $72 million in Brownfield funding since the program began in 1994. While the delegation welcomed the funds Congress approved on a bipartisan basis, they criticized the Trump administration for proposing to cut virtually all funding for EPA grant programs to states, like the Brownfields program, and rolling back other environmental protection programs at the EPA that help keep Granite Staters and the environment healthy.

“New Hampshire’s economy and way of life are rooted in our surroundings, and it’s great to see these funds delivered to New Hampshire to clean up contaminated sites,” said Congressman Chris Pappas. “However planned layoffs, funding cuts, the cancellation of critical research projects, and the EPA’s recent announcement that it will rescind limits keeping toxic PFAS chemicals out of our water will directly harm Granite Staters. I will continue pushing EPA to fulfill its obligations to New Hampshire communities, and I will never stop fighting to safeguard our environment for future generations and ensure that every family has access to clean, safe drinking water.""

“Congress has long provided bipartisan support to the Environmental Protection Agency’s Brownfields program to clean up and provide new economic life to contaminated sites in communities big and small. This funding we secured—which will help Nashua, Milford and Concord revitalize and remediate sites in their communities—is especially important as the administration threatens to roll back environmental protections that help keep Granite Staters safe,” said Senator Shaheen. “As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I’ll continue pushing back against efforts to restrict resources and staffing so that the EPA can uphold its responsibility to protect public health and the environment.”

“While this federal funding for three toxic waste sites in New Hampshire is one good step forward in cleaning up polluted land to put it back into use, the Trump Administration is simultaneously taking several steps backwards that make people less healthy, including its move to do away with protections against PFAS in drinking water,” said Senator Hassan. “I will continue to support efforts that get our communities and our economy the clean and safe land, air, and water that they need to thrive.”

“Brownfields Grants from the United States Environmental Protection Agency are critical to ensuring the health and well-being of communities, economies, and environments across New Hampshire,” said Congresswoman Goodlander. “At a time when the Trump Administration has put much-needed federal funding on the chopping block, I’m encouraged to see these grants heading to projects in Nashua, Concord, and Milford, where they will do what federal funding is meant to: reinvest your taxpayer dollars here at home. I will never stop fighting to deliver every penny of federal funding promised to New Hampshire.”

Disbursed through the EPA, the City of Concord will receive $678,000 to clean up the former Concord Stables site, which has been vacant for decades and is contaminated with petroleum products and inorganic contaminants.

The most substantive part of the bill is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts.
The tax bill would add at least an additional $2.5 trillion to the national deficit over the next 10 years and decrease federal tax revenue by roughly $4 trillion by 2034.
The bill extends the child tax credit of $2,000, which would otherwise have ended with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts at year’s end.
The bill, however, also eliminates taxes on tips, a critical campaign promise by both Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.","United States House Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill”, a wide-ranging tax and spending legislation, is at a crucial moment.

The nearly 400-page legislation proposes sweeping changes which include extending the 2017 tax cuts, slashing taxes for businesses and individuals, and enacting deep cuts to social programmes like Medicaid and SNAP.

While Republicans tout the bill as a boon for economic growth and middle-class relief, nonpartisan analysts warn it could add trillions to the national debt and strip millions of Americans of medical and food assistance.

The bill will be voted on by the House Budget Committee today and, if passed, will be voted on the floor next week.

The most substantive part of the bill is an extension of the 2017 tax cuts. The tax bill would add at least an additional $2.5 trillion to the national deficit over the next 10 years and decrease federal tax revenue by roughly $4 trillion by 2034.

Passing the legislation will also raise the debt ceiling, which sets the amount of money the government can borrow to pay for existing expenditures, by $4 trillion, a sticking point for hardline Republicans who want deeper cuts.

Here are some of the key measures in the proposed bill in its current form.

Changes for households

The bill increases standard deductions for all Americans. Individual deductions will increase by $1,000, $1,500 for heads of households, and $2,000 for married couples.

The bill extends the child tax credit of $2,000, which would otherwise have ended with the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts at year’s end.

It bumps up the child tax credit by $500 per child for this tax year and runs through the end of 2028. It also includes a $1,000 savings account for children born between December 31, 2024 and January 1, 2029. The legislation would also allow families to annually contribute $5,000 tax-free.

There is a new tax deduction for Americans 65 and older. The new bill would give a $4,000 annual deduction starting this year for people making a gross income of $75,000 for a single person and $150,000 for a married couple. If passed, the rule would take effect for the current tax year and run until the end of 2028.

“It will just make tax paying more complicated and more uncertain when a lot of these things ultimately expire,” Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the right-leaning Cato Institute, told Al Jazeera.

Another provision in the bill modifies state and local tax (SALT) deductions. It allows filers to be able to write off some of what they paid in local and state taxes from their federal filings.

Under the 2017 tax act, that was capped at $10,000, but the new legislation would raise that to $30,000. Some Republicans, particularly those in states with higher taxes like New York and California, have been pushing to raise the cap or abolish it altogether. However, they have faced fiscal hawks and those who see the increases as relief for those already wealthy.

The bill includes an increased benefit for small businesses that allows them to deduct 23 percent of their qualified business income from their taxes, up from the current 20 percent.

There is also a call for no taxes on overtime pay for select individuals. It would not apply to people who are non-citizens, those who are considered “highly compensated employees,” and those who earn a tipped wage.

The bill, however, also eliminates taxes on tips, a critical campaign promise by both Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris. The bill would allow people who work in sectors like food service, as well as hair care, nail care, aesthetics, and body and spa treatments, to specifically deduct the amount of tipped income they receive.

At the federal level, employers will still not be required to pay tipped workers more than the subminimum wage of $2.13 hourly. The intention is that workers will be able to make up the difference in tipping the receipt from customers.

Cuts to the social safety net

The legislation calls to make $880bn in cuts to key government programmes with a focus mostly on Medicaid and food stamps.

The CBO found that more than 10 million people could lose Medicaid access and 7.6 million could lose access to health insurance completely by 2034 under the current plan.

Even far-right Republicans have called out the Medicaid cuts. In an op-ed in The New York Times this week, Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri said the cuts are “morally wrong and politically suicidal”.

According to a new report from One Fair Wage shared with Al Jazeera, tipped workers could be hit especially hard, as 1.2 million restaurant and tipped workers could lose access to Medicaid.

“A no tax on tips proposal, which is like a minuscule percentage of their income and doesn’t affect two-thirds of tips workers because they don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax, is just nowhere near enough to compensate for the fact that we’re going to have millions of these workers lose the ability to take care of themselves, in some cases go into medical debt, in many cases just not take care of themselves,” Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, an advocacy group for restaurant workers, told Al Jazeera.

The bill also introduces work requirements to receive benefits, saying that recipients must prove they work, volunteer or are enrolled in school for at least 80 hours each month.

At the same time, the bill also shortens the open enrolment period by a month for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare. This means people who have employer-funded healthcare and lose their job might lose eligibility to buy a private plan on the healthcare exchange.

“It’s taking folks like 11 to 12 weeks to find a new job. The worse the labour market gets, that number will tick up. If you’re unemployed for three months, you get kicked off Medicaid,” Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera.

“Then, if you try to go buy a plan on the ACA marketplace, you are no longer eligible for subsidies … which I think is really cruel.”

Other major proposed cuts will hit programmes like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programme or SNAP, which helps 42 million low-income individuals afford groceries and comes at a time when food costs are still 2 percent higher than a year ago. The CBO found that 3 million people could lose SNAP access under the new plan.

The bill would also force states to take up more responsibility in funding the programmes. States would be required to cover 75 percent of the administrative costs, and all states would have to pay at least 5 percent of the benefits — 28 states would need to pay 25 percent.

“States are now going to be on the hook for billions of dollars in funding for these two vital programmes. They have a tough choice. One is, do they cut funding from others like K-12 education, roads, veteran services, etc, to cover this gap, or do they raise taxes so that they can raise more revenue to cover this gap,” Pancotti added.

Under the current law, the federal government is solely responsible for shouldering the cost of benefits. The proposed cuts would save $300bn for the federal government but hit state budgets hard.

Bill fuels Trump administration priorities

The bill would also cut the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicle purchases and $4,000 for a used EV, a move which could hurt several major US automakers that are already reeling from the administration’s tariffs on automobiles.

General Motors pumped billions into domestic EV production in the last year, which has included a $900m investment to retrofit an existing plant to build electric vehicles in Michigan and alongside Samsung, the carmaker invested $3.5bn in EV battery manufacturing in the US.

In February, Ford CEO Jim Farley said that revoking the EV tax credit could put factory jobs on the chopping block. The carmaker invested in three EV battery plants in Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. The federal government under the administration of former President Joe Biden paid out more than $2bn in EV tax credits in 2024.

The proposed legislation would also give the Trump administration authority to revoke the tax exempt status of nonprofit organisations that it deems as a “terrorist supporting organisation”. It would give the secretary of the treasury the ability to accuse any nonprofit of supporting “terrorism”, revoke their tax exempt status without allowing them due process to prove otherwise, which has raised serious concerns amongst critics.

“This measure’s real intent lurks behind its hyperbolic and unsubstantiated anti-terrorist rhetoric: It would allow the Treasury Department to explicitly target, harass and investigate thousands of U.S. organizations that make up civil society, including nonprofit newsrooms,” Jenna Ruddock, advocacy director of Free Press Action, said in a statement.

“The bill’s language lacks any meaningful safeguards against abuse. Instead it puts the burden of proof on organizations rather than on the government. It’s not hard to imagine how the Trump administration would use it to exact revenge on groups that have raised questions about or simply angered the president and other officials in his orbit.”

The bill would introduce new taxes on colleges, including a varying tax rate based on the size of a university’s endowment per student with the highest at 14 percent for universities with a per student endowment of more than $1.25m but less than $2m and 21 percent for those of $2m or more.

This comes amid the Trump administration’s increased tensions with higher education. In the last week, the Trump administration pulled $450m in grants to Harvard on top of the $2.2bn it pulled in April — a move which will hinder research into cancer and heart disease, among other areas. Harvard has an endowment of $53.2bn, making it one of the richest schools in the country.

The legislation would also increase funding for a border wall between the US and Mexico, which the administration has argued will help curb undocumented immigration. However, there is no evidence that such a wall has deterred border crossings.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-05-16T101739Z_591021594_RC2YIEA16E7L_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-GULF-1747390990.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:18.730289

The lobbying comes as Congress considers major domestic policy legislation which includes extending and expanding tax breaks, and spending overhauls to bring the federal budget in line with current priorities. The proposal being considered by the U.S. House of Representatives — known as the Big Beautiful Bill — would largely gut the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a foundational component of former President Joe Biden’s administration in addressing human-caused climate change and reorienting the economy toward technologies of tomorrow.

“The bills reported out of committee earlier this week are a repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, in all but name,” Ted Fertik, vice president for manufacturing and industrial policy at the BlueGreen Alliance, said, speaking to reporters Thursday. “This is a sledgehammer to investments and tax credits that are already creating jobs, lowering costs and bolstering manufacturing across the country.”

It’s not yet clear how the situation will play out. On Friday, conservatives on the House Budget Committee blocked the legislation, citing deficit concerns.

Built into the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed with no Republican support, were numerous provisions and incentives to advance clean energy and transportation. Those incentives have been helping to transition the trucking industry away from diesel, spurred the development of computer chips, wind energy, battery innovations and other technologies, all in the United States. That momentum, advocates said, ought not be slowed.

Zero-emission vehicles “appear to be in that takeoff moment,” Steven Higashide, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists clean transportation program, said. “This could be the start of a new kind of freight system. One that’s better for our health, as well as delivering significant operational savings to fleets. So, lets not undercut this remarkable advance in technology at this critical moment.”

One of the key reasons the nation ought not be pumping the brakes on technology and innovation, an executive said, is that China is stepping on the accelerator.

“This is a ‘Sputnik’ moment for the U.S.,” Adam Browning, executive vice president, policy at Forum Mobility, said, noting 30 percent of heavy-duty truck sales in China in December were zero-emission.

“We need some Apollo 11 energy here,” said Brown, whose company makes heavy-duty truck charging depots. “Not, failure to launch.”

The proposed legislation would end incentives like the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, known as 30C, an incentive available for developers of electric vehicle (EV) charging sites. Also on the chopping block would be the popular Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit, which provides a $7,500 tax credit for businesses or nonprofits purchasing an EV.

Eliminating credits for new and used EVs “means thousands of dollars in costs for households that want to make the switch, ending the clean vehicle infrastructure credit, making it harder for people to put a charger at their home, specifically in rural and underserved areas,” Higashide said, indicating these incentives have been instrumental in turning the page on air pollution from trucking and the transportation sector.

“Our research shows, when you replace a diesel truck with an electric truck, the pollution is so much lower. You’ve cut the health impacts associated with that truck by almost 80 percent,” he said.

Republicans have been dismissive toward these arguments.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act, returning $6.5 billion in unspent funds,” wrote Kentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, who chairs the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, in an op-ed Sunday for The Wall Street Journal.

""In addition to raising new revenue, the bill will slash waste, particularly handouts to Democrats’ climate activist cronies. The 2024 election sent a clear signal that Americans are tired of an extreme left-wing agenda that favors wokeness over sensible policy and spurs price increases,” Guthrie wrote.

Michael Fielkow, general counsel and head of corporate development at Harbinger Motors, which makes plug-in hybrid delivery trucks, said the matter is about more than partisanship.

“This is really not a partisan issue. This is about protecting American national security. It’s about building an American infrastructure for what will absolutely be future technology that leads the transportation market,” Fielkow said. “So the real question comes down to whether or not we support the growth of that technology in the U.S., or in other countries.”

The hard-right lawmakers are insisting on steeper spending cuts to Medicaid and the Biden-era green energy tax breaks, among other changes, before they will give their support to President Donald Trump’s “beautiful” bill. They warn the tax cuts alone would pile onto the nation’s $36 trillion debt.

The failed vote, 16-21, stalls, for now, House Speaker Mike Johnson’s push to have the package approved next week. But the holdout lawmakers vowed to stay all weekend to negotiate changes as the Republican president is returning to Washington from the Middle East.

“Something needs to change or you’re not going to get my support,” said Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas.

Tallying a whopping 1,116 pages, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, named with a nod to Trump, is teetering at a critical moment. Conservatives are holding out for steeper cuts to Medicaid and other programs to help offset the costs of the tax breaks. But at the same time, lawmakers from high-tax states including New York are demanding a deeper tax deduction, known as SALT, for their constituents.

Johnson has insisted Republicans are on track to pass the bill, which he believes will inject a dose of stability into a wavering economy.

Democrats slammed the package, but they will be powerless to stop it if Republicans ultimately unite. They emphasized that millions of people would lose their health coverage if the bill passes while the wealthiest Americans would reap enormous tax cuts. They also said it would increase future deficits.

“That is bad economics. It is unconscionable,” said Rep. Brendan Boyle, the top Democratic lawmaker on the panel.

The Budget panel is one of the final stops before the package is sent to the full House floor for a vote, which is expected as soon as next week. Typically, the job of the Budget Committee is more administrative as it compiles the work of 11 committees that drew up various parts of the big bill.

But Friday’s meeting proved momentous. Republicans hold a slim majority in the House and have just a few votes to spare to advance the measure, including on the Budget Committee.

Four Republican conservatives initially voted against the package — Roy and Reps. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia. Then one, Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania switched his vote to no.

The conservative holdouts from the Freedom Caucus are insisting on deeper cuts — particularly to Medicaid. They want new work requirements for aid recipients to start immediately, rather than on Jan. 1, 2029, as the package proposes.

Roy complained that the legislation front-loads new tax cuts and spending while backloading the savings.

“We are writing checks we cannot cash, and our children are going to pay the price,” Roy said.

“Sadly,” added Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., “I’m a hard no until we get this ironed out.”

At the same time, the New Yorkers have been unrelenting in their demand for a much larger SALT deduction than what is proposed in the bill, which could send the overall cost of the package skyrocketing.

As it stands, the bill proposes tripling what’s currently a $10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction, increasing it to $30,000 for joint filers with incomes up to $400,000 a year.

Rep. Nick LaLota, one of the New York lawmakers leading the SALT effort, said they have proposed a deduction of $62,000 for single filers and $124,000 for joint filers.

The conservatives and the New Yorkers are at odds, each jockeying for their priorities as Johnson labors to keep the package on track to pass the House by Memorial Day and then onto the Senate.

“This is always what happens when you have a big bill like this,” said Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. “There’s always final details to work out all the way up until the last minute. So we’re going to keep working. There’s a lot of work to be done.”

At its core, the sprawling package extends the existing income tax cuts that were approved during Trump’s first term, in 2017, and adds new ones that the president campaigned on in 2024, including no taxes on tips, overtime pay and some auto loans.

It increases some tax breaks for middle-income earners, including a bolstered standard deduction of $32,000 for joint filers and a temporary $500 boost to the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500.

It also provides an infusion of $350 billion for Trump’s deportation agenda and to bolster the Pentagon.

To offset more than $5 million in lost revenue, the package proposes rolling back other tax breaks, namely the green energy tax credits approved as part of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. Some conservatives want those to end immediately.

The package also seeks to cover the costs by slashing more than $1 trillion from health care and food assistance programs over the course of a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on able-bodied adults.

Certain Medicaid recipients would need to engage in 80 hours a month of work or other community options to receive health care. Older Americans receiving food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, would also see the program’s current work requirement for able-bodied participants without dependents extended to include those ages 55-64.

States would also be required to shoulder a greater share of the program’s cost.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates at least 7.6 million fewer people with health insurance and about 3 million a month fewer SNAP recipients with the changes.

Mocking the name of the bill, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called it “one big, beautiful betrayal.”

“To pay for it,” Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvey said, “kids in Kentucky will go hungry, nursing homes and hospitals will close, and millions of Americans will be kicked off their health insurance. It’s wrong.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/GettyImages-2215063885-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 21:01:35.688722

That’s the Republican 2025 budget reconciliation plan: sacrifice your public lands and take more from your family’s wallet to line the pockets of billionaires and polluters.","What you should know

Congressional Republicans are using a process called budget reconciliation to ram through more of the Trump administration’s agenda.

Budget reconciliation is a tool that Congress can use to fast-track federal bills related to spending. It requires a simple majority vote in both Houses of Congress, meaning that Republicans do not need a single Democratic vote to pass the bill into law.

This time, Republicans have drafted a bill that sells our public lands and oceans to the lowest bidder, exploits our natural resources, and cuts environmental justice funding and clean energy tax credits to pay for handouts to polluting industries and tax breaks for billionaires.

What you can do: Ask your elected officials to side with the American people over billionaires and polluting industries. We need members of Congress to actively and publicly oppose the reconciliation bill. We cannot accept the ways it would increase energy prices, sacrifice our public lands and oceans, allow polluting industries to evade accountability in the courts, and cut critical investments in public health and environmental programs.

What is budget reconciliation?

In a nutshell, the law affords Congress a process called budget reconciliation to fast-track federal spending and saving changes. Reconciliation is how Congress passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a $369 billion climate solutions package that made America a leader in clean energy technology. The Inflation Reduction Act also provided tax breaks for middle-class and low-income households that made home energy improvements.

Federal budget proposals typically need 60 votes in the Senate, which means that either party needs support from the other to pass their budget package. But budget reconciliation only requires a simple majority, or 51 votes — and Republicans control 53 Senate seats. Instead of using their power to address real issues, they’re trying to undo the progress made under the Inflation Reduction Act. They’re also pushing through a free pass for billionaire polluters to harm the environment and the American people without consequences.

Republicans are voting against our families, our public lands and oceans, and our planet

Republicans have run roughshod over budget reconciliation guidelines: they’re including substantive policy changes in a process that is strictly intended for federal fiscal policy. Among Republicans’ “budget” priorities for the 2025 reconciliation process:

Mandating offshore oil-and-gas drilling, including in sensitive ocean ecosystems and endangered species habitat like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska’s Arctic

Privatizing hundreds of thousands of acres of America’s public lands — with no strings attached. The buyers will be able to do whatever they want, with no regard for how their activities harm the land.

Requiring federal agencies to open additional hundreds of thousands of acres to oil, gas, and coal leasing, as well as logging and mining

Removing checks and balances that have helped us protect public lands for generations by prohibiting anyone from challenging wealthy polluters in court. Instead, big polluters will simply be able to pay their way out of being held accountable for damaging OUR public lands.

Cutting popular, job-creating clean energy tax credits, funding for environmental justice programs, and grants that allow coastal communities to build resilience against natural disasters.

Less money for local jobs and community investments…

Once again, Trump and his congressional enablers aren’t shy about targeting programs that have been good for Americans of all political stripes. By repealing the Inflation Reduction Act’s environmental justice investments and clean energy tax credits, Congressional Republicans are intentionally taking away hundreds of billions of dollars in investments from their communities. Their own districts and states will lose hundreds of thousands of jobs, and hardworking people will pay more for energy bills and environmental harm.

The Inflation Reduction Act is a proven, bipartisan winner that has already created over 400,000 jobs across 48 states and Puerto Rico. It’s helped clean energy jobs to grow at double the rate of overall job growth nationwide. All told, the Inflation Reduction Act is expected to have over $3.8 trillion in economic benefits while providing Americans with affordable, reliable clean energy — if Republicans don’t gut it first.

…even MORE handouts for polluting industries…

Congressional Republicans will take a wrecking ball to green jobs, clean energy, and social safety nets like Medicaid, while finding plenty offunds to provide tax windfalls to billionaires and sweetheart deals to industries that pollute our lands, our waters, and our bodies. They’re hungry to expand drilling in every region of the country, onshore and offshore, by using budget reconciliation to mandate auctions of public lands and waters in the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska’s Cook Inlet, vast habitats in Western states, and much, much more.

They’re prioritizing this giveaway even though record production levels have already pushed the limits of how fast companies can drill. For once, oil and gas executives are the ones saying “enough” — they already have excessive leases on our public lands. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil and gas corporations are producing on just 20% of the 12 million acres they lease offshore; in Alaska, none of them showed up to bid on ANWR leases offered by the Biden administration in January 2025.

….and even MORE destructive powers to the Trump administration.

This bill isn’t just about billionaires and polluters; it transfers an inordinate amount of power to the Trump administration, insulating its actions from the courts and giving it power to target anyone who disagrees.

Remember the part about giving wealthy polluters a free pass from their day in court? Buried in the legislative text are provisions that would create a “pay-to-pollute” scheme where sponsors of major dirty projects can pay a fee for an expedited environmental review that’s shielded from court scrutiny. These provisions would give the Trump administration authority to ram through polluting projects while tying the hands of everyday people and communities who would otherwise challenge the impacts to their health, our ecosystems, and our planet.

But wait, there’s more. The bill contains language that would give the Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke tax-exempt status from nonprofits as it wishes — without due process. This move would grant the Trump administration unchecked power to punish any advocacy and social-services groups based solely on disagreeing with them.

The Trump administration is already weaponizing parts of the federal government to target perceived political enemies. This broad provision would provide it with a powerful tool that spells disaster for civil society in our country.

Tell Congress to fight for you, not polluters

As energy, health care, and food costs rise for people across the country, House and Senate Republicans have responded by asking people to do more with less. Meanwhile, they’re doubling down on providing massive handouts and tax breaks to polluting industries, huge corporations, and the nation’s wealthiest people.

That’s the Republican 2025 budget reconciliation plan: sacrifice your public lands and take more from your family’s wallet to line the pockets of billionaires and polluters.

Of course, the Trump administration won’t stop here. They’ll continue shredding our social safety nets. The “savings” won’t reach you or me; that money gets funneled back to people who’ve always been able to afford their groceries and medications — people who’ve never worried about whether their water is safe to drink, or if their air is bad for their lungs. Members of Congress need to hear that Americans are watching the federal budget process to see who fights for the public good.

Earthjustice strongly opposes budget reconciliation provisions that include any of the following:

Opening the Arctic and other cherished public lands and ocean to oil and gas drilling, coal leasing, mining, and logging

Creating loopholes that allow polluters to “pay to pollute” and evade accountability by circumventing bedrock environmental laws, like the National Environmental Policy Act and Endangered Species Act

Defunding Inflation Reduction Act grants that are actively lowering energy costs and cleaning up pollution in communities heavily burdened by environmental injustices and climate change

Effectively repealing the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax credits even though they’re driving hundreds of billions of dollars in investment and hundreds of thousands of jobs into communities across the country

When deciding whether to regulate greenhouse gases, the EPA has concluded that it is required to turn a blind eye to the harm.
Therefore, by regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA can reshape entire industries, the economy and our way of life.
Most people are probably shocked to learn that the EPA has decided to regulate greenhouse gases without such considerations.
The Trump administration may be evaluating whether the EPA is already allowed to consider the adverse effects of regulating greenhouse gases.","Even for the least essential choices we make in our daily lives, such as what we should have for dinner, we consider the pros and cons.

Yet, the Environmental Protection Agency doesn’t consider the downside of arguably the most consequential type of regulation in American history: greenhouse gas regulation.

In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court in 2007 told the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases if it found that their emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Based on the Clean Air Act, this requirement is referred to as the endangerment finding.

The EPA interpreted this to mean the agency is prohibited from considering the harm of regulating greenhouse gas emissions. This is the generally understood interpretation and likely will be supported by the judiciary.

However, what if greenhouse gas regulations cause more harm than good? That wouldn’t matter. When deciding whether to regulate greenhouse gases, the EPA has concluded that it is required to turn a blind eye to the harm.

So, if the regulations would devastate the economy, hurt the livelihood of low-income populations, or increase prices, none of that can affect the decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

It is true that once the decision to regulate has been made, the agency can expressly consider costs, to some extent, in how it will regulate. This isn’t much comfort because once the decision to regulate greenhouse gas emissions has been made, much of the damage has already been done.

The EPA has given itself unprecedented bureaucratic power by concluding that it is required to regulate greenhouse gases. About 84 percent of U.S. energy use comes from fossil fuels, which produce greenhouse gas emissions. Practically, every aspect of our economy relies on fossil fuels in some fashion. Therefore, by regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA can reshape entire industries, the economy and our way of life.

The EPA is taking advantage of this power. In addition to finalizing a rule to dictate how we produce electricity, the agency recently finalized its de facto electric vehicle mandate. By the agency’s estimate, the cost of this rule is $760 billion. To put that number in context, it is the same price tag as President Barack Obama’s massive stimulus bill in 2009, with its projected cost of $787 billion.

Congress should ensure that whenever the EPA decides whether to regulate, it should consider the adverse effects of doing so. This should hardly be controversial. Most people are probably shocked to learn that the EPA has decided to regulate greenhouse gases without such considerations.

The Trump administration may be evaluating whether the EPA is already allowed to consider the adverse effects of regulating greenhouse gases. It is hoped the agency can do so.

This shift is most apparent on the roads, where electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers, which serve as the primary means of transport for millions in urban and semi-urban areas, are rapidly capturing market share on account of supportive policies like the FAME India Scheme. Sustainable battery manufacturing, of course, figures prominently in this transition.

It is clear that demand for sustainable battery packs will rise sharply in these volume markets. Still, there is equally strong scrutiny on the sustainability of the processes used to manufacture these batteries. The clean technology powering the dream of green mobility for India must be addressed amidst significant environmental and social trade-off challenges. To achieve enduring ecological and socially responsible outcomes, the journey of Indian electric mobility towards true sustainability relies on transformative actions in battery manufacturing.

The current footprint

Traditional battery manufacturing for electric vehicles (EVs) utilises lithium-ion batteries and carries a substantial footprint. The refinement processes of lithium, cobalt, and nickel ores have a major environmental impact; they consume large amounts of water (a huge issue for India’s water-scarce regions), destroy habitats, and contaminate land. This creates a need for all manufacturers, including Indian suppliers, to demonstrate ethical sourcing policies. Moreover, the production of sustainable battery cells requires a considerable amount of energy.

Most of India’s power plants are coal-fired (as of early 2025), meaning that batteries manufactured in India are already using coal-derived energy before the EV is operational. It is estimated that the manufacturing of a single EV battery pack results in the CO₂ emission of approximately 4 tonnes. The current composition of India’s grid significantly alters this estimation. Furthermore, traditional processing emits NMP (N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone) as a solvent, which poses additional environmental challenges. Finally, the extensive issue of managing battery end-of-life is particularly alarming. India is projected to see a swift rise in electric two-wheeler and three-wheeler vehicles, resulting in millions of used batteries that will need effective disposal and recycling solutions.

Currently, the formal recycling rates for lithium-ion batteries in India are underdeveloped, which risks wasting valuable resources and poses environmental hazards due to improper disposal, often handled by the informal sector. These issues are vital for the future of India’s sustainable battery manufacturing.

Creating a sustainable future

Innovations are rapidly emerging both in India and worldwide to tackle these challenges in a more sustainable way, particularly in the area of sustainable battery production. A significant trend is the shift towards various battery chemistries. Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries are becoming increasingly popular in India due to their lower cost, enhanced safety, and long lifespan, making them well-suited for the rising demand in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler markets. The market share is rising steeply. Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries might be even more beneficial for India.

Na-ion makes use of sodium locally, reducing the need for imported lithium without cobalt, unlike other options. While still maturing in terms of energy density, R&D efforts within Indian institutions are making strides to make them suitable for stationary storage and inexpensive short-range EVs, aligning perfectly with India’s ‘Make in India’ initiatives and energy security goals. Solid-state batteries, paving the way for greater performance and safety, still need to be enhanced.

At the same time, the use of manufacturing processes is advancing towards greater ecological sustainability. The dry electrode coating technology, which has the potential to reduce energy consumption by 30% while eliminating toxic solvent usage, is being developed internationally and poses significant cost and environmental savings opportunities for Indian gigafactories.

Many companies are increasingly committing to renewable energy for sustainable battery production. This is an important step in the overall reduction of carbon footprint linked with India’s grid power challenges. In addition, integrating water conservation through closed-loop systems and effective waste management via scrap reclaiming is becoming essential in modern manufacturing strategies.

Furthermore, repurposing electric vehicle sustainable batteries for backup power or solar energy storage presents significant opportunities in India before they are ultimately recycled, enhancing resource value. “Digital Battery Passports” are also envisioned to aid in seamless reuse and recycling in India by tracing the battery’s life cycle and constituents.

Tackling the challenge

India must overcome specific challenges to fully realise innovations in sustainable battery design and manufacturing. Expanding new technologies such as Na-ion or dry electrode coating, intended for pilot projects, into mass production facilities in India is economically burdensome in terms of advanced infrastructure, power, and skilled workers. Although government PLI schemes intend to support domestic manufacturing, ensuring that these plants adopt best practices globally from the very beginning is essential.

India faces a difficult task in developing an efficient and comprehensive system for collecting and recycling batteries throughout the country. In India, the formal pathways to manage the expected inflow of spent batteries from 2W/3W vehicles, which could reach operational or administrative scale, along with integrating potential workers from the informal recycling sector, have distinct logistical and socio-economic challenges. Maintaining proper guidelines for Indian manufacturers regarding supply chain empathy and ethical sourcing for imported minerals also emerges as a challenge, as it has stringent requirements.

Locally producing low-carbon batteries is an ongoing challenge due to the carbon intensity of India’s electric grid, which will improve with the construction of additional green energy facilities. Sustainable battery production will come only after bolstering policies concerning the electric grid. Systematic support for the Battery Waste Management Rules, coherent policies, and regulations are deemed necessary alongside implementing these rules for the country to have confidence in investing in sustainable technology and infrastructure.

Building a sustainable battery ecosystem

Overall, it is clear that electromobility, particularly in the two-wheeler and three-wheeler markets, is expanding rapidly. However, this growth is heavily dependent on the sustainability of batteries. Developing recycling systems, improving the energy grid, ensuring ethical supply chains, and advancing new technologies are major challenges. Nevertheless, change is underway. With India’s creative environment, supportive government policies, and increasing dedication from manufacturers, advancements are being made in alternative battery chemistries, sustainable battery production methods, and circular economy practices.

There is no doubt that India needs to tackle the sustainable management of the production and lifecycle of the batteries. Industry needs to invest, focus on research and development, establish policies, develop efficient infrastructure, and grow consumer awareness for sustainable batteries. With teamwork, India can integrate innovation and overcome obstacles to not only reduce pollution and carbon emissions but also conserve resources and enable inclusive, resilient progress towards a self-reliant, cleaner future.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/05/16/Mr.-Anshul-Gupta-Managing-Director-of-OPG-Mobility.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:27.451128

“We are in this global competition to attract investments at a time where the world is more complicated, more dangerous,” Joly said.
Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne, who was also at the event and spent at least 20 minutes chatting with U.S.","OTTAWA — Industry Minister Mélanie Joly says Honda Canada remains “fully committed” to major electric-vehicle investments in Canada after the company announced May 13 that it was pausing a multibillion-dollar EV project in Ontario.

Joly said in a statement she spoke with Honda Canada’s president and CEO, Dave Jamieson, who assured her that “no jobs will be lost.”

“He also confirmed that Honda is still fully committed to major EV investments right here in Canada — and we’ll work together to make it happen,” Joly said.

Honda announced it has postponed a $15-billion electric-vehicle project, citing market demand, and is shifting some production of its popular CR-V model intended for the U.S. market to its Ohio plant because of tariffs.

The halted investment marks by far the biggest project delay yet in Canada as the outlook for EV growth softens.

Joly told reporters her goal is to ensure the government is in “solution mode.”

In a quarterly earnings press conference in Japan, chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said the company will look at where the electric-vehicle market is in two years before deciding whether to keep going with the project.

“What happens after two years and the starting time of the project, we have to observe what is happening and ultimately make the decision,” he said, based on translated remarks.

While he cited EV demand for the delay, he said the company’s move to shift CR-V production to the U.S. is a more immediate result of tariffs.

“There is room to increase the production capacity in the United States, and we are trying to look into what will happen as a result of that,” said Mibe. “In the midterm, if the tariff measures are to be in place for a long time, then we will have to increase our production capacity in the United States.”

At a gala dinner May 14 at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Que., to launch the Business 7 Summit, Joly said her first priority is to make sure Canada supports the sectors that are on the front line of the trade war, including the auto sector and the steel and aluminum sectors.

She said Canada needs to continue to protect its jobs and ensure it can attract investments as it deals with uncertainty amid the trade war with the U.S.

Joly said she will also be on the “offence” and drive economic growth with a prime minister who she says is obsessed with the economy.

“We are in this global competition to attract investments at a time where the world is more complicated, more dangerous,” Joly said.

Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne, who was also at the event and spent at least 20 minutes chatting with U.S. Ambassador to Canada Peter Hoekstra, said Prime Minister Mark Carney has challenged the government to be ambitious and have a more resilient economy.

Honda was the second largest auto manufacturer in Canada last year based on the roughly 420,000 vehicles it produced, and the CR-V makes up close to half that total.

Honda Canada spokesman Ken Chiu said the company has no plans to cut overall production or jobs in Canada, and that the company is instead shifting which vehicles go where based on tariffs.

“We’re basically swapping export destinations of a small portion of CRVs between our plants,” he said by email.

He said the decision to postpone the EV project, which would include a battery plant, a retooled assembly line and two other plants, has no effect on the 4,200 people who currently work at the Honda manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ont.

Honda’s decision, affecting plans that were expected to create 1,000 jobs, came as it reported a drop in profits and more on the way because of tariffs. The company said U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs are expected to cut US$4.4 billion from its operating profit for this fiscal year, largely because it has so many vehicles coming from Canada and Mexico into the U.S.",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2019/08/shutterstock_750610873-e1564681105810.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 05:00:09.972903

Neither Sen. Jon Ossoff nor Sen. Raphael Warnock is up for reelection this year — the former will run again in 2026 and the latter in 2028.

Georgia's U.S. senators worked on hosting a town hall in Southwest Atlanta to answer questions from constituents, made requests for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to expedite hurricane relief for farmers affected by Hurricane Helene, questioned Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services nominee about the CDC firings in Georgia, and pressed the Environmental Protection Agency about canceling a federal grant to open a new health clinic in Thomasville, Ga.

Costs for service members

On May 1, Ossoff and Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) introduced bipartisan legislation to lower costs for service members and their families.

According to a press release, the Improving Service Members Civil Relief Act Benefit Utilization Act was introduced to ""expand access to financial protections and benefits available to active duty service members and their families.""

The SCRA legislation would provide legal and financial protections to active duty service members, including National Guard and Reserve members and their families. However, a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report reveals this benefit is often underutilized.

The legislation would ""expand existing financial literacy programs to include information about these protections; require the Department of Defense's annual survey to include information about these programs; include benefits information on all activation orders; and require creditors to apply a 6% cap to all eligible accounts under the jurisdiction once a service member invokes their SCRA rights,"" per the press release.

""Georgia's service members and their families deserve the very best, yet many are unaware of key benefits to help them save money,"" Ossoff said in a statement. ""I'm introducing this new bipartisan bill to expand access to these key financial protections for our heroic service members and help them save money and build wealth.""

Civil Rights cold cases

On May 2, Ossoff and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) announced they introduced bipartisan legislation to help get justice for civil rights cold case victims and their families.

According to a press release, the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Reauthorization Act ""would strengthen and extend the Civil Rights Cold Cases Review Board's authority through 2031 to help ensure the public release of records related to Civil Rights cold cases dates 1940 through 1979 and help enable states and local authorities to release records in their possession.""

The legislation came after 2022, when the senators passed the Civil Rights Cold Cases Investigation Support Act of 2022 into law. This act extended the Review Board's term through 2027, guaranteeing its continued work.

""For too long, families of Civil Rights cold case victims have waited for answers and justice,"" Ossoff said in a statement. ""Our bipartisan bill is an opportunity to pursue justice and truth on behalf of those who were killed. There's no expiration date on justice. That's why this effort must continue.""

South Fulton Town Hall

On May 4, Warnock hosted a town hall in southwest Atlanta, where he answered constituents' questions for over two hours about what he is doing for Georgians amid the Trump administration's budget cuts, tariffs, and foreign policy.

RELATED: Sen. Raphael Warnock holds town hall in Southwest Atlanta

""I am doing everything I can with the tools I have,"" Warnock said. ""But those tools are not the same as they were my first two congresses. But I'm going to use the tools I have. Just because we're out of power doesn't mean we don't have any power.""

USPS postmaster general

On May 5, following the resignation of former Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, Ossoff urged the USPS Board of Governors to pick a new postmaster general who could solve the continued mail delays throughout Georgia.

""My constituents and I cannot emphasize this strongly enough, are beside themselves at the consistent and recurring failure of USPS leadership to execute their basic mission in Georgia,"" Ossoff wrote to the Board of Governors.

The inquiry comes after USPS released data last month reporting that Georgia District's Overall First-Class Mail Service is 7.7% below the national average.

""The absence of a Postmaster General leaves USPS without direction and the urgency necessary to ensure timely delivery. Georgians deserve reliable on-time mail delivery, and competent leadership that will deliver results,"" Ossoff continued. ""I once again urge you to swiftly appoint a new Postmaster General who will completely correct the abysmal failure of Postmaster General DeJoy's Delivering for America program.""

Aviation workforce

On May 6, Warnock and Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced legislation to amend the Internal Revenue Code to decrease the financial barrier to entering the aviation career field.

The legislation would lower the barriers by making expenses for aviation education programs eligible for 529 tax savings plans to help save for education costs.

According to a press release, the Aviation Workforce Development Act would allow ""students pursuing FAA-certified flight and aviation maintenance programs to now use their 529 plan funds to cover these educational costs.""

""The Aviation Workforce Development Act builds on my efforts to create educational pipelines that welcome Georgians from every zip code into this critical industry,"" Warnock said in a statement. ""This is a bipartisan and bicameral bill for a reason — these are commonsense solutions to address needs throughout our aviation industry, and I'm proud to work alongside Senators Scott and Cantwell in this effort.""

Georgia farmers hurricane relief

On May 6, Ossoff called on U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to expedite hurricane relief for Georgia farmers impacted by Hurricane Helene at a U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies hearing.

Per a press release, Ossoff shared stories from constituents, including Arren Moses, owner of Moses Pecan in Uvalda, Ga.

""We lost almost our entire 2024 pecan crop when Hurricane Helene hit our orchards,"" he told Ossoff's office. ""We lost the majority of our mature pecan trees, which will set our farm's production back for years. We were thankful that Congress approved disaster assistance funding at the end of last year, but it's critical that these funds get to those that need help.""

""Chris Hopkins, a cotton producer in Toombs County, also told Sen. Ossoff's office that the storm has 'created a void due to loss of yield and quality as well as cost of cleanup that has become untenable to a first-generation operation like mine.'""

Rollins said the USDA will do everything possible to make Helene disaster funding available ""by the end of the month"" if not by the following week.

Public safety grants

On May 6, Warnock joined Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), and almost 30 other senators in urging Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Maureen Henneberg to reverse the cancellation of hundreds of public grants throughout the country via letter.

""On April 22, the Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) notified hundreds of grant recipients across the country, without warning, that their funding had been terminated, effective immediately,"" the senators wrote. ""Many of these grants are authorized by Congress and support programs that have enhanced public safety in communities rural and urban, affluent and poor, Democratic and Republican.

""While this administration continues to market itself as the administration of law and order and public safety, DOJ has decided to defund programs that prosecutors, police and sheriff's departments, judges, mental health service providers, academics, and more depend on to advance the Department's longstanding 'core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously enforcing the law.'""

""Based on public reporting, outreach from grantees, and a DOJ Justice Management Division (JMD) spreadsheet, … it appears that the Department defunded at least 365 public safety grants on April 22, 2025. A review of this information reveals that these grants provide support for victims of crime and resources for communities to ensure public safety,"" the senators continued.

Per a press release, the senators requested answers to nine questions about cancellations, ""including whether the Department has reallocated the money to other programs and how officials determined which grants should be canceled.""

""Additionally, we advise that the Department restore immediately the grants terminated on April 22. The cursory termination of these programs imperils the public safety of the victims and communities that rely on these critical resources,"" the senators concluded.

CDC firings

On May 7, Warnock requested answers from Jim O'Neill, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services nominee, at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about the firings of CDC public health employees in Georgia.

""Mr. O'Neill, these folks are my constituents; I know them; they are my neighbors; I bump into them at the grocery store. Many of them had just gotten performance evaluations saying they are doing an outstanding job. Only to be fired weeks later for 'Performance issues,'"" Warnock said in his questioning. ""If confirmed, you'd oversee personnel, yes or no. Do you think it is appropriate to fire HHS or CDC, public health experts, for 'performance issues' that have just gotten positive performance evaluations?""

In addition, on May 8, Warnock and Ossoff led an effort via letter to request a meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to discuss the firing of Georgia CDC employees.

The senators requested that the meeting occur on Wednesday, May 14, when Kennedy will testified before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.

Political discrimination in disaster assistance

On May 8, Ossoff announced that he launched a push to pass bipartisan legislation, first introduced by Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), that would stop political discrimination when providing federal disaster assistance.

According to a press release, the Stopping Political Discrimination in Disaster Assistance Act would ""prohibit in Federal law any political discrimination when Federal agencies provide disaster assistance after a natural disaster.""

""No American impacted by a natural disaster should ever, ever be denied assistance based on their political beliefs,"" Ossoff said in a statement. ""That's why I helped introduce this bipartisan bill to prohibit in law political discrimination in the provision of Federal disaster assistance.""

Paine College commencement speech

On May 11, Warnock delivered the commencement speech to the Class of 2025 at Paine College in Augusta, Ga., one of 10 historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in Georgia.

According to a press release, Warnock, the only sitting U.S. senator to graduate from an HBCU, ""urged the graduates to make their life's project longer and larger than their lifespan and give themselves over to a mission that is larger than themselves.""

At the commencement, Paine College also awarded Warnock the honorary doctor of humane letters degree and a plaque of appreciation for delivering the speech.

Thomasville health clinic

On May 14, Ossoff questioned the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin about the cancellation of a federal grant to open a new health clinic and upgrade water infrastructure in Thomasville, Ga., during a U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and Related Agencies hearing.

The city of Thomasville reported that the grant would have been used to open a new health clinic in an area struggling with air pollution.

Per a press release, ""Thomasville Mayor Todd Mobley told Sen. Ossoff's office the award represented a 'transformative opportunity to make vital health and safety improvements.'""

""Oftentimes, these rural communities don't get the love and attention of the federal government. They can be forgotten,"" Ossoff said at the hearing. ""In Georgia, big cities tend to get a lot of the federal support. So there was great news for the good people of Thomasville last year when they won an EPA grant to help build a new health clinic, rehabbing the gym and the school to build a new Federally qualified health center near three daycare centers, as well as to upgrade wastewater infrastructure.

I’m pleased to join with my colleagues and the Environmental Protection Agency today to announce continued investments we secured together through this program for environmental cleanup and economic revitalization, including at sites in Hartford and Torrington.
We are also proud to receive a $2 million Community-Wide Assessment Grant for Connecticut,” said Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection Commissioner, Katie Dykes.
“This funding will promote the cleanup of contaminated sites, turning long-abandoned properties into community assets that support public health, environmental safety, and economic development.
Today’s announcement follows $9 million in federal funding the delegation announced last year with President Biden from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to expedite the assessment and cleanup of brownfield sites in Connecticut while advancing environmental justice.","Hartford, CT – Today, members of the Connecticut Congressional Delegation announced nearly $7 million in federal Brownfields Grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Connecticut communities.

“Brownfields funding has supported the revitalization of former industrial areas and the cleanup of contaminated sites across our state for three decades, historically with strong, bipartisan support,” said Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01). “Our entire delegation has worked together to ensure these investments continue, boosting funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and writing to the Trump Administration earlier this year when they unilaterally suspended $8.6 million in approved funds for Connecticut’s brownfield remediation sites. I’m pleased to join with my colleagues and the Environmental Protection Agency today to announce continued investments we secured together through this program for environmental cleanup and economic revitalization, including at sites in Hartford and Torrington. I remain committed to working with the Administration to create good-paying jobs in our region and protect the health and safety of our residents.”

“This $7 million in federal funding will help revitalize Connecticut’s communities, transforming hazardous sites into opportunities. Brownfields threaten our environment and hamper local economic development efforts, but this substantial investment will make an invaluable impact in cleaning up the mistakes of the past and building a more sustainable future,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal.

“Great to see another round of federal dollars—which were funded by Congress last year—coming back to Connecticut to assess and clean up abandoned and blighted properties. Approval of these hard -won grants is a true testament to our communities’ eagle eye focus on securing funds to support economic and community development,” said Rep. Joe Courtney (CT-02). “There’s no question that the federal infrastructure law is turbocharging these investments to transform polluted land to economic hubs. This new round of funding brings the total investment for brownfield grants in CT-02 to well-over $10 million through the federal infrastructure law in just three years.”

“Connecticut has made meaningful progress in transforming former industrial sites into vibrant, productive spaces that benefit our residents, environment, and economy,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-03). “These EPA Brownfields Grants not only safeguard the environment, but will continue to drive investment, job creation, and economic resilience in our communities.”

“The $7 million in Brownfield Grants Connecticut will receive this year will significantly aid our state’s efforts to remediate contaminated properties and former industrial sites to restore them to land once again suitable for use,” said Rep. Jim Himes (CT-04). “I’m especially excited that the City of Bridgeport will receive an additional $1 million to continue cleaning up properties around the city and I look forward to visiting the rehabilitated land once the projects are completed.”

“People in Connecticut deserve to live in a clean and safe environment. The deterioration of industrial sites and the prevalence of distressed properties inflict the greatest hardship on children and families in surrounding communities. These areas face significant barriers to economic progress and an elevated risk of long-term health problems. This funding will provide crucial support for the Naugatuck Valley and Greater Hartford regions, aiding remediation efforts and helping to transform them into centers of opportunity,” said Rep. Jahana Hayes (CT-05).

“DEEP congratulates the Capitol Region, Metropolitan, Naugatuck Valley, and Southeastern Councils of Governments on earning EPA brownfield grants. We are also proud to receive a $2 million Community-Wide Assessment Grant for Connecticut,” said Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection Commissioner, Katie Dykes. “This funding will promote the cleanup of contaminated sites, turning long-abandoned properties into community assets that support public health, environmental safety, and economic development. It’s a win for cleaner neighborhoods, stronger local economies, and a more affordable, vibrant future.”

“The Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments (SECOG) is thrilled to receive this $1.2 million EPA Brownfield Assessments Coalition Grant, which will allow SECOG to address potential contaminated properties in our region,” said Amanda Kennedy, SECOG Executive Director. “This funding is not just an investment in environmental assessment at brownfield properties – it’s an investment in the region’s economy, giving local communities a voice in shaping the future of these sites. We’re proud to partner with the Eastern Connecticut Land Bank and the Connecticut Resource Conservation and Development District as we work collaboratively with SECOG communities to turn these underutilized properties into assets for their communities.”

The move means House leadership will need to cobble together a new version of a bill that already cut critical federal programs too deeply, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Like many House members, UCS also is concerned about the bill’s wholesale roll back of federal climate incentives that are driving a clean energy boom.

“This bill will raise costs for consumers and folks in need, while destroying American innovation and lowering taxes for the already super rich,” said David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. “Not only is this bill shockingly cruel in the depth of cuts it would impose, it shows the majority and president are totally cut off from reality. In their fantasy world, people deserve to fall through the massive holes cut in the U.S. social safety net, consumers should pay more for energy and transportation to support the oil and gas industries, and billionaires deserve lower taxes. In addition, Congress went out of its way to create a loophole by which the administration can target nonprofits the president doesn't like without due process—stunning and shameful.”

Below is information about the sections of the bill UCS analysts are following.

Energy sections of the bill, including those that would:

• Effectively repeal the clean electricity tax credits through nearly immediate phaseout, unworkable supply chain restrictions, and limited access to transferability, which would slow the vital buildout of new sources of electricity generation and undermine the market signal to increase domestic manufacturing.

o Undermining the clean electricity tax credits threatens to send electricity prices soaring, severely slowing the deployment of the lowest-cost sources of electricity generation right as demand is expected to surge.

o Shifting eligibility to “placed in service” would further accelerate the credit phaseout and threaten to fully derail future projects.

• Cut targeted investments in critical grid infrastructure, including transmission, intended to alleviate the challenges of rapidly rising electricity demand and increase the reliability and resilience of the electricity system.

• Cut numerous programs intended to help people, communities and companies transition to cleaner and more efficient ways of using energy.

• Repeal tax credits that help people make their homes more energy efficient, which would force people to pay more to heat and cool their homes.

• Restrict access to, and shorten the timeframe of, the advanced manufacturing credits, which would slow the nation’s pivot to forward-looking investments in the clean economy.

• Repeal the clean hydrogen production tax credit.

• Create numerous attempted shortcuts and bailouts for fossil fuel interests, including pay-to-play provisions.

• Defund and delay implementation of a program that incentivizes the cleanup of methane pollution from oil and gas systems.

Clean transportation sections of the bill, including those that would:

• Functionally repeal clean vehicle tax credits, which would make it harder for drivers and fleets to switch to electric vehicles (EVs).

o While drivers can save hundreds of dollars a year in reduced fuel and maintenance costs by switching to electric, the upfront cost of electric cars and trucks can be a hurdle, which is why the tax credits were targeted to increase everyone’s accessibility to EVs.

• Repeal clean vehicle infrastructure tax credits, which would make it harder for drivers and businesses to invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure in the locations that need it the most: rural and underserved areas.

o Lack of access to charging stations is cited as one of the most common barriers for drivers interested in switching to electric. Repealing this credit would only benefits the oil industry, at the expense of suppliers manufacturing the charging infrastructure, union workers installing and maintaining the chargers, and drivers and fleet operators looking to save money and clean the air by switching to electric.

• Cut fuel efficiency (CAFE) and pollution standards for cars and trucks, attacking one of the largest federal actions ever taken on climate change and directly impacting people’s wallets.

o Eliminating the global warming pollution rules would increase fuel and maintenance costs for new vehicles by $6,000 over the life of the vehicles; rolling back the commonsense CAFE standards would increase fuel costs by $23 billion through 2050.

• Claw back congressionally approved funds for the Clean Heavy Duty Program and Clean Ports Program (CPP), which would delay the replacement of heavy-duty vehicles, such as school buses and vocational vehicles, with zero-emission models and make it harder for U.S. ports to invest in zero-emission equipment.

o The vehicles, vessels, and equipment that move freight create hot spots of some of the worst air quality in the country and contribute significantly to climate change. There is no safe level of soot to breathe, and despite making up a small fraction of vehicles on the road, heavy duty vehicles are disproportionately responsible for global warming emissions, soot and smog-forming pollution.

SNAP and ag sections of the bill, including the plan to:

• Increase farm bill spending by roughly $60 billion by slashing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps millions of low-income Americans, both rural and urban, to put food on their tables. In doing so, the bill abandons the systems approach we need to fix the nation’s food and farm system.

Defense sections of the bill that would:

• Spend $25 billion on the development of a hugely expensive, unrealistic, and counterproductive homeland missile defense system called Golden Dome, which includes a system of space-based weapons that would try to destroy nuclear-armed missiles as they launch. UCS analysis has shown that such systems are very expensive, technically challenging to build, and readily defeated as well as globally destabilizing and likely to lead to less security, not more.

• Increase spending on the troubled, behind-schedule and very over-budget Sentinel land-based ballistic missile program, which UCS recommends cancelling, given it is expensive, dangerous and unnecessary.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:31.046156

“I see first-hand how the clean energy tax credits have delivered on their promise, creating good family-sustaining union jobs across Wisconsin,” Jacobs said.
Adesso said the tax credits gave the district “certainty” it needed to be willing to undertake the clean energy additions to the project.
Clean energy as we know is the future, and we have to continue to invest in it.”","The tax cut legislation that U.S. House of Representatives Republicans are putting together in Washington includes measures that will cost thousands of jobs in Wisconsin and undercut the state’s progress toward cleaner energy, according to environmental and labor advocates.

To help pay for the extension of tax cuts enacted in the first Trump administration, the GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee is proposing to repeal clean energy tax credits, Politico reported this week. The tax credits were among the measures enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

“These credits are not just numbers on a balance sheet out in Washington D.C,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in an online press conference Wednesday. “They are representing real jobs, real economic growth, and real progress towards Wisconsin’s sustainable energy infrastructure. Since the IRA was signed into law in 2022 we have seen an unprecedented boom in clean energy development in the trades.”

The press conference was hosted by Forward Together Wisconsin, a nonprofit established to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.

“We’ve been seeing this real opportunity to drive energy costs down, and I cannot for the life of me understand why people want to reverse that progress,” said former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, president of Forward Together Wisconsin.

In addition to the tax credits that the U.S. House proposal would repeal, President Donald Trump in his second term has frozen federal clean energy grants that were part of the 2022 legislation. Those include grants to establish a network of electric vehicle charging stations — prompting a lawsuit by 15 states, including Wisconsin.

Solar energy investments that have boomed in the last three years are among those that are threatened by the House proposal, according to advocates.

“At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement this week.

Since passage of the IRA, Wisconsin has seen $933 million in clean energy and transportation private-sector investments, along with just over $2 billion from federal grants and loans, according to Innovation Policy & Technology, a San Francisco climate change policy think tank. The organization tallied 61 new clean energy and transportation projects that got underway in the state, with 45 manufacturing American-made products.

“Lower investment and higher energy bills due to repealing these federal programs and tax incentives will cost nearly 5,200 Wisconsin jobs in 2030 and more than 6,400 jobs in 2035, compared to current policies,” Innovation Policy & Technology reported.

The advocacy group Climate Power has calculated that without the federal support $5.4 billion for 15 planned Wisconsin clean energy projects could be in jeopardy.

Of those projects, 12 — 80% — are in five congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Climate Power. Three representatives of those districts — Bryan Steil in the 1st CD, Scott Fitzgerald in the 5th CD and Glenn Grothman in the 6th CD — voted against the IRA in 2022. The other two, Derrick Van Orden in the 3rd CD and Tony Wied in the 8th CD, weren’t in office at the time but publicly opposed the legislation.

John Jacobs, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 494 in Southeast Wisconsin, said the clean energy tax credits and related policies have spurred investment and employment for the union’s members.

“I see first-hand how the clean energy tax credits have delivered on their promise, creating good family-sustaining union jobs across Wisconsin,” Jacobs said. “Repealing these tax credits could be devastating to many, but would put thousands of jobs at risk and hurt a growing industry.”

The tax credits were “an investment in America,” he added. The jobs lost if the credits are repealed “translate to economic instability for families across our state.”

The IRA also included a provision that extends the value of the tax credits to nonprofit organizations and government agencies.

Thanks to that benefit, called direct support payment, the Menasha Joint School District in the Fox Valley has qualified for a $4 million reimbursement from the federal government for installing rooftop solar energy and geothermal energy systems in a school currently under construction, said Brian Adesso, the school district’s business services director.

Once the school is complete the district expects to save $159,000 a year on its electric bill, “which is cost savings to local taxpayers and money that can be invested back into the students and staff,” Adesso said at the Forward Wisconsin press conference.

Adesso said the tax credits gave the district “certainty” it needed to be willing to undertake the clean energy additions to the project. Killing the credits would make that choice harder for school districts and impose higher costs on local property taxpayers, he added.

“The bill making its way through Congress takes a sledgehammer to the tax credits,” Addesso said — ending some credits early and attaching “bureaucratic restrictions that could make many of the credits unusable.”

Barnes said Forward Wisconsin Together is calling on Congress to protect the clean energy initiatives. “The people of Wisconsin deserve better,” he said. “The country deserves better. Clean energy as we know is the future, and we have to continue to invest in it.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dsc_0370-scaled-e1696034646170-1024x6831744384896-1.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:34.176156

""But it is not optimal for this court, far removed from the circumstances on the ground, to determine in the first instance the precise process necessary to satisfy the Constitution in this case,"" the court continued and, referring to the federal appellate court that ""erred in dismissing the detainees' appeal for lack of jurisdiction,"" said that ""we remand the case to the 5th Circuit for that purpose.""

Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project and lead counsel in the case, said Friday that ""the court's decision to stay removals is a powerful rebuke to the government's attempt to hurry people away to a gulag-type prison in El Salvador.""

""The use of a wartime authority during peacetime, without even affording due process, raises issues of profound importance,"" Gelernt added.

The Supreme Court opinion noted the case of Kilmar Abrego García, a Maryland man with protected status who was wrongfully deported to CECOT in March. Last month, the high court unanimously ruled that Trump must facilitate Abrego García's return to the United States. The Trump administration has resisted the order, despite the president proclaiming that ""if the Supreme Court said, 'Bring somebody back,' I would do that.""

Steve Vadeck, a professor at Georgetown Law Center, toldCNN Friday that ""because lower courts have blocked use of the [Alien Enemies Act] in every other district in which the president has sought to invoke it, that means it's effectively pausing all removals under the act until the 5th Circuit—and, presumably, the Supreme Court itself—conclusively resolves whether they're legal and how much process is due if so.""

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Haines—who was appointed by Trump—issued the first court ruling supporting Alien Enemies Act deportations.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed in recent days as Israeli forces pressed ahead with Operation Gideon's Chariots, a plan to conquer and indefinitely occupy all of Gaza and ethnically cleanse much of its population, possibly to make way for Jewish recolonization of the strip as advocated by numerous Israeli government officials.

Local and international media reported that at least 115 Palestinians including children were killed by Israeli attacks since dawn Friday, with air, artillery, and tank strikes concentrated in Beit Lahia and the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

""Netanyahu has declared that there is 'no way' Israel will stop the war, even if all hostages are released, and he has vowed to completely reoccupy Gaza and force remaining Palestinians off their land,"" McCaw wrote. ""His Cabinet has formally approved a full-scale ground invasion and permanent military occupation of the Gaza Strip. One senior Israeli minister openly stated that Gaza will be 'completely destroyed.'""

""This is it. Now or never. We implore you to condemn Netanyahu's plan, demand a permanent end to this genocidal war, and pledge to oppose further weapons sales to the Israeli government unless its human rights abuses stop,"" the letter continues. ""As long as the Israeli government believes it will continue to receive unlimited American financial, military, and diplomatic support, Netanyahu has no reason to risk his grip on power by changing course.""

Israeli and international critics accuse Netanyahu of risking the lives of 23 living hostages still being held by Hamas by prolonging the war in a bid to forestall a reckoning in his criminal corruption trial.

""Netanyahu has made clear what he plans to do: destroy Gaza and ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people, even if it means starving and slaughtering the Israeli hostages along with them,"" CAIR said. ""There is no more time left to sit on the sidelines, make symbolic statements, or hope something better will happen.""

""Netanyahu has made clear what he plans to do: destroy Gaza and ethnically cleanse the Palestinian people.""

""Children are being blown to pieces every single hour with American weapons,"" the group noted. ""Babies are starving to death while food rots at the Gaza border. Mothers and fathers are dying with them, and the Israeli captives held in Gaza are at risk of starving to death or being killed by the Israeli government's indiscriminate bombing campaign.""

""Please speak up forcefully and demand an end to this madness before there is no one left to save,"" the letter implores.

Earlier this week, Ben Cohen, co-founder of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream company, was arrested after disrupting a Senate hearing, shouting, ""Congress kills poor kids in Gaza by buying bombs and pays for it by kicking kids off Medicaid in the U.S."" as he was hauled off by police.

""Congress and the senators need to ease the siege,"" Cohen added. ""They need to let food into Gaza. They need to let food to starving kids!""

The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report, published Monday, states that 244,000 people in Gaza are now in Phase 5, defined as such ""an extreme deprivation of food"" that ""starvation, death, destitution, and extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition are or will likely be evident.""

At least scores of Palestinians—including a minimum of 57 children and 14 elders—have died of severe malnutrition combined with lack of medical care throughout Gaza, United Nations experts and human rights groups said in recent days.

Already suffering under an Israeli blockade imposed in 2007 after Hamas took power in the coastal enclave, Gazans have been ravaged by hunger and illness due to the ""complete siege"" imposed by Israel immediately after the Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack. The siege was tightened on March 2, when Israel stopped all lifesaving supplies—including food, medicine, fuel, and cooking gas—from entering the strip.

Israel's blockade, use of starvation as a weapon of war, killing or wounding of more than 187,000 Palestinians—including thousands missing and feared dead and buried beneath rubble—mass forced displacement of more than 2 million Gazans, and eliminationist statements by Israeli leaders and others are all being reviewed in The Hague as part of the South Africa-led genocide case against Israel currently before the International Court of Justice.

Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant are also wanted by the International Criminal Court, also in The Hague, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity including extermination and forced starvation.

Also on Friday, CAIR welcomed a resolution signed by 27 Democratic and two Independent U.S. senators calling on the administration of President Donald Trump to ""use all available diplomatic tools"" to secure an end to Israel's assault on Gaza, the hostages' release, and a lifting of the siege in order to allow ""urgent delivery of humanitarian aid to address the needs of civilians.""

While many Israelis and their supporters around the world deny that there is mass starvation in Gaza, both Trump and Mike Huckabee, his ambassador to Israel, have acknowledged that Palestinians are starving. On the final day of his Mideast tour Friday, Trump said in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates that ""a lot of people are starving"" in Gaza, and ""we're going to get that taken care of.""

However, Huckabee recently admitted that a U.S.-Israeli plan to deliver limited humanitarian aid to parts of Gaza would initially only feed around 60% of the population. The United Nations and humanitarian groups operating in Gaza have rejected the plan.

A provision in the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which went into effect in 2014, allowed states to expand eligibility for Medicaid to all low-income adults regardless of disability or parenthood status. The change is part of the reason that enrollment in the program rose roughly 50% between 2010 and 2021, according to the authors of the study.

The study, which used a dataset of 37 million low-income American adults, found that expansions increased Medicaid enrollment by 12 percentage points. The study estimates that people who enrolled in Medicaid were 21% less likely to die compared to those not enrolled.

""These expansions appear to be cost-effective, with direct budgetary costs of $5.4 million per life saved and $179,000 per life-year,"" according to a summary of the working paper.

The researchers told the Times that the timing of the release of the working paper was not connected to Congress' current conversation around Medicaid, though they told the outlet that the debate made their findings especially relevant.

The Times described the research as ""the most definitive study yet"" on Medicaid's health effects and health economists not involved with the research described it as the most persuasive proof so far that Medicaid and other types of health insurance save lives.

Meanwhile, on Friday, efforts to pass the GOP megabill hit a stumbling block when a handful of Republican co-called ""fiscal hawks"" voted with Democrats on the U.S. House Budget Committee to block the reconciliation package from advancing through a key committee vote. The Republican hardliners voted no because they want more cuts to Medicaid.

After the vote, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a panel member, vowed that Democrats would ""keep fighting to protect Medicaid and the American people.""

In response to the House Budget Committee vote, Alex Lawson, executive director of the advocacy group Social Security Works said on Friday: ""Make no mistake, Republicans still plan to bring it to the House floor next week.""

Lawson blasted the proposed Medicaid cuts, writing that ""their plan will kill people.""

""The ripple effect of these cuts will hit every single person in this country,"" he added. ""Unless you are a billionaire, your standard of living and your health care will get worse if this despicable plan becomes law.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zMjEwMDM4OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTE0ODI1N30.nWE-dO3LpGCfrP6HKKrgMGYA-9xT8aazabGiQTfcsrM/image.png?width=210,N,,2025-05-16 23:02:38.015632

Engineered for the EV environment

Unlike ICE vehicles, which use heavy gear oil in their differentials, EV drive modules share a lubrication system with the motor and use lower-viscosity oils that flow more like water. Eaton’s Truetrac has been redesigned with micro-geometry tuning to ensure durability in this thinner oil environment, with material science advancements applied to ensure longevity in high-torque applications.

Another key factor in EV differentiation is noise, vibration and harshness. EVs are more sensitive to drivetrain noise due to the absence of traditional engine sounds that would mask mechanical operation. To account for this, Eaton has refined the EV Truetrac’s gear design to minimize noise while maintaining seamless operation.

Low-Energy Fridays: If Our Grid Goes Down, How Do We Get Our Lights Back On?

Two weeks ago, tens of millions on the Iberian Peninsula lost electricity. While the reason for the disturbance could take years to discern, it’s likely that no single cause led to the blackout. Previous issues of this type and magnitude resulted from a confluence of mishaps and misfortune. If the American experience is any gauge, a final assessment of the event won’t be available for a while.

The Iberian event is a reminder of how fast things happen in the world of electricity. Unlike other utilities, such as gas or water, electricity is consumed immediately. In order to protect equipment from voltage or frequency variations that could harm mechanics or electronics, power plant operators, utilities, and large customers install technology that disconnects facilities from the grid when things go awry. Advancements in these technologies mean that disconnections can occur nearly instantaneously. This is what happened in Spain and Portugal, where power plants—some large enough to serve more than a million homes—disconnected from the grid when they sensed it was out of sync, ironically making the system even more unstable. A cascading process of generation and load rapidly disconnecting from the grid exacerbated its imbalance, resulting in a complete blackout.

The lights are back on in Spain and Portugal, but the event raises at least two questions: Has the United States experienced similar blackouts? When blackouts occur, how is the electric system restarted and service restored?

As for the first question, yes—the United States has experienced blackouts. It’s important to note the distinction between a “blackout” and “rotating outages,” sometimes referred to as “rolling blackouts.” Rolling outages are not blackouts, but rather are targeted and intentional interruptions of electricity conducted to balance demand and supply while maintaining some extra power to make up for sudden disruptions. Blackouts are uncontrolled and result in the mass disconnection of generation from the grid, bringing everything to a halt.

The most recent major blackout event in the United States happened in 2021 during Winter Storm Uri. While limited to the intra-Texas grid, the event was significant and lasted a number of days. However, the Texas experience was more an example of a multi-day lack of available supply due to frigid temperatures, frozen power plants, and undeliverable gas supply than the result of an unstable grid. The closest U.S. parallel to the Iberian event was the Northeast Blackout of 2003, which affected 50 million Americans and Canadians.

In the 2003 blackout, North America experienced its largest disruption in electricity supply, resulting in billions of dollars in economic damage and leaving some customers in the Northeast United States and Canada without power for days. The event started in Ohio due to several factors including insufficient and unclear transmission planning obligations, utilities’ and grid operators’ lack of situational awareness of the grid, and the failure of a utility to adequately manage trees in its transmission rights of way.

These issues were exacerbated by a lack of grid services that could have been called upon to alleviate the impact of multiple transmission outages. The 2003 blackout didn’t affect further geographic areas because the affected area was essentially disconnected from the broader grid after the problems arose; however, the damage had been done. After only a few hours (culminating in a rapid few minutes of cascading outages), the Northeast was completely without power.

Spain re-energized its entire system within 24 hours, and Portugal needed only half that time to reach 100 percent restoration. As for the Northeast Blackout, the system mostly came back online within 30 hours. The process of restarting a system from a blackout is methodical and completed in a stepwise manner rather than all at once, as disorderly restoration runs the risk of another blackout. The restoration process starts with blackstart units, which are capable of starting up from a shutdown without assistance from the grid or other power plants. In lieu of blackstart units, direct transmission ties can be used to bring power from other areas to start up non-blackstart generating units. Imports or power from blackstart units are then directed toward other generating stations that require outside power to restart and coordinate with the grid. The power from newly connected generators is used to bring on others, and so on, while load is reconnected to slowly balance the grid.

As we wait for the Iberian blackout’s causes to be determined, we hope Europeans use it as a learning opportunity the way the United States did following the 2003 event. Congress passed sweeping energy policy legislation with more robust electricity reliability expectations, which the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) have implemented over the past two decades. Lessons learned from reliability events routinely inform the standards set and enforced by FERC and NERC, and we can learn from the Iberian blackout as well—even if it takes years to determine the root causes.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AdobeStock_1004092128.jpeg,N,,2025-05-17 07:03:39.552044

Initially, Tesla prohibited customers from purchasing leased Model 3 sedans at lease-end, citing the need for an upcoming robotaxi fleet.

This policy expanded to all models by 2022 but was reversed in November, with the robotaxis never materialising.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said: “You don’t have the option of buying. We want them back. Next year, for sure we’ll have over one million robotaxis on the road.”

Tesla sold many previously leased cars to new buyers after updating their features via software upgrades.

This move allowed the company to sell the vehicles at a higher price, with one source noting it was a way to “jack up the price” of used cars.

Tesla has leased over 314,000 vehicles, representing 4.4% of its total deliveries.

The no-buy policy was justified by the need for robotaxi supply, signalling to investors that Tesla was nearing fully autonomous driving technology.

This belief contributed to a 1,500% rise in Tesla’s stock since 2019, solidifying its position as the world’s most valuable automaker.

Tesla mentioned in its website in 2019 that: “Customers who choose leasing over owning will not have the option to purchase their car at the end of the lease, because with full autonomy coming in the future via an over-the-air software update, we plan to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network.”

The lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) battery, too, originated in the U.S., with foundational work led by battery pioneer John Goodenough at the University of Texas at Austin.

China seized on these breakthroughs and scaled them, whereas the U.S. got distracted and lacked foresight.

Welcome to the Friday edition of Critical Materials, your daily round-up of news and events shaping the world of electric cars and technology. Also on our radar today: Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa is gutting the company’s workforce and reducing its production footprint to cut costs. And Tesla is urging battery maker Panasonic to increase U.S. output due to tariffs.

30%: The LFP Battery Was America’s Gift To China

CATL Shenxing Plus LFP battery

The LFP battery is playing an increasingly central role in the global EV revolution. It’s cheaper to produce than NMC batteries, largely because it doesn’t rely on expensive materials like nickel and cobalt. It also offers better thermal stability and more consistent performance, though it comes with lower energy density.

Now, the very battery chemistry that originated in the U.S. is hitting remarkable milestones in China, powering EVs with longer range and even supporting megawatt-level charging speeds.

As The Detroit News notes, battery pioneers John Goodenough and Arumugam Manthiram laid the foundation for LFP technology with two landmark papers on iron-based cathodes in 1987 and 1989, published out of the University of Texas at Austin. They had cracked the code for a safer, low-cost battery that didn’t suffer from voltage fade. Goodenough later published the first formal paper on LFP in 1997.

Here’s more from the outlet:

""It took so many years to develop as a product,"" Manthiram said about LFP, ""but the intellectual concept was done by the great people in the great country of the United States of America—I want to say that very loud and clear — not in China.""

UT Austin went on to patent the technology, but that patent didn’t cover China. So the country had access to the research from day one. But the U.S. didn’t see the potential of LFP at the time, and yearned for batteries that required less frequent charging—something that wasn’t LFP’s strength at the time.

And here comes the chilling part from the report:

""The important point is the resources and not paying attention, looking near-term or for short-term gains, and not paying attention to long-term gains,"" Manthiram said.

""Our own arrogance of American thought process has got to be recalibrated,"" said Bob Galyen, the former chief technology officer of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., (CATL) the Chinese battery maker from which Ford is licensing the LFP technology for its Marshall plant in south-central Michigan.

""I never dreamed of helping to create a behemoth of a corporation that is light-years ahead of everybody else.""

Today, U.S. automakers do use LFP. Entry-level versions of the Tesla Model 3, Ford Mustang Mach-E, and Rivian’s R1T and R1S are all equipped with it. But China has leapfrogged ahead. And it’s a disturbing fact that U.S. research helped kickstart what is now the world’s largest battery maker: CATL, a company that has built its empire on LFP and now leads the world in installed battery capacity.

Other Chinese firms—BYD, CALB, and Gotion—have also propelled LFP to dominance, with the chemistry making up nearly 81% of installed battery production in China.

So at this point, the question isn’t whether the U.S. has fallen behind. It’s a tiring reality. Yes, American battery manufacturing is growing and EV sales are rising. But after Tesla’s early steps in scaling up EVs and building out America’s most comprehensive fast-charging network, we haven’t really seen another true disrupter emerge—no radical leaps in charging speeds, range, or breakthrough innovations.

Now, the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts to the Department of Energy—and to other science-driven agencies—could further erode America’s long-held edge in R&D.

60%: Nissan’s Radical Turnaround Plan

The innovation problem is also plaguing Nissan. After years of failing to offer competitive EVs or hybrids, the automaker’s profits are plunging and sales don’t look all that good either. But CEO Ivan Espinosa has a plan—and it’s not sexy.

The 46-year-old chief executive is spearheading the brand’s efforts to slash 20,000 jobs and shutter seven factories to save some $3.3 billion in costs. That also includes cutting engineering costs by 20%, reducing the complexity of parts in cars by 70% and bringing down the number of platforms from 13 to seven.

Here’s more from Automotive News:

“Are we confident that this is enough? The answer is yes, this will be enough to drive the results that we need, but we need to move fast,” he said. “We want to bring the heartbeat back.”

“We wouldn’t be doing this if it was not necessary for the survival of Nissan,” he said.

The automaker plans to launch the new-generation Leaf this year, and InsideEVs even got an early look at the EV in Japan in March. Nissan is also planning to launch the next-gen Skyline sedan and a C-segment crossover, along with a compact Infiniti SUV.

But amid its global shuttering of plants, reshuffling of production to minimize damage from tariffs and rising competition means this rescue plan won’t guarantee a positive outcome. Only time will tell if the automaker’s “heartbeat” will truly revive.

90%: Tesla Urges Panasonic To Increase U.S. Battery Output

The Trump administration’s 25% tariffs on foreign vehicles and parts imports are not helping Tesla, despite CEO Elon Musk being the president’s “first buddy.” The automaker is reportedly urging battery supplier Panasonic to fast-track U.S. production of EV batteries.

Panasonic’s chief executive Yuki Kusumi told reporters in Tokyo that its main customer was encouraging faster production of EV batteries in China, the Financial Times reported. Tesla is believed to be by far the largest customer Panasonic has.

The CEO hinted that U.S.-made Panasonic batteries would help EVs qualify for significant tax credits. But the Trump administration is moving aggressively to end the tax credits as part of its budget cuts. House Republicans have already proposed a bill in Congress to end the incentives.

Changes to digestate regulation could also violate existing laws, environmental groups warn.

Biodigesters slowly cook manure, slaughterhouse waste, food scraps, and other materials to produce methane for energy, creating digestate in the process, which is used as fertilizer. More than 130 digesters are operating in Michigan, according to the American Biogas Council, an industry trade group.

Michigan House Bills 4257 and 4265 could assist the buildout of digesters in the state by reducing state oversight of biodigesters and digester waste, regulating digestate as solid waste rather than liquid. Reclassifying digestate and its highly mobile nutrients and contaminants in this manner could threaten well water supplies and drive harmful algal blooms, environmental groups say.

“This is a recipe for creating a rapidly escalating public health and tourism disaster for the state of Michigan,” Christy McGillvray, legislative and political director for the Sierra Club Michigan Chapter, told Michigan’s House Agriculture Committee on Thursday.

The bills are sponsored by Reps. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd) and Joey Andrews (D-St. Joseph). Most of the bills’ cosponsors are Republicans, although they have bipartisan support.

Industry representatives say current regulations mean the state is missing out on jobs and investment.

“Over $14 billion in capital is sitting on the sidelines right now because of these issues, and our industry has the ability to add 30,000 jobs to the state,” Heather Dziedzic, vice president of policy for the American Biogas Council, told the agriculture committee May 8.

Food waste and animal manure could be used to create “renewable natural gas to power or heat over a million homes,” and digestate is valuable fertilizer, she said.

Michigan’s 2023 climate law lists biogas as a renewable energy source. Biogas production can capture some of the methane from the storage of manure and other wastes. Environmental advocates have drawn attention to methane leaks from biodigesters and the potential for digester credits and tax breaks to incentivize large livestock farms, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Digester waste sparks resident, regulator concerns

Reports from those living near the troubled Fremont Digester in west Michigan, which is scheduled to shut down this year, show residents are extremely concerned about digestate from the facility.

In a 2024 statement from For Love of Water and other environmental groups, Kathy Morrison, a farmer living near the Fremont digester, said the smells of digestate were nothing like odors from a nearby turkey concentrated animal feeding operation, or CAFO, or manure applications.

“I could only liken it to having my head in a full port-a-potty,” she said.

Digestate has been found to contain toxic PFAS chemicals and heavy metals, Tracy Keckskemeti, assistant director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s Materials Management Division, told the House committee May 8. Testing has shown the material can also contain E. coli and other harmful bacteria, although anaerobic digestion may break down some of these pathogens.

Concentrated nitrates and phosphorus in digestate could also make water pollution worse, Traverse City-based publication Circle of Blue reports. Increases in phosphorus cause harmful algal blooms like the one that shut down Toledo’s drinking water supply for three days in 2014.

An April memorandum from the Environmental Law and Policy Center said changing how digestate is classified would “further endanger Michigan’s already-threatened water resources.”

“The CAFO and slaughterhouse waste streams defined in these Bills, however, are not ‘solid’ in any meaningful sense of the word and nothing about the anaerobic digestion process changes that,” the memo states, adding the waste streams travel through soil and reach ground and surface water more easily than solid waste.

EGLE officials emphasized on May 8 that digestate is wastewater and Sydney Hart, legislative liaison for EGLE, said the agency cannot support the bills as drafted.

Protecting water a ‘national security issue’

Changing digestate regulations could be especially problematic in the absence of other pollution controls and may violate state and federal law, according to environmental advocates.

Deregulating digestate would mean managing it with the Generally Accepted Agricultural Management Practices, or GAAMPS, Megan Tinsley, water policy director for the Michigan Environmental Council, said at the Thursday hearing. These guidelines are intended to protect farms from nuisance complaints, but don’t address digestate, she said.

“Michigan has over 1.2 million private household drinking water wells. Treating hazardous waste as a solid product and relying on a set of voluntary standards that don’t actually even exist for this cocktail of ingredients is a true recipe for disaster,” Tinsley said.

Changes to digestate regulation could also violate existing laws, environmental groups warn. The ELPC memo says the bills violate several state and federal laws governing pollution as well as the Michigan Constitution’s requirement that the Legislature protect the state’s water and other natural resources.

Changes to digestate rules would also take place in a context where other protections are lacking, according to state Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor).

At the May 8 hearing, she said Michigan still lacks strong polluter pay laws to address contamination or a statewide septic code to protect water resources.

“There’s no backstop there for these wells that are all over our state,” she said, adding that Michigan is unique in having so much fresh water.

“It’s a national security issue. If we’re starting to run out of water, Michigan is where we’re going to get our water.”

The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.

The Trump administration has begun the process of undoing decades of regulations that improved energy efficiency in American household appliances. In a statement announcing the move, the U.S. Department of Energy said those regulations are “driving up costs and lowering quality of life for the American people.”

The legality of this effort is problematic, however, as federal law prohibits the Department of Energy from reversing already approved appliance efficiency standards.

And as a scholar of environmental regulations, I know those regulations were created to save energy and lower utility bills for consumers. I also know that many companies and consumers have supported federal regulation to strengthen energy efficiency standards and generally have opposed weakening them.

The first government-set energy efficiency standards for appliances were issued by California in 1974. They were initially for refrigerators, the household appliance that used the most energy. Subsequently, several other household appliances were added. During the next decade, more states issued standards, as saving energy would help avoid the costs of constructing new power plants.

The proliferation of state standards led the federal government to prohibit states from issuing appliance efficiency standards once the federal government had done so. The first federal standards, in 1987, applied to 13 household products, including refrigerators.

Since then, the federal government has created standards for additional products and tightened existing ones. Those changes have progressively made home appliances and business and industrial equipment more efficient, saving consumers billions of dollars, decreasing air pollution from power plants and reducing carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to climate change.

Broad application

Federal data indicates that 40% of total U.S. energy consumption – and 28% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions – is attributable to household and industrial appliances, such as heating and cooling systems, refrigerators, lighting and various kinds of equipment, such as computers, printers and electric motors.

At present, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Appliance and Equipment Standards Program covers more than 70 products that the government estimates consume about 90% of energy used in homes, 70% of energy in commercial buildings and 30% of energy used in industry. The government estimates the standards saved American consumers $105 billion just in 2024 – with a typical household saving about $576 over the expenses if there were no efficiency standards.

Appliance energy efficiency standards now in place are cumulatively expected by the Department of Energy to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 2 billion metric tons over 30 years. That’s as much carbon dioxide as 15 million gas-powered cars would emit in that same period.

Many federal standards, including on light bulbs, electric motors and commercial heating and cooling equipment, have been based on those previously adopted by one or more states. Federal law permits states to issue standards for products that the federal government has not yet regulated: As of 2024, 18 states had set efficiency rules for a total of 22 types of appliances, including computers and televisions.

Additional benefits

These appliance standards have reduced American energy use, including electricity. The existing national standards are projected to reduce overall national energy consumption by 10% between 2025 and 2035.

Those standards also improve public health, because there is less need to build new fossil-fuel power plants or operate existing ones. As a result, power generators have been able to reduce their emissions of dangerous pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury.

A popular policy

Making appliances more energy efficient has proved popular. A national survey released by the Consumer Federation of America in 2018 found that 71% of Americans “support the idea that the government should set and update energy efficiency standards for appliances.” Significantly, 72% of those surveyed named lowering electrical bills and 57% stated that avoiding construction of new power plants to keep electricity rates from rising were important reasons to increase appliance efficiency.

Support remains strong: A June 2024 YouGov poll found that 60% of Americans support tougher appliance efficiency standards.

From 1987 through 2007, more than three-quarters of national appliance energy efficiency standards were passed into law by Congress, with the rest created by administrative processes under existing laws. These legal standards received bipartisan support and were signed into law by Republican Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush.

But more recently, partisanship has affected the setting of standards. Since 2008, whether standards improve or remain unchanged has depended on whether Democrats or Republicans occupied the White House.

Political back-and-forth

The Obama administration enacted among the most ambitious energy efficiency standards for appliances and equipment to date. New standards for commercial air conditioners and furnaces affected heating and cooling equipment for half of the square footage used by the nation’s businesses. The rules were projected to reduce energy costs to businesses by $167 billion over the life of the regulated products.

But during the first Trump administration, improvements in existing standards came to a halt.

When Joe Biden became president, his administration resumed issuing new standards, most notably phasing out incandescent light bulbs. The Biden administration also issued new standards for furnaces, residential water heaters, stoves, washing machines and refrigerators.

Controversy continues

A new Biden rule for electric motors, which are widely used in manufacturing and processing equipment, incorporated recommendations from businesses and advocacy organizations. The rule was slated to take effect in 2028 and was expected to save businesses and consumers up to $8.8 billion over a 30-year period.

But the Trump administration has withdrawn this standard, along with others issued by the Biden administration, including for ceiling fans, dehumidifers and external power supplies. The administration has postponed the effective dates of other standards that had been finalized before Trump took office. The administration said the reversals would “slash unnecessary red tape and regulations that raise prices, reduce consumer choice, and frustrate the American people.”

Another set of politically controversial standards Biden introduced sought to encourage consumers to switch from stoves, furnaces and water heaters that use natural gas or propane to electric ones. The electric versions of those appliances are more energy efficient, while gas cooking emits toxic chemicals into the home. Switching can be expensive, and many consumers prefer gas-powered appliances, as of course does the natural gas industry, which has opposed these federal efforts.

And in early April 2025, Republicans in Congress used their legislative authority to overturn the regulations for natural gas water heaters.

The electric truck startup Nikola recently went bankrupt, and its factory was auctioned off to the electric car manufacturer Lucid.
There are similar challenges in Europe, where the electric truck startups Volta Trucks, Tevva and Quantron recently went bankrupt.","This decision was made after it became known that Bollinger Motors was no longer able to fulfil its financial obligations. Employees were no longer receiving their salaries, rents remained unpaid, and suppliers were also waiting in vain for outstanding payments.

Bollinger Motors, based in Oak Park, Michigan, near the automotive metropolis of Detroit, was once a beacon of hope in the emerging market for electric commercial vehicles in the USA. Founded with the aim of building robust, emission-free vehicles for commercial customers, the company had developed the all-electric B1 and B2 models (SUV and pickup) as well as the B4, an electric truck with a gross vehicle weight rating of up to 7.2 tonnes. As early as 2022, the company decided to focus solely on commercial vehicles and thus on the B4.

Production was halted in January 2025 when the company was no longer allowed to use its production facility at Roush Enterprises, due to unpaid invoices totalling USD 1.8 million. The financial situation had already been deteriorating for months. Founder Robert Bollinger, who sold the majority of his shares in Mullen Automotive, filed a lawsuit after a loan of 10 million US dollars was not repaid. Bollinger accused the current management, especially Mullen, of leading the company into crisis. The lawsuit reveals that Bollinger Motors has had no clear strategic leadership since the takeover and that promises have not been kept.

Problems with marketing and sales

The product situation also paints a sobering picture: although around USD 5 million worth of vehicles are in stock, there is a lack of sales and marketing. Moreover, production can only be resumed if outstanding invoices are paid and new investors are found, as reported by Detroit News. Current attempts to do business with potential customers or strategic partners have not yet yielded any results.

Despite the dramatic situation, some of those in charge at the company are still fighting back. They emphasise that Bollinger Motors remains committed to its vehicles and hopes to return to production soon. The receivership procedure is intended to help stabilise the company, pay off creditors and possibly attract new investors. A final decision on the future of Bollinger Motors is likely to be made in the coming weeks.

The EPA said it’s part of $267 million awarded nationwide to transform polluted sites into housing and business developments to promote economic growth. The move comes as the agency has halted funds for environmental justice and climate work and reorganizes as part of cost-cutting measures by the Trump administration.

“EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.”

The Trump administration has sought to rein in more than two dozen environmental regulations in favor of oil and gas projects, saying it lowers costs for Americans and businesses.

EPA Regional Administrator Anne Vogel said the grants will protect public health and the environment “while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.”

The money will go to nine local, state and tribal entities. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Milwaukee Redevelopment Authority and city of West Allis will receive between $650,000 and $3 million in supplemental money for revolving loan funds to finance redevelopment projects.

In Milwaukee, the city’s redevelopment authority will use $650,000 to fund cleanups at the Compass Lofts, the Tempo Hotel and the Historic Patterson Place. The agency will also receive $500,000 for cleaning up a site that’s being leased by the nonprofit Jewish Community Center for a food pantry. The money will be used to clean up the site and a 50,000-square-foot warehouse that’s contaminated with volatile organic compounds.

Six other communities and the Oneida Nation will receive anywhere from $500,000 to $2 million to conduct environmental assessments or cleanups. They include the cities of Kenosha, Racine and Brillion.

Shell Starship 3.0 will be the official transport vehicle for the Pennzoil Tech Inspection Trailer for the remainder of the 2025 NTT INDYCAR SERIES season, beginning with the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix on June 1.

“Integrating Shell Starship into INDYCAR’s operations is an exciting next step in demonstrating how cutting-edge technologies can support real-world logistics while helping reduce carbon emissions,” said Thomas Mueller, general manager of Commercial Road Transport at Shell. “This is innovation in motion, and we look forward to seeing how the Starship performs in a practical application in demanding environments.”

Shell Starship

Shell Starship, powered by a Cummins X15NTM natural gas engine and lubricated with Shell Rotella natural gas engine oil, is the first natural gas-powered Class 8 truck to operate within a national racing series fleet in North America, according to a company press release.

“The trucking industry is undergoing a remarkable transformation as we decarbonize freight movement across North America, driven by sustainability goals, regulatory demands and the pursuit of lower total cost of ownership,” said Mike Roeth, executive director of the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE). “Shell Starship plays a key role as part of this journey by demonstrating what’s possible through improved freight-ton efficiency and the use of renewable natural gas.”

The truck demonstrates the potential of today’s efficient technologies, such as a lightweight aerodynamic carbon fiber body, a camera-based system that reduces drag compared to traditional mirrors and a lightweight chassis, to help lower emissions in the commercial road sector, according to the release.

Demonstration Run

In a demonstration run, the Shell Starship 3.0 truck fully loaded and powered by Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) achieved a fuel economy of approximately 9 miles per gallon (MPG) Diesel Gallon Equivalent (DGE) and a range of approximately 890 miles.

Compared to the U.S. average for diesel class 8 trucks, the Shell Starship 3.0 equipped with the Cummins X15N natural gas engine and powered by Renewable Natural Gas was able to transport three times more freight per kilogram of CO₂ emitted, according to the release.

The Class 8 truck is now part of INDYCAR’s transportation system, hauling the Pennzoil Tech Inspection Trailer, which carries the specialized equipment used to inspect the cars of all INDYCAR teams during race weekends.

“INDYCAR is proud to collaborate with Shell to combine our collective passion for innovation, sustainability and competition,” said J. Douglas Boles, president of INDYCAR and Indianapolis Motor Speedway. “Using the Shell Starship truck in our logistics fleet not only helps us reduce emissions but also showcases what’s possible when high-performance meets real-world sustainability.”

Shell and INDYCAR

“Shell’s relationship with the series has grown steadily in recent years, including becoming the Official Fuel of the NTT INDYCAR SERIES in 2023 with the introduction of Shell’s 100% renewable race fuel,” the release said. “The addition of Shell Starship to INDYCAR’s logistics fleet continues that momentum, providing a visible and tangible demonstration of Shell’s commitment to energy-efficient innovation in racing and transport.”

The January Executive Order declaring an “Energy Emergency” fails to make a credible case that such an emergency exists.
If this were a true energy emergency, the federal government would deploy all available energy resources to respond.
Supplemental infrastructure, like the transmission lines needed to carry electricity from hydropower or geothermal resources on public lands, is essential.
The importance of our public lands is reflected not only in NEPA processes, but also in other federal statutes enacted by Congress that govern the management of public lands resources.","Last month, the Department of the Interior (DOI) announced it would circumvent key environmental review and public participation processes to allow energy resource development and critical mineral mining on U.S. public lands. Interior argues this unprecedented decision, which overrides longstanding safeguards designed to protect public health and the environment, is necessary to respond to the President’s unjustified declaration of an “energy emergency.”

But rolling back environmental review processes under the false pretense of an “emergency” will not only sacrifice our long-term public health and environmental protections; it will also increase confusion and litigation risk for project developers and allow resources posing the greatest harms to receive the least scrutiny. Here are four issues with the order.

1. The “energy emergency” is unsubstantiated and the response overlooks potential for renewable energy of public lands.

The January Executive Order declaring an “Energy Emergency” fails to make a credible case that such an emergency exists. Interior’s own regulations require an imminent threat to life, property, or important cultural and historic resources to justify emergency action – yet no such threat has been identified. In fact, the United States is currently a net energy exporter.

If this were a true energy emergency, the federal government would deploy all available energy resources to respond. Instead, Interior has identified a narrow list of approved technologies, notably omitting solar and wind — two technologies that are modular and scalable with great potential on public land managed by the Department.

Interior has already permitted more than its Congressionally authorized goal of 25 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy projects well ahead of the 2025 deadline, and the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Western Solar Plan identified 31 million acres of public lands across the West as suitable for utility-scale projects. CATF research shows there is approximately 2,100 GW in technical potential for solar, wind, and conventional geothermal energy generation on BLM land alone, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates 1,500 GW of offshore wind technical potential in federally managed waters. While not all of this potential can or should be developed, it represents triple the total installed generating capacity in the United States today.

Excluding solar and wind energy from the emergency permitting processes—combined with the active hamstringing of wind energy permitting and the targeting of offshore wind projects already under construction and nearly ready to generate electricity— does not align with a response to a true energy “emergency.” It also overlooks the fastest path to expanding generating capacity and grid reliability.

2. For energy resource development and mining activities that “qualify” under new policies, inadequate review timelines effectively eliminate a key venue for public and Tribal input.

As CATF has previously written, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and other federal laws require public transparency and public participation in the review process, and provide some of the only formal venues for community input on impactful infrastructure. The new timelines proposed by Interior for specific technologies and mining activities are unreasonable and fail to preserve meaningful opportunities for public transparency and engagement.

For projects likely to have significant environmental impacts requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) under NEPA, the Department now “anticipates that most comment periods will be approximately ten days” of the 28 days total allocated to the preparation of the EIS. This guidance severely limits the potential to reduce overall project timelines. CATF research shows that collaboration among communities and developers in identifying and evaluating alternative routes leads to project routing decisions that are more acceptable to all stakeholders, minimizing opposition and accelerating project construction. But such collaboration is impossible under the new timelines established by DOI. The compressed review schedules leave insufficient time to meaningfully consider public comments, especially as the Department cuts significant staff.

Interior is the primary federal agency responsible for fulfilling the U.S. government’s trust responsibility to Tribes, managing 55 million surface acres and 57 million acres in subsurface estates, charged with supporting tribal self-determination and working with tribal governments to promote the health and development of native communities and the ecosystems they rely on.

DOI’s new guidance also provides that under the NHPA, impacted Tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations will have only seven days to comment on energy projects proposed on culturally significant lands. As required by emergency procedures in regulations, this shortened comment period should only have applied within 30 days of the purported “emergency” declaration, unless a formal extension was requested. Nevertheless, Interior’s guidance as it stands today gives sovereign governments only one week to evaluate and provide formal comment on the impacts of private — potentially polluting — infrastructure on culturally important lands, waters, and sites. Immediate impacts are hard enough to assess in that short of a timeframe, let alone the compounding, longer-term effects of pollutants and heavy metals in the air and water on the well-being of culturally important animals and landscapes.

In a recent report on offshore wind, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that (1) a critical area of improvement for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) in offshore wind deployment is more meaningful consultation with Tribes and more consistent efforts to consider or address Tribal concerns and (2) that Tribal capacity to “adequately review documents or meaningfully consult with government officials” is lacking. DOI’s expedited timelines for select resources is inconsistent with GAO’s recommendations and represents a major step backward in fostering collaboration and trust with Tribes, ignoring and worsening the very challenges the Administration has identified.

3. Hasty reviews significantly increase industry risk and uncertainty, offsetting potential benefits to private developers.

Policy and process certainty is incredibly important to infrastructure developers. While circumventing key environmental reviews on public lands might seem like a boon to the private sector, Interior’s changes to permitting and review regimes are rapid and inconsistent, subjecting developers to greater litigation risk and poor interagency processes that will ultimately delay projects.

CATF previously noted that the White House Council on Environmental Quality’s (CEQ’s) recent dismantling of rules dictating federal agency compliance with NEPA will only cause confusion in the environmental review process, adding delays and ambiguity into a process that would benefit from more interagency cooperation and collaboration. Interior’s “alternative” interpretation of NEPA provides a case study of the destabilizing effect of this dismantling.

Interior is often not the only agency involved in environmental reviews. Depending on a project’s location, the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Defense are frequently supporting agencies. Project developers must meet the requirements of all agencies — not just the lead. Where BLM or another Interior agency is the lead agency on an EIS review, Interior acknowledges that other agencies are not required to comply with the same 28-day timeline. Staffing cuts across all agencies are making extremely short timelines even more difficult to meet.

The lack of clarity around what technologies are covered under the emergency guidelines creates additional burdens on developers. Energy developers think at the systems level – no matter the source of generated electricity, they must consider how that power will be delivered to and integrated into the market. Supplemental infrastructure, like the transmission lines needed to carry electricity from hydropower or geothermal resources on public lands, is essential. But the text of the emergency permitting procedures is unclear on whether transmission would be covered under the new guidelines. Even if transmission projects qualify under Interior’s emergency permitting procedure, it remains unclear whether developers can obtain the permits required from other federal agencies, Tribes, or state authorities to connect them to the grid in a timely manner.

Additionally, while developers hoping to take advantage of emergency permitting timelines may obtain permits more quickly from the Interior Department than they would have otherwise, the shortened timelines for engagement from Tribes, impacted communities, and the public — as well as the questionable legal basis for declaring an “energy emergency” — increase the likelihood of litigation, potentially delaying projects rather than accelerating them.

The Department of Interior’s mandate is to manage and conserve most federal lands and natural resource. The federal environmental review processes in critical to that mandate, as it ensures that our precious natural resources are properly stewarded, particularly for development activity on lands preserved for future generations, either as parks, monuments, federally managed forests and rangelands

Federally owned and managed parks, monuments, forests, rangelands, and wetlands are some of our most precious shared resources. They give Americans of all income levels, and visitors from around the world, the opportunity to appreciate nature’s splendor, study and learn about wildlife and environmental stewardship, and take part in recreational activities. They provide habitat for many ecologically important species and include working lands that support forestry and agricultural sectors. These lands offer economic opportunities for neighboring communities, and they are the ancestral homelands of many Tribes.

The importance of our public lands is reflected not only in NEPA processes, but also in other federal statutes enacted by Congress that govern the management of public lands resources. For example, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) states that public lands must be managed “ in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archeological values; that where appropriate will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition; that will provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife and domestic animals; and that will provide for outdoor recreation and human occupancy and use.”

A bad solution for an invented emergency

CATF recognizes the urgent need to build more infrastructure to achieve a high-energy, low-cost, reliable, secure, and decarbonized energy system. However, the Interior’s proposal to fast-track the development of energy projects and mining under the guise of an “energy emergency” opens the door to potentially harmful development, undercutting decades of bipartisan efforts by Congress, Tribal Nations, conservationists, outdoor recreation groups, and past administrations to protect our shared natural and cultural heritage.

Rushed and unnecessary development on public lands could cause lasting environmental, economic, cultural, and social harm — damage that may be impossible reverse.

CATF will continue to investigate and advocate for streamlined review and permitting processes that maintain environmental and community safeguards, protect our valuable public lands, and achieve better project outcomes for developers and communities alike.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/17121216/LandSystem_SocialFeature_1.jpeg,N,,2025-05-16 17:08:45.443079

These changes are designed to reduce hazardous air pollutants and enhance public health protections, particularly in communities adjacent to industrial facilities.

With compliance deadlines approaching, it’s imperative for affected facilities to understand the new requirements and implement necessary measures. EDGE is committed to assisting clients in navigating these regulatory changes effectively. In addition to EDGE employees who have extensive experience with emissions measurement projects going back many years, EDGE has a strong working partnership with one of the world’s preeminent air emissions measurement experts.

Key Regulatory Changes

The updated HON regulations introduce several critical requirements and deadlines for existing sources:

Fenceline Monitoring Start Date: Begin continuous monitoring for six key air toxics including ethylene oxide, benzene, and 1,3-butadiene, by July 15, 2026. One of two methods accepted: EPA Method 325 A/B (14-day passive diffusion) or Method 327 (24-hour canister sampling) is required based on which hazardous air pollutants are used, produced, or stored on-site.

Monitoring Plan Submission: Submit a fenceline monitoring plan within 180 days of the effective date.

Corrective Action Deadline: Implement required corrective actions for any monitoring exceedances by July 2027.

Ethylene Oxide Standards: Existing facilities must comply with new ethylene oxide control requirements by July 2026.

Additional Compliance Requirements include (Effective July 2027):

Enhancements to source-focused regulations such as heat exchange systems, process vents, tanks, transfer operations, wastewater systems, and fugitive emissions. In some cases, compliance with the modified regulations may require a physical modification to the facility such as:

Sites using flares for control may require additional monitoring infrastructure

Reclassification of Group 1 and Group 2 tanks and vents may prompt revaluation and further controls

Updates to floating roof tank standards may necessitate structural modifications

Cooling tower sampling must now follow the Modified El Paso method with designated port locations

Public Data Disclosure: Fenceline monitoring data will be made publicly available, and exceedances will trigger mandated investigation and remediation.

Anticipated Environmental and Health Benefits

According to the EPA, the HON amendments are expected to reduce hazardous air pollutants by more than 6,200 tons annually. While previous regulations addressed benzene emissions, this latest rulemaking introduces more stringent and targeted controls for ethylene oxide (EO), the pollutant at the center of many of the most substantial modifications. These changes reflect a stronger regulatory push to mitigate EO-related risks in fenceline communities. The rule also includes a projected 58% reduction in benzene emissions from tanks and equipment leaks. Together, these updates are expected to significantly improve public health outcomes and contribute to better air quality in surrounding communities.

The data show that:

Gasoline prices would increase 25 cents to 37 cents per gallon by 2035 as demand for oil increases due to the termination of federal electric vehicle affordability programs, fuel economy standards, and tailpipe emission standards.

Americans would pay the oil and gas industry an additional $339 billion for gasoline and $75 billion for electricity by 2035.

Repealing the financial support for buying new, used, or leased electric vehicles would keep between 22 million and 40 million more gasoline-powered cars and trucks on the road through 2035, as roughly one-third of families who would have tried to switch to an electric vehicle can no longer afford one.

“The House Republican tax plan to terminate federal clean energy investment would leave households buying so much more gasoline that it will push prices up,” said Trevor Higgins, senior vice president for Energy and Environment at CAP and author of the analysis. “It’s an indirect tax on energy, and it could raise gas prices up to 37 cents per gallon. This effort to cut off clean energy is a windfall for the oil and gas industry, and it comes at the expense of American families.”

This new analysis is based on modeling conducted by the energy systems analysts at Rhodium Group based on current proposals to repeal, end, or otherwise stymy clean energy investments and programs. All told, these policy choices are projected to cost the average household $2,400 in unnecessary gasoline expenditures over the next 10 years.

So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

“We will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin. “This will support water systems across the country, including small systems in rural communities, as they work to address these contaminants. EPA will also continue to use its regulatory and enforcement tools to hold polluters accountable.”

Under the previous rule, water systems were required to test for PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA within three years and notify the public of PFAS levels. If levels were higher than the standard, they were required to install PFAS treatment systems by 2029.

The new proposal allows public drinking water systems more time to come up with plans to address PFOA and PFOS, extending the date to comply with those rules to 2031. It would also rescind the regulations and reconsider the standards for PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA. EPA is planning to issue a proposed rule on these chemicals in the fall of 2025 and finalize it by the spring of 2026.

“We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water,” said Administrator Zeldin.

PFAS has been linked to serious health risks including cancer, liver damage, immune system dysfunction, and developmental issues in children. In response to growing concerns about contamination in the state’s rivers, lawmakers in both chambers of North Carolina’s General Assembly have been grappling with how best to address the issue.

Communities of color are still paying the price.,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/redlining-shaped-power-grid-communities-color-are-still-paying-price,"Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills.
These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities.
Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country.
California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.
“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.","As an ice storm slicked roads across eastern Michigan on Feb. 6, representatives from four houses of worship arrived at the offices of Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored. The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

Energy inequality across America

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see. Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods. “I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.

Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

Solar helps cool city

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate income households.

“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.

“Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to rule quickly on dozens of small U.S. refineries' pending applications for exemptions from biofuel-blending requirements, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told lawmakers on Thursday.

There are 161 applications for exemptions from the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard pending after the Biden administration refrained from acting on them. The EPA's decision will have significant implications for the multi-billion-dollar credit market that underpins the biofuel program.

""None of these were getting approved at all in the last administration,"" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in a congressional hearing. ""We want to get caught up as quickly as we can.""

The Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation's fuel supply or buy renewable fuel credits, known as RINs, from those who do. But small refiners can petition the EPA to receive an exemption if they can show financial hardship.

In the first Trump administration, the EPA significantly increased the number of exemptions approved, driving down the price of the renewable fuel credits and angering the Farm Belt, which said the exemptions hurt a program that drove investment in the Midwest.

The Biden administration was critical of the exemptions and essentially let the applications linger without any decisions, resulting in the buildup.

Zeldin's comments came as the EPA sent a proposed rule to the White House for review on the amount of biofuels oil refiners must blend into their fuel beginning in 2026.

It will be one of the first opportunities for the Republican president to show his stance on biofuels policy, which historically has pitted Big Oil and the Farm Belt against each other.

That dynamic shifted recently as a coalition of oil and biofuel groups recommended the EPA, which administers the volumes, propose federal mandates for biomass-based diesel blending for 2026 at 5.25 billion gallons, Reuters previously reported.

That would be a significant increase.

Soybean oil futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell over 5% on Thursday on rumors the EPA's proposed rule would set biomass-based diesel blending for 2026 at 4.65 billion gallons. Reuters could not confirm that figure.

The EPA was expected to propose a biofuels rule that covers both 2026 and 2027, Reuters previously reported.

The EPA's previous rulemaking on renewable biofuels volume obligations finalized total federal volumes at 20.94 billion gallons in 2023, 21.54 billion gallons in 2024 and 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.

NEW YORK - Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that 10 recipients across New York have been selected to receive more than $8 Million in Brownfields Grants to assess, clean up, and revitalize local lands. These investments support locally driven redevelopment, unlocking economic opportunity, creating jobs, and improving public health outcomes in communities in New York. In addition, EPA will provide $3.75 Million in new and supplemental funding to three successful Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) programs that support Brownfields work on an ongoing basis in New York. These grants put the agency’s commitment to protect human health and the environment into action while remaining good stewards of tax dollars and advancing policies to energize the economy.

""The brownfield grants are essential for New York, allowing us to transform neglected sites into thriving community assets that instill pride and drive economic growth,” said EPA Regional Administrator Michael Martucci. “By investing in these revitalization efforts, we not only protect our environment but also create job opportunities and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers.""

“Over $5M in Brownfield grants across NY-22 will help revitalize and improve public health in key areas in Cortland County, Syracuse, and the Mohawk Valley,” said U.S. Representative John W. Mannion (NY-22). “I’ll continue to work with the EPA to deliver targeted investments in our communities, and I look forward to seeing these projects drive meaningful and lasting change.""

“I am thrilled that the EPA has selected Chautauqua County as a recipient of the Brownfield grant,” said U.S Representative Nicholas Langworthy (NY-23). “This is a fantastic opportunity for Dunkirk and Jamestown to clean up, redevelop, and revitalize local lands. This investment is crucial to unlocking economic opportunities and improving these communities.”

""The City of Rensselaer is grateful to the US EPA for providing us with this assistance. The reuse strategy for priority sites in the city supports the efforts of the “Rensselaer Rising” initiative which are to create a livable, vibrant, and sustainable urban environment. This initiative will provide new opportunities for residential, commercial, and recreational spaces by remediating brownfield sites, particularly in our downtown and waterfront areas,"" said Michael Stammel, Mayor of Rensselaer.

EPA has made these selections based on a competitive process. Selectees in New York are:

The Adirondack Economic Development Corporation in NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess and plan for the cleanup of various polluted sites in the Villages of Massena and Malone. Key sites targeted for assessment include an old vacant building, two former creameries, and a former coal storage facility.

The City of Binghamton, NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess and prioritize polluted sites in the North Chenango River Corridor and the First Ward Neighborhood. This includes engaging with the community. Key sites targeted for assessment include a vacant former wire manufacturing site, a former gasoline station, a parcel with dilapidated multi-family homes, and an unsecured site with a former industrial building and residences.

The Cortland County Industrial Development Agency in NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess 18 sites, develop cleanup plans and engage the community in the City of Cortland and the Village of Homer. Key sites targeted for assessment include a former metal manufacturing facility, an old armory, a vacant paint company in Cortland, and a textile plant, industrial site, and two fuel stations in Homer.

The County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency in NY has been selected to receive $500,000. This funding will be used to conduct assess 21 sites, develop cleanup and reuse plans and engage the community in the Cities of Dunkirk and Jamestown. Key sites targeted for assessment include a vacant waterfront block, a former auto dealer and repair shop, a large vacant manufacturing facility, and a former dry cleaner in Dunkirk, along with a former landfill and several vacant manufacturing properties in Jamestown.

Additionally, Chautauqua was selected to receive $1 million for their existing Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding supports a successful RLF program that has already facilitated cleanup projects. Highlighted projects for this funding include the Homesteads at Dunkirk Landing, the Westfield Welch Building Redevelopment, and the Dunkirk Waterfront Block.

The City of Glens Falls, NY has been selected to receive $500,000. The grant will be used to assess 25 sites and prioritize polluted sites along the city’s East-West End Textile Trail. This includes developing three cleanup plans and supporting community engagement efforts.

It will also support the development of four cleanup plans and community engagement efforts. RLF activities will focus on the Towns of Caledonia and Livonia, as well as the Villages of Dansville and Geneseo.

The Mohawk Valley Economic Development Growth Enterprises Corporation (Mohawk Valley EDGE) in NY has been selected to receive $1,000,000 for its existing Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding is being provided because the RLF program has performed well but has significantly depleted funds. The RLF program has successfully facilitated loans or subgrants for four cleanup projects that are either completed or in progress. One highlighted project for the use of the new funding includes the St. Luke's Hospital site.

The City of New York has been selected to receive $750,000 for its existing Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) program. This funding comes on top of the $3,700,000 previously awarded by EPA and is provided because the RLF program has performed well but has significantly depleted funds.

The RLF program has successfully facilitated loans or subgrants for 18 cleanup projects that are either completed or in progress. Notable projects for the use of the new funding include sites at 103 West 108th Street in Manhattan, 819 Grand Street in Brooklyn, and 2828 West 28th Street on Coney Island.

The Montgomery Street site is a 0.2-acre parcel with a deteriorating 5,430-square-foot building and has been used for various purposes, including as a residence, bus service facility, and auto-related services. The Seymour Street site is a 1.7-acre parcel with a vacant 39,000-square-foot former manufacturing building, a former powerhouse, and a wooden shed. It has been unused since 2021 and was previously a metal and ball bearing manufacturing site.

Brownfields grants are a powerful catalyst for local economic growth. Communities in New York have used previous EPA grants to assess, cleanup, and attract new development. Nationally, Brownfields funding delivers proven results:

13.9 jobs per $100,000 of EPA Brownfield Grant funds spent

$20.45 for each $1 of EPA Brownfields funding expended on assessment, cleanup, and revolving loan fund grants.

Property values near cleaned-up sites increase by 5-15.2% with an estimated gain of $500,000 to $1.5 million in total property values

Increase of $29-97 million in local tax revenue in just the first-year post-cleanup, per a study done in 2017.

The widely popular Child Tax Credit would be expanded, along with an increase in the standard deduction. Additionally, lawmakers have introduced new temporary tax breaks requested by Trump for overtime pay, car loan interest, and tips. However, due to procedural rules in the Senate, lawmakers were unable to fulfill Trump’s promise to exempt Social Security from taxation. Instead, they would provide seniors with an additional $4,000 deduction. It is uncertain how lawmakers will address the ongoing dispute regarding the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions. The proposed legislation aims to increase this cap to $30,000 and introduce a new income limit of $400,000, but it remains unclear if this proposal will gain support from blue-state Republicans who are focused on the issue.

Additionally, this plan phases out the EV tax credit. If a manufacturer has sold 200,000 or more EVs since 2009, it will lose the credit at the end of the year. If it has sold less than 200,000, it will keep the credit until Dec. 31, 2026.

The bill’s current version targets a total of $4 trillion in tax cuts and $1.5 trillion in spending reductions. Although the House initially hoped for up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, it abandoned efforts to reach an agreement on the $2 trillion in spending cuts that would have been necessary to meet its budget.

The Chamber has long supported the TCJA and applauds the House for its efforts to preserve these pro-growth financial policies. Read more about the importance of the TCJA.

The Chamber is also watching the education initiative in the bill known as the “Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan.” The plan introduces significant changes to the Pell Grant program, addressing funding shortfalls and modifying eligibility criteria for the award. Additionally, the plan imposes stricter limits on the amount of federal student loans borrowers can obtain. It also repeals regulations concerning gainful employment and borrower defense.

A key component of the plan is a risk-sharing provision, which would hold schools accountable for a portion of unpaid student loan balances. Many of the provisions in this plan originate from Republicans’ primary higher education legislation from last session, the College Cost Reduction Act.

A top priority in education for the Chamber is ensuring students have access to affordable continuing education options and the necessary tools to finish much-needed certifications and degrees. The proposed changes to Pell grants, TRIO, and other resources will hinder that success and make it harder for Michigan to get to 60% of Michiganders with a certificate or degree by 2030.

The proposal for health care savings targets Medicaid dollars, specifically implementing a work requirement for many Medicaid recipients. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this policy change could result in over 8.6 million people losing healthcare coverage.

One of the largest potential sources of savings in health care will come from a policy curbing states’ ability to levy taxes on providers. This could force states to make major changes since the taxes can pay for a state’s share of Medicaid costs. The legislation would freeze state provider taxes at their current rates and prohibit them from establishing any new taxes. Every state except Alaska relies on a provider tax of some form. The total savings from all changes are expected to be approximately $800 billion.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/US-Capitol_featured_2.jpg,N,,2025-05-17 03:59:17.058303

The initial endangerment finding was made under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which governs motor vehicles.
Section 231, governing aircraft, has identical endangerment language to Section 202.
One in particular is that it would require the agency to reverse course on what constitutes a ""significant"" contribution of greenhouse gases.
We should soon see whether the EPA is going to adopt this more targeted approach to cutting back EPA regulation of greenhouse gases, or whether it will insist on running headlong into the maw of the original endangerment finding.","Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency will consider rescinding the so-called endangerment finding that triggers the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In a prior post, I explained why this is a fool's errand, and elaborated on some of the relevant points in this webinar.

My prior comments assumed that the agency was planning to do what Zeldin and others had publicly suggested: Rescind the primary finding that the emission of greenhouse gases ""cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare."" Given the precautionary nature of this language, taking this course would have required the Agency to disavow virtually everything it has said in the past 35 years about the potential consequences of climate change, among other things. It would be a morass.

Yet if the EPA's primary goal is to rescind greenhouse gas regulations imposed on stationary sources, and prevent the adoption of new such regulations, it has an alternative approach--an approach that is more of a targeted bank shot than a frontal assault on the endangerment determination and, judging from this E&E News story, it is a potential approach that is getting more attention.

The initial endangerment finding was made under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which governs motor vehicles. Under this provision, the EPA is obligated to adopt emission standards for pollutants about which such a finding is made. Other provisions of the Act have similar language, but they are not all the same, and the differences in the language found in different opinions could matter.

Section 231, governing aircraft, has identical endangerment language to Section 202. Section 111, governing stationary sources (including power plants), on the other hand, has slightly different language. Under 111, the EPA is required to adopt regulations for a category of sources if the category:

causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.

Here, unlike under Section 202 and 231, it is not enough that the emissions in question ""contribute"" to potentially harmful pollution. The emissions, from the source category in question, must contribute significantly. In other words, even taking endangerment as a given, there are some sources of greenhouse gas emissions that need not be regulated under Section 111 because their contributions to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is not significant enough to justify action.

What this means is that the EPA could seek to disarm the Clean Air Act's regulatory threat to stationary sources by defining what it means to contribute ""significantly"" so as to exclude most (if not all) such source categories as those that must be regulated. This is not a sure-fire strategy, as it may be difficult to argue that power plants in particular are not a ""significant"" contributor to climate change. Power plants are responsible for approximately 30 percent of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, most other source categories are far smaller, and would be easier to exclude, particularly if the EPA emphasizes that the significance of a source category's contribution to climate change must be evaluated on a global basis (and the fact that the United States produces a declining share of global greenhouse gas emissions).

The virtue of this approach for EPA is that it does not require contesting basic claims about climate science or reversing the agency's prior interpretation of that science or the meaning of Section 2020. Yet there are risks. One in particular is that it would require the agency to reverse course on what constitutes a ""significant"" contribution of greenhouse gases. Back in 2021, the Trump EPA said this applied to any source responsible for more than three percent of emissions. The EPA no longer eligible to receive Chevron deference on the meaning of this statutory language, and its change in position will reduce the amount of respect its new interpretation receives.

We should soon see whether the EPA is going to adopt this more targeted approach to cutting back EPA regulation of greenhouse gases, or whether it will insist on running headlong into the maw of the original endangerment finding. The agency's choice should reveal quite a bit about the extent to which it is prioritizing meaningful and sustainable deregulatory initiatives over blunderbuss, base-pleasing initiatives.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/the-volokh-conspiracy.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 13:13:36.899254

In April 2024, the “first-ever national, legally enforceable drinking water standard” aimed at limiting Americans’ exposure to PFAS, which are also known as “forever chemicals,"" was introduced. 

On Wednesday, the EPA disclosed new “plans to rescind and reconsider limits on four ‘forever chemicals,’” just over a year after those limits were implemented.

The EPA plans to strike specific “regulations covering PFHxS, PFNA, GenX and PFBS,” but will keep standards set in the 2024 rule for two common types of PFAS, known as PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion, which the Associated Press called ""effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected."" That said, the EPA decided to give companies until 2031 to meet the new standards, instead of the previous administration's 2029 target. 

Despite this disappointing rollback, there is hope: 190 bills were introduced in 35 states in 2025, aimed at combating PFAS contamination at the state and local level as well, so the effort to combat the problem is not limited to the federal level.

Why this matters:

The EPA’s funding decisions affect how communities across the country — especially those already burdened by pollution — can protect themselves from environmental threats. The grants at issue were meant to reduce exposure to contaminated water, heatwaves, and floods, and to boost infrastructure like heat pumps and health clinics in underserved neighborhoods. Withholding these funds could stall or reverse efforts to clean up toxic sites, upgrade water systems, and prepare for climate-driven disasters.

So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits.
The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.
“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.
Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.","On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to weaken limits on some harmful “forever chemicals” in drinking water roughly a year after the Biden administration finalized the first-ever national standards.

The Biden administration said last year the rules could reduce PFAS exposure for millions of people. It was part of a broader push by officials then to address drinking water quality by writing rules to require the removal of toxic lead pipes and, after years of activist concern, address the threat of forever chemicals.

President Donald Trump has sought fewer environmental rules and more oil and gas development. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has carried out that agenda by announcing massive regulatory rollbacks.

Now, we know the EPA plans to rescind limits for certain PFAS and lengthen deadlines for two of the most common types. Here are some of the essential things to know about PFAS chemicals and what the EPA decided to do:

Please explain what PFAS are to me

PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been around for decades and have now spread into the nation’s air, water and soil.

They were manufactured by companies such as 3M, Chemours and others because they were incredibly useful. They helped eggs slide across nonstick frying pans, ensured that firefighting foam suffocates flames and helped clothes withstand the rain and keep people dry.

The chemicals resist breaking down, however, which means they stay around in the environment.

And why are they bad for humans?

Environmental activists say that PFAS manufacturers knew about the health harms of PFAS long before they were made public. The same attributes that make the chemicals so valuable – resistance to breakdown – make them hazardous to people.

PFAS accumulates in the body, which is why the Biden administration set limits for two common types, often called PFOA and PFOS, at 4 parts per trillion that are phased out of manufacturing but still present in the environment.

There is a wide range of health harms now associated with exposure to certain PFAS. Cases of kidney disease, low-birth weight and high cholesterol in addition to certain cancers can be prevented by removing PFAS from water, according to the EPA.

The guidance on PFOA and PFOS has changed dramatically in recent years as scientific understanding has advanced. The EPA in 2016, for example, said the combined amount of the two substances should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. The Biden administration later said no amount is safe.

There is nuance in what the EPA did

The EPA plans to scrap limits on three types of PFAS, some of which are less well known. They include GenX substances commonly found in North Carolina as well as substances called PFHxS and PFNA. There is also a limit on a mixture of PFAS, which the agency is also planning to rescind.

It appears few utilities will be impacted by the withdrawal of limits for these types of PFAS. So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the Biden administration’s limits. But most utilities face problems with PFOA or PFOS.

For the two commonly found types, PFOA and PFOS, the EPA will keep the current limits in place but give utilities two more years — until 2031 — to meet them.

Announcement is met with mixed reaction

Some environmental groups argue that the EPA can’t legally weaken the regulations. The Safe Water Drinking Act gives the EPA authority to limit water contaminants, and it includes a provision meant to prevent new rules from being looser than previous ones.

“The law is very clear that the EPA can’t repeal or weaken the drinking water standard,” said Erik Olson, a senior strategist at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council.

Environmental activists have generally slammed the EPA for not keeping the Biden-era rules in place, saying it will worsen public health.

Industry had mixed reactions. The American Chemistry Council questioned the Biden administration’s underlying science that supported the tight rules and said the Trump administration had considered the concerns about cost and the underlying science.

“However, EPA’s actions only partially address this issue, and more is needed to prevent significant impacts on local communities and other unintended consequences,” the industry group said.

Leaders of two major utility industry groups, the American Water Works Association and Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, said they supported the EPA’s decision to rescind a novel approach to limit a mix of chemicals. But they also said the changes do not substantially reduce the cost of the PFAS rule.

Some utilities wanted a higher limit on PFOA and PFOS, according to Mark White, drinking water leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.

They did, however, get an extension.

“This gives water pros more time to deal with the ones we know are bad, and we are going to need more time. Some utilities are just finding out now where they stand,” said Mike McGill, president of WaterPIO, a water industry communications firm.

It’s poised to become the nation’s top power provider.

Why it matters: The U.S. plans to build 80 new gas power plants by 2030. As AI drives electricity use to as much as 12% of total U.S. demand by 2028 (up from 4.4% today), affordable and reliable energy is critical.

It’s a two-way street, as AI also boosts gas and oil efficiency through predictive maintenance, drilling optimization, and more competent logistics.

Consider:

A Goldman Sachs report predicts that natural gas will supply approximately 60% of the power needed for data centers through 2030.

The electricity demand from one AI data center can rival the demand for a small city.

As data centers are built in New Jersey and New York, electricity demand is rising.

New York benefits from substantial hydro resources; New Jersey, betting on offshore wind and solar, is coming up short.

As Interior Secretary Doug Burgum bluntly stated: “We’re never gonna build an AI data center in New York or New England if natural gas costs three times more than in Pennsylvania.”

Natural gas remains essential. NRG’s $12 billion deal to acquire 18 gas-fired plants across nine states doubles its capacity in Virginia, where natural gas powers over half the state’s electricity. A new pipeline is in the works to meet that state’s growing data center demand.

Bottom line: AI requires power, and lots of it. The only way to meet rising demand without risking blackouts or price spikes is through rapid expansion of natural gas capacity.

GRID RELIABILITY WARNING: A major grid operator is sounding the alarm over summer strain as demand spikes.

The culprit? A rush to shut down reliable fossil-fuel plants in states like Ohio and replace them with intermittent solar power in a region with limited sunshine.

Why it matters:

Ohio, once a power exporter, now faces potential shortfalls by 2027 if PJM’s grid isn’t upgraded.

Demand is soaring, driven by Artificial Intelligence, data centers, and manufacturing.

The National Weather Service forecasts a hotter-than-normal summer, further stressing the grid.

Consider: As the grid strain grows, Republicans in Congress are wavering on clean energy subsidies. The Senate is fighting to preserve parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, despite campaign promises to eliminate it.

Instead of terminating the IRA’s trillion-dollar handouts, dubbed the “Green New Scam,” its budget merely delays them, relying on easily-reversed “phaseouts” set to begin in four years.

This includes the most costly and market-distorting tax credits for wind and solar. These subsidies accelerate the shutdown of reliable power sources by pushing up consumer costs and destabilizing the grid.

Congress promised to kill the costly Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy subsidies. Instead, they’re preserving most of them under the guise of “phaseouts,” easily reversed by future political pressure.

These subsidies distort markets, drive reliable plants offline, and reward wind and solar even when they flood the grid with unwanted power—the result: hostile prices, rising costs, and a less reliable grid.

Energy expert Alex Epstein points out that the most important thing to know about a “phaseout” of subsidies is that, unlike the promised “termination” of subsidies, a “phaseout” is easily reversed by future Congresses under pressure from lobbyists.

Bottom line: The IRA’s subsidies for solar and wind are crippling grid reliability just as demand surges. Congress must fully repeal them before the grid buckles under the weight of bad policy.

Under the Biden Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revived the social cost of carbon (SCC), which quantifies the economic effects from the release of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions. Specifically, the Administration adopted three Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)—the Data-driven Spatial Climate Impact Model (DSCIM), the Greenhouse Gas Impact Value Estimator (GIVE), and the Howard and Sterner meta-analysis models—to calculate the SCC.REF Policymakers often rely on SCC estimates from these models to justify imposing strict regulations on a wide variety of everyday products, ranging from vehicles and household lamps to pool pump motors.REF Given the SCC’s role in regulatory policymaking, the robustness of these models to key assumptions should be critically evaluated.

Prior Heritage Foundation research has found that reasonable changes to many such assumptions led to significant reductions in SCC estimates, suggesting that the Biden Administration selectively applied unrealistic assumptions to inflate SCC values and justify aggressive environmental regulations. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that SCC estimates and their underlying models are unreliable and subject to manipulation and, therefore, should not be used to guide regulatory policy.

A Brief Overview of Integrated Assessment Models and the Social Cost of Carbon

IAMs estimate the SCC by modeling interactions among the economy, society, and the environment. Central to these models are “damage functions,” which translate temperature increases into projected economic losses to support cost-benefit analyses. Monte Carlo simulations incorporate uncertainty in this analysis by repeatedly running a model with randomly chosen inputs to produce a range of possible outcomes. This process generates probability distributions of SCC estimates, which are often characterized by standard point and interval estimators. Although heavily influential in public policy, IAMs are highly sensitive to assumptions and subject to significant uncertainty, raising concerns about their robustness and reliability.REF

The SCC played a central role in the Obama Administration’s climate agenda. To develop SCC estimates, the Administration formed the Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (IWG), which included agencies such as the Department of Energy and the EPA. Using three IAMs, the IWG estimated SCC values ranging from $26 to $95 per metric ton of CO2 emissions in 2050.REF

The first Trump Administration disbanded the IWG and shifted the SCC focus from global impacts to domestic climate effects. The Biden Administration later reinstated the SCC framework, introducing three new models, including DSCIM, to project economic damages from climate change.REF On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued “Unleashing American Energy,” an executive order disbanding the IWG. The order criticized the lack of robustness in SCC estimates and directed the EPA Administrator to address its deficiencies, including the potential for SCC elimination.REF

Overview of the DSCIM Model

Developed by the University of Chicago’s Climate Impact Lab, DSCIM estimates the SCC by assessing damages from CO2 emissions across five key categories: health, energy, labor productivity, agriculture, and coastal regions.REF The model consists of four components: socioeconomic and greenhouse gas emissions projections, climate system modeling, damage functions, and discounting.REF

Given the inherent uncertainty in variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity, population growth, gross domestic product (GDP) projections, and agricultural assumptions, the model employs Monte Carlo simulations over 10,000 iterations to capture a range of possible outcomes. The associated probability distribution is summarized via the arithmetic average across these simulations.

As with any model, the DSCIM relies on a set of underlying assumptions. This Backgrounder discusses a subset of these assumptions to assess the model’s sensitivity to modest changes in their specifications—namely, the specification of discount rate, time horizon, and climate sensitivity.REF

Discount Rates. The SCC depends on the concept of discounting, which is intended to account for the time value of money and ensure that future climate benefits and costs are appropriately valued in present terms. Though identifying the optimal discount rate remains uncertain, selecting an appropriate rate is essential to engage in proper cost-benefit analysis.

Following the logic of greenhouse gas policy, cutting CO2 emissions is an investment in environmental capital. The theory is that cutting CO2 emissions today improves the environment and its flow of services in the future. There are unlimited choices for investment—in environmental capital, human capital, or physical capital—that could provide for improved flow of services in the future, but the resources for making those investments are limited. Therefore, the limited resources should be allocated to those investments that provide the greatest improvement.

Investments in environmental capital, such as reducing CO2 emissions, should be pursued only if they yield a rate of return at least comparable to the best available alternative investments. Discounting—the process of calculating the present value of future benefits—provides the framework for making this comparison. By reversing the process of compounding, discounting enables a consistent evaluation of the future benefits of CO2 reduction relative to other investment opportunities.

Selecting an appropriate discount rate is essential for making efficient investment decisions. Using too low a discount rate risks harming future generations by diverting resources away from alternative investments that could deliver greater overall benefits.

Though it is impossible to know what would be the highest return that could be reasonably generated by alternative investment, the real rate of return on the New York Stock Exchange has been 7 percent over the past two centuries. That this is a very broad sampling across both investment areas and time spans argues strongly for its use.REF Some may lean toward a 3 percent discount rate, which is closer to the rate of return of the bond market.REF

From 2003 to 2023, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed agencies to apply both 3 percent and 7 percent discount rates in cost-benefit analyses, with flexibility to consider additional rates as appropriate.REF In 2023, the Biden Administration revised this policy, establishing a central discount rate of 2 percent and encouraging declining discount rates to account for long-term uncertainty, particularly in the context of climate impacts.REF To support this shift, the OMB incorporated a discounting methodology known as Ramsey discounting as the preferred method for modeling uncertainty over extended time frames.REF The Biden Administration’s EPA estimated the SCC under 1.5 percent, 2 percent, and 2.5 percent Ramsey discount rates. The mean and median SCC under these rates are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Chart 1 provides an overall visual representation of the SCC in 2030.As Chart 1 shows, for 2030, the mean estimates of the SCC are $387, $233, and $140, with standard deviations of $553, $329, and $201 under 1.5 percent, 2 percent, and 2.5 percent discount rates, respectively. The 95th percentiles vary significantly, estimated for these discount rates at $1,276, $763, and $460, respectively. These findings, derived solely from the EPA’s own assumptions, underscore the significant variability inherent in SCC estimates.

As prior research published at Heritage as well as in the peer-reviewed literature has shown, the SCC can drop drastically as a result of altering the discount rate.REF It would therefore be useful to similarly alter discount rates in DSCIM and assess associated changes in the SCC. Discount rates in DSCIM, however, are tied to specific damage function coefficients. For example, estimating the SCC under a 1.5 percent Ramsey discounting involves a specific set of damage function coefficients, as do 2 percent and 2.5 percent rates.

In an effort to use DSCIM to estimate the SCC under alternative discount rates, we contacted the EPA to request the relevant codes to re-estimate the damage function coefficients. The EPA declined to provide the model codes, instead referring us to an external research group that had conducted the estimates using a high-performance computing environment. While it may be possible to obtain the codes from this group and replicate the set-up, the technical barriers and lack of direct federal access create a de facto transparency problem. These obstacles prevent meaningful independent analysis of alternative discounting assumptions and undermine the reproducibility of the SCC estimates.

Time Horizon. The SCC estimates rely on projected aggregate damages extending nearly 300 years into the future. However, making long-term forecasts of key variables such as GDP growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and technological progress centuries ahead are fraught with uncertainty. As a result, we re-estimated the model over a less unrealistic period of nearly 150 years, with results shown in Tables 3 and 4.

As Tables 5 and 6 show, as a result of altering the time horizon, the mean and median estimates are substantially reduced by 40 percent to nearly 80 percent. The largest SCC reductions occur at a 1.50 percent discount rate (69 percent to 78 percent) and in 2080 (58 percent to 78 percent). Chart 2 depicts the probabilistic distribution of the SCC for 2030 under this shortened time period.

As Chart 2 shows, under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent discount rates, the mean SCC estimates are $103, $81, and $62, with standard deviations of $112, $87, and $67, with 95th percentiles of $305, $240, and $185, respectively. As a result, beyond just the point estimators presented in Tables 3 and 4, the SCC is drastically lower under this 150-year time horizon.

Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity. Another assumption on which the SCC estimates depend is the specification of an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) distribution, which quantifies the earth’s temperature response from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 emissions. As a key determinant of global temperature projections, this concept heavily shapes the SCC. While there is a scientific consensus that rising CO2 emissions contribute to global warming, the magnitude of this effect remains uncertain.REF Given this uncertainty, ECS is not represented by a single fixed value but rather as a probability distribution involving a spectrum of possible values.

The EPA adopts a mean ECS of 3.18°C (median 2.95°C), which falls within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report estimated range of 2.0°C and 5.0°C.REF However, empirical evidence indicates that IPCC climate models consistently overpredict global warming, with observed temperatures falling below projections. These discrepancies imply that more realistic estimates of ECS likely fall toward the lower end of the IPCC’s range.REF One distribution was published by John Christy and Richard McNider in 2017, and another was published by Nic Lewis in 2022 in separate peer-reviewed journals.REF Tables 7–14 present SCC estimates under these two different distributions along with associated percentage changes.

As these tables show, altering the choice of climate sensitivity to that of the Lewis distribution elicits significant reductions in both the mean and median SCC estimates, with an average decrease of nearly 60 percent. The Christy and McNider (2017) distribution, as illustrated in Tables 11–14, also shows pronounced reductions in SCC estimates, with an average of approximately 90 percent.

Charts 3 and 4 show histograms under the alternative distributions. As Chart 3 shows, the SCC values are considerably lower under the Lewis (2022) distribution compared to the EPA specification. Namely, the mean estimates are $160, $97, and $59, with 95th percentiles of $590, $361, and $220 and standard deviations of $256, $150, and $92 under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent Ramsey discount rates, respectively.

As Chart 4 shows, as is the case with the Lewis (2022) distribution, the SCC is also substantially lower under the Christy and McNider (2017) distribution compared to the EPA’s specified climate sensitivity distribution. Namely, the mean estimates of the SCC are $28, $18, and $11, with 95th percentiles of $187, $115, and $72 and standard deviations of $98, $57, and $34 under 1.5 percent, 2.0 percent, and 2.5 percent discount rates, respectively.

Charts 3 and 4 clearly show that, in addition to the point estimates presented in Tables 7–14, the SCC is significantly lower under these alternative specifications of climate sensitivity. In the following section, we discuss a largely unexplored phenomenon—the concept and probability of a negative SCC.

Probability of a Negative SCC

CO2 plays a crucial role in photosynthesis and can contribute to environmental benefits such as higher agricultural yields and extended growing seasons, particularly under conditions of moderate warming. To its credit, DSCIM recognizes that in some scenarios, these positive effects may outweigh the projected climate damages, allowing for the possibility of a negative SCC.REF

Tables 15–18 display the probability of a negative SCC under both the EPA’s assumptions and the alternative assumptions presented in this report.Table 15 reports an average probability of a negative SCC of 0.15 under the EPA’s assumptions, and this falls slightly to 0.13 when the time horizon is truncated to 2150. This decline reflects the shorter period over which long-term climate impacts can be realized, which in turn reduces the probability of scenarios in which moderate warming results in net economic benefits. Under the Lewis (2022) and Christy and McNider (2017) ECS distributions, Tables 17 and 18 show a 0.23 and 0.39 probability of a negative SCC, respectively.

These higher probabilities for 2030 are also evidenced in Charts 1–4. Under the assumptions made by the prior Administration’s EPA, the probability of a negative SCC ranges between 0.13 and 0.15 for 2030. As Charts 3 and 4 show, these probabilities increase substantially under the Lewis (2022) and Christy and McNider (2017) ECS distributions, ranging from 0.22 to 0.40. These increased probabilities of negative SCC values reflect the modeled benefits of moderate warming under these ECS distributions.

A negative SCC, reflecting net benefits from CO2 emissions, suggests that, if anything, carbon emissions should not be taxed but rather subsidized. Of course, we do not take the position that the government should tax or subsidize greenhouse gas emissions, but the model’s negative SCC estimates under reasonable adjustments to assumptions underscore the sensitivity of these models to user manipulation. In fact, research published over the past several years has suggested that CO2 fertilization effects may be vastly understated in IAM modeling.REF

Policy Implications and Conclusions

As is the case with other IAMs, the DSCIM model intends to estimate the economic impact of climate change.REF However, also as with other IAMs, the DSCIM model is sensitive to reasonable changes in assumptions and therefore highly vulnerable to user manipulation. Consequently, policymakers—such as those in the Biden Administration—can manipulate the SCC by selecting assumptions that support their preferred outcomes, using circular logic to both produce and justify predetermined regulatory policies.

As a result, we offer the following policy recommendations:

To ensure transparency and reproducibility in regulatory analysis, federal agencies should not be able to hide behind the work of outside groups. Instead, they should maintain and publicly provide access to the full suite of models and code used to generate key policy metrics such as the SCC—including the ability to adjust core assumptions. Referring stakeholders to external research groups—particularly when replication requires high-performance computing—creates practical obstacles that limit independent scrutiny. Requiring agencies to directly host accessible and modifiable code would strengthen accountability and improve the integrity of cost-benefit analysis in environmental policymaking.

In the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order issued on January 20, 2025, President Trump instructed the EPA Administrator to evaluate the use of the SCC, including considering its elimination.REF On May 5, 2025, the Trump Administration issued this guidance, indicating that federal agencies should not consider the SCC in policymaking unless “plainly required by their governing statute.”REF

Although this guidance is indeed a step in the right direction, a future Administration could potentially reinstate the SCC framework with an executive order, as President Biden did during his term. To prevent this, Congress should enact legislation prohibiting the use of the SCC in policymaking. During the 118th Congress, Representatives Richard Hudson (R–NC) and Kevin Hern (R–OK), along with several other lawmakers, introduced a bill to do so. However, it failed to ultimately become law. Lawmakers should continue pursuing legislative measures to ensure that future Administrations, regardless of party, cannot reinstate the SCC in regulatory decision-making.REF",https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png,N,,2025-05-16 12:24:51.729165

The first is a revamp of Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) standards for certain PFAS in drinking water. The second is an update to Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) timelines for reporting PFAS use. As we previewed in our April 30 note, these actions are part of a multifaceted effort by the Trump EPA to update the agency's approach to PFAS issues, with likely more to come. This note provides a summary of the changes and how their implementation may proceed in light of certain congressional and judicial scrutiny.

PFAS in Drinking Water

On May 14, the EPA announced its intention to make changes to national drinking water standards regulating certain PFAS. In a press release, the EPA described plans to extend the compliance dates for two PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) but rescind regulations for four other substances pending further EPA consideration.

By way of background, in April 2024, the Biden EPA issued a rule to limit levels of certain PFAS compounds in drinking water. That rule established enforceable maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for six PFAS compounds: 4 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and PFOA and 10 ppt for four other compounds: PFHxS, PFNA, PFBS, and HFPO-DA (a.k.a. GenX). Compliance with the MCLs was to occur no later than 2029.

In its recent announcement, the EPA said it will extend the compliance date for PFOA and PFOS by two years to 2031. The EPA also announced that it intends to rescind regulations for the other four PFAS compounds and will reconsider how they should be addressed. EPA states that this action is ""designed to reduce the burden on drinking water systems and the cost of water bills, all while continuing to protect public health and ensure that the agency is following the law in establishing impactful regulations such as these."" The Agency plans to issue a proposed new rule for public comment in fall of 2025 and a final rule in the spring of 2026.

Reaction has been varied—drinking water utilities have been generally positive, as they will benefit from additional time to meet the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, while environmental and some health groups have raised concerns. The move drew immediate attention from Congress, where EPA Administrator Zeldin faced senators on May 14 who questioned the agency's plans to address PFAS. Zeldin defended the actions as appropriate and reaffirmed his commitment to ""fulfill all statutory obligations."" We anticipate legal challenges to the new rule, as well as continued attention from Congress in the months ahead.

TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting

On May 13, the EPA published an interim final rule to amend the data submission period for the TSCA Section 8(a)(7) PFAS reporting rule. Under that rule, manufacturers (including importers) are to electronically report information regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, disposal, exposure, and hazards for activity beginning in 2011. Reporting was originally to occur over a six-month window beginning in November 2024 but was delayed to July 2025 and is now being reset to April through October 2026. Small manufacturers have until April 2027 to file their reports. EPA states this latest adjustment is to allow for sufficient time to develop and validate the software needed to receive the required data.

Of note, the Federal Register notice states that at this time the only change to the Section 8(a)(7) rule is the data submission dates. However, the notice also states the EPA ""intends to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking in the near future that will, among other things, allow for further comment on the appropriate reporting period."" Just as importantly, the EPA indicated that more substantive changes to TSCA reporting could occur: ""the Agency may, in a future separate action, reopen other aspects of this rule for public comment in light of Executive Order 14192: Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulations (90 FR 9065, January 31, 2025).""

When Congress created TSCA 8(a)(7) in 2019 by statute, it specified that reporting was to cover actions since January 2011. Any change to the covered reporting period sought by EPA would likely need action by Congress. The Agency has signaled interest in actions to reduce the regulatory burden, particularly on small businesses, including in its April 28 press release: ""Implement section 8(a)(7) … without overburdening small businesses and article importers,"" a possible reference to a de minimis exemption or other modification to the reporting requirement.

What Happens Next?

Stakeholders should remain focused on how the EPA moves forward on PFAS matters. The Agency, as it laid out in its April 28 announcement, will continue to evaluate the suite of PFAS rules and regulations as it looks to create its own path forward. In addition to the expected drinking water rules previewed above, announcements are also expected regarding the 2024 hazardous substance designation of PFOA and PFAS under CERCLA and other measures under consideration. Congress continues to discuss PFAS matters, including how best to handle CERCLA liability for ""passive receivers,"" and will most certainly remain actively engaged with the EPA.

All of these regulatory actions, of course, are being litigated by affected parties and the Agency, even as the EPA alters the rules at issue.[1] Those actions (and perhaps new ones) are likely to continue, albeit with new underlying legal and substantive disputes. We anticipate that litigation will continue for the foreseeable future.

Others went further. Zeldin revealed that the EPA will “reconsider” the 2009 “endangerment finding,” its determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare, which underpins the agency’s regulation of carbon dioxide and other climate-warming pollutants under the Clean Air Act—a radical move that the first Trump administration considered but ultimately decided against pursuing. “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” said Zeldin.

And the Environmental Protection Agency is now committed wholly to dismantling decades of environmental protections.

Coastal Review Online

Federal and state efforts to limit the public’s exposure to “forever chemicals” through drinking water sources seemed to be gaining traction just a year ago.

In a historic move in April 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency set limits on six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, including PFOA, PFOS and HFPO-DA, most commonly referred to as GenX.

About three months after the federal drinking water rules were adopted, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources introduced proposed groundwater and surface water standards on eight PFAS.

Related: Zeldin says PFAS limits may get tougher, downplays layoffs

But, as of this week, the Trump administration says it intends to rescind and reexamine rules on four PFAS, including GenX, and extend the deadline for public water utilities to comply with rules on PFOA and PFOS by two years.

PFAS are a group of more than 14,000 chemicals used in everyday consumer products including food containers, stain-resistant carpet and water-repellant gear. These man-made chemical compounds are often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they are persistent in the environment and have been found to accumulate in people and animals. Exposure to these substances has been linked to weakened immune function, reproductive and developmental issues and increased risk of some cancers.

The EPA’s announcement Wednesday of its plans to scale back PFAS limits comes on the heels of a recent decision by members of the state-appointed commission responsible for adopting rules that protect, preserve and enhance air and water resources to again defer moving forward monitoring and minimization discharge plans for PFAS and 1,4-dioxane into the state’s surface waters.

Critics of those proposed plans argue the rules, as written, lack any real subsistence in reducing the releases of chemical compounds into the state’s waterways.

And in a new year with a new administration at the helm of the federal government, the impetus for regulation may turn up the pressure on state governments to limit discharges of “forever chemicals” into drinking water sources.

State Division of Water Resources officials were heading in that direction in July 2024 when they presented water quality standards for eight PFAS to committees of the N.C. Environmental Management Commission.

The standards would be used to limit permitted releases of PFAS into groundwater and surface waters, set health thresholds for providing alternative water supplies to residents on private wells whose drinking water exceeds contamination limits, and establish goals for cleaning contamination.

The commission’s groundwater and waste management committee agreed to recommend groundwater health standards for only three PFAS, including PFOA, PFOS and GenX. That proposal went to public comment later in the year.

The commission’s water quality committee deferred a motion to send the surface water rule package on all eight PFAS to the full commission and, since its July 2024 meeting, has also pared down its focus on PFAS to PFOA, PFOS and GenX.

Based on that committee’s vote earlier this month, the commission isn’t expected to see a proposed draft rule on PFAS or 1,4-dioxane earlier than its July meeting.

In an emailing responding to questions from Coastal Review on Thursday morning, EMC Chair JD Solomon said the commission anticipates receiving the hearing officer’s report on the proposed groundwater rules at that same meeting.

Draft rule ‘doesn’t have sufficient teeth’

The current proposed rules for surface water bear little semblance to those the Division of Water Resources presented last July.

The set of rule drafts presented to the water quality committee in March were largely written from input provided by the North Carolina Water Quality Association, a statewide organization that represents public water, sewer, and stormwater utilities.

The water quality standards included in the initial draft rules the division created last year have since been deleted. Without those standards, the state lacks ability to enforce limits on dischargers of PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, critics say.

One of those critics of the current proposed draft rules is Environmental Management Commissioner Robin Smith.

“I think that consistently there has been a concern that, in the absence of a water quality standard, even a minimization plan isn’t enforceable,” Smith told Coastal Review in a telephone interview earlier this week.

Following last week’s commission meeting, Smith raised several concerns in an email that she sent to fellow commissioners.

“My concern is that (the current draft rule) doesn’t have sufficient teeth,” she said. “If you read through the full draft, there’s just nothing there other than the minimization contents, like a table of contents for what the minimization plan would have to be. There are no standards for determining whether what a system submits in their plan is adequate or not.”

In his email, Solomon explained that the regulatory impact analysis, or RIA, which is an evaluation of the potential costs and benefits associated with a proposed regulation, did not sufficiently identify cost-benefits associated with the proposed rules.

Last September, the water quality committee voted to move forward with a proposed monitoring and minimization plan and “continue discussions with federal agencies to make sure the benefits portion of the numeric standard were realistic,” Solomon said.

“The monitoring and minimization approach is seen as a proactive measure by EPA because it addresses potential contamination before it gets into our human and natural systems communities,” he wrote. “Allowing potential contamination into our public water bodies and public sewer systems is also much more costly to clean up.”

But the proposed monitoring and minimization plan would fail to enforce consequences for industries if they increase their pollution, said Southern Environmental Law Center Attorney Hannah Nelson.

“DEQ worked really hard to put together a comprehensive set of water quality standards that would have required polluters to reduce their pollution at the source and they spent a lot of time putting those rules together,” she said. “We don’t see that same thing happening with this set of rules. Instead, the analysis supporting this rule making completely ignored impact to downstream drinking water utilities. They don’t address that because, if they did, we would see that this rule is all about protecting industry and it’s not about protecting the people of North Carolina.”

In an April 17 letter to state environmental officials, Cape Fear Public Utility Authority’s executive director admonished the revised draft rule for 1,4-dioxane.

“After months of research, our consultants determined, as a matter of law, that there is no legal basis by which to create mandatory, legally enforceable 1,4-dioxane minimization requirements without supporting water quality standards for surface waters,” wrote the utility’s Kenneth Waldroup in the letter addressed to Solomon and Division of Water Resources Director Richard Rogers.

“Given that the EMC determined many years ago that 1,4-dixoane adversely impacts the protected use of groundwater, we respectfully point out that the EMC neglects its statutory duty to protect surface waters from the same pollutant. Pollution mitigation plans that have no required or enforceable reduction targets will not garner any tangible results but instead be no more than an action in name only providing empty promises to the people of North Carolina,” the letter states.

There are six known 1,4-dioxane polluters upstream of the drinking water supply for Sanford, Fayetteville, Brunswick, New Hanover and Pender counties, and municipalities that buy drinking water from Sanford.

Waldroup has said that the utility will have to invest millions of dollars to remove 1,4-dioxane, a likely carcinogen, from its raw drinking water source: the Cape Fear River.

Cape Fear Public Utility Authority has already spent millions in upgrades and ongoing treatment of PFAS discharged into the Cape Fear River from, among other upstream polluters, Chemours’ Fayetteville Works plant.

GenX is specific to the Bladen County facility, which is roughly 74 miles upstream of Wilmington.

Since news broke nearly eight years ago that Chemours had knowingly discharged PFAS directly into the river, air and groundwater for decades, the company has spent millions to reduce its PFAS emissions to comply with a 2019 consent order between the company, DEQ and Cape Fear River Watch.

The Cape Fear utility and other public water utilities in the region are calling for regulations that would ultimately shift the cost of reducing PFAS and 1,4-dioxane discharges to the industries that produce those chemical compounds.

“We seek meaningful regulation that acknowledges and rewards the reductions made to date, prevents backsliding, and requires uncooperative industrial dischargers to mirror the work of dutiful municipal partners,” Waldroup wrote.

The Clean Water Act includes “anti-backsliding” provisions advocates say prohibits repealing or weakening the drinking water standard.

“Unfairly” blamed

Water quality committee members pointed the finger at Division of Water Resources staff as the reason for the latest delay in getting proposed rules out for public comment.

Smith, who is not a member of the water quality committee, took issue with that assertion, saying in her email that committee members were “unfairly blaming” division staff.

“DWR was not responsible for the fact that the Office of State Budget and Management (OSBM) did not approve the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIAs) for these two sets of rules before the May EMC meeting,” she wrote.

Instead, “significant changes” to the rule drafts and the draft regulatory analyses that were presented to the committee in March “led directly to OSBM questions that delayed approval of the RIAs and remain unresolved.”

Changes to the draft rules were made at the direction of a group of commissioners, including the chair and vice chair of the water quality committee, chair of the groundwater and waste management committee, and Solomon. Solomon did not respond to an email request for comment.

During the water quality committee’s May 7 meeting, Rogers said staff had “been engaged in taking direction from a subcommittee of this committee” over the last month.

“We have taken that direction and applied it directly to the draft rules that y’all have before you today,” Rogers said.

Exactly which commissioners had been meeting with staff had not been made clear until the May 7 meeting, Smith told Coastal Review.

“It’s not necessarily inappropriate to have a subcommittee or a working group, a small group of EMC members who work on something between committee meetings, but one of my concerns about this process has been there’s never been any transparency about the fact that was going on and who was involved,” she said. “I do think we need to reach some common understanding of how we’re working on these rules, but that also clearly affects the public, and I’m also not sure we’re on a path toward making great progress in July, depending on how willing some of these water quality committee members are to making changes to satisfy OSBM.”

Solomon said that DEQ staff “asked for a more collaborative approach” with the commission for the monitoring and minimization draft rule.

“Coordination and communication with DEQ divisions is charged to the chair and vice-chair of the relevant EMC committee, and in this case the WQC chair and vice chair interacted with DWR to move this draft item onto the committee agenda for debate and discussion,” he said. “No action has been taken on the draft monitoring and minimization rule, or the RIA, by the WQC or the EMC. Based on OSBM’s response to the draft RIA, the benefits aspect of the draft rule is the primary issue. My direction as EMC chair is to bring the updated draft documents before the committee in July.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Raven_Rock_State_Park_Cape_Fear_River_8074824871.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-16 12:24:59.540109

Several House Republicans are pushing back against their own party’s attempt to slash clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, fearing local economic fallout.

Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP leaders support phasing out the credits to help fund Trump-aligned priorities, but some lawmakers say that could devastate investments in their districts.

With Republicans split and Democrats opposed, the fate of the tax package may rest with the Senate, where moderate Republicans also support preserving parts of the climate law.

Key quote:

“Across the country, there is a huge economic impact that would happen if we just cut these things off.”

— Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-Va.)

Why this matters:

Republicans have spent the last two years slamming the Inflation Reduction Act as a liberal spending spree — but now some are getting cold feet about gutting its green tax credits. Clean energy tax credits are funneling billions into red-state districts, transforming economically depressed towns into hubs for solar, wind, and battery production, and bringing jobs that are hard to hate come reelection time. Is the GOP is willing to sacrifice an economic boon — one that’s driving green manufacturing and cutting pollution — to score points in a political fight?

In short:

President Trump has called climate liability lawsuits a threat to the economy and ordered the Justice Department to preemptively sue states like Hawaii and Michigan to prevent them from proceeding.

Attorney General Pamela Bondi filed additional lawsuits against New York and Vermont over laws aimed at making polluters pay for climate adaptation, labeling them threats to national security.

Despite federal pressure, some lawsuits are advancing in state courts, including a Colorado case allowed to proceed by the state’s Supreme Court, even as other suits have been dismissed or dropped.

Key quote:

“The climate crisis is here, and the costs of surviving it are rising every day. The burden should fall on those who deceived and failed to warn consumers about the climate dangers lurking in their products.”

— Josh Green, governor of Hawaii

Why this matters:

As the climate warms, communities across the United States are racking up billions in damages from floods, fires, droughts and storms — costs that state and local governments argue should be shared by the companies that profited from fossil fuels while allegedly misleading the public about their risks. These lawsuits resemble earlier efforts to hold the tobacco industry accountable and could set powerful legal precedents. But the federal government’s new legal interventions raise the stakes. Suing states to stop climate litigation marks an aggressive defense of fossil fuel interests and could undermine the ability of local governments to recover funds for climate resilience. If successful, this strategy might close off one of the few remaining avenues for holding corporations responsible for climate impacts — especially in the absence of sweeping federal climate policy.

In short:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin defended the Trump administration’s decision to freeze nearly $3 billion in climate law grants intended for low-income and minority communities, as well as $20 billion in green bank financing for clean energy projects.

Democrats accused Zeldin of illegally impounding funds mandated by Congress, while Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said the funding cuts were “indiscriminate” and harmed rural communities, including her constituents in Alaska.

Zeldin said the agency acted based on new “policy priorities” under President Trump and suggested some grants might be reinstated if language about environmental justice and diversity is removed, in line with a Trump executive order.

Key quote:

“So you understand that when you impound funds, you’re violating the law?”

— Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley

Why this matters:

The EPA’s funding decisions affect how communities across the country — especially those already burdened by pollution — can protect themselves from environmental threats. The grants at issue were meant to reduce exposure to contaminated water, heatwaves, and floods, and to boost infrastructure like heat pumps and health clinics in underserved neighborhoods. Withholding these funds could stall or reverse efforts to clean up toxic sites, upgrade water systems, and prepare for climate-driven disasters. In addition, the dispute reflects a deeper clash over executive power and the role of science and equity in federal policy.

In short:

The rule being rescinded had cut project fees for solar and wind energy developers on federal land by about 80%.

The Trump administration argues the existing fee reductions unfairly favor intermittent renewables over traditional energy sources.

The planned rollback is part of a broader effort to dismantle clean energy incentives and revive fossil fuel production.

Key quote:

""Eliminating the Biden administration's preferential treatment of unaffordable, unreliable 'intermittent' projects and dismantling excessive, one-sided restrictions on traditional energy sources like oil, gas, and critical minerals, will unlock the full potential of America’s natural resources.""

— Doug Burgum, secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior

Why this matters:

The cost of developing solar and wind farms on public lands has long been a barrier to scaling up renewable energy in the United States. By slashing those fees in 2024, the Biden administration aimed to create a more level playing field with oil and gas, whose access to public lands has traditionally faced fewer financial hurdles. Reversing that policy signals a return to favoring extractive industries over low-carbon alternatives. Public lands make up a large share of the nation’s undeveloped potential for utility-scale renewable energy, especially in the sunny Southwest and windy Great Plains. Making them less accessible to clean energy developers could slow the transition to a cleaner grid and deepen the country’s reliance on polluting fuels.

In short:

A new report from the Plastics & Climate Project reveals that microplastics could interfere with ocean and soil processes that lock away carbon, a factor missing in most climate models.

Microplastics affect oceanic carbon sequestration by disrupting marine snow and altering plankton behavior, while in soil they may impact microbial carbon storage.

The report calls for more research into plastic's warming potential, especially in light of emerging evidence that plastics may influence Earth's reflectivity and release methane as they degrade.

Key quote:

“An incomplete understanding must not halt action to comprehensively account for plastic climate impacts.”

— Holly Kaufman, senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and a lead author of the report

Why this matters:

Scientists are learning that microplastics affect far more than marine life. These tiny fragments can slow plankton growth, disrupt fish waste, and alter microbial processes in the soil, all of which could reduce Earth’s ability to absorb and store carbon. This undermines a vital natural buffer against climate change. On top of that, plastic particles might change how sunlight reflects off snow, ice, and even clouds — and may emit methane as they break down. These pathways aren’t yet fully understood, but they suggest we’ve been underestimating plastic’s climate footprint. As plastics continue to spread through ecosystems, including remote oceans and mountaintops, it becomes more urgent to study how they affect planetary systems in addition to human health.

In short:

The National Weather Service has 155 open positions, including key roles in hurricane-prone areas like Louisiana, as it rushes to prepare for the June 1 start of hurricane season.

Democrats on the House Science Committee say staff have been urged to take demotions to cover gaps, while internal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) documents reveal shortages in meteorology, IT, and hydrology roles critical to public safety.

Former officials and lawmakers link the shortages to Trump-era workforce reductions and warn that understaffing at NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency could compromise disaster response as climate-driven events intensify.

Key quote:

“We’re not prepared. We’re heading into hurricane season as unprepared as anytime as I can imagine.”

— Tom DiLiberto, former NOAA official

Why this matters:

The National Weather Service staffing crisis couldn’t come at a worse time. As climate change drives stronger hurricanes, heavier rainfall, and more erratic storm patterns, gaps in forecasting and emergency communication could mean communities don’t get timely alerts. Local NWS offices are essential not just for tracking storms but for coordinating with emergency responders on the ground. If hydrologists, IT specialists, or lead meteorologists aren’t in place, radar systems could fail or data could lag just when it's needed most. Compounding the issue, NOAA’s tracking systems for billion-dollar disasters and polar data are also under threat.

In short:

AmeriCorps, the national service agency that deployed over 200,000 people annually, has been severely slashed by the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), cutting 85% of staff and canceling $400 million in grants.

Programs across California and the U.S. that focused on disaster response, climate resilience, and environmental education have been abruptly halted, leaving communities and volunteers stranded mid-service.

Lawsuits from states and grant recipients aim to block the cuts, arguing that the dismantling of AmeriCorps threatens essential recovery efforts in the face of rising extreme weather and weakens national disaster preparedness.

Key quote:

“This will be disastrous to communities. And the thing that’s really unfortunate is we won’t feel it until after disaster hits.”

— Dana Fisher, professor at American University’s School of International Service

Why this matters:

AmeriCorps played a quiet but essential role in disaster recovery across the United States. By pulling thousands of young people into public service for modest pay, it built a decentralized but responsive force that could be quickly mobilized during emergencies. These programs often served as the first boots on the ground and the last to leave after disasters, especially in underserved areas where local support is thin. The decision to dismantle AmeriCorps comes as climate-fueled disasters intensify in frequency and scale. Without these workers, communities face longer recovery times, more chaos, and fewer hands to help. At the same time, other critical institutions like FEMA and NOAA are facing similar rollbacks, compounding the risk.",https://www.dailyclimate.org/media-library/a-sign-on-a-concrete-building-reading-united-states-environmental-protection-agency.jpg?id=60261355&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C96%2C0%2C97,N,,2025-05-16 13:13:55.079982

Gary Peters.

They wanted Peters to pressure the Trump administration to lift the funding freeze on $20 million in “community change grants” promised by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to houses of worship across Detroit to create community resilience hubs powered by renewable energy — offering shelter during weather emergencies and utility outages.

More than three months later, spring has come to Michigan — and yet the expected $2 million in funding for the St. Suzanne Cody Rouge Community Resource Center in Detroit remains on ice.

St. Suzanne Executive Director Steve Wasko says his organization — which provides meals, clothing, day care and other programs for residents of this predominantly Black neighborhood — has “received conflicting and sometimes contradictory communication about the grant.”

Wasko had been promised funding to install heat pumps, solar panels and a generator, among other upgrades. The retrofit would allow St. Suzanne to help more people while cutting an energy bill that can run up to $15,000 a month in the winter.

The funding freeze is just the latest setback for poor communities of color across the United States — including in Detroit, Los Angeles and Philadelphia — that are being left behind in the transition to cleaner, cheaper power.

Neighborhoods like Cody Rouge suffer from underpowered electrical service, more frequent power outages and high energy bills — a legacy of the once-legal practice of redlining that robbed communities of color of financial and public services, Floodlight found.

In formerly redlined neighborhoods like Cody Rouge, shutoffs for non-payment are more likely. And poverty limits access to renewable energy: Aging roofs can’t support solar panels, outdated wiring can’t handle new heaters, and old electrical infrastructure struggles to accommodate electric vehicle charging and solar arrays.

“It’s now very clear that energy services, ranging from quality of service to price of service, are disproportionately poor if you are a minority, a woman or of low income,” said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy at the University of California-Berkeley.

Little money, high bills

High energy costs are a burden across Detroit. A quarter of the metro area’s poorest households spend at least 15% of their income to power and heat their homes, according to a Floodlight analysis of data from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

Across the United States, a quarter of all low-income households — roughly 23 million people — struggle to pay their energy bills. In most major U.S. cities including Detroit and Philadelphia, these one out-of-four low-income households pay 15% or more of their incomes on average on electricity, cooling and heat. In Los Angeles, this group pays just over 14% of their household income on utility bills.

These energy burdens have persisted for decades despite billions of dollars from federal and state governments subsidizing electricity bills in low-income communities. And now, Trump has gutted the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides heating and cooling subsidies for 6 million U.S. households.

Other policy solutions face significant challenges. Energy subsidy programs suffer from low enrollment. Collective “community solar” efforts capable of bringing cheap renewable power to renters and the urban poor are stymied by utilities or not made available to folks with lower incomes.

During the Biden administration, tens of billions of dollars were allocated by Congress to help socially vulnerable groups participate in the energy transition. Trump froze much of that funding. Repeated court orders to resume the funding have been ignored or only partially honored. The chaos has only deepened advocates’ concern that the disparities in America’s electric grid will persist — and perhaps even deepen.

“The current energy system has this imbalance, but if we don’t fix that, we’ll continue down that path, even as we transition to a cleaner, greener energy system,” said Tony Reames, professor of environmental justice at the University of Michigan.

Energy inequality across America

In some states, minority communities are more likely to lose power. And in others, Black and brown residents are more likely to have their power shut off for nonpayment. Because of gaps in data collection, a clear national picture of energy inequality is difficult to see. Across the United States, counties with high minority populations in Arkansas, Louisiana and Michigan are disproportionately prone to having long blackouts, according to a 2023 study in Nature Communications.

At least 3 million Americans face disconnection each year because they can’t afford utility bills, with Hispanic and Black households being four and three times more likely to be disconnected, respectively, according to the Energy Justice Lab, which tracks disconnections.

That number could be much higher, though, since only 28 states require their utilities to disclose disconnections, meaning no data is available for 44% of the country, according to Selah Goodson Bell, an energy justice campaigner with the Center for Biological Diversity.

The redlined grid

And in certain cities, the inequality extends to the very structure of the grid itself.

In Detroit and California, advocates and scientists have found that outdated utility infrastructure is concentrated in predominantly minority areas. This barrier may limit those neighborhoods’ ability to access renewable energy technologies such as rooftop solar, battery storage and electric-vehicle charging, which can lower energy costs.

When the lights flicker or go out in Detroit’s poorest neighborhoods, it’s often because of the electrical distribution grid.

Today in Motor City, many low-income residents get their power through DTE Energy’s 4.8-kilovolt (kV) electric system, which struggles to keep up with the changing climate. Whiter, wealthier suburbs of Detroit are serviced by a more modern 13.8-kV grid. In rate cases, activists have accused DTE of prioritizing infrastructure upgrades in wealthier, whiter communities while leaving Black and brown neighborhoods with outdated and unreliable service.

Across the city, power lines and transformers are decades past their intended lifespan, leading to frequent outages and prolonged blackouts. Aging infrastructure, beset by summer heat waves and winter storms, led to almost 45% of customers suffering eight or more hours of service disruptions in 2023. A company spokesperson notes it improved reliability by 70% between 2023 and 2024.

“I know after three days without power, the strands of civilization get tested,” said Jeff Jones, Detroit resident and executive director of Hope Village Revitalization, a nonprofit community development corporation. “It can get really frightening.”

DTE says it has committed to improving the grid, citing a $1.2 billion investment in downtown Detroit’s infrastructure and a push to prioritize grid upgrades in vulnerable communities.

Lauren Sarnacki, a senior communications strategist at DTE, said the company also helped connect customers to nearly $144 million in energy assistance last year. And the utility runs a pilot program for households earning up to 200% of the federal poverty level, capping their energy costs at 6% of their income.

One Black church in Metro Detroit did not wait for the grid to improve. Last fall, New Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church weatherized, upgraded its heating system and installed solar panels and a battery with the assistance of the nonprofit Michigan Interfaith Power & Light and a state grant.

The solar array and battery give community members a chance to warm up or cool down in the building when the power is out in the neighborhood, said the church’s deacon, Wilson Moore.

“For the church itself, we’ve cut costs as far as energy consumption almost 40, 45% — and that’s without even solar panels up,” he said.

The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also operates a 4.8-kV distribution grid in certain neighborhoods, including in Boyle Heights, a predominantly hispanic East LA enclave that was once redlined and has now begun to gentrify.

There, aging transformers and outdated service lines mean that businesses installing EV fast-charging stations or anyone trying to plug in a large solar array may have to pay for grid upgrades, according to an NREL study. “Grid limitations could limit the success of other clean energy equity programs,” the study concluded.

The shadow of redlining remains

Old roofs also are a major barrier to rooftop solar adoption across Los Angeles, according to Alex Turek, deputy director at GRID Alternatives Greater Los Angeles, a nonprofit that deploys renewable energy in low-income neighborhoods. “I think 70% or more of our folks who we build trust with, who are ready to move forward, can’t then adopt solar because their roofs are old and can’t support the weight,” Turek said.

Floodlight spoke to 18 organizations attempting to deploy renewable energy in low-income communities across the country. All of them said that poor housing stock, which is often concentrated in formerly redlined neighborhoods, was a major barrier to their work.

For renters and apartment dwellers, community solar may be a solution by allowing low-income residents “a way of dividing up an array and sharing it among multiple people,” said Alan Drew, a regional organizer with the Climate Witness project, a faith-based climate nonprofit.

Programs in 24 states and Washington, D.C., support this form of collective solar energy, which generates enough energy to power more than million homes, according to a yearly survey from the NREL. Most of the locations also offer financial assistance for low-income households to access this form of energy, according to the NREL study.

However, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, investor-owned utilities have stymied the adoption of community solar. California has 13 solar projects built on the community solar model, but only one — the Anza community solar project in Santa Rosa — is dedicated to low- and medium income customers.

The state does have the Solar on Multifamily Housing (SOMAH) program that has subsidized over 700 solar arrays on multifamily affordable housing units, bringing costs down for some 50,000 apartments. The program makes sure that the cost savings don’t just go to the landlord.

“The smart policy design feature of the SOMAH program is that at least 50% of the system has to benefit the tenants,” said Turek, of GRID Alternatives.

Solar helps cool city

On sweltering afternoons in Hunting Park, the heat rises in waves from the asphalt, baking the brick rowhouses. The Philadelphia neighborhood’s sparse tree cover offers little relief — only 9% of it is shaded, compared to 20% of the city overall.

The effect is brutal. With much of its land covered in concrete, brick and blacktop, temperatures in Hunting Park can soar as much as 22 degrees higher than in other parts of Philadelphia. That difference translates directly into higher electricity bills as residents struggle to cool aging homes never built for such extreme heat.

Charles Lanier, executive director of the Hunting Park Community Revitalization Corp., said some residents pay as much as 40% of their incomes just to heat and cool their homes.

“I’ve seen bills as high as $5,000,” Lanier said. “It’s a problem across the board in marginalized communities here in the city of Philadelphia.”

In Hunting Park and in low-income neighborhoods across the City of Brotherly Love, the Philadelphia Energy Authority has braided together several grant and funding streams to repair, weatherize, electrify and add solar power to some 200 low-income homes across the city in a state where community solar is not allowed.

The agency also runs Solarize Philly, a program that has helped install solar on some 3,300 homes, including low- to moderate income households.

“We think low-income solar is the best way to create long-term affordable housing,” said Emily Schapira, CEO of Philadelphia’s Energy Authority.

Lanier has seen the value of solar firsthand.

“Here at our office we have installed rooftop solar panels. Our electric bill has gone from $100,” he added, “to almost zero.”

The window will close on 14 April.

According to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, “This is our clean energy superpower mission in action, kickstarting growth, delivering energy security and transforming towns and cities as part of the transition – from the ports of Nigg and Leith to the manufacturing hubs of Blyth and Hull”.

So, what is the CIB? How will it work? And can it live up to the Energy Secretary’s ambitions?

The CIB (previously titled Sustainable Industry Reward) applies to all offshore wind projects bidding for funding through Allocation Round 7 of the CfD scheme and is governed by its own allocation framework. It has two components:

a mandatory or minimum component (which sets a compliance ‘floor’ for all relevant CfD applicants); and

an optional or extra component (which makes additional CfD revenues available on a competitive bid basis).

To participate in the CfD allocation round, all relevant CfD applicants must obtain what is known as a CIB statement. In order to obtain a CIB statement, each such applicant must meet a set of CIB minimum standards, demonstrating investment of at least £100 million per gigawatt (GW) (fixed) or £50 million (floating) in shorter supply chains (criterion 1 investment), and/or sustainable means of production (criterion 2 investment).

Criterion 1 investment may be made in manufacturing facilities or installation firms for a defined category of key components. They may also be made in ports, however, the ports in question must all be located in specified deprived UK areas.

Criterion 2 investment may be made in component manufacturing facilities or installation firms that have committed to a ‘Science Based Target’ set under the Science Based Target initiative.

Please note, in either criterion CIB investments can only be made in tangible assets (as opposed to intangible assets such as skills, and research and development) and must be made after 13 March 2024, but before the relevant CfD start date.

As well as obtaining a CIB statement, each relevant applicant is also entitled to submit a range of proposals under the CIB extra component to make additional criterion 1 or criterion 2 investments (on top of the minimum investment already committed to obtain the statement).

These proposals will be ranked by the value of the investment proposed, relative to its cost (in terms of the amount of subsidy sought). Top ranked bids will be allocated additional CfD revenue under the CIB budget, which was set indicatively in November 2024 at £27 million per GW of total capacity covered by CIB statements. Part of the budget will be ring-fenced for floating proposals.",https://shepwedd.com/themes/custom/awbs4/favicon.ico,N,,2025-05-16 10:09:37.333579

A return through tax credits.
They can bank on that, because tax credits are a guarantee.
But anyway, the program itself was supposed to be around until at least 2032 and the bank could bank on those tax credits.","This week I chatted with Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice with Lawyers for Good Government, an organization that has been supporting beneficiaries of the Inflation Reduction Act navigate the uncertainties surrounding tax credits and grant programs under the Trump administration. The reason I wanted to chat with Jillian is simple: the IRA is under threat for the first time under a Republican Congress. I wanted to understand how solar and wind projects could be impacted by the House Republican reconciliation bill and putting IRA tax credits in doubt. I learned a lot.

The following conversation was lightly edited for clarity.

Okay, Jillian, what’s the topline here? How would the GOP reconciliation bill impact individual projects’ development?

There are big chunks of the reconciliation bill that will have dramatic impacts on project development, including language that would repeal or phase out bipartisan and popular tax credits in a way that would make it very, very difficult to invest in projects. I can get into the weeds next.

But it’s worth saying first – the group of programs aside from tax credits that [House Republicans] would repeal represents every single part of America. Hundreds of projects that will not go forward if these programs are not going well. And they have several legally obligated grants that EPA has already mucked up in a litany of ways. But what they’re proposing to do is to pull the rug out from under those programs. On top of that they want to pull any unobligated funding out.

I think it’s extremely misrepresentative to say these are not big cuts. They’re significant cuts to clean air and clean water across the board.

Help me get into the weeds about how phasing out the credits will make it harder to invest in a project.

Right now, a bank might want to invest a certain amount of money in a clean energy project because they know on the back end they can get 30% or 40% back on their investment. A return through tax credits. They can bank on that, because tax credits are a guarantee.

Was that an intentional pun? “Bank”?

Yeah, it is. I love a good pun. You opened the floodgates, that was a mistake.

But anyway, the program itself was supposed to be around until at least 2032 and the bank could bank on those tax credits. That’s a big runway, because projects could get delayed and you could lock in the credit as soon as you started construction.

Now they’re doing a phase-out approach where if your project is not placed into service before a certain date, you don’t avoid the phase out. You don’t get any protections if you’re starting your project now or next year. It has to be placed in service before 2028 or else your project may not be eligible. You are constructing it, you are financing it, but then through no fault of your own – a storm or whatever – then suddenly that project is no longer entitled to get 30% or 40% back.

That’s a big risk. And banks don’t like risk.

Opposition on the ground also delays projects the way a storm does. Would this empower those opponents?

Oh, totally. Totally. If anyone wants to fight a project, a bank might be even less likely to invest in it. The NIMBYs for that particular project become a risk.

What would you tell a developer at this moment who is wondering about the uncertainty around the IRA?

I would tell them that now is the time to speak up. If they want to stay in this business and make sure their energy stays as low-cost as it already is, they need to speak up right now, no matter what their political party affiliation is. Make it clear solar isn’t going away, wind isn’t going away, storage isn’t going away.

And that’s what the staff did for the Palisades restart environmental assessment,” Naber said.","As New Jersey-Based Holtec International works its way toward restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in West Michigan, a host of organizations are challenging regulator’s findings that reviving the reactor would not bring significant harm to the environment.

The Palisades restart marks the first effort of its kind in the United States, with the federal government awarding the effort a $1.5 billion loan alongside $150 million in state funding to bring the facility back online.

However the effort is not without its detractors, as some environmental organizations have argued against providing state funding for the effort, while other organizations have opposed the plant over safety and environmental concerns.

In a virtual hearing Thursday morning, attorneys representing Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan, Michigan Safe Energy Future, Three Mile Island Alert, and Nuclear Energy Information Services asked a panel Atomic Safety and Licensing Board panel to accept a motion allowing them to file new and updated contentions. Those contentions argue the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission erred when it issued a finding of no significant impact for the project, allowing it to forgo a full review of environmental impacts.

“The position of the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] staff seems to be that, since the plant was operable in May 2022 that simply a return to operability means that there are no significant environmental impacts,” said Wallace Taylor, an attorney representing the anti-nuclear groups, arguing that the environmental analysis should have come from a perspective of retooling, recalibrating and restarting a dormant facility.

The Commission issued a draft of its findings in January, where it outlined the purpose and need reviving the facility would serve, the level of environmental review needed and provided a description of the plant, any potential alternatives, and the various ways it could impact the environment.

The environmental assessment cites Michigan’s standard for 100% clean energy by 2040, which includes provisions for nuclear energy and natural gas with 90% effective carbon capture technology in justifying the need for the project. It also argues the facility will enhance electrical reliability in the state by generating consistent, carbon-free energy and reducing the state’s reliance on imported energy sources.

Although the commission reviewed alternatives like replacing the current reactor with a new reactor; replacing the reactor with other alternatives like natural gas, solar and wind; and using alternative system designs with the current reactor, it only provided further analysis for a no-action alternative, where it would deny the authorizations needed to bring Palisades back online.

After reviewing a number of potential concerns, commission staff ultimately concluded the project would have no significant environmental impacts, and that choosing not to grant the authorizations Holtec needs to operate the plant would violate the purpose and need of the project: meeting clean energy demand.

Terry Lodge, also representing the groups challenging the review, contended that the purpose of need statement was flawed, arguing it presents a restart of the plant as the only viable option without offering any justification or explanation of the demand for power.

Lodge and Taylor also argued the limited consideration of alternatives to the plant was similarly problematic.

“I think that it’s pretty obvious that renewable energy would have a lessened environmental impact than a nuclear plant, which would require uranium mining, which would require something to be done with the radioactive waste. There’s radioactive material, like tritium, for example, that comes from nuclear plants, and all of that would have to be considered to have a really appropriate discussion in the [environmental analysis], and that wasn’t done,” Taylor said.

Lodge further contended that the impact of the project remains unclear, as Holtec is still working to identify whether it needs to replace key components of the reactor, like steam generators, arguing the environmental effects of the restart are not yet known and quantified.

While justifying their findings, commission staff explained that the purpose and needs statement is used to determine the range of alternatives considered within the assessment.

Anita Naber, representing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, explained that the alternatives analysis is intended to determine whether there are other options available or environmentally preferable alternatives.

She later explained that while developing a purpose and need statement for their environmental analysis, staff members give substantial weight to the goals and needs of an applicant, in line with both the commission’s policy and case law.

“The staff will look at the applicant’s purpose and need and the factual background and information that’s submitted by the applicant in support of that purpose and need and evaluate that. And that’s what the staff did for the Palisades restart environmental assessment,” Naber said.

In offering their closing arguments to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, the plant’s opponents emphasized that an environmental impact should have been required for the project since the beginning, and would have required a much more in-depth analysis of alternatives.

However, members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec argued that the contentions filed by the opposing groups should be denied, as they were not responding to new information as required by the commission’s rules. Naber also noted that the commission expects petitioners to file contentions on the basis of an applicant’s environmental report rather than delaying them until after the staff issues its environmental analysis.

“To have their contentions admitted for hearing, petitioners must demonstrate some sort of genuine factual or legal dispute with the staff draft [environmental analysis], which they have not done. They also need to provide actual fact or expert support for their assertion, but they have not done this either,” Naber said.

On rebuttal, Lodge argued that the Commission’s rules allow petitioners to file new or amended contentions based on a draft or final environmental impact statement, environmental assessment or any supplements to those documents.

“We timely and we believe properly under this section amended our contentions,” Lodge said, arguing their updated contentions should not be excluded as a result.

The panel will take the matter under consideration and will determine whether to accept the opposition’s updated contentions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Palisades-plant.jpg,N,,2025-05-16 10:10:47.577087

“This [environment protection reform] would be an ideal opportunity for her to show that she’s serious about that,” he said.","Legislating a federal environment protection agency is a “very high and immediate” priority for the re-elected Labor government, new minister Murray Watt has said, signalling he wants nature laws passed quickly to avoid another drawn-out political fight.

In an early statement of intent, Watt will next week travel to Western Australia where he intends to meet face to face with the premier, Roger Cook, and mining industry leaders whose lobbying helped sink the proposed EPA in the previous term.

In his first interview with Guardian Australia in the role, the Queensland senator said he was also considering dropping the “nature positive” title for Labor’s wider overhaul of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (Epbc).

“I am considering the type of language we use to describe these reforms,” Watt said.

“I think the more we can explain these concepts in terms that Australians can understand and buy into, I think that does improve our chances of building public support for them.”

The former industrial relations minister was last week appointed to replace Tanya Plibersek, whose three years in the environment portfolio were defined by a failure to win support for promised nature protection laws.

Watt’s first priority is a decision on Woodside’s application to extend its North-West shelf gas project to 2070 – due on 31 May – before he turns his attention to fixing the EBPC Act.

The Labor frontbencher said it was “certainly his intention” to make a ruling before the deadline rather than seek another extension.

Plibersek was on the cusp of a deal with the Greens in November to establish the EPA before it was scuttled by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, amid pressure from Cook and WA miners.

Albanese stepped in again in February, shelving the legislation indefinitely to the anger of environmental groups and grassroots Labor members.

The prime minister recommitted during the election campaign to establish a federal nature watchdog but not in the some form to the one shunted weeks earlier.

With the government committed to fresh rounds of talks with industry and environment groups, Watt would not be drawn on the possible design of EPA 2.0, including the option of an agency that enforces nature laws but does not approve projects.

Albanese offered up that model – which sections of industry backed – in a futile attempt to win the Coalition’s support in the previous term.

The EPA was just one part of the wider “nature positive” plan, which also included a suite of national environmental standards in line with recommendations in Graeme Samuel’s review of the EPBC Act.

Plibersek put the standards on the backburner, with no timeframe for their implementation, after splitting up the package in April last year.

Watt said he was open to changing course, pursing one large set of laws – including an EPA – rather than multiple tranches.

“It was absolutely understandable that we progressed the reforms in a staged manner prior to the election,” he said. “I’ve got a genuinely open mind about that (one broader bill). There will be pros and cons about that, and that’s one of the things that I want to consider.”

Watt has not formed a view about national environmental standards but said it was “his intention to progress these reforms in the spirit of Graeme Samuel’s recommendations”.

The new minister wouldn’t set a deadline for the legislation but has signalled Labor wants to resolve the legislation early in the term, outside the heat of the pre-election period.

“This is a very high and immediate priority for the government,” Watt said.

“It’s why on day one on the job, I was on the phone to all of the key stakeholders talking about this. It’s why I’m headed to WA next week … to get those conversations started.

“I do think that the immediate period after an election is an ideal time to settle complicated, contentious reforms and I want to use that opportunity to the best effect.”

The minister insisted he wasn’t “picking sides” in the debate, having held phone calls with environment groups, such as Greenpeace and Australian Conservation Foundation, and industry groups such as the Minerals Council of Australia.

Watt was open to working with either the opposition or the Greens to strengthen environment laws, with both parties under new leadership after the election.

The new Greens leader, Larissa Waters, urged the government to be “bold” as she reaffirmed the party’s position on banning native forrest logging and blocking new coalmines and gas fields.

Labor has ruled out a ban on native forrest logging but has committed to applying national environmental standards to regional forestry agreements.

The government also has no plans to add a “climate trigger” to environmental laws, adamant the safeguard mechanism is an appropriate mechanism to regulate emissions from fossil fuel projects.

Watt welcomed Waters’ commitment to a “constructive” approach to dealing with Labor.

Clean energy as we know is the future, and we have to continue to invest in it.”","The tax cut legislation that U.S. House of Representatives Republicans are putting together in Washington includes measures that will cost thousands of jobs in Wisconsin and undercut the state’s progress toward cleaner energy, according to environmental and labor advocates.

To help pay for the extension of tax cuts enacted in the first Trump administration, the GOP-led House Ways and Means Committee is proposing to repeal clean energy tax credits, Politico reported this week. The tax credits were among the measures enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

“These credits are not just numbers on a balance sheet out in Washington D.C,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in an online press conference Wednesday. “They are representing real jobs, real economic growth, and real progress towards Wisconsin’s sustainable energy infrastructure. Since the IRA was signed into law in 2022 we have seen an unprecedented boom in clean energy development in the trades.”

The press conference was hosted by Forward Together Wisconsin, a nonprofit established to inform people about the Biden administration’s infrastructure and climate investments and to defend them.

“We’ve been seeing this real opportunity to drive energy costs down, and I cannot for the life of me understand why people want to reverse that progress,” said former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, president of Forward Together Wisconsin.

In addition to the tax credits that the U.S. House proposal would repeal, President Donald Trump in his second term has frozen federal clean energy grants that were part of the 2022 legislation. Those include grants to establish a network of electric vehicle charging stations — prompting a lawsuit by 15 states, including Wisconsin.

Solar energy investments that have boomed in the last three years are among those that are threatened by the House proposal, according to advocates.

“At a time when billions of dollars are being invested in states that overwhelmingly voted for President Trump, this proposed legislation will effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement this week.

Since passage of the IRA, Wisconsin has seen $933 million in clean energy and transportation private-sector investments, along with just over $2 billion from federal grants and loans, according to Innovation Policy & Technology, a San Francisco climate change policy think tank. The organization tallied 61 new clean energy and transportation projects that got underway in the state, with 45 manufacturing American-made products.

“Lower investment and higher energy bills due to repealing these federal programs and tax incentives will cost nearly 5,200 Wisconsin jobs in 2030 and more than 6,400 jobs in 2035, compared to current policies,” Innovation Policy & Technology reported.

The advocacy group Climate Power has calculated that without the federal support $5.4 billion for 15 planned Wisconsin clean energy projects could be in jeopardy.

Of those projects, 12 — 80% — are in five congressional districts represented by Republicans, according to Climate Power. Three representatives of those districts — Bryan Steil in the 1st CD, Scott Fitzgerald in the 5th CD and Glenn Grothman in the 6th CD — voted against the IRA in 2022. The other two, Derrick Van Orden in the 3rd CD and Tony Wied in the 8th CD, weren’t in office at the time but publicly opposed the legislation.

John Jacobs, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 494 in Southeast Wisconsin, said the clean energy tax credits and related policies have spurred investment and employment for the union’s members.

“I see first-hand how the clean energy tax credits have delivered on their promise, creating good family-sustaining union jobs across Wisconsin,” Jacobs said. “Repealing these tax credits could be devastating to many, but would put thousands of jobs at risk and hurt a growing industry.”

The tax credits were “an investment in America,” he added. The jobs lost if the credits are repealed “translate to economic instability for families across our state.”

The IRA also included a provision that extends the value of the tax credits to nonprofit organizations and government agencies.

Thanks to that benefit, called direct support payment, the Menasha Joint School District in the Fox Valley has qualified for a $4 million reimbursement from the federal government for installing rooftop solar energy and geothermal energy systems in a school currently under construction, said Brian Adesso, the school district’s business services director.

Once the school is complete the district expects to save $159,000 a year on its electric bill, “which is cost savings to local taxpayers and money that can be invested back into the students and staff,” Adesso said at the Forward Wisconsin press conference.

Adesso said the tax credits gave the district “certainty” it needed to be willing to undertake the clean energy additions to the project. Killing the credits would make that choice harder for school districts and impose higher costs on local property taxpayers, he added.

“The bill making its way through Congress takes a sledgehammer to the tax credits,” Addesso said — ending some credits early and attaching “bureaucratic restrictions that could make many of the credits unusable.”

Barnes said Forward Wisconsin Together is calling on Congress to protect the clean energy initiatives. “The people of Wisconsin deserve better,” he said. “The country deserves better.

TRANSCRIPT

Opening remarks

Murkowski: Good morning, the Committee will come to order. I'd like to welcome Administrator Zeldin to the committee here this morning. I think it is important that as we begin our budget hearings, we begin the oversight through the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee with the EPA, an area of interest, I think, for all of us, as we think about how we ensure that Americans from Alaska to Oregon, to New York to all the places in between, have the benefits of clean air, clean water for all of us.

So, thank you, Administrator, for being here to discuss the Fiscal Year 2026 budget request. We recognize that what we have seen is “skinny,” as we refer to it around here. Each year, the subcommittee holds a hearing to examine the EPA budget requests. Some years, the budget is the focus of the hearing, and others, it's agency actions that draw the majority of the questions. I think it's probably safe to assume that this year it's going to be a mixture of both of these. And again, we've just seen the “skinny” outline of Fiscal Year 2026, we have yet to see the full details of the President's budget request, but I have to say at the outset: looking at some of these proposed cuts, I'm looking at them and questioning whether they are serious cuts. I find many of them problematic. I'm just going to be open and honest with my words here this morning and we will have good dialogue, constructive dialogue, in this committee.

So again, while we're waiting for additional details, I want to spend my time this morning talking about the vision for the EPA and Administrator, how you plan to use your position to continue to better provide clean air, water and land for Americans from Alaska to Florida, from California to Maine, and how a budget like the one that you propose could support that mission.

Under the Biden administration, I had some very serious concerns about the regulatory overreach of the agency. I expressed them often. I also shared the concerns that I felt were overzealous enforcement actions coming out of the agency that went contrary to the needs of Alaskans. We were able to figure out how to find common ground in certain areas to make progress, and some things that were certainly good for Alaska. I mentioned to you contaminated lands, residential wood stove testing and certification. We still have a long, long ways to go on PM, 2.5, I think we know that. PM 2.5 and 301 (h) waivers... We've got work to do. I think we know that.

So now we're in a in a new administration, new administrator and perhaps a different direction here. I do appreciate many of the actions and the initiatives that we have had a chance to discuss. (I) certainly support the willingness to work with the Army Corps of Engineers to review the WOTUS rule, your reconsideration of Clean Power Plan 2.0, the vehicle emissions rules, and then, of course, a renewed focus on permitting, something I would think that all of us can come together on.

But my concern this morning, and what you will hear from me, and I think many others, is the approach that's been taken with regards to freezing funds, canceling grants, and then the reorganization of the agency. I'm looking at it through the not only through the lens of Alaskans, but really all Americans who, regardless of how you feel about the EPA, we benefit from its data driven decision-making, the remediation efforts and the mission to protect human health and environment. And I respect, I give a lot of leeway for an incoming administration's prerogative to implement changes in support of the policies and priorities, but it also has to be done with clear articulation of the of the goals against which such changes will be measured.

And so, it's problematic when as a committee we're asking questions, we don't receive basic data that would be helpful, would be good guidance for us. And so, when we see implementation of significant changes without working or seriously communicating with us, your partners in Congress, it just makes it harder for us to do the job of supporting your mission. We are on the same side here, and so we want to work with you in so many of these areas.

I think we all can agree that there are inefficiencies and redundancies to be found throughout the federal government, some of EPA programs we know are overly burdensome. And again, I applaud the administration for seeking to find ways to help ordinary Americans cut through red tape and make programs easier to access. But the seemingly indiscriminate freezing of EPA funding, regardless of source, has caused some significant anxiety from the folks that I'm talking to in Alaska. One example is the Community Change Grants in my state, we've received $150 million from this program. It's communities like the little village of Kipnuk, it's the Native village of Kotzebue. Took a lot of work to get to the place where they were able to secure the funding, and they've had their grants canceled by the agency without any explanation, and so this is where some of the anxiety comes, is just not knowing why.

It's not just in Alaska. I think members on both sides of the dais can, and probably will, talk about the benefits of the grants to their states and their communities. You've also proposed massive reorganizations of EPA to include the elimination of the Office of Atmospheric Programs and the Office of Research and Development. It is true that agencies funded by our bill will have the flexibility to reprogram and reorganize, and we provide that flexibility because we know - we get it. There can be urgent and exigent circumstances that warrant such actions. However, agencies must comply with the requirements and provide the committees with the requisite information, whether it's budgetary and staffing implications, but also the rationale for the actions to include why these actions are so urgent. And so far, EPA has not adhered to our reprogramming guidelines and has been largely unresponsive to the questions. So, I would certainly expect timely and transparent responses and information. I would expect EPA to abide by the parameters that are outlined in our reprogramming guidelines. And I think, as a former member of Congress, you get it. You've been on the frustration end of things as well. So again, ways that we can be working together.

Now, turning our attention to the FY 26 budget proposal. In Alaska, we've seen on the ground examples of really good things being done with some of the programs that your budget has substantially reduced or proposed to eliminate. Example: the proposed reduction of the State Revolving Fund, reducing it from $2.8 billion down to $305 million. This is an 88% reduction. This was one of the ones when I mention unserious proposal. This is the one that I'm looking at, because it clearly is one of the most essential programs that the agency administers. And you mentioned as part of your justification for cutting this program that the account has been heavily earmarked, and this is true. The 66 members of the Senate, including 17 Republicans, making it our most bipartisan account, who requested congressionally directed spending for the SRF accounts did so in connection with the states to ensure the funding was going to critical clean water and drinking water projects. Now I would also note that in FY 25, Congress voted for, and the President signed into law, a full year CR that keeps the SRF fully funded, rather than reducing it by the amount of the CDS is.

So, I'm going to close my comments here with, I don't know if it's a note of sympathy or just an acknowledgement, because I get it. You are, I think, 106 days since you were confirmed and sworn in as EPA Administrator. And for an agency as key and as vital as yours, that's really a short time to get everything up and running, from enacting the administration's priorities to establishing a clear working relationship with us here in Congress. We know that you're still getting your team in place, because we're trying to move them through our process here, and it is slow, and you need those folks. You need the members of your team. So, I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt here. There's plenty of time for us to figure out what's working what's not, establish open lines of communication between our teams that will mutually benefit your mission and all those that we work for. So, I'm eager to start on that. I thank you for your testimony today, your willingness to answer our questions and just the opportunity to be working with you. And with that, I turn to ranking member Merkley for his comments.

First line of questions from Murkowski

Murkowski: I will begin with my first five minutes, and again, appreciate the opportunity that you and I have had to discuss some of the particular issues. I'd like to ensure that we continue that very direct engagement, not only between us, but also with our staffs. We've had a conversation about transparency, partnership and responsiveness, and again, I think you come to this position really from a good place, because you've sat in in our seats here, so to speak. When you've asked questions of an agency and you get frustrated because you're not able to get what you're seeking.

So, there is a lot going on within the agency, as you have outlined, and as I suppose the ranking member and I have outlined. But we need to be more informed, rather than getting updates by way of tweets or stories for them from the media. The agency has issued reorganization notifications, but we're not getting the full picture or the answers to some of the questions that we have asked. So, my direct question to you this morning is just a renewed commitment that the promise of transparency, partnership and responsiveness is there, that we're going to be able to have meetings between your senior teams and our folks on the Appropriations side, so that we can help you. Let me help you type of an approach, and that's what I'm seeking from you this morning, Mr. Administrator.

Zeldin: Absolutely, Madam Chair, and you uniquely amongst 535 members of Congress have a “Batphone” into my office, which I would encourage you to use at any time. We’ve spoken since my confirmation, and when we meet, you often have a very long list of priorities for Alaska, that you’re fighting for, that you’re passionate about. And to make sure that we're working through that list at every opportunity is something that will be a priority for our team as long as I am here as administrator, and I would encourage you to reach out whenever you would like, and I'd be available to work through whatever is at the top of your list that day.

Murkowski: Very good. Very good. Let me ask about the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. I mentioned in my opening, these are probably the areas where on this committee we have more bipartisan support for a program, and we're looking at a budget that effectively eliminates the one thing that we're all in agreement on. So, I'd ask you to share with me and the others on the committee why the agency would move away from such a critical on-the-ground program when we're talking about access to clean water?

Zeldin: Madam Chair, as you pointed out in your opening remarks, and as you referenced from the skinny budget that was released that we're here to talk about today, there has been a bleeding out of funds deliberately through decisions made by Congress to earmark. I understand that when I came into this position, I inherited a lot of earmarks that many of you have fought for, and I want to be able to continue to work with each of you and your staffs. In some cases, we need to get the recipients to submit paperwork where they're on the receiving end of big earmarks, so that we can work through this backlog as quickly as we can. It would be helpful to have a conversation about the SRF and the use of earmarks, and how that has been reducing the funding through the years.

As you all know, there's a difference when these skinny budgets come out, whether or not something is funded at $0, or it's funded at $1. Now that might not seem like much to the American public in understanding how these conversations go in Congress. The SRF is not zeroed out in the skinny budget - In fact, it has hundreds of millions of dollars there in it. So, as we go forward with this process, I look forward to more conversations about the SRF, and I'm sure members of the House and the Senate will be having conversations amongst yourselves as to what you believe to be the appropriate funding level for SRF, as well as the future of the program, and whether or not earmarks will continue to be used to reduce that balance. That's obviously a decision that Congress has a very important role to play.

Murkowski: Well we do, and we can have a separate discussion about earmarks. I think we both know that earmarks don't contribute to the top line number you are discussing here. A concern that I have raised with you, that there has been, over the years, Congressionally Directed Spending, earmarks, that have been moved through the process, authorized and appropriated to, and still not spent down. So, my time has expired. Now know that on this next round, I'm going to ask for a little more discussion about that. But I do think that given the significance of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund by so many of us… let's have a broader discussion about how we move forward with what I would think most of us recognize has got to be a priority within the EPA.

Second line of questions from Murkowski

Murkowski: Administrator, I had asked you, we had had a discussion about the Congressionally Directed Spending projects. You have indicated that, indeed, we've got a backlog here that we need to address. My understanding is that since fiscal year 2022, Congress had directed 2,264 CDs projects at the EPA - only 705 have received the funding. So, I think both of us would agree, you know, we've got an issue here. There's a problem. The FY 25 CR, of course, did not include the CDS projects. So, I'm looking at that and saying, all right, the agency has the balance of the fiscal year to work on catching up from this backlog of the CDSs. Can you just give me a little bit of your understanding in terms of how you've directed your team to expeditiously get these projects out the door in a more timely manner?

Zeldin: I appreciate the question, Madam Chair. The backlog goes back years. I've directed my team to both work with the members of Congress who represent those areas, the members of Congress who requested those earmarks to get assistance in the case where the recipient has not been responsive, and simultaneously, to try to engage as much as possible directly with the recipient, to try to get the recipient to submit their paperwork. We want to completely get through the entire backlog that we inherited as quickly as possible.

Murkowski: Can we help you with that?

Zeldin: Yes.

Murkowski: I'm working with my constituents right now as we're moving forward in this year's appropriations and getting requests for CDSs. So, can you perhaps either let me know who it is on your team that we need to be communicating directly to if there are snags on your end, or perhaps, again, you're just not able to get in touch with the applicant?

Zeldin: 100%. As you well know, the EPA is broken down into all sorts of different program offices.

Murkowski: Right.

Zeldin: And the it might not be just one person for all grants. It might depend on whether the backlog might… we might be talking about a backlog inside of the Office of Water, where they need assistance from the members of Congress, or maybe it's another office. Maybe it's the Office of Air and Radiation. We would look forward to an opportunity to work with you and your team, and all members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle as much as possible, to eliminate the backlog that we inherited.

Murkowski: Good, good. Let's do that. I think that's a good plan.

Many members here have asked about different grants and programs, the pauses, the freezes. It's been particularly frustrating in Alaska, when we hear there's been a hold up in terms of the grant award. We've got just a limited construction season. It's just hard. Even if not choked by ice, you might have a barge that comes up with your materials for a project, maybe once, maybe twice a season, and so it can push a project back, not just months, but by another season - another year, perhaps multiple years. It's been hard to provide some clarity to our communities on which grants are going to be awarded, which are just going through the review process that you shared with us, which grants have been terminated.

So, I'd ask if your folks could provide a list of what's actually been paused for review versus what has been terminated. I think we've heard, for instance, on the EJ (Environmental Justice) grants, that one has been perhaps more clear, but there are a lot in between. And I think it would help our communities if there was more certainty as to what has actually been terminated versus what is still in the pipeline for review. So, I'd ask for your help on that.

Zeldin: Absolutely, Madam Chair, and we will continue to be distributing funding appropriated by Congress as we go through the rest of the fiscal year that will include funds for your great, great state, and we look forward to working with you on the process. As you know, when the President first came in, there was an administration-wide pause that was lifted. The pause that was then instituted for EPA was more specific to some of the Inflation Reduction Act programs. There was a Clean School Bus program concern that was that was raised early in the administration, when Lion Electric (Company) and their bankruptcy issue caused some questions to be asked to make sure that the concerns with Lion Electric (Company) were it was just specific to Lion Electric (Company). And as it relates to the grants that were that were canceled, that's something that if you have any questions about what was included in that we're happy to answer any individual questions.

Murkowski: Good, okay, we’ll work with you on that list.

Third line of questions from Murkowski

Murkowski: The operating plan for FY25 we received. It's very much in line with the previous year's funding level for each line item. There's a lot of changes that that have been discussed, but it sounds like you are committing to spending the funds as delineated in the agency's spend plans. And I guess my ask to you is, if that's not going to be the case, that the subcommittee receive a reprogramming request so that we basically follow the process if, in fact, we're not doing the agency is not doing this spend out as we have anticipated, as these small communities understand them.

I just have two very quick follow ups. One is very easy for you, because we've discussed it at length, but it is a significant issue in my state when it comes to contaminated lands. The history that I have shared with you of Alaska Natives receiving their settlement of lands, being conveyed by the federal government. And basically, they were conveyed tainted lands, lands that were contaminated by various actions of federal agencies, whether it's the land managers, or the Department of Defense. And so, we have made some good progress with EPA. And believe me, this is not EPA’s is fault or liability for the contamination. It's the federal governments. But what we have learned is that the EPA is uniquely qualified to help us solve this issue. Over the past couple years, there's been roughly $20 million in funding that has been directed to contaminated lands, and the agencies have been doing some really good work. I just need your commitment that we're going to continue with this. $20 million, unfortunately, doesn't even get the first project cleanup. We know that that these are expensive, but it is an obligation. It is a liability of our government, and we owe it, whether it's to Alaska Natives as conveyance of their settlement, or to others. And I know that when we're talking (EPA) Superfunds, Brownfields, contaminated lands, we just have so much work to do here. So, know that you got cooperation on my level here.

Zeldin: Yes, Madam Chairwoman, I look forward to visiting over the course of the next couple of weeks in Alaska. Might be able to have the opportunity to hear about, see about, see this firsthand, and I will, with regards to all appropriations, make sure that we are fulfilling our obligations under the law. So, if Congress appropriates the funds, we'll make sure that it's spent.

Murkowski: Very good.

PFAS is something that we talk a lot about in Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. Last month, you announced that EPA will “tackle PFAS from all of EPA’s program officers, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable, and providing certainty for passive receivers. You said this was just the beginning of the work that EPA is going to do to tackle PFAS, which I certainly appreciate, and I know most everyone up here does.

Can you tell me whether the operating plan and the skinny budget requests, whether they actually reflect this kind of full forward push on PFAS, and whether it includes the $10 billion that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding provided to take on PFAS contamination. I'm looking at this skinny budget, and I'm saying, good for you, let's go on PFAS. But I'm worried about making sure that we're actually budgeting to do so, and I'm also worried about whether or not with the RIFs that we have seen to date, as well as what is anticipated about perhaps an additional fork in the road, whether we're going to be able to do the job. So again, this is something where you're going to have good support from people in this committee for the initiative. But do you have the budget, and do you have the people?

Zeldin: Senator, we're actually adding people into this effort inside of the Office of Water. As you noted, this spans multiple program offices at EPA. A lot of the PFAS work is done inside of the Office of Water. The reorganization announcement that we made a couple weeks ago includes boosting that effort inside of the Office of Water. The press release from April 28 that you referenced included a lot of different actions that we plan on taking, and everything that the agency has announced is already factored into the skinny budget that is before the committee today.

Murkowski: And so, let me just ask more directly, whether or not you're concerned that the RIFs or the deferred resignation is going to impact your ability to execute, whether it's on the PFAS side or contaminated lands, or any number of issues that you've heard here from members.

Zeldin: No, Madam Chair. This is a very important priority of ours at EPA. When I was in Congress, I was a member of the PFAS Task Force. I had voted for the PFAS action act, when I was a member of the House. I represented the district that had all sorts of different PFAS contamination issues. This is something that, in many respects, started during President Trump's first term in office, and has continued to progress since. And we're going to make sure that we're hitting the ground running. That's included in the April 28 announcement, but as we noted in that announcement, that's just some of the many decisions and important work that's before us. It is a very high priority.

Murkowski: So, you've spoken to the adequacy to meet the PFAS mission. Are you concerned about your numbers EPA wide to do your overall mission, not just specific to PFAS, but with everything else that you're looking at? Because the reduction in staffing, is very significant, you've got to admit that. And so, you've got a big task, and we want you to be able to execute on that. So, just want to hear from you whether you have any concerns about your staffing levels right now.

Zeldin: Madam Chair, we are going to fulfill all statutory obligations. One of the things that was a surprise to me coming into the position was just how many people who are employees at the agency were not working on any statutory obligation at all. And I also want to say that there are a lot of amazing, dedicated employees at EPA. The American public might feel disconnected from agency employees who might be working in Washington, D.C., but there are a lot of people who have been there for a long time. They believe in the agency mission. They work hard every single day. One of the reforms we brought in coming in is ending COVID year remote work. And it's great to hear noise in the building, to see the foot traffic, and to see people being productive and collaborative. But if anyone out there was tuning in and they don't know what the agency looks like, it's filled with a lot of amazing, dedicated workers who believe in the agency's mission, and we're going to work hard to make the public proud.

Murkowski: Well, I'm glad that you've acknowledged your workforce, because I think you do have people who are good public servants. They're proud of the work they do, and they're the work that they do has value. And we want to recognize that.

Closing Remarks

Murkowski: We will have further discussion about so many of these issues: the reorganization, what we're seeing with the grants. But I appreciate, Administrator Zeldin, you appearing before the committee, responding to our questions. We will hold the record open until May 21 for additional questions from members and would look forward to your responses to those as well.

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency, speaking Wednesday during a Senate budget hearing in Washington, D.C., dismissed reports that the agency was weakening standards on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also called “forever chemicals.”

During questioning by the chair and ranking member, respectively, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin told the Senate Appropriations Committee that news reports about the EPA weakening PFAS standards were inaccurate and that the standards could instead get tougher. Zeldin said expected job cuts at the agency would not impact its work.

The senators said they were concerned about the EPA’s reductions in force, or RIFs, and its ability to meet commitments made earlier this year about tackling the compounds in soils and waters.

Murkowski noted that the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees EPA funding, frequently discusses PFAS.

“Last month, you announced that EPA will, quote, ‘tackle PFAS from all of EPA’s program offices, advancing research and testing, stopping PFAS from getting into drinking water systems, holding polluters accountable and providing certainty for passive receivers. You said this was just the beginning of the work that EPA is going to do to tackle PFAs,” she said.

She asked Zeldin whether the EPA’s operating plan budget requests “actually reflect this kind of full-forward push on PFAS and whether it includes the $10 billion that the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding provided to take on PFAS contamination.”

Zeldin replied that the EPA was “actually adding people” to its Office of Water, which he said does much of the agency’s work on PFAS. But Murkowski pressed further on the announced RIFs deferred resignations and how they would affect EPA’s ability to execute the plan.

“When I was in Congress, I was a member of the PFAS Task Force. I had voted for the PFAS Action Act. When I was a member of the House, I represented the district that had all sorts of different PFAS contamination issues,” said Zeldin.

Merkley did not appear swayed. He said rough counts showed EPA had lost about 400 people, who were fired within their first year, 560 in the first round of deferred resignations, 180 in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility jobs who were RIF’ed. Another 1,129 exited via second round of deferred resignations, with 1,800 of opt-ins.

“Now we’re up to almost 3,000,” Merkley said. “Office of R and D, it’s rumored that would reduce to 500 positions, which would be a loss of 1,300 additional — now we’re at 4,300. I’ll just point out that for two decades, the level of employment at EPA was about 17,000. Right now, it’s about 14,000, so subtracting the numbers I just shared, we’re talking about more than 4,000 reduction from that.”

He said cutting further to the expected number of 10,000 employees “raises doubts” the agency can meet its own goals.

“It sounds like it’s at odds with your commitment to tackling PFAS and I’m concerned about the numbers,” Merkley said to Zeldin.

Zeldin responded that it was apparent that the question was in response to a news story.

“It might not come as a shock to you, but sometimes the news says stuff that’s not accurate,” Zeldin said. “That is not what the agency announced. As it relates to PFOA and PFAS, you said that we were weakening the standards, and that’s actually the opposite of what the agency actually announced.”

Zeldin said “there was an issue” pertaining to four compounds, “and that’s something that we are going to be going through a process, but that doesn’t mean that the that it gets weaker. The (maximum concentration) might end up getting lower, not higher.”

Merkley entered for the record the Washington Post story with the headline: “EPA plans to weaken rule curbing forever chemicals in drinking water.”

Zeldin said he would “encourage the committee to look at the actual announcement from EPA, as opposed to the Washington Post.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/zeldin.jpg?fit=1200%2C786&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-16 08:04:54.671422

Virtually no public transportation. Half a century ago, residents of Boxtown, a neighborhood in South Memphis settled by formerly enslaved families, felt forgotten by the modern age. But no longer.

They are now at the center of a battle with the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, who built what his company xAI has dubbed the world’s largest supercomputer, Colossus, roughly 2 miles away.

City leaders see Musk’s arrival in Memphis, Tennessee, as a coronation of its future economy, a chance to transform the region into a “high-tech manufacturing hub.” Like their counterparts in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, they were eager to recruit tech companies looking for homes outside Silicon Valley. Musk’s xAI would bring tax revenue and new jobs.

“It represents a tremendous opportunity,” Mayor Paul Young recently told NBC Nightly News, “an opportunity for us to take our economy to the next level.”

But in an area beset by industrial pollution, residents are wary of the methane gas turbines helping to power the electricity-hungry behemoth. The turbines give off nitrogen oxides, a key contributor to smog, and formaldehyde, among other pollutants, according to their manufacturer. Residents say public input has been limited and the company hasn’t been transparent about its plans.

xAI has vowed to stay below allowed limits on pollutants. In response to questions from NBC News, the company defended its process. “xAI works collaboratively with County and City officials, EPA personnel, and community leaders regarding all things that affect Memphis,” it said in a statement, adding that its tax revenue would support “vital programs and services” in the area.

Still, residents of Boxtown, a nearly all-Black community, have their doubts. “How do we really know what is coming from those facilities?” said Sarah Gladney, 71. “They can tell us anything, but how do we really know?”

Their skepticism has deep roots. For decades, outsiders with big plans have come and gone, sometimes leaving the air worse than they found it. But now the outsider also happens to be one of the country’s most powerful men, one who has been helping to run it alongside President Donald Trump. What happens next could test the limits of Musk’s power and the strength of environmental protections.

In at least two other states, Musk’s companies have run afoul of regulators and have been cited or fined for allegedly breaking environmental rules — Tesla in California, and SpaceX and The Boring Co. in Texas. The companies have denied wrongdoing.

Separately, Trump has vowed to shift the focus of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has already dismantled teams created under the Biden White House to address environmental justice issues like those now facing Boxtown.

In coming weeks, the Shelby County Health Department is expected to decide whether to approve xAI’s permit to permanently install 15 turbines. Meanwhile, xAI has already purchased another property in nearby Whitehaven to expand its operations in Memphis.

Local residents aren’t backing down. Their distrust escalated into anger in late April, when they packed a meeting to fight xAI’s permit approval.

At the hearing, xAI senior manager Brent Mayo, clad in a black T-shirt and hat with the company logo, said its turbines would be equipped with technology to lower emissions, making it the “lowest-emitting facility in the country.”

After roughly a minute, several in the crowd began to chant, “People over property. People over property,” drowning him out.

The dirt roads, hogs and cotton fields that once made Boxtown feel more country than city are long gone. But the neighborhood still feels alive with history — both good and bad.

Older residents talk about how their ancestors settled here, building homes out of scraps of boxcars, which gave the area its name.

""They wanted something they could call their own,"" said Raymond C. Cheers, 74, a local historian, noting that some of the freedmen who lived in Boxtown are now buried in a cemetery there at Mount Pisgah Baptist Church.

As a child growing up in the then-unincorporated Boxtown, Brenda Odell, now 76 and retired from a career in education, remembers going down with her family to check out the site of a future power plant.

It was the Jim Crow South, but Odell said there was a sense of hope around the Allen Fossil Plant. Yet, as she reached adulthood, many in the community still lacked electricity, even after Boxtown was annexed by Memphis. And by the time the Tennessee Valley Authority decommissioned the facility in 2018, millions of tons of hazardous coal ash were left behind.

“Everybody was excited, you know,” she said. “And now they’re having to take the coal away.”

Other businesses have come to South Memphis, leaving pollution in their wake. A facility that sterilized medical equipment closed shortly before xAI’s arrival, after the EPA found a heightened cancer risk in the area due to the plant's ethylene oxide emissions. Sterilization Services of Tennessee said at the time it had “never been out of compliance” with local, state and federal regulations and had issues relating to a lease extension before it closed.

KeShaun Pearson, president of Memphis Community Against Pollution, says the neighborhood, whose zip code has a median income just under $37,000, is sometimes seen as an easy target.

“They always come to southwest Memphis,” Pearson said. “They always come to what they believe is the path of least resistance.”

Shelby County, which includes Boxtown, leads the state in emergency room visits for asthma. One study found that Southwest Memphis has at least 22 local pollution sources and a cumulative cancer risk four times higher than the national average. Last month, the county received an “F” from the American Lung Association for its air quality.

Dr. Christie Michael, an associate professor with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, who oversees a program for high-risk pediatric asthma patients at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital, said any additional pollution is too much.

“If we’re already struggling in Shelby County to meet the EPA standards, and we haven’t been,” she said, “regardless of how responsible this is, it’s not going to help.”

When xAI first launched its chatbot in 2023, it described Grok as an edgier AI, with a “bit of wit” and a “rebellious streak.” But training Grok to answer quickly and accurately requires massive computing power, roughly 200,000 graphics processing units housed in a facility whose main building is the size of 13 football fields.

By using a shuttered Electrolux factory, Musk was able to bring Colossus online in just 122 days and double its size in less than a year, giving his artificial intelligence company, xAI, a competitive advantage.

In a webinar, a consultant for xAI said the turbines the company used were intended to be temporary and did not need a permit for their first year of use, a view endorsed by the mayor, the health department and the Chamber of Commerce.

Environmental advocates disagree. “Not getting a permit from day one was circumvention,” said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. “And we’re certainly concerned that it’s going to continue.”

“xAI’s operations comply with all applicable laws,” the company said in a statement, adding that it intended to use “Lowest Achievable Emission Rate” turbines and relegate stationary turbines “to a backup power role, which will further reduce emissions” once another power source is available later this year.

Boxtown residents hoping to question Musk himself haven’t had a chance — he hasn’t appeared at any community meetings.

Sitting on her front porch with her friend Easter Knox, Gladney mulled over what she’d say to him. “What was the rush?” she said she’d ask.

“Did you even know that this community has already been fighting, and has all these polluters surrounding us?”

In its January application, xAI included a 19-page “environmental justice review,” arguing that the project was safe. The scope was limited to the nonresidential area closest to the facility, leaving out nearby communities like Boxtown.

Shaolei Ren, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, who has studied the health costs of data centers, said emissions’ risks can be far reaching.

“A lot of people think if they are not living next to the emission sources, they are not affected by the air pollutant,” he said. “That’s not true because these air pollutants can really travel hundreds of miles, and they are not limited by the state lines or county lines.”

At the request of the mayor’s office, Chunrong Jia, a professor of environmental health at the University of Memphis, used xAI’s data to model the potential impact of running 15 turbines for Colossus, if approved, and projected its emissions were unlikely to threaten local air quality for residents. But Jia’s analysis was based on data provided by xAI rather than on independent air monitoring.

“The modeling results were preliminary,” Jia said. “We still had a lot of uncertainty, a huge uncertainty behind that modeling process.”

In an interview last week, Young said he planned to work with Jia to implement air monitoring in the coming months.

Days before the public hearing in April, some residents received anonymous mailers with the message: “Breathe Easy, Memphis!” equating xAI’s emissions to those of a neighborhood gas station.

But local residents remain skeptical. Toward the end of the hearing, Alexis Humphreys, a 27-year-old who lives in Boxtown, asked those in the room with asthma to raise their hands, as she held up her inhaler. Her mother and her 87-year-old grandmother have it too, she said.

“I can’t breathe at home, it smells like gas outside,” she said, about the existing pollution in the area, facing representatives of the Shelby County Health Department and Greater Memphis Chamber.

“How come I can’t breathe at home and y’all get to breathe at home?”

Though Boxtown has a legacy of environmental harm, it also has a tradition of activism.

Easter Knox moved to the area in 1977 after marrying her husband, Starry, and has come to be known to local children as “Mama Easter.”

Inside her home, she has a picture of Black men carrying the “I Am a Man” sign from the city’s 1968 sanitation strikes. Martin Luther King Jr. was in Memphis supporting the workers’ demands for safer working conditions when he was assassinated at the Lorraine Motel.

In Boxtown, Knox has seen echoes of the injustices he fought. In 2019, two companies announced plans to run a crude oil conduit, known as the Byhalia Pipeline, through the community, which activists saw as a threat to drinking water, though the companies denied it. Some families were sued in an effort to seize their land.

Knox and others protested the pipeline, and eventually, the oil and gas giants backed off.

She sees the battle with xAI as a similar one.

“It’s just sort of hard, you know, when people got money,” Knox said, wearing a mask because of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

She’s said she relies on her faith to stay positive and sees her activism as a gift to future generations.

“Hopefully when I’m gone and left the scene, they can continue to fight,” Knox said.

For now, xAI appears to be responding, at least to some extent. Through the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce, it announced plans to remove some of the turbines within two months.

And while the company recently acquired a 1-million-square-foot site in Whitehaven, the chamber said xAI would not be using gas turbines there.

Pearson will be watching closely. “Until we see all of the turbines removed from South Memphis, there’s nothing to celebrate, and there’s nothing to believe,” he said. “We believe facts down here.”

Gladney, a retired postal worker, has grown accustomed to living in a neighborhood that’s become a battleground in the fight for clean air.

Even before xAI moved in, she stopped walking as frequently in the neighborhood, which depending on the day, can smell like chemicals or sewage, she said.

“It’s really hard to continue to walk in a community where the unknown is going on,” Gladney said.

Still, she’s not willing to give up the fight. “Some people say, ‘Well, you know, why don’t y’all move?” she said. “And my question is, ‘Why don’t you move from where you live?’ If you keep moving, things will never change.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250510-triptych-memphis-boxtown-ch-1651-5897f3.jpg",N,,2025-05-16 10:10:36.513944
