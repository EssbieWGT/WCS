Its renewable materials are currently used by more than 100 global brands such as LVMH, Yeti and Procter & Gamble.

Eastman's 2025 Sustainability Report presents its advancements and ongoing efforts toward its climate and circularity objectives.

The organisation's climate strategy is central to its operations, with a primary goal of achieving net zero by 2050. This is supported by a decarbonisation plan that emphasises energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy sources.

Eastman has set a target to lower its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2035. To this end, Eastman has 50 active energy efficiency projects underway globally, including at its large manufacturing sites in Tennessee and Texas.

Eastman's climate strategy and decarbonisation

Eastman is focused on procuring renewable energy for its facilities and developing low-carbon technologies.

These include thermal batteries and carbon capture, which could be vital for decarbonising energy-intensive industrial processes and achieving substantial emissions reductions. The report highlights how material innovation is key to its strategy.

Mark Costa, CEO at Eastman, says: “As we continue to navigate a challenging global economic environment, we remain committed to a strategy built on growth through innovation that aligns with sustainability macro trends. That strategy is working and our focus on sustainable innovation is delivering our business results and reinforces our purpose to enhance the quality of life in a material way.

""Our 2025 Sustainability Report is an ideal place to learn more about our growth strategy and how material innovation is vital to building A Better Circle.”

Eastman is also developing material solutions that directly address its climate impact. One such solution is molecular recycling, which processes hard-to-recycle waste to produce new materials with up to 50% lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional methods.

Strategic partnerships in carbon capture

To further its climate objectives, Eastman is engaging in strategic partnerships.

Its involvement with the Global Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Institute connects it with governments, corporations, research bodies and NGOs. This collaboration is designed to share best practices and promote scientific advancements in carbon capture technology.

According to Eastman's report, carbon capture and storage solutions could be instrumental in reducing emissions, particularly from heavy industry.

One of Eastman’s primary objectives is to establish a circular economy for plastics. Eastman has a goal to recycle at least 500 million pounds of plastic waste each year by 2030. This amount is equivalent to preventing 22 billion single-use water bottles from entering landfills.

Chris Killian, Chief Sustainability Officer at Eastman, says: “Eastman has the opportunity to make a substantial positive impact through better, more sustainable materials. We can help solve global issues like plastic waste through circular plastics and biodegradable cellulosic polymers that reduce environmental impact.

""For the sake of future generations, product innovation in the materials industry must be more sustainable.”

Molecular recycling and the circular economy

Unlike traditional mechanical recycling, which cannot process many everyday items like carpets, polyester clothing or coloured PET bottles, Eastman’s molecular recycling technology can. This process breaks down these complex waste products to create its Renew materials.

These materials are supplied to global manufacturing markets and are indistinguishable from plastics made from virgin resources.

The report states that “the world needs molecular recycling and mechanical recycling working in tandem to reduce waste”.

Eastman operates the world’s largest polyester molecular recycling facility at its site in Kingsport, Tennessee, which opened in March 2024. In its first year and a half of operation, the facility has recycled more than 100 million pounds of plastic waste.

Eastman is also collaborating with recycling firms globally to improve recycling infrastructure, aiming to keep more plastic out of landfills.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/3fc4a57de8a74f35a0563a8da1ce9ff6:c78bb4ef13f5a2a669f39e659389ca4f/1615221489856-e-1766016000-v-beta-t-lgf5fkp1xhk1djgnfh8jfkzb2y39-vjnyfvrdusgwo.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 21:58:48.556178

Two hours later, Gov. Josh Stein said he too is opposed to the increase, citing family affordability issues.

Less than two weeks ago, the Charlotte-based utility giant filed a revised rate request for 15% over two years with the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Duke Energy said demand for electric power is rising at an unprecedented pace, and critical grid upgrades are needed for reliability, to protect against severe weather and to support North Carolina’s continued growth.

The filing would affect both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress customers, covering much of the state. Combined the company has more than 4.5 million customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.

Duke Energy has said the proposed rate hikes will increase reliability through power grid updates for the growing state, including new businesses that are mainly manufacturing facilities. More electricity-hungry data centers also are expanding in the Carolinas, fueled by the boom in AI that requires lots of power.

“With costs rising everywhere, it’s important we take a close look at Duke Energy’s proposed rate increase to ensure it is necessary,” Jackson said in a statement. “My office is intervening to make sure we find the right balance between investing in our energy infrastructure and protecting North Carolinians’ wallets.”

Jackson’s office sent a news release to reporters about the move with the message header: “Attorney General Jeff Jackson Intervenes to Fight Duke Energy Rate Increases.”

The issue of affordability is one that continues to resonate nationally as well as locally, with politicians on both sides of the aisle seeking to claim the mantle of helping consumers.

Stein thanked Jackson for intervening. In a news release, the governor added, “Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike is simply too high and comes as the company is also retreating on more affordable clean energy.

“At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we should be doing everything we can to make life more affordable, not less,” Stein said.

When asked to comment on Jackson’s and Stein’s statements, Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton told The Charlotte Observer: “We do not take any requests to increase rates lightly, knowing that our investments to meet North Carolina’s growing energy needs will be carefully evaluated by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the public, and interveners such as customer advocates and the attorney general.

“We look forward to continuing the constructive dialog of all parties as the review moves forward next year,” Norton said.

Jackson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

Duke Energy Carolinas serves the western half of the state, including Charlotte. Duke Energy Progress operates in the eastern half, including the Triangle region.

About Duke Energy’s proposed rate hike

Duke Energy customer rate increases would begin Jan. 1, 2027, with a second increase the next year, if approved by the utilities commission.

For Duke Energy Carolinas customers, the monthly bill would increase by $17.22 in 2027 and by $6.34 in 2028. In the first year, that would take average bills from $144.98 to $162.20. In 2028, the average monthly bill would be $168.54

For Duke Energy Progress customers, bills would increase by $23.11 in 2027 and by $6.59 in 2028. That would take the monthly bill in the first year from $163.84 to $186.95. In 2028, the average monthly bill would be $193.54.

Commercial and industrial customers would also experience rate increases.

From 2027 to 2028, commercial customers for Duke Energy Carolinas will see increases of 8.7% and 3.9%. Industrial customers will see 6.3% and 3.4%. On the Progress side, commercial hikes will be about 9.2% and 4.6%. Industrial will be around 7.4% and 4.3%.

The utility commission’s decision is expected in late 2026 following public hearings.

Critical minerals also get priority treatment when it comes to land use and permitting decisions, including on national public lands.
During the Biden administration, the FAST-41 program was expanded to include critical minerals projects, using the USGS list to determine eligibility.","On November 7, 2025, the Trump administration published its updated list of critical minerals. This update added ten new minerals to the U.S. Geological Survey’s critical minerals list, including copper, uranium, silver, and metallurgical coal. The inclusion of these minerals on the list for the first time makes it clear that the Trump administration is using the list to advance its agenda of prioritizing resource extraction over all other uses of our national public lands. Designating these minerals as ‘critical’ paves the way for land use and permitting decisions that will negatively impact Western public lands and wildlife habitats for decades to come.

What is the critical minerals list and why does it matter?

The Energy Act of 2020 defined critical minerals and specified a process and criteria for the U.S. Geological Survey (part of the Interior department) to develop and update the official critical minerals list. The law states that to be considered critical, a mineral must be essential to U.S. economic or national security, have a supply chain vulnerable to disruption, and be essential to manufacturing a product that is important to economic or national security. The law also specifically states that fuel minerals are not eligible for inclusion on the list. The list must be updated at least every three years, and the Trump administration has pledged to update it at least every two years. (In addition to Interior’s critical minerals list, the U.S. Department of Energy also maintains a critical materials list, which includes the critical minerals as well as additional materials that are vulnerable to supply chain disruption and essential to energy technologies specifically.)

Once a mineral is designated as critical, it can qualify for heightened consideration in areas such as U.S. defense and trade policy. Projects involving critical minerals can qualify for federal funding opportunities such as research and development grants, priority funding for mapping, and Defense Production Act investments. Critical minerals also get priority treatment when it comes to land use and permitting decisions, including on national public lands. In particular, critical minerals mining and processing projects are eligible for the “FAST-41” program. This program, so called because it was created by Section 41 of the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, was originally established during the Obama administration to streamline permitting for infrastructure projects.

During the Biden administration, the FAST-41 program was expanded to include critical minerals projects, using the USGS list to determine eligibility. The Biden administration permitted two critical minerals projects—the South32 Hermosa mine in Arizona and the Stibnite mine in Idaho—through the FAST-41 program. The Trump administration has since added several more mining projects to the program. The expansion of FAST-41 beyond what Congress intended in order to include mining projects is concerning. Mining on national public lands is governed by the Mining Law of 1872, which predates the nation’s environmental laws. The Mining Law grants sweeping rights to claim-holders; once established, these rights can last for decades and prevent other uses of public lands. The impacts of mining also can last for decades, and can damage drinking water sources, wildlife habitats, and other irreplaceable natural resources. This makes mining unlike transportation infrastructure and unsuited for a program intended to streamline infrastructure development in already-impacted and developed areas of the country. The mine permitting process is often the only opportunity the government and the public have to protect public lands and the species and communities that depend on them from the negative impacts of mines, such as pollution, water usage, loss of recreation access, and habitat damage. Speeding up this process limits these opportunities to balance multiple uses of our national public lands and threatens these resources we all depend on.

What’s new in the latest update?

The 2025 critical minerals list adds ten materials not previously included. Notable among the additions: copper, uranium, and coal.

Copper, often in the form of wires, is essential to many forms of technology. Its inclusion on the critical minerals list is inappropriate because the U.S. already has significant stockpiles of copper. However, designating copper as critical could help speed up permitting for domestic copper mining projects, such as the Resolution copper mine at Oak Flat in Arizona on land sacred to the San Carlos Apache Tribe.

The addition of uranium is even more inappropriate since the Energy Act of 2020 specifies that fuel minerals may not be included on the critical minerals list. (Uranium is the fuel for nuclear reactors.) To justify adding uranium, the USGS pointed to President Donald Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, signed January 20, 2025, which directed USGS to consider whether uranium could be included on the list. As with copper, designating uranium as critical is likely intended to help boost domestic uranium mining, which in turn would support an expansion of nuclear power in the U.S. A handful of uranium projects, including the Velvet Wood mine near Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the Pinyon Plain mine near the Grand Canyon in Arizona, are already moving forward. Velvet Wood is especially notable because it was touted by the Interior department as the first project to be permitted under a new fast-tracked Interior department process that compresses environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act to a mere 14 days. (This is separate from FAST-41, which expedites permitting.)

Perhaps the biggest stretch is the addition of coal to the critical minerals list. As with uranium, coal should be ineligible for inclusion since it is a fuel mineral, and the law that established the critical minerals list specifically excludes fuel minerals from the list. Rather than follow the law, the USGS relied on a Trump executive order, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” signed April 8, 2025, which directed USGS to consider adding metallurgical coal to the critical minerals list. There are several different types of coal, and metallurgical coal is the type that is suitable for use in steel production. (Thermal coal, also referred to as steam coal, is the type that is used in power plants. While metallurgical coal can also be used in power plants, it is usually more expensive. Thermal coal cannot be used in steel production.) Designating metallurgical coal as critical could help bolster both metallurgical coal mining and a domestic market for metallurgical coal in the U.S. by making projects that use metallurgical coal eligible for federal funding opportunities and expedited permitting. (Currently, the majority of metallurgical coal mined in the U.S. is exported.) However, it is also another example of disregard for the law, which states that fuel minerals may not be designated as critical, to advance the Trump administration’s political agenda of propping up the dying coal industry.

What does this mean for public lands in the West?

President Trump’s “energy emergency,” his executive order to increase domestic mineral production, and the addition of copper, uranium, and coal to the critical minerals list present serious threats to national public lands, outdoor recreation access, and wildlife habitats in the West. The Trump administration’s policies are designed to prioritize mineral production over all other uses of national public lands. These policies have already resulted in the resurrection of zombie mines, such as the Velvet Wood mine, and disregard for Tribal sacred sites, such as the Resolution copper project at Oak Flat in Arizona. Many more projects are already being fast-tracked, guaranteeing more damage to public lands and wildlife habitats in the years to come. Even when mining ceases, the impacts of these projects will be felt for decades into the future, as the West has already seen over the past century.",https://westernpriorities.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/25134706586_9df777fb6b_k.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:58:38.087611

Juno Beard, assistant director of arts education for Stuart’s, said the opera house is supporting about 65 students this year and 11 bands.
Beard said with an increase in demand for students wishing to join the music program, there is a limited amount of space, meaning several students work as the bands practice around them.
Adam Remnant, director of arts education for Stuart’s, said acoustic treatment makes it easier for students to hear what is being played.","Giving Tuesday is a day for those all over the world, including Ohio University Bobcats, to share their generosity and support for those in the community.

Multiple organizations and non-profits encourage the public to donate and support various causes. This year, Bobcats have the opportunity to support the environment and local students through Giving Tuesday fundraisers.

At Jackie O’s Taproom, located at 25 Campbell St., residents and students are invited to Pints with a Purpose, hosted by Stuart’s Opera House in support of its after school music and audio program. The music program was implemented for students in the area in need of an artistic outlet to share their love of music and performance.

Juno Beard, assistant director of arts education for Stuart’s, said the opera house is supporting about 65 students this year and 11 bands.

Beard said with an increase in demand for students wishing to join the music program, there is a limited amount of space, meaning several students work as the bands practice around them.

Beard also said the rooms are large and create an echo, which might affect the songwriting process.

“So when you have really loud amps or drums (and) students trying to play their song or get the full experience of their song, it can be really difficult to hear,” Beard said.

To combat this issue, Tuesday’s event is raising money for acoustic treatment for Stuart’s practice and recording rooms. Acoustic treatment, the process of improving sound quality in a space, ensures sound waves are reflected correctly, according to Audiophiles. Adam Remnant, director of arts education for Stuart’s, said acoustic treatment makes it easier for students to hear what is being played.

“It makes it so that music and sound isn't bouncing off the surfaces of the walls and ceiling and floor as much, which just makes it a more conducive listening environment,” Remnant said. “Which will benefit the students, will benefit the staff. It'll just make everything sound better.”

From every featured pint of beer from Jackie O’s, $1 is donated to Stuart’s and guests have additional opportunities throughout the night to donate directly to their fund.

Evan Seurkamp, AMP alum and instructor and member of the Laughing Chimes band, is performing, followed by Carter Tinkham, current AMP student, a solo performer and songwriter with a country adjacent sound. Beard and Remnant are also performing in their band Shirt Brothers.

“We are going to play a couple of original songs and maybe one cover,” Beard said. “It’ll be short … but just an extra thing to make it a fun evening and encourage people to get out and donate for Giving Tuesday.”

Locals can also give back Tuesday by supporting the Athens Conservancy, a non-profit land trust protecting wild land and biodiversity in the environment. The Conservancy strives to protect its 3,200 acres of land, and have partnered with the city and county to protect 300 acres of public land.

The non-profit had $5,032,824 in assets at the end of 2021, with $273,974 from contributions and grants. It is matching all donations dollar for dollar to its Bluebell fund. Dollars raised helps pay for university student’s summer internships, guided hikes, outreach programs, land acquisition and stewardship and invasive-plant removal.

Kate Kelley, president of the Conservancy, said donations will help acquire land from owners who want to protect the natural environment on their property. Kelley said the Conservancy focuses on protecting watersheds and forested areas because they are important for public health and carbon sequestration, the long-term storage of carbon in plants, soils, geologic formations and the ocean.

“(Carbon sequestration) is very important for buffering the effects of climate change,” Kelley said.

Kelley highlighted the importance and impact the Conservancy’s interns have, and said they make a positive impact in their local areas. Kelley said engaging young minds makes a difference and it is essential to have the funds to support them.

“People out of town can visit and feel what it feels like to be in a mature forest,” Kelley said. “You can see the use of your dollars in terms of carbon sequestration, and you can go out and enjoy it. It's not something far away that you'll never see, you'll never enjoy. This is right here, and everyone has access to our preserves.”

Canadian Solar will own 75.1 percent of each JV, which will run the solar manufacturing assets through a leasing model. For Canadian Solar, founded by Chinese origin Dr. Shawn Qu, the perception battle has been an ongoing effort, with many assuming that the firm is a Chinese firm, when it is clearly not. The latest move goes further to derisk the firm's operations from action against Chinese owned firms in the US.

The three facilities to be part of the JV are a solar wafer plant, a battery factory, and an energy storage manufacturing site that is still under construction.

The China listed CSI will receive a one-time payment of CNY352 million (USD49.8 million) based on an asset valuation of CNY469 million. Post deal, CSI will focus on non-US markets exclusively.

CSI also plans to provide Canadian Solar with a counter-guarantee limit of upto CNY44.6 billion (USD6.3 billion) to support the latter in providing performance and financing guarantees for CSI and its holding subsidiaries. CSI was listed on the Shanghai stock exchange in 2023, at the height of the boom in solar stocks in China, which has subsequently ebbed after the downturn caused by over capacity and low prices.

TVA, the nation's largest government-owned utility, reapplied for the $800 million funding opportunity in April after President Donald Trump's administration revised the grant criteria to remove diversity, equity and inclusion requirements in the original grant announced under former President Joe Biden's administration. TVA and its partners originally applied in January.

The two recipients of $400 million each, TVA and Holtec Government Services, were announced Tuesday.

TVA led a team of partners to apply for the grant funding, including Bechtel, BWX Technologies and the state of Tennessee. The funding is meant to assist companies working to build the next generation of nuclear reactors, which the Trump administration has tied to artificial intelligence leadership.

The TVA reactors could be the first small modular reactors in the U.S. In May, the federal utility became the first power company to apply for a construction permit for a small modular reactor. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission could approve construction by the end of 2026.

Small modular reactors are designed to be smaller, safer and more financially feasible than large, traditional nuclear power plants.

The first TVA reactor in Oak Ridge will cost around $5.4 billion to build, according to a draft of the utility's long-term energy plan. The cost would go down with each new reactor, TVA officials have said.

""This award affirms TVA's continued leadership in shaping the nation's nuclear energy future,"" Don Moul, TVA president and CEO, said in a press release. ""With (the Department of Energy's) support and the strength of our partners, we're accelerating the deployment of next-generation nuclear -- reducing financial risk to consumers and strengthening U.S. energy security. This is how we deliver reliable, affordable energy and real opportunity for American families.""

CELEBRATING AWARD

The grant is a critical source of funding for the self-funded utility, which operates under a legal debt limit of $30 billion, set by Congress in 1979 and never adjusted for inflation. TVA ended its fiscal year Sept. 30 with $23.8 billion of debt.

TVA generated a record $13.7 billion in revenue in 2025, with $1.4 billion in net income after expenses. The utility is building more than 3,500 megawatts of new power generation, enough for more than 2 million homes, mostly from natural gas plants.

Holtec, the other grant recipient, plans to build two reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan. Both projects use Generation III nuclear technologies, which have similar designs to existing nuclear plants.

Since moving to Asheville in 2004, Judy Mattox has been on a mission to protect the mountains of Western North Carolina. “Asheville is just ‘take-your-heart,’” she says. A lover of hiking and gardening, Mattox decided to increase her knowledge of the natural world and how to care for it by joining the local chapter of the Sierra Club in 2007. In 2010, she was voted WNC Sierra Club chair. “I do the little piece that I can do, although sometimes, it’s not that little.”

Mattox explains that the Sierra Club has a multitude of goals for WNC, centering around protecting natural resources, fighting the effects of climate change, and educating the public on how they can get involved. She goes on to say that a large portion of their work revolves around local politics. “Our main bottom line is to affect elections, to affect good environmental candidates to safeguard the state,” Mattox says, stating that the Sierra Club endorses the environmentally-minded candidates across the entire NC ticket, and makes sure the voters are informed on who those candidates are. In the last election, the club handed out over 40,000 endorsement cards to voters. “We have the ear of a lot of people. They’re turning to us, going, ‘Who do we vote for?’”

The WNC Sierra Club has tackled a wide variety of environmentally-related issues. In 2020, they helped to shut down the Duke Energy coal-fueled power plant at Lake Julian. Along with partner Southern Environmental Law, they fought to establish zoning laws and ordinances for steep slope developments to prevent runoff into the river, and to protect farmland from being bought out by big developers. They also helped to pass dark sky ordinances to reduce light pollution and protect the migrating birds, as well as noise ordinances to ban crypto-mining (which she says can create jet engine level noise) in WNC. Currently, they are championing the cause Plastic-Free WNC to outlaw single-use plastics. On the first Wednesday of every month, the club holds a public program covering a range of topics from Reducing Your Carbon Footprint to Birding and Wildflowers. “There’s never any lack of things to be involved with,” Mattox says of the club’s many good works. “I haven’t slept well in fourteen years.”

A recent WNC Sierra Club accomplishment that Mattox is particularly proud of is joining with high school students across Buncombe County to petition the county to approve a goal to have 100% renewable energy by 2042. In December 2017, based on the students’ testimonies, the county changed their vote and passed the resolution. “Kids are powerful,” Mattox remarks. She goes on to say that the WNC Sierra Club’s award-winning Kids Adventure Club starts early in educating children to appreciate the natural world around them. The club takes young people on hikes and trips to the NC Arboretum, and hosts kids’ programs on birds, trees and snakes. “You gotta teach kids to love nature. They’re the best reason of all to get involved.”

When Hurricane Helene hit WNC last year, the WNC Sierra Club was needed even more. They partnered with MountainTrue, RiverLink, and Asheville GreenWorks, to repair the local ecosystem with efforts like live-staking the eroded stream beds, and giving away free trees to plant. They also helped educate the public about what effects the storm actually had on the trees and forests. Mattox comments that the people who live in Asheville feel that it is their duty to protect its natural resources, and that it has one of the largest number of environmental groups in the country. “Pretty much everywhere I go, everybody I meet wants to protect our mountains, wants clean air and clean water,” she says, commenting on how rewarding it has been to see their club’s meeting attendance grow in the past few years. “We have 1.1 million acres of forest surrounding us, which is why a lot of us are here; it’s beautiful.”

In 2024, Mattox and the club’s political chair Ken Brame were awarded the Environmental Champion of the Year by the WNC Rotary Club. She also received an award in 2020 for the Adventure Club program. Mattox says that her favorite aspect of her work as club chair is that she gets to bring all of these different groups together to talk about the best options for the environment, and that she hopes her own charm, humor and directness serve her role well. “It’s really fun when things are successful,” Mattox says. “All of this takes forever, so you just keep trying, keep trying.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-02 19:02:08.697084

Brent Woodall, who is challenging Beeker in the 2026 Republican primary, told 1819 News the action was an example of “the tail wagging the dog.” “Why is the Public Service Commission not the one who is laying out what needs to happen?
That is something that the Public Service Commission is supposed to be providing leadership on and in this case it seems like the tail is wagging the dog,” Woodall said.
I’m sure they’re looking at Georgia and it’s giving them some concern, but again the Public Service Commission we need people that are leading the way, not following.","Members of the Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC) approved on Tuesday a two-year rate freeze proposed by Alabama Power in a recent filing.

The PSC regulates utility companies in Alabama.

Commissioner Jeremy Oden said in a statement after the vote on Tuesday, ""The high cost of living is hurting the quality of life of every Alabamian, and Alabama Power’s commitment to keep rates flat for two years is a win for ratepayers.”

“Biden’s war on American energy is over, and President Trump is ushering in the golden age of American energy dominance,” he added. “But undoing Biden’s radical and reckless policies takes time, and I appreciate Alabama Power’s responsiveness to the Public Service Commission’s immediate and primary objective: providing much-needed relief to Alabama families and ratepayers. I’m proud of the work my fellow commissioners and I put into bringing everyone to the table and pushing for real, practical solutions that make energy more affordable.""

Commissioner Chris Beeker said, “Alabama Power’s announcement that it will seek to keep utility rates flat for the next two years brings welcome relief at a time when all of us are struggling with the inflation hangover created by the Biden administration and woke initiatives like the Green New Deal.”

“Every member of the Public Service Commission sent strong signals that any request for a rate increase would be a non-starter because too many families across Alabama are already finding it difficult to make ends meet, and consumers need relief,” he continued. “We appreciate the fact that our message was received, understood, and accommodated. During his first term in office, President Trump built the greatest, strongest, and most successful economy in our nation’s history, and as a proud MAGA Republican, I know he will repair the economic damage Biden left behind, restore affordability to our everyday lives, and make America great again. At the same time, I’ll stand shoulder-to-shoulder with President Trump to stop committed communists and socialists like AOC, Bernie Sanders, and Zohran Mamdani from destroying the capitalist system that built the greatest nation history has ever known.""

Brent Woodall, who is challenging Beeker in the 2026 Republican primary, told 1819 News the action was an example of “the tail wagging the dog.”

“Why is the Public Service Commission not the one who is laying out what needs to happen? Why is it that the utilities are going to the PSC, saying ‘Here’s what we’ll do’ in response to these reports and also I think to Sen. (Katie) Britt’s comments about high rates that Alabamians pay. That is something that the Public Service Commission is supposed to be providing leadership on and in this case it seems like the tail is wagging the dog,” Woodall said. “I’m sure that they’ve got concerns about what is coming. You mentioned Georgia. That’s two (PSC) seats that flipped to the Democrat Party. They’ve got to be looking from Georgia to Alabama, saying ‘Well, what’s going to take place here?’”

He continued, ""It goes back to: why do we have the difference in rates between Georgia and Alabama? WBRC reported that Alabama has the third-highest electric bills in the nation behind Hawaii and Connecticut. With that being the case, why would our rates be that high compared to Georgia and the other southern states? The answer that you receive from the Public Service Commission quite frequently when you ask those questions is, ‘Well, it gets hot in Alabama.’ Well, it gets hot in Georgia and Mississippi and Louisiana and Florida. I’m sure they’re looking at Georgia and it’s giving them some concern, but again the Public Service Commission we need people that are leading the way, not following.

“I think the people of Alabama are going to see this vote for what it is. It is an act being carried out by the commissioners because they are concerned about their position. I don’t think that they are going to be successful in what they are trying to do which is keep Alabamians from realizing just what a poor job the commissioners have been doing over the last several years,"" Woodall said.

Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry, who is challenging Oden in the Republican primary in 2026, told 1819 News on Tuesday, “It’s ironic that the timing is five months before the election that’s coming up.”

“When you’re in a position like the Public Service Commission…it’s your job to take care of the citizens, it’s your job to take care of the businesses and make sure that there’s balance for them to be successful. It’s your job to work hand in hand for economic development (and) growth but also make sure that our citizens are taken care of and it’s your job to be a voice for them,” Gentry said.

As expectations and urgency grow on both fronts, innovators are discovering ways not only to bring them closer together, but to make them accelerate one another.

With 74% of organisations targeting net zero by 2040, AI is fast becoming core infrastructure for tackling decarbonisation at the necessary speed and scale.

Addressing this dual challenge and opportunity, Siemens has released a report, From Pilots to Performance: How Industrial AI is Helping to Scale Sustainability Impact, produced in partnership with Reuters Events. The study covers 263 senior sustainability leaders, conducted in the third quarter of 2025.

What the numbers show

The report reveals that almost two-thirds of organisations have moved past proof-of-concept into live industrial AI deployments focused on sustainability.

“Climate change, biodiversity loss, population growth require customers to embrace energy transition, circularity transition and societal changes at the same time,"" says Eva Riesenhuber, Global Head of Sustainability at Siemens.

“The complexity of juggling global interconnected system transitions in times of major disruptions can only be mastered with AI.”

Energy management leads the way

Energy management has emerged as the most advanced application area, with 65% of organisations deploying industrial AI solutions in this field. The technology is proving especially effective in optimising energy use across assets and processes, with 52% of respondents citing it as the primary way AI will help reach sustainability targets. Real-world projects highlight the environmental upside.​

In the Netherlands, Alliander – the electricity and gas network operator serving 3.5 million customers – has adopted Siemens’ Gridscale X platform to support the energy transition. The software delivers real-time visibility via a digital twin of the grid, enabling up to a 30% increase in grid utilisation without new physical infrastructure. This added capacity is also allowing more renewable generation to come online.​

Data centres and cooling innovation

In Estonia, Greenergy Data Centers has rolled out Siemens’ White Space Cooling Optimization control system at its site near Tallinn.

The solution uses dense sensor networks to constantly track temperature and airflow, automatically fine-tuning cooling equipment to actual demand.

“When we first launched the system, it improved our efficiency by approximately 30% at the push of a button,” Kert Evert, Chief Development Officer at Greenergy Data Centers, says.

“But this was just the beginning, because the system learns, adapts and improves over time.”

Beyond boosting efficiency, AI is helping to advance circularity and resource productivity. Around 60% of organisations are using AI for resource efficiency management, while 43% apply it to improve waste handling. At the same time, predictive maintenance solutions designed to extend asset life and cut material use have been adopted by 60% of organisations.​

AI for circular product design

At the product level, AI is enabling sustainability criteria to be built into design workflows from day one. Some 63% of organisations report using generative design for physical products, helping teams optimise for material use and embedded carbon at the outset.

Eryn Devola, Head of Sustainability at Digital Industries, a division within Siemens, says AI tools are making sustainable design practical without overwhelming engineering teams.

“It’s now easier to say, ‘While we’re working on this design, let’s also address resource efficiency and carbon footprint.’

“Today, we can model these factors and embed them into decision-making to achieve the right trade-offs without adding major effort for engineering.

“And we can go further: since we’re already touching the design, we should also explore how to dematerialise, reduce size, increase modularity, etc.

“These are all key factors that contribute to creating a truly sustainable product for the long term,” she says.

Lighter robotics and cleaner glass

Siemens has showcased these capabilities with lightweight robot grippers produced from a lower-carbon polymer. The grippers weigh under 2kg and account for just 30kg of CO₂ emissions from cradle to gate, versus 670kg for traditional metal grippers weighing close to 50kg. According to the company, upgraded production lines using these components have cut energy use by around half and reduced CO₂ emissions by more than three tonnes.​

Automation Innovation, a specialist in glass production equipment, has also applied AI-powered analytics and digital twin technology to overhaul mould cleaning. The new automated system has saved 700,000 tons of raw materials annually, trimmed on-site energy demand by 30% and avoided nearly one billion kilograms of CO₂ emissions so far, while eliminating the need for hazardous cleaning chemicals.​

Rising confidence in AI’s impact

Confidence in industrial AI as a lever for the energy transition is rising sharply. The share of respondents expecting a high or medium positive impact on accelerating the energy transition climbed from 42% in 2024 to 71% in 2025. Separately, 59% say they are already using AI to help decarbonise operations, according to the Siemens Infrastructure Transition Monitor 2025.​

Brooke Tvermoes, Director of Climate, Energy and Environment at IBM’s Chief Sustainability Office, says: “We implemented AI in our manufacturing operations and the focus was actually to help improve product quality and yield.

“But by doing that we also reduced waste and energy consumption. That’s a tangible result with real dollar values associated with it, which resonates with people.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/f96bd8e5eebe9be636445d38497c295d:65e74f160662555d4c2dda13a5b9a266/eva-riesenhuber-global-head-of-sustainability-at-siemens.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 21:58:52.524277

""This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect good-paying Michigan jobs.""","A plan to install two modular nuclear reactors in Michigan got a big boost Tuesday when the federal government announced funding to support it.

The Department of Energy will contribute $400 million for the project, which Holtec International unveiled two years ago. The 300-megawatt reactors, which could be the first of their kind in the U.S., would be built at the site of the closed $800-megawatt Palisades nuclear power plant that Holtec is reopening.

""President (Donald) Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,"" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a news release. ""Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President's manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.""

The Trump administration also will back the Tennessee Valley Authority with $400 million to advance the deployment of a small modular reactor in Tennessee and to accelerate the addition of more units.

Jupiter, Florida-based Holtec has targeted a mid-2030 commissioning date for the novel reactors in Van Buren County's Covert Township. They would have a capacity of up to 300 megawatts per unit, which is about a third of what a traditional reactor produces. They are a tenth to a quarter of the size and are modular, meaning they can be made in a factory and installed on site and are less expensive.

Holtec called the DOE's announcement a ""major step forward.""

""Advancing the SMR-300 at Palisades will help deliver reliable power and long-term economic and job benefits to the region,"" spokesperson Nick Cupl said. ""We appreciate the strong support from our federal, state, and local partners, whose continued engagement makes this progress possible.""

Despite this, Hyundai is not backing down from its electrification strategy, which currently includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and will soon expand to include extended-range electric vehicles.

""Our EV strategy was never based on current policy because then you just have a timer until the next administration. We were building an EV plant and had an E-GMP platform prior to the IRA.

– Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America

CarBuzz spoke with Olabisi Boyle, senior vice president of product planning and mobility strategy for Hyundai Motor North America, at the 2025 Los Angeles Auto Show. We learned how the South Korean automaker currently sees itself in a major consumer shift with regard to who wants a new EV. This shift may require new products, new powertrains, and a rethink on how Hyundai prices its vehicles.

EV Sales Dropped Last Month, But Are Up Overall

You may undoubtedly read headlines about how EV sales are rapidly declining and almost no one is buying them anymore. We encourage you to read deeper and use critical thinking skills, as these headlines may be intentionally misleading to get your click. Glancing at Hyundai's sales report for November 2025, EV sales were indeed down compared to the same month in 2024. The 2026 Hyundai Ioniq 5 saw a 59% drop from last year, while the Ioniq 6 fell by 56%. There was not enough data for the Ioniq 9 in October 2024, and the Kona Electric is not separated from the gas model in Hyundai's sales report.

Seeing those huge negative changes compared to 2024 may seem like it spells doom for EV sales, but the numbers are already starting to level out. In fact, the November sales are up from October when the Ioniq 5 sold 1,642 units and the Ioniq 6 only moved 398 units; the Ioniq 9 remained relatively steady from last month's 317-unit pace. It's also important to look at the year-to-date sales, where the Ioniq 5 is up 12% compared to 2024 and, despite a rapidly slowing sedan market, the Ioniq 6 is down just 9%. EV sales overall are not growing as fast as they were previously, but they are not yet in decline.

Hyundai Was Ready Without The Credit

Hyundai was among the automakers most ready for the $7,500 tax credit to expire, as the Korean automaker almost immediately announced massive price cuts on its popular Ioniq 5 EV. Depending on the trim, the difference actually surpassed the amount you would have been given by the federal government (up to $9,800). This move was done intentionally to help cater to a new audience of EV buyers.

""Early EV consumers were new adopters, and now we've moved to the center of the (innovation adoption) curve. That middle of the curve is people who prioritize affordability and ease of use. We need to make sure EVs cater to them,"" Boyle explained. ""We look at it in advance and say, 'this is what the customer wants, but they will only want to pay this much in four or five years.' So we work internally with R&D to say the material cost is commonized in advance such that we can offer it at that price or readjust the options in our car.""

Even with a nearly $10,000 discount on the Ioniq 5, Boyle admits she knew October sales would not match Hyundai's lofty September numbers before the federal tax credit expired. For reference, the Ioniq 5 sold 8,408 units in September (a 152% change compared to the same month in 2024), its best sales month ever. ""A lot of people just wanted to get the credit before it went away. There was encouragement even from senators and lawmakers,"" she added.

EREVs Solve The Infrastructure Issue?

After affordability, Boyle sees infrastructure as the next major hurdle to overcome on the road to EV adoption. More chargers are a clear solution, but Hyundai believes there are other short-term answers that fit consumer's needs. ""What we've done as a strategy is a diversity of powertrains and flexibility in manufacturing: ICE, HEV, and battery EV. And now also we're saying EREV,"" she said.

""It's not a consumer issue, it's an infrastructure systems issue. It's not that I don't like EVs, it's if the infrastructure was there. That was a pain point for the middle of the curve. So you need a strategy to accommodate the middle of the curve.""

""People like to hear 'I can have a 600-mile range.' You can get that with EREV. That is a big motivator, especially if you are driving something like a truck,"" Boyle described. ""They are just looking for that max range, maybe if it's 150 or 200 miles (on electric), you can go without charging two or three days. I think it becomes more of a proposition the higher you get that all-electric range.""

It's unclear which Hyundai product will be the first to receive an EREV powertrain, but Boyle may have given a hint during our interview.

""EV-only is a tough sell, especially in pickup trucks. You don't get 600 miles. We just announced a midsize truck. Give us time.""

While Hyundai works on changing its lineup, the company is also working on improving existing infrastructure with its partnership in Ionna, a North American charging network that will soon challenge Tesla Superchargers. Hyundai is one of seven automakers invested in Ionna, helping to build DC fast-chargers across the country.

""We've only been a company for about 20 months, but we've contracted 4,000 charging bases across the US, 1,000 just in California. We plan to have 1,000 charging bays live by the end of the year,"" said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna. ""Everything we are deploying is 400 kilowatt charging: 40% NACS and 60% CCS, but we watch the market, and we can see queuing if we need to go back and make changes.""",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-hyundai-palisade-grille.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 18:03:21.215831

Coalition of Pro-Environment Legislators and Advocates Call for Passage of the Energy Leadership Act Bill During Lame Duck

Environmental champions in the Legislature joined with advocates from across the state today to ask the Senate Budget Committee to advance historic clean energy legislation at its Dec. 8 hearing.

The New Jersey Energy Leadership Act would put New Jersey on the path to 100% clean electricity by 2035. This landmark legislation is designed to lower electricity costs and create union jobs by quickly bringing locally produced renewable energy online to respond to the growing energy affordability crisis.

“Last month’s election provided a clear mandate for bold action to lower energy prices,” said New Jersey LCV Executive Director, Ed Potosnak. “The New Jersey Energy Leadership Act will put our state at the forefront of lowering electricity prices for working families while creating union jobs in growing clean energy industries. This legislation is the centerpiece of Governor Murphy’s environmental legacy, and the time to act is now.”

The press conference came after months of thorough discussions between Governor Murphy, legislators and key stakeholders to create the strongest possible legislation that creates union jobs, strengthens environmental justice protections and addresses skyrocketing energy prices.

“The New Jersey Clean Energy Act of 2024 is a critical step toward lowering utility bills and making our energy system more affordable for every family in our state,” said Assemblyman Robert J. Karabinchak (D-Middlesex). “By expanding clean, reliable power, this bill will help to stabilize energy costs while cutting emissions. It also creates strong consumer protections and supports good-paying jobs as we transition to a cleaner grid. This is the kind of forward-looking policy New Jersey needs, one that protects both our environment and our wallets.”

""Clean energy is an environmental issue and a kitchen table budget issue. Energy demands are escalating fast. More than 50 data centers have been built or approved to be built in New Jersey with 100 more applications expected in the near future. While we grapple with how to address these new development pressures, these data centers are driving demand and prices. Clean energy is the fastest energy we can build and bring to market. Clean energy is also the least expensive type of energy for New Jersey residents and businesses,"" said Jennifer M. Coffey, Executive Director Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions (ANJEC). ""Offshore wind and solar energy are also the cleanest forms of energy and will help us meet our climate change goals, which are incredibly important in the fastest warming state in the nation here in New Jersey.""

“Making 100% clean energy the law in New Jersey is not just an essential climate goal—it’s an investment in healthier communities, stronger local economies, and long-term reliable and affordable energy,"" said Patty Cronheim of ReThink Energy NJ. ""By balancing environmental responsibility with smart innovation, we can ensure a sustainable future that benefits every resident across the state and generations to come.""

Trenton must lead on this issue more than ever in the face of dangerous environmental rollbacks from President Trump and his MAGA allies in Washington — which are causing energy costs to skyrocket to further enrich oil and gas billionaires.

“The goal of 100% Clean Energy by 2035 is achievable, when we have humane leadership that considers the future of our planet, and will host all of our descendants with a healthy earth, that has clean air, clean water, and clean soil,” said Sharonda Allen, MPA, Chapter Co-Chair, Greater New Jersey Gateway Chapter of the Climate Reality Project. “This can be achieved by sourcing our energy from clean, green energy such as Solar, and the re-ignition of Offshore Wind here in New Jersey! Our geography is well-suited for smart energy production that will produce jobs and help to lower electricity costs for all New Jerseyans.”

At the same time, November’s elections underscored a clear mandate from voters to lower energy costs by investing in clean, renewable energy. This legislation would ensure New Jersey has access to cleaner and cheaper energy that can be built much more quickly than dirty fossil fuels.

“The Energy Leadership Act is the legislature’s chance to deliver on energy affordability for New Jerseyans, and we need it to become law right now. Each day, working families are bearing an energy burden created by Big Tech and our grid operator, PJM. This landmark legislation would put our state on a path toward alleviating that burden by expanding large-scale, cheap, and fast, clean energy generation. We urge Speaker Coughlin and Senate President Scutari to do what is right for New Jerseyans by securing our clean energy progress, clean our air, and bring costs down by passing the Energy Leadership Act. We now urge Senator Sarlo to post S237 on the Senate Budget.” Anjuli Ramos-Busot, NJ Sierra Club Director

“New Jersey is known for innovation, and that pioneering spirit should carry into our push for cleaner, cutting-edge forms of energy that protect people’s health, safeguard our environment, and lower costs,” said Senator Angela McKnight (D- Hudson). “Clean energy is cheaper and faster to develop than fossil fuels, and it has the power to improve affordability for families while rapidly expanding our in-state generation. We must pass the Energy Leadership Act to meet the energy needs of our state, strengthen our grid, and secure a more sustainable future for the next generation.”

""New Jersey has the opportunity to lead the nation in building a clean energy future. As a proud sponsor of this legislation, I know that promoting 100% clean energy isn’t just about protecting our environment. It’s about protecting our communities, our economy, and the generations to come.” Said Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D- Essex and Passaic).

“This is a defining moment for our state. Climate change is not some far-off threat—we already feel its effects as it devastates our communities with more frequent storms, extreme heat, and rising sea levels,” said Senator Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex/Mercer). “Governor Murphy’s vision for 100% clean energy by 2035 is an ambitious, yet necessary goal for New Jersey to mitigate these negative effects and help create a more sustainable planet. I commend the LCV and Sierra Club for leading the charge on this front.” Senator Linda Greenstein (D- Mercer and Middlesex).

“The finding that the revised standard so successfully prevented worker heat deaths is evidence that a clear, comprehensive workplace standard is an effective tool for saving lives,” said Michaels.
Donate Now California still had about 100 heat deaths a year from 2010 to 2020.
But applying the conservative estimate that worker deaths decreased by 33 percent after 2010, Dean said, suggests the stronger standard saved about 34 lives per year.
“We hope the federal government will implement a federal heat standard,” Dean said.","Last year was the hottest on record, but global warming isn’t just overheating the planet. It’s killing workers.

Now a new analysis of the impact of state-implemented outdoor heat standards on worker deaths adds to the growing body of scientific research showing that requiring employers to take simple precautions to prevent heat stress can reduce the risk of injury, illness and death from exposure to high temperatures on the job.

Similar precautions are included in the heat standard the Biden administration proposed last year, which the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is expected to finalize by early next year.

Under the proposed federal rule, employers must provide adequate water, rest and shade when the heat index—a measure of how humidity amplifies heat’s effects on the body—reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and take additional measures, such as providing paid 15-minute breaks every two hours, once the index reaches 90 degrees.

For nearly two decades, California was the only state to mandate such protections for outdoor workers. Over the past three years, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada, Oregon and Washington have passed similar rules.

In the new study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Health Affairs, labor policy experts compared heat-related deaths among outdoor workers in California, which adopted the nation’s first outdoor heat standard in 2005, with neighboring states that have similar climates but lacked a standard during the study period, from 1999 through 2020.

Critics argued that the 2005 standard was not actively enforced and its ambiguous wording allowed employers to skirt requirements. In keeping with those critiques, the researchers saw a drop in worker deaths relative to the surrounding states only after 2010, when the state enhanced enforcement and subsequently strengthened requirements to ensure workers had access to water, shade, breaks and emergency services during hot days.

The California standard became increasingly effective over time, said study author Adam Dean, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University, while worker deaths in the neighboring states of Arizona, Nevada and Oregon increased.

“After 2010, we’re finding a statistically significant association between the heat standard and heat-related outdoor deaths,” said Dean, meaning that the effect seen was not due to chance.

And there was a significant drop in heat-related deaths after stronger enforcement was implemented, Dean said, calling the observed 33 percent reduction in deaths “a conservative estimate.”

California officials ramped up enforcement of the heat standard starting in 2010 by increasing workplace inspections, issuing more citations for violations and expanding educational outreach to both employers and workers.

“The study’s methods are sound and its results are of great importance, documenting the life-saving impact of a comprehensive workplace heat standard,” said epidemiologist David Michaels, a professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health and a former top OSHA administrator who was not involved in the study.

“The finding that the revised standard so successfully prevented worker heat deaths is evidence that a clear, comprehensive workplace standard is an effective tool for saving lives,” said Michaels.

Undercounting Heat Deaths

Far too many workers are getting sick and dying from preventable heat-related illnesses, former OSHA deputy assistant secretary Jordan Barab said in formal comments in October as the agency considered a heat standard more than 50 years after government scientists first recommended one.

“And because of severe undercounting,” Barab said, “far more are dying than we even know about.”

Heat-related deaths are routinely undercounted for various reasons, including a failure to recognize how high temperatures trigger fatal heart attacks, strokes and deadly accidents as well as inconsistent reporting by medical professionals and coroners. Heat exposure is extremely risky for workers with underlying heart or lung conditions, especially if they’re laboring in polluted air.

Because working in hot conditions can impair cognitive function and lead to accidental injury and death, Dean and his colleague Jamie McCallum, an expert on worker struggles at Middlebury College, included vehicular deaths related to equipment in agriculture, construction and transportation as potentially caused by heat stress.

While the study didn’t attribute every vehicular fatality to heat, Dean said, if the heat standard is effective, they would have expected to see a decline in those types of deaths relative to other states after implementing the policy. “What we’re saying is that the fact that these kinds of deaths in California decreased relative to those deaths in the neighboring states after the heat standard was passed is evidence in favor of the heat standard having been effective.”

In all, the team identified more than 6,000 heat-related deaths among outdoor workers in 126 counties in Arizona, California, Nevada and Oregon, about 300 deaths a year on average, between 1999 and 2020. Arizona had the most deaths overall and holds the county with the highest number of deaths in a year, Maricopa County, which had 233 deaths in 2020.

All the states had spikes in worker deaths until 2010, when a very rapid increase in deaths in Arizona, plus spikes in Oregon and Nevada, together accounted for the 33 percent drop in California deaths relative to the other states, Dean said.

Dean said the study makes no claim that California’s 2010 enforcement campaign was “perfectly successful.” In fact, he said, worker deaths in California have actually increased since 2010 on average, but the increase in the surrounding states that lack a standard is much more extreme.

California still had about 100 heat deaths a year from 2010 to 2020. But applying the conservative estimate that worker deaths decreased by 33 percent after 2010, Dean said, suggests the stronger standard saved about 34 lives per year.

“Climate change and increasing extreme heat is increasing the risk of heat-related deaths among outdoor workers everywhere,” Dean said. “Heat-standard precautions can mitigate the worst risk.”

Officials with U.S. OSHA did not respond to questions from Inside Climate News about when they expect to finalize the proposed heat standard or whether they will require employers to ensure workers have adequate water, shade and rest periods during hot days.

“Chronic and Persistent Vacancies”

The finding that worker deaths decreased over time in California is notable given perpetual understaffing challenges at Cal/OSHA, the state occupational safety and health agency, as outlined in a recent California State Audit report.

The study indicates that regulations on paper, especially those with loopholes, mean very little without effective enforcement by regulators, said Garett Brown, a retired Cal/OSHA field inspector who now serves as an agency watchdog.

“California’s enforcement gains are currently being undermined by chronic and persistent vacancies among field inspectors,” Brown said, noting that Cal/OSHA is currently operating with 95 inspector vacancies, a third of the available positions, and a $16 million cut in its enforcement budget, Brown said.

Still, just having a standard on the books can help save lives, said Michaels. Many agriculture employers learned about the stronger standard, heard about citations being issued by Cal/OSHA and decided to comply with the standard by providing water, shade and rest breaks, he explained.

“More farmworkers are alive today than would be if the stronger standard were not in effect,” Michaels said. “And more lives will be saved if federal OSHA adopts a similar standard.”

As temperatures continue to rise with greenhouse gas emissions, enforcement will be ever more critical to protecting undocumented workers and others who fear retaliation for taking the precautions that save lives, Dean and other labor experts say.

“We hope the federal government will implement a federal heat standard,” Dean said. “We also worry that it will not be effective in protecting workers unless it’s matched by the kind of increased enforcement that we’ve seen in California since 2010.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1629940610-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:01:27.946562

Food is fuel, food brings people together. Food is also big business, and innovative companies are helping advance the growing and producing of food throughout the world. Agribusiness is a thriving industry, due to consistent demand and continued scientific advances that help farmers and other stakeholders mitigate challenges.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service, in its 2022 Census of Agriculture, U.S. farms and ranches produced $543.1 billion in agricultural products, up from $388.5 billion in 2017. The value of crop sales exceeded livestock sales, with crops accounting for 52% of the total.

Increasingly, technology plays a pivotal role in agriculture. The USDA Economic Research Service, in its “America’s Farms and Ranches at a Glance, 2024 Edition”, reported that farms of all sizes are using precision agriculture (PA) technologies to increase yields, reduce purchased input costs, improve environmental quality, and save on labor time. Among the top technologies were yield monitors, yield maps, and soil maps—used by 13% of small farms and 68% of large-scale crop-producing farms. Guidance autosteering systems on tractors, harvesters, and other equipment were used on 9% of small farms and 70% of large-scale crop-producing farms. According to the research, technology such as drones, robotic milking, and wearable livestock technologies are less common, especially among small farms.

While good soil and favorable weather are key components of success in agribusiness, so are location, workforce, and education.

Unlike a one-time purchase, an energy project creates a long-term partnership, often spanning 20–40 years or more.","The U.S. energy sector is undergoing a historic transformation, driven by soaring electricity demand from new technologies, ambitious corporate sustainability goals, and major federal roadblocks. This has triggered a nationwide land rush, placing real property at the center of the energy transition conversation in the U.S. With the existing grid struggling to keep up with increasing power demands, utilities are aggressively shifting from passive energy procurement to direct real estate acquisition and development. For corporate leaders, understanding this new utility strategy is essential for strategic site selection and competitive positioning.

The Utility Shift to Real Estate and Development

Historically, regulated utilities often met renewable energy needs through long-term power purchase agreements, or PPAs, with independent producers. Today, utilities are increasingly pursuing direct asset ownership.

The primary driver of this shift is that it allows utilities to add the value of a power plant to their “rate base,” which is the value of property on which they are allowed to earn a specified rate of return for shareholders, as set by a public utility commission. Power purchased from others is merely a pass-through expense, offering no such return.

Direct ownership also gives utilities greater control to meet state and federal decarbonization mandates, improve grid reliability, and stabilize long-term prices. This allows them to capture the full project value, including energy, capacity payments, and renewable energy certificates. Consequently, utilities are now competing directly with power producers and commercial developers.

A Comparative Analysis of Key Transaction Models

The decision to build, buy, or simply contract for power is a complex one, forcing utilities and developers to weigh the trade-offs between risk, control, capital investment, and speed. Various transaction model options exist because there is no one-size-fits-all solution; each structure allocates critical variables differently to suit a company’s specific financial situation, risk appetite, and strategic goals.

While no single model is universally preferred, regulated utilities are showing a distinct preference for structures that result in asset ownership — such as direct ownership or build-transfer agreements — because of the powerful incentive to grow their rate base. A build-transfer agreement, or BTA, is a hybrid model where a developer handles the high-risk early stages of a project, such as obtaining site control and permits, before transferring the “de-risked” asset to the utility upon completion. This model leverages developer agility while allowing the utility to add the final asset to its rate base. While this approach mitigates early-stage risk and benefits from specialized developer expertise, it often comes with a higher acquisition cost and requires complex negotiations, especially given current market conditions.

In contrast, entities in deregulated markets or those looking to avoid massive capital outlays continue to rely heavily on the flexibility of power purchase agreements. PPAs remain a common model where a utility or other large electricity consumer buys power from a project owned and operated by an independent power producer for a long term, typically 15–25 years. This allows the power purchaser to avoid all development and operational risk and requires no upfront capital, providing predictable energy costs. However, for a utility, this path forgoes the opportunity to expand its rate base, offers less operational control, and prevents it from directly monetizing tax incentives.

In the direct utility ownership, or “self-build,” model, the utility acts as its own developer, directly acquiring land and managing the entire project. This approach offers maximum control and rate base value but places all development, construction, and financial risk squarely on the utility and its ratepayers. While it maximizes shareholder return, this model can be slower and less efficient than private development.

Mitigating the Top Three Real Estate Legal Challenges

Whatever transactional model utilities choose, proactive risk management is essential for project survival. Energy projects are defined by massive upfront capital investment and long, complex development timelines where real estate is the most critical component. Failing to proactively manage land-related risks means that fatal flaws — such as an undiscovered title defect or community opposition — may only be discovered after millions of dollars have been spent. This reactive approach inevitably leads to crippling delays, explosive budget overruns, and, in a worst-case scenario, the complete abandonment of the project, reducing a promising asset into a substantial financial loss.

First, navigating the zoning and permitting gauntlet is often the most unpredictable part of development due to community opposition and complex regulations. Such opposition and complexity may be mitigated by early and transparent engagement with local officials and community leaders; however, early engagement can be more difficult with a BTA model, where a developer is in control during this phase, potentially leaving the acquiring utility to inherit landowner issues. Success depends on incorporating local zoning codes into initial site screening and utilizing state-level siting authorities where available to streamline approvals.

Second, securing necessary land control is paramount, as unforeseen issues can present fatal flaws to a project. Obtaining option agreements creates site control with minimal upfront capital while also providing a crucial window for due diligence before committing to a long-term agreement. It is also vital to obtain comprehensive land title surveys and proactively negotiate with existing mineral rights holders, a challenge particularly pronounced in states with a long history of oil and gas activity.

Third, navigating landowner relationships from negotiation to operation is critical. Unlike a one-time purchase, an energy project creates a long-term partnership, often spanning 20–40 years or more. A failure to establish a clear and fair agreement at the outset can lead to persistent operational friction and ongoing community opposition. Conflicts can arise over issues not clearly defined in the initial lease, such as maintenance, interference with farming activities, and access rights.

A comprehensive lease agreement, negotiated with transparency, is the foundational document for a lasting relationship. This includes clearly defined compensation with escalator clauses, precise mapping of land use and access rights, and explicit reservation of the landowner’s rights on adjacent property. Proactive operational management, including a designated local point of contact and clearly delineated maintenance duties, can also be beneficial. Finally, planning for decommissioning from the start, with a detailed plan and financial guarantee for land restoration, builds crucial long-term trust.

A C-Suite Guide to Site Selection in the New Energy Paradigm

For corporations planning energy-intensive facilities, the site selection playbook must evolve because the energy landscape itself continues to change focus. Power is no longer a simple commodity; it is now the primary gating factor for any major industrial development — especially as the race to build AI data centers increases demand for electricity. Corporations that adapt their strategies to treat energy as a critical strategic asset can secure a powerful competitive advantage, enabling faster construction and more reliable operations. Failing to evolve risks being saddled with sites that cannot be powered on a viable timeline, leading to catastrophic project delays, stranded capital, and a loss of market position.

Power availability is now the primary factor determining a site’s viability. With grid capacity constrained and interconnection queues backlogged for years, the “time to power” can make or break a major investment. Site selection teams should perform deep diligence on a location’s energy readiness by analyzing the local utility’s integrated resource plan, investigating the regional grid operator’s interconnection queue, and understanding the utility’s preferred transaction models to predict its behavior.

This reality has given rise to the “Bring Your Own Power” imperative, where leading corporations develop on-site generation to ensure power reliability. This strategy requires much larger land parcels that can host both an industrial facility and a power plant, creating a new premium class of “energy-anchored” industrial real estate. Two recent examples highlight this shift. First, Amazon Web Services acquired a 1,200-acre data center campus in Pennsylvania directly connected to a 2.5 GW nuclear power plant, securing up to 960 MW of reliable, carbon-free power through a long-term PPA. Second, Microsoft, as part of its goal to eliminate diesel backup generators by 2030, successfully tested hydrogen fuel cells to power a row of data center servers for 48 consecutive hours, proving the viability of clean hydrogen for providing uninterrupted power.

Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 MW of natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are also part of a new expedited interconnection study process.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

Last December, Meta announced its intention to develop its largest-ever artificial intelligence (AI) data center campus in Richland Parish, about 30 miles east of Monroe, LA. The $10 billion, 4 million square foot mega site represents one of the largest private capital investments in state history and offers to fundamentally transform the economics of what has been called a “neglected corner” of Louisiana.

But Meta’s $10 billion estimate only covers a portion of what it will cost to get the site online. Entergy Louisiana previously announced it will invest $6 billion in electric infrastructure to power the project, including a 10,000-acre solar farm, three natural gas turbines, and 100 miles of new transmission lines. Carbon sequestration will offset 60% of the new gas emissions with the potential of future wind or solar expansion, according to the company.

Entergy Louisiana argues its customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, the company said.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA.","Read Time: 3 mins

On November 20, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) issued a proposed rule to amend the regulatory definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq. (90 Fed. Reg. 82320, Nov. 20, 2025). The agencies’ proposal responds directly to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Sackett v. EPA, 598 U.S. 651 (2023), and aims to align federal jurisdiction with the Court’s limitations while reducing ambiguity for regulators and regulated entities.

If finalized, this rule could significantly reduce the number of CWA Section 404 and Section 401 permits required for greenfield and infrastructure development, especially in areas with ephemeral or isolated water features. However, stakeholders should be aware that state-level regulatory responses are likely, particularly in jurisdictions that traditionally exercised broader water protections.

Summary of Key Changes to WOTUS Rule

1. Jurisdictional Waters Re-Defined (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(a))

The proposed rule narrows the WOTUS definition by specifying only two jurisdictional categories:

Traditional Navigable Waters (TNWs)

Relatively Permanent Waters and Their Adjacent Wetlands

This excludes several previously jurisdictional features and emphasizes Sackett’s “continuous surface connection” test.

2. “Relatively Permanent” Standard Clarified (§ 120.2(c)(7))

The rule defines “relatively permanent” as surface waters that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or during the “wet season.” The “wet season” is defined as periods when monthly precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, based on long-term climatic data. Ephemeral streams, by contrast, are excluded under § 120.2(d)(4).

Additionally, such waters must:

Possess a bed and bank

Connect to a downstream jurisdictional water via a relatively permanent flow path (§ 120.2(c)(7)(ii))

Tributaries that flow only in response to precipitation events—i.e., ephemeral streams—are no longer jurisdictional.

3. Adjacent Wetlands Must Be Physically and Hydrologically Connected (§ 120.2(c)(8))

Jurisdictional wetlands must:

Physically abut a jurisdictional water (e.g., TNW or relatively permanent water)

Have surface water continuously present during the wet season

Critically, the rule clarifies that a wetland separated from jurisdictional waters by discrete features (e.g., levees, berms, or culverts) is not “adjacent” unless surface water is continuously present on both sides during the wet season (§ 120.2(c)(8)(ii)).

4. Elimination of “Interstate Waters” as a Standalone Category

Interstate waters are no longer jurisdictional based solely on their interstate nature. They must independently qualify under the revised categories (§ 120.2(b)(1)).

Expanded and Clarified Exclusions (40 C.F.R. § 120.2(d))

The rule proposes new clarity around exclusions:

Groundwater is expressly excluded, including tile-drained and subsurface flows (§ 120.2(d)(1))

Non-navigable ditches constructed entirely in dry land are excluded, even if they eventually convey relatively permanent flow (§ 120.2(d)(3))

Prior Converted Cropland retains its exemption unless abandoned for >5 years and reverted to a WOTUS-qualifying wetland (§ 120.2(d)(2))

Waste Treatment Systems are excluded under an expanded definition that includes treatment ponds, lagoons, and infiltration systems (§ 120.2(d)(5))

Section 404(f) Farming Exemptions remain unchanged, continuing to protect routine agricultural discharges (§ 120.2(f))

Implications for CWA Permitting Programs

CWA Section 404: Fewer Permits, Fewer Delays

By narrowing the scope of WOTUS, the agencies expect a marked reduction in Section 404 permit obligations, particularly for projects involving ephemeral streams and non-abutting wetlands. This is likely to reduce costs, project delays, and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) triggers tied to Section 404 actions.

Notably, in arid or semi-arid regions, where ephemeral waters dominate, the proposal could eliminate permitting requirements for many previously regulated features.

CWA Section 401: Reduced Certification Burden

Because Section 401 certifications are contingent on federal permits, the expected decline in Section 404 permits will lead to fewer 401 certification requests. This may reduce administrative workload for state and tribal agencies.

CWA Section 402: Nuanced Impact

Discharges from point sources to waters no longer deemed jurisdictional may no longer require National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. However, permit obligations may persist if pollutants ultimately reach a WOTUS via hydrological or artificial conveyance systems.

State Response and Potential Regulatory Gaps

While the proposed rule reduces federal oversight, it acknowledges that states and tribes may respond by expanding state-level jurisdiction (90 Fed. Reg. at 82325). Currently, at least 24 states regulate waters more broadly than the federal standard, including Washington, Oregon, and California. These states may develop or expand dredge-and-fill programs to fill potential regulatory gaps.

For instance, Washington State has already initiated steps to establish a Section 404 analog at the state level, ensuring continuity in environmental protection despite federal contraction.

What Should Stakeholders Do Now?

Below are key considerations and timely moves that stakeholders may want to discuss with counsel:

Map and Assess: Identify and reassess project site water features under the revised definitions.

Engage in the Rulemaking: Public comments are due by January 5, 2026, and may be submitted through regulations.gov under Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OW–2025–0322.

Monitor State Responses: Watch for increased state regulation or new permitting schemes in areas where federal oversight is reduced.

Consult Experts: Engage environmental counsel or consultants to navigate evolving federal and state requirements and potential NEPA implications.

The EPA and Corps’ proposed WOTUS rule represents a substantial realignment of federal water permitting authority under the CWA. While it is expected to ease permitting burdens and regulatory costs for developers, energy firms, and agricultural stakeholders, it also introduces complexities at the state level that merit close attention.",https://www.mcglinchey.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/water-marsh.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:58:46.838430

Global lithium demand is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 12% through 2030, reaching 4.6 million tonnes LCE.","The global lithium market, a critical barometer for the electric vehicle (EV) industry, has entered a new phase of stabilization in late 2025, following a dramatic period of price volatility. After plummeting by as much as 90% from its late 2022 peak, lithium prices have found a floor and are now showing signs of a modest rebound. This pivotal shift offers a more predictable cost environment for EV manufacturers, potentially fueling continued innovation and broader adoption, even as the outlook for EV demand presents a mixed picture across different regions.

The Tumultuous Path to Stability

The journey to lithium price stabilization has been tumultuous. From an all-time high in November 2022, prices experienced a precipitous decline through 2023 and the first half of 2025, driven by an influx of new supply and, at times, concerns over decelerating EV growth in certain markets. This sharp downturn pushed many high-cost lithium producers to curtail or even halt operations, effectively rebalancing the market's severe oversupply. By June 2025, prices began to stabilize, with lithium carbonate futures in China now trading around 94,400 CNY/T (approximately $13,400 USD/metric ton) as of December 2, 2025 – a significant recovery from their lows, reflecting a 25.73% year-to-date gain.

Several factors have converged to underpin this stabilization. Strategic production adjustments by major lithium miners, coupled with a robust and continuously growing global EV demand – particularly strong in China, where new energy vehicle output increased by 33.1% in the first ten months of the year – have been instrumental. Global EV sales surged to 2.1 million units in September 2025, marking a 26% year-over-year increase. Furthermore, ongoing inventory drawdowns and supportive governmental policies, especially in China, have played a crucial role in preventing further price erosion. An emerging demand vector from lithium-based battery storage systems for data centers powering artificial intelligence is also contributing to the upward pressure, with projections indicating a 30-40% surge in overall lithium demand from this sector in 2026. This confluence of supply-side corrections and sustained demand has led analysts like Goldman Sachs to forecast a gradual increase in prices, with battery-grade lithium carbonate potentially reaching $11,000/mt in 2025 and $13,250/mt in 2026.

Despite the recent recovery, the market remains cautiously optimistic. While prices are not expected to revisit their 2022-2023 peaks in the near term, the current stability provides a healthier foundation for the industry. The average EV battery pack price in China, for instance, reached approximately $94 per kWh in 2025, falling below the critical $100/kWh threshold, largely due to cheaper lithium and the widespread adoption of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries. This improved cost predictability is a significant boon for EV manufacturers, allowing for better long-term planning and potentially more affordable electric vehicles for consumers.

Companies Navigating the Evolving Landscape

The stabilization of lithium prices and the mixed EV demand outlook present a varied landscape for public companies across the value chain. Lithium miners, previously battered by the price collapse, are now seeing a path to improved profitability, while EV manufacturers must balance cost benefits with intense competition and regional demand disparities.

For lithium miners, the rebound in prices is a welcome relief. Companies like Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), which saw its stock decline due to weak lithium prices in 2024, are now poised for recovery. Albemarle has demonstrated resilience through cost execution and a focus on its energy storage segment, lifting its 2025 volume growth forecast to over 10% and returning to profitability in Q2 2025. With lithium prices showing a rebound in late 2025, Albemarle's outlook for 2026 appears stronger, with forecasts suggesting sales could reach the $7 billion range. Similarly, Livent (NYSE: LTHM), which faced a weaker outlook during the downturn, could benefit significantly from the market's shift to a potential deficit by 2026, especially given strong long-term demand fundamentals.

On the EV manufacturing front, the impact is more nuanced. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), a global leader, benefits from the overall increase in global EV sales and lower battery costs. The stabilization of lithium prices should support its battery production costs. However, the cautious trajectory of EV adoption in North America, coupled with policy uncertainties and increased competition, could impact its regional sales growth. Tesla's ability to manage costs, innovate, and adapt to regional market dynamics will be crucial.

In stark contrast, BYD (HKEX: 1211) has solidified its position as the largest global EV producer, leveraging its dominance in the rapidly growing Chinese market and strategic expansion into Europe and Latin America. BYD's vertical integration, including investments in lithium mining projects, provides a significant hedge against price volatility. Analysts project a bullish trajectory for BYD's stock, further bolstered by its investments in advanced battery technologies like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries, which could reduce its long-term reliance on fluctuating lithium prices. The continued strength of the Chinese EV market, driven by competitive pricing and government support, positions BYD favorably.

Wider Significance and Industry Ripple Effects

The stabilization of lithium prices and the mixed EV demand outlook are not isolated events; they are profound indicators of broader industry trends, generating significant ripple effects across the global economy and policy landscape. This period echoes historical commodity cycles, where market forces and strategic interventions reshape entire sectors.

A primary trend is the continued drive towards battery technology and cost reduction. The achievement of an average EV battery pack price of $94 per kWh in China in 2025 – falling below the critical $100/kWh threshold – is a game-changer. This is largely due to the cost-effectiveness of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) cells, which are approximately 25% cheaper than NCM/NCA alternatives. This cost advantage, primarily driven by Chinese manufacturing, is creating global downward price pressure, making EVs more accessible and accelerating mass-market adoption.

The supply chain dynamics are also undergoing a critical transformation. The lithium market is transitioning from oversupply to a potentially tighter market by 2025, with a projected deficit by 2026. Looking further ahead, a significant ""raw material disconnect"" is anticipated, with lithium supply potentially trailing EV demand by 572,000 tonnes by 2034. This long-term outlook underscores the urgent need for continuous investment and strategic planning to meet future demand. Investment and resource security have become paramount, with nations like Saudi Arabia investing in lithium projects, while policy uncertainties in regions like the US could hinder domestic supply chain development. The burgeoning Energy Storage Systems (ESS) market, projected to grow by 37% in 2025, is another significant driver of lithium demand, recognizing its role as essential grid infrastructure.

The ripple effects are far-reaching. Economic impact includes reduced EV manufacturing costs, leading to more affordable vehicles and stimulating exponential market growth. However, abrupt policy changes, such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits in the US, can disrupt markets and necessitate financial adjustments for manufacturers. Geopolitical implications are intensifying, with a fierce competition for control over EV and battery technologies, particularly between the US and China. China's proposed restrictions on lithium extraction and refining technologies in early 2025 aim to enhance its control over the global lithium supply chain, highlighting the strategic importance of this critical mineral. From an environmental and sustainability perspective, the push for electrification continues to drive lithium demand, while advancements in extraction technologies like Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) are improving efficiency and reducing the environmental footprint. Recycling initiatives are also gaining vital importance.

Regulatory and policy implications are profoundly shaping the market. The anticipated reversal of key EV policies in the US under a potential Trump administration, including the removal of production mandates and the scaling back of federal tax credits, is expected to create significant uncertainty and potentially slow EV adoption. New tariffs on Chinese-made EV batteries and critical raw materials are also projected to raise manufacturing costs. Conversely, China has actively supported its EV market with subsidies, although the expiration of the zero-tax policy on EV purchases at the end of 2025 will likely trigger a surge in late 2025 sales. Europe is promoting green energy policies but also imposing tariffs on low-cost Chinese EVs to protect its domestic industry.

Historically, the current market dynamics echo precedents in other critical commodity industries. The commodity price cycles seen in lithium are similar to those in oil and copper, where periods of oversupply lead to price collapses, followed by production cuts and eventual stabilization. These cycles underscore the challenge of managing supply in volatile global markets and the enduring influence of macroeconomic factors. Just as prolonged low prices in copper can hinder investment in new mines, the recent lithium downturn slowed new project development, potentially leading to future supply shortfalls.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future

The future of lithium prices and EV demand is a complex tapestry woven with short-term volatility and robust long-term growth, demanding strategic pivots and offering both significant opportunities and challenges. As of late 2025, stakeholders are positioning themselves for an evolving landscape.

In the short-term (2025-2026), lithium prices are expected to exhibit some instability, despite the recent rebound. While a small market surplus is predicted for 2025, it is forecast to shift into a deficit by 2026. This suggests continued upward pressure on prices, though significant corrections could occur if supply disruptions don't materialize or if the adoption of alternative battery chemistries accelerates. Global EV sales will continue to rise, exceeding 20 million units in 2025, but regional disparities will persist, with China leading the charge and Europe showing strong growth, while North America faces a more cautious trajectory due to policy uncertainties. The declining average EV battery price, expected to reach US$90 per kWh in 2025, will further enhance affordability.

The long-term (2027-2040) outlook for lithium prices is overwhelmingly bullish, driven by a projected widening supply-demand gap. Global lithium demand is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 12% through 2030, reaching 4.6 million tonnes LCE. By 2030, a significant shortfall of 97 Kt of lithium is anticipated, expanding to 621 Kt by 2040. This structural deficit, combined with risks from project delays and underinvestment, suggests sustained upward pressure on prices. Similarly, long-term EV demand remains robust, with the total EV share of light-vehicle sales globally projected to surge to 44.6% by 2030 and 69.5% by 2035. Heavy-duty electric trucks and buses, along with energy storage systems, will significantly contribute to this growth.

To navigate this future, several strategic pivots are required. Diversifying supply chains and enhancing regional resilience are paramount, with Western nations investing in domestic lithium mining and processing to reduce reliance on concentrated production. Technological innovation in extraction and batteries is crucial, including the widespread adoption of Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) for more sustainable and efficient recovery, and continued investment in next-generation battery chemistries like solid-state and sodium-ion batteries. The development of a circular economy through recycling is also essential for resource security and sustainability. Governments must adopt adaptive policy frameworks that support domestic resources and infrastructure, while automakers need to prioritize cost optimization and affordability to accelerate mainstream EV adoption.

Market opportunities are abundant. The lithium-ion battery recycling market is poised for explosive growth, offering a critical solution for resource scarcity. Energy Storage Systems (ESS) present a rapidly expanding demand for lithium beyond EVs. Innovations in Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) offer more environmentally friendly production methods. Emerging EV markets in developing economies, driven by lower-cost models, represent new growth avenues.

However, significant market challenges persist. Geopolitical and supply chain risks remain high due to concentrated production. The market is still susceptible to oversupply and price fluctuations. Infrastructure gaps, particularly in charging networks, need massive expansion. Regulatory uncertainty from shifting government policies can create unpredictable market conditions. The emergence of alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion could impact lithium demand in certain segments. Finally, environmental and social concerns of mining require continuous innovation in sustainable practices.

Comprehensive Wrap-up and Investor Outlook

The global lithium and EV markets are at a pivotal juncture in late 2025, characterized by a hard-won stabilization in lithium prices and a dynamically growing, albeit regionally varied, demand for electric vehicles. This intricate interplay underscores a market in transition, driven by strategic supply adjustments, evolving policies, and rapid technological advancements.

Key takeaways highlight lithium's impressive rebound in 2025, driven by robust demand, inventory drawdowns, and Chinese regulatory tightening. While global EV demand continues its upward trajectory, with over 20 million units expected in 2025, regional nuances are significant, particularly China's dominance. A crucial new demand driver is the emerging need for lithium in AI data centers, projected to surge by 30-40% in 2026, fundamentally expanding lithium's value proposition beyond transportation. The imperative for strategic supply chain security has also become a defining feature, with substantial investments aimed at diversifying sources and reducing reliance on concentrated production.

The market assessment reveals a shift from oversupply to a potentially tighter balance in 2025, with a looming deficit by 2026 and beyond. This is fueled by producers' supply cuts and delayed projects, alongside soaring EV manufacturing and energy storage system demands. However, the ""great raw material disconnect"" – where the lengthy timeline for new lithium mine development lags behind rapid battery facility expansion – persists, demanding massive investment. The EV market, while expanding significantly, faces challenges from market saturation and policy reversals in some regions, despite advancements in battery efficiency and charging infrastructure.

The lasting impact of these dynamics includes a fundamental reshaping of global supply chains, with a strong push for localization outside China to mitigate geopolitical risks. Technological evolution is accelerating, with LFP batteries gaining prominence and gigafactories preparing for next-gen chemistries like solid-state. The increased importance of recycling for a circular economy is undeniable, becoming crucial to supplement primary lithium sources. Perhaps most significantly, lithium's newfound role as a critical enabler for AI infrastructure signifies a profound shift in its perceived value and procurement, adding another layer of demand pressure that will reverberate for years to come.

For investors, navigating this market requires a nuanced approach. Lithium miners with low production costs, diversified operations, and strong ESG practices are well-positioned for the long-term, given the potential for structural deficits. Battery manufacturers innovating in chemistry and securing robust supply agreements offer substantial opportunities. EV manufacturers must demonstrate strong technological differentiation, competitive pricing, and adaptability to regional policy shifts and market dynamics. Companies involved in infrastructure and technology providers for charging, recycling, and advanced extraction (like DLE) are poised for growth. Key risks include market saturation, abrupt policy changes, technological challenges, and the capital intensity of new ventures. Diversification across the value chain and thorough due diligence are paramount. The unexpected, yet powerful, AI-driven demand for lithium introduces a new dimension to investment theses, potentially accelerating market tightening and price increases beyond what EV growth alone would dictate, making lithium an even more critical commodity for the future.

Surprise funding will help smaller agencies with senior mobile food programs, weekend backpack efforts, food pantries, veteran programs

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

GREENVILLE, S.C. – Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are wrapping up a monthlong initiative to support organizations that address food deserts, insecurities and inequities across South Carolina by announcing nearly $275,000 in surprise microgrants and contributions to community organizations across the state.

The big picture: The announcement wraps up a monthlong campaign of financial support to and employee volunteerism with organizations in South Carolina that fight hunger across the state. These include programs that distribute food boxes, fill backpacks for weekend food programs for students, provide help to veterans and senior mobile meal programs, among other feeding initiatives.

In total, the initiative provided more than $600,000 to critical community partners that do this incredible work, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina, One SC Fund and AIM, among many others.

The microgrants and contributions were not solicited by the receiving organizations. The ‘surcee’ funding opportunities recognize the important gaps these typically smaller agencies fill in the neighborhoods they serve. A complete list of recipients can be found here.

Why it matters: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That’s 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

What they’re saying

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy’s South Carolina president: “If you grew up in South Carolina, you are likely familiar with a ‘surcee’ – a small, unexpected gift. Giving Tuesday is the perfect opportunity to give a little something extra and highlight the great work these organizations do throughout the year to help keep our friends and neighbors from going hungry.”

Mark Champagne, executive director, Sumter United Ministries: “Thanks to the generosity of the Duke Energy Foundation’s $5,000 grant, we will be able to place food into the hands of neighbors who are struggling more than I’ve seen in many years. As requests continue to rise and our shelves grow thin, this gift brings real hope at a time when our community truly needs it.”

Traci H. Kennedy, executive director, TOTAL Ministries: “We so appreciate everything Duke Energy Foundation does for TOTAL Ministries. The grant is making an immediate and meaningful difference, allowing us to meet rising needs and care for families who are struggling the most.”

Melinda Waddell, executive director, The Manna House: “The support from Duke Energy for our mission to create a hunger-free Florence allows us to continue to provide hot, healthy, nutritious meals to our clients. With more than 100,000 individual meals served in 2024, we truly appreciate their dedication and commitment to our neighbors and community.”

Andrea White, chief executive officer, Food Bank of Greenwood: “The grant from the Duke Energy Foundation ensures we can continue providing critical resources to our neighbors, helping stabilize households and improve overall community well-being throughout the Lakelands.”

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

The project teams will receive up to $800 million in federal cost-shared funding to advance initial projects in Tennessee and Michigan and help expand the Nation’s capacity while facilitating additional follow-on projects and associated supply chains. The selections announced today will help deliver new nuclear generation in the early 2030s, strengthen domestic supply chains, and advance President Trump’s Executive Orders to usher in a nuclear renaissance and expand America’s Energy Dominance agenda.

“President Trump has made clear that America is going to build more energy, not less, and nuclear is central to that mission,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Advanced light-water SMRs will give our nation the reliable, round-the-clock power we need to fuel the President’s manufacturing boom, support data centers and AI growth, and reinforce a stronger, more secure electric grid. These awards ensure we can deploy these reactors as soon as possible.”

With today’s announcement, DOE is supporting the following first-mover teams to develop and construct the first Gen III+ small modular reactor (Gen III+ SMR) plants in the United States:

Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) - $400,000,000

TVA plans to advance deployment of a GE Vernova Hitachi BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Nuclear site in Tennessee, as well as accelerate the deployment of additional units with Indiana Michigan Power and Elementl. Additionally, TVA plans to work with the domestic nuclear supply chain partners Scot Forge, North American Forgemasters, BWX Technologies, and Aecon. Other partners supporting the project include Duke Energy, Oak Ridge Associated Universities, and the Electric Power Research Institute.

Holtec Government Services, LLC (Holtec) - $400,000,000

Holtec plans to deploy two SMR-300 reactors at the Palisades Nuclear Generating Station site in Covert, Michigan, demonstrating viability for additional orders both domestically and abroad. Holtec is pursuing an innovative one-stop-shop approach to SMR deployment by fulfilling the roles of technology vendor, supply chain vendor, nuclear plant constructor in partnership with Hyundai Engineering & Construction, plant operator, and electricity merchant selling the power to near-by utilities and end-users.

As the nation prepares for continued growth in electricity demand, President Trump has charged DOE with adding new, affordable and reliable energy to keep America energy secure. Small modular reactors offer flexible deployment, proven technology, and the ability to leverage existing supply chains, making them one of the fastest and most scalable pathways to new nuclear capacity.

In March 2025, DOE issued a $900 million solicitation to de-risk the deployment of Gen III+ SMRs and the remaining $100 million will be awarded later this year to support additional deployments and address key barriers in design, licensing, supply chain, and site readiness.

In this edition of the Environmental Justice Update, we examine the latest key trends, policy initiatives, and legal developments reshaping the EJ landscape.

Federal

In June 2025, a coalition of almost two dozen nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for terminating over 400 grants under the Environmental and Climate Justice (ECJ) Block Grants program created under the Inflation Reduction Act (Public Law No: 117-169) (IRA), arguing that the grant terminations were unlawful. The plaintiffs contended that the termination violated the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious, contravened the Presentment Clause and separation of powers, and disregarded Congress’ directive to fund the grants.

In July 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta co-led a multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general in submitting an amicus brief supporting the plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit. Among other points, the amicus brief argued that the termination of the program disproportionately harms marginalized and historically disadvantaged communities, undermining the core purpose of Congress’s instruction to EPA when it passed the IRA.

In a 29 August 2025 opinion, US District Judge Richard Leon of the District of Columbia denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, saying: “Put simply, I cannot order the Government to reinstate contracts and pay money due on them.” (emphasis in original). Pointing to decisions from earlier this year by the US Supreme Court pertaining to Department of Education grants and grants from the National Institute of Health, Judge Leon also dismissed the case, agreeing with EPA that the suit belonged before the US Court of Federal Claims.

The majority of plaintiffs appealed Judge Leon’s decision to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on 16 September 2025. Plaintiff’s emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal was denied as the court found “that harm to the plaintiffs if the grant funds were returned to the Treasury was not irreparable.”

As this legal dispute plays out, Congress’s rescission of all unobligated funding under the ECJ Block Grants program as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (Public Law No.: 119-21), increases the potential difficulty plaintiffs may face in quickly reinstating their grants.

Multistate EJ Guidance

In response to the rollback of EJ under the Trump Administration earlier this year,1 many states have recommitted to EJ protections through a multistate EJ guidance. Specifically, in June 2025, a coalition of state attorney generals from 13 states2 issued the “Multi-State Guidance Affirming the Importance and Legality of Environmental Justice Initiatives.” This document aims to identify sources of legal support for state EJ laws and to provide assurances to stakeholders that EJ practices remain legal despite the Trump Administration’s efforts to curtail them.

The “Multi-State Guidance” challenges the Trump Administration’s labeling of EJ as “illegal discrimination,” locating support for EJ in a variety of federal statutes and the US Constitution. Specifically, the document finds key support in:

The US Constitution:

The Tenth Amendment: Granting states the power to pass laws that advance “Public health, safety, and welfare.”

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: Barring state and local governmental entities from discriminating based on race or sex.

The First Amendment: Barring the government from conditioning benefits on the waiver of free speech rights.

Civil rights statutes, including:

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Preventing those receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race, color, and national origin.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972: Preventing federal funding recipients from discriminating on the basis of disability, age, or sex, respectively.

Title VIII of the Federal Fair Housing Act: Outlawing public or private discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin in activities related to housing.

Federal environmental laws, such as the Clean Air Act’s requirement for public notice and public comment.

Nonprofit laws that prevent the revocation of 501(c)(3) status by presidential executive order or directive.

Treaty obligations to Native American tribes.

In addition to laying out what they see as the legal basis for EJ, and based on this analysis, the state attorneys general provide a “non-exhaustive [list of] examples of work that public entities, non-profit and philanthropic organizations, and businesses lawfully undertake to advance environmental justice.” These activities fall into several broad categories:

Education, technical assistance, and funding support

Public engagement and participation

Burden identification and analysis

Preventing and mitigating pollution exposures

Climate readiness and resilience

Enforcement and remedies

In sum, the multistate guidance seeks to offer stability and assurance to stakeholders by providing clarity on the EJ strategies and resources that remain available to communities in the wake of the federal repeal of EJ initiatives.

Alaska

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Republican reconciliation effort passed in July 2025, has impacted US energy and natural resource development across states and industries. Alaska is one state in particular that is positioned to experience a significant change in energy policy as a result of OBBBA. Two key OBBBA provisions—mandatory lease sales in Alaska and an adjustment of revenue sharing rates—have drawn attention from Alaska’s tribal communities, both for their potential to stimulate economic development and for the increased risk of negative environmental impacts that development could bring.

Specifically, OBBBA directs the secretary of the interior to conduct oil and gas lease sales in certain sections of Alaskan land over the next 10 years, repealing the Biden Administration’s limitation on oil and gas leasing on millions of acres in Alaska and restoring leasing policies established under the first Trump Administration. In addition, OBBBA provides an adjustment of future revenue splits from oil and gas royalties between Alaska and the federal government. This change will result in additional revenue to the Alaska Permanent Fund, which provides cash dividends directly to Alaska residents, along with state and local governments and support services.

Responses to the changes in OBBBA from Native American organizations in Alaska have been mixed. Some Native American groups have shared their appreciation for the OBBBA’s reversal of Biden administration land policies, stating that the previous administration ignored “Alaska Native self-determination” by withdrawing millions of acres of Alaskan land from development and eliminating avenues of Tribal tax revenue. Other Tribal organizations in Alaska opposed OBBBA and have expressed serious concerns that the “aggressive” oil, gas, and coal development directed in the bill puts “ecologically sensitive and culturally significant” lands at risk. Tribal groups have argued that increased carbon emissions from new oil and gas developments, combined with local pollution from energy infrastructure, will exacerbate the already-significant environmental risks.

California

Earlier this year, the state of California filed a lawsuit against the city of Tulare, a small city south of Fresno, for alleged violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The suit, filed in January by Attorney General Rob Bonta, claims that Tulare improperly approved a zoning ordinance that allows the development of cold-storage facilities in light and heavy industrial zones. Tulare approved the zoning ordinance in 2024 without conducting an environmental review under CEQA, claiming that the ordinance was exempt from the law’s requirements. Bonta’s suit argues that these cold-storage facilities could pose increased “air pollution and cancer risks” in “a previously racially-segregated community that is now one of the most pollution-burdened and disadvantaged communities in the State.” The case was disposed on 29 April 2025. Notwithstanding, the litigation highlights the state’s efforts to put pressure on a local government to fulfill its legal obligations to mitigate potential environmental harms to residents.

Colorado

This summer, Colorado’s Environmental Justice Action Task Force (Task Force) sought nominations for communities facing environmental inequities to analyze and improve health impacts. The Task Force was originally created on 2 July 2021 with the passing of HB21-1266. Housed in the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), the main goal of the Task Force is to propose recommendations to the general assembly on how to address EJ inequalities, particularly in disproportionately impacted communities. On 14 November 2022, the Task Force published a final report detailing their work and findings over the previous year. In this report, the task force recommended that CDPHE develop a branch of the department to conduct environmental equity and cumulative impact analyses (EECIA) across the state. This recommendation led to the passing of HB24-1338 on 28 May 2024.

HB24-1338 created an Office of Environmental Justice (the Office) housed within CDPHE. This Office specifically oversees the development process of EECIAs in selected geographic areas of Colorado with the goal of understanding how environmental factors affect the health and well-being of Colorado residents. When selecting these areas, the Office must choose disproportionately impacted communities, particularly those affected by a heightened exposure to environmental contaminants. Other factors in this selection process include the proportion of low-income families, the percentage of people of color, and locations with a history of environmental racism. Once these areas are selected, the Office will partner with an academic institution or another third-party to develop an EECIA, which involves hiring a contractor to perform scientifically rigorous analyses recommended by the Task Force. Some of these recommendations include increasing oversight at petroleum refineries, improving the response of the Air Pollution Control Division to air pollution complaints, and analyzing the cumulative impacts of pollution in the air, water, and soil of these communities. Within nine months of completing the EECIA, CDPHE will prepare a report identifying its findings and recommending resources to address environmental inequities.

The impact of these EECIA analyses is intended to help direct funds and resources from the state level to the local level to address issues for communities most exposed to environmental stressors, such as pollution and extreme heat conditions.

Illinois

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (Illinois EPA) is drafting proposed statutory language to formally codify the agency’s EJ policy and associated environmental permitting review procedures. Illinois EPA is proposing to limit the enhanced permitting review process to census tracts scoring in the 25th percentile or higher based on certain environmental indicators, with the underlying data to be updated every three years.

At the same time, several proposed EJ bills have yet to pass, including SB1307 and SB1686, which propose to amend the Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the Illinois Environmental Justice Act respectively, and the bills remain in Assignments (Committee) after the first readings. Against this backdrop, the Illinois Pollution Control Board opened a docket for interested parties to submit proposals for procedural regulations to “provide guidance to the Board when considering EJ issues, including the selection of screening tools for identifying areas of EJ concern, in its proceedings.” Illinois EPA, the Illinois Attorney General and various environmental interest groups have submitted comments.

The proposed legislation follows a 24 March 2025 EPA announcement that Illinois EPA had satisfied its obligations under the February 2025 Informal Resolution Agreement, which was issued to resolve allegations that Illinois EPA engaged in discriminatory permitting processes. Under the Informal Resolution Agreement, Illinois EPA committed, among other objectives, to “implement[ ] enhancements to its permit review process” and “ensure [Illinois] EPA’s public involvement process will be available to all persons[.]”

Under the current EJ policy, permitting actions in “areas of EJ concern”—defined as “a census block group with a low-income and/or minority population greater than twice the statewide average”—are subject to stricter scrutiny and heightened public participation requirements. Illinois EPA currently utilizes a GIS mapping tool, known as EJ Start, to determine areas of EJ concern within the state.

Massachusetts

Enacted under Senate Bill 2521 in August 2024, the Environmental Justice Trust (Trust) was signed into Massachusetts’ state budget following a joint proposal by Attorney General (AG) Andrea Joy Campbell, Representative Brandy Fluker-Oakley, and Senator Adam Gomez. Funded through civil penalties that are received in judgments and settlements from state cases involving the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Division, the Trust seeks to benefit community health by using these funds to address economic, environmental, and health-related burdens frequently faced by residents in disadvantaged communities. The Trust will help to address longstanding disparities in environmental health faced primarily by lower-income communities in Massachusetts.

The Trust is funded by the penalties accrued from cases against:

Companies that illegally emit or emit beyond permitted amounts, toxins and other pollutants into the air;

Contractors who expose employees to asbestos during demolitions;

Companies that discharge pollutants into local rivers and streams either illegally or beyond the scope of their permits; and

Entities that wrongfully destroy essential areas of wetland and green spaces that increase flood potential in surrounding communities.

The Trust allows monies to be directed at impacted communities to address financial burdens caused by violations, rather than the monies going into the commonwealth’s general fund. The money in the Trust will specifically be used to restore impacted natural resources, investigate environmental pollution or harm caused to local property, benefit the overall health of the affected community, and provide support to academic or government-funded research to further identify environmental protection and conservation measures in these areas.

On 27 January 2025, the AG’s Office announced that the first payments of a consent judgment against four companies, totaling US$155,000, would be placed into the Trust. More recently, on 8 September 2025, a local Massachusetts company reached an agreement with the AG’s Office for a settlement of US$300,000 in civil penalties, of which US$150,000 will be deposited into the Trust for a violation of the Massachusetts Clean Air Act and illegal asbestos removal. On 10 September 2025, the AG’s Office announced another settlement agreement with a Massachusetts based company for US$115,000 in penalties, with US$55,000 going into the Trust, for illegally handling, removing, and storing asbestos.

Maryland

On 17 July 2025, Governor Wes Moore signed the Valuing Opportunity, Inclusion, and Community Equity Executive Order (The VOICE Order). The VOICE Order, which went into effect immediately, creates the Interagency Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Council (the Council), which will strive to create a unified front among the state’s agencies to deal with the issue of environmental inequity. Made up of representatives from 14 state agencies appointed by the governor, the Council will coordinate state efforts, track relevant spending, and perform several other tasks to advise the agencies on advancing the governor’s EJ priorities. For example, the VOICE Order requires agencies to use Maryland’s EJ mapping tool, MDEnviroScreen, to “track and address disparities related to environmental hazards, exposures, risks, health outcomes, investments and benefits.”

Critically, the Council is tasked with developing enhanced public participation plans for communities with EJ concerns potentially affected by certain resource extraction, waste management, and industrial and manufacturing processes and activities. The Council will also provide technical assistance to localities in developing and implementing EJ programs and making concrete recommendations to the governor regarding how to best address disparate environmental health impacts caused by state action.

Michigan

On 1 July 2025 and 22 July 2025, Senate Bill 479 and House Bill 4742, entitled the “Protecting Overburdened Communities Act,” was introduced to amend Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) environmental permitting review process. The law would require EGLE to consider the cumulative impact of all pollutant types associated with a potential project. Additionally, the bill would require the agency to account for the greater risk of harm that social and economic factors have on communities. EGLE will use its EJ screening tool, MiEJScreen, to assess projects for environmental risk. If EGLE finds a negative impact on overburdened communities without a compelling need for the project, it has authority under the legislation to deny a permit application. Further, the policy requires permit applicants to give their community 60 days’ notice for a public hearing on the permit and prepare a project impact statement. Applicants must publish the information in at least two community newspapers, including a local non-English paper.

The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and Tourism and the Senate Committee on Energy and Environment in July and has not progressed further as of the date of this publication.

New Jersey

On 8 October 2025, the New Jersey Appellate Division held oral arguments on the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s (NJDEP) adoption of N.J.A.C. 7:1C (the Rules), which implement the Environmental Justice Law N.J.S.A. 13:1D-157 to -161 (the EJ Law).

Petitioners focused on aspects of the Rules that they argue go beyond the authority granted to NJDEP under the EJ Law, such as the Rules’ application to “zero population blocks”, and the Rules’ definitions for terms such as new facility, existing facility, expansion, and geographic point of comparison. Petitioners and amici further raised the lack of predictability that the Rules provide, particularly in terms of timing of the EJ process and NJDEP’s application of the EJ stressors, which petitioners noted were implemented in the EJMAP tool without being properly subject to administrative procedures.

In response, NJDEP argued that the department reasonably and permissibly filled in the gaps provided in the law using its expertise. NJDEP and its amici also argued that the Rules’ definitions meet the plain language test and are consistent with defined terms in other NJDEP regulatory programs. The court pressed NJDEP on a number of issues including the Rules’ threshold for measuring the contribution of adverse cumulative stressors, NJDEP’s development of its EJMAP, and the fact that the Rules do not factor economic considerations.

The court has taken the matter under advisement for further consideration.

Conclusion

Our EJ Task Force continues to closely monitor developments in this rapidly evolving area, including the updates highlighted above. As the EJ focus continues to evolve, businesses—particularly those operating in overburdened communities—should remain vigilant and track policy shifts and enforcement trends at both the federal and state levels. Staying informed and proactive is essential to managing risk and aligning with emerging compliance expectations. The firm is ready to work with clients to understand how these and other changes may impact their businesses.",https://files.klgates.com/images/_wbmanaged/elnr_wbc_socialimage_377976.png,N,,2025-12-02 17:01:07.915867

NATIONWIDE – Today, on the 55th anniversary of the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, a coalition of environmental justice groups representing millions of people living in frontline and fenceline communities across the U.S. call out the Trump administration’s efforts through the Agency to abandon its mission over the last year, and push for a comprehensive repositioning to center environmental justice for all. The Trump administration’s EPA has moved forward with the most unprecedented actions in the Agency’s history, including rollbacks to clean air, water, and worker protections, cutting staff, defunding programs, rescinding critical grants, and prioritizing polluters – all at the expense of environmental justice communities. In response, a coalition of environmental justice networks are pushing back to hold the line for life-saving protections and to empower people to hold the EPA accountable for a better and renewed vision that truly protects the health of everyone. The coalition, which includes the Moving Forward Network (MFN), Climate Justice Alliance (CJA), Equitable & Just National Climate Platform (EJNCP), Environmental Justice Health Alliance for Chemical Policy Reform (EJHA), and the Environmental Justice Leadership Forum (EJLF)

QUOTES

“The EPA was born from the power of our voices demanding for our fundamental rights to clean air, water, and land to be protected. Over half a century later, we cannot let the EPA dismantle critical protections that will allow polluters to once again poison our water, fill our lungs with smog, and disproportionately harm environmental justice communities. The future is ours to shape! We will keep fighting for an EPA and government that protects our rights, our health, and our future where all people breathe clean air, drink clean water, and have the opportunity to thrive.” – Anastasia Gordon, Director of Federal Policy at WE ACT for Environmental Justice

“Our communities built the movement that created the EPA 55 years ago. We refuse to go back to the days of burning rivers and deadly smog. The Trump administration is twisting the EPA’s mission on its head, and sacrificing our health and the livelihoods of our families for the sake of billionaires’ profits. We won’t stand by while the few protections we have left are dismantled. We demand clean air, safe water, and a healthy future for every family, no matter their ZIP code.” – Mar Zepeda, Legislative Director, Climate Justice Alliance

“Fifty-five years ago, people-power led by communities on the frontlines of pollution and injustice pushed our government to create the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA. That power still lives in environmental justice communities today. The EPA is meant to protect us from corporate polluters. Now is the moment to demand a new path, one where the EPA and our government truly embed environmental justice, honor community leadership, and deliver full health protections our communities have fought for across generations.”– Paulina López, Duwamish River Community Coalition, Seattle, Member of the Environmental Justice Leadership Forum

“Intense public concern over pollution and advances in science led to the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 55 years ago. Today, clean air, clean water, safe food and thriving communities remain enduring demands of the American people. The Trump Administration’s rollback of critical environmental regulations, elimination of environmental justice grants, and attacks on science fundamentally betray EPA’s mission and stand on the wrong side of history. Join the conversation about creating a roadmap for an EPA and federal government that truly protects public health and the environment, addresses the climate crisis, and embeds justice and equity throughout its programs.” –Charles Lee, Principle Author of the foundational report Toxic Wastes and Race, former Senior Policy Adviser at the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights at the EPA, Visiting Scholar at Howard University School of Law

“When the first Earthday gathering happened, thousands of people turned up in Central Park on the Upper West Side of Manhattan to demand that we, as a nation, pay more attention to addressing environmental threats and harms. Just a few miles north in the historic Harlem neighborhood a huge Black and brown community was struggling with air pollution triggered asthma rates, lead poisoning from old housing stock, a lack of green space, and many other environmental threats. But for the most part my neighbors and I had no idea the historic Earthday gathering was taking place in Central Park, and we were not invited. One especially significant outgrowth of the first Earthday celebration was the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. I didn’t know it at the time, but the standing-up of the U.S. EPA and the formation of West Harlem Environmental Action (WE ACT) some seventeen years later, would become intertwined as we worked to fight against a host of environmental harms enveloping our community. Most especially air pollution owing to the fact that we had the highest levels of PM 2.5 exposure of any community in the United States. Along with alarmingly high incidences of asthma and rates of premature death from asthma and other respiratory diseases. In collaboration with Harlem Hospital, the Columbia University Children’s Environmental Health Center, and the NY Urban program of NRDC we worked for thirty years to urge EPA to lower the level of the PM 2.5 standard which triggered local, state and federal action to improve air quality, particularly in overburdened communities like ours. Last year the Biden-Harris administration finally lowered the PM 2.5 standard from 12 to 9 micrograms. But a few days ago the current administration decided to abandon that revised standard and revert back to the higher level of allowable exposure. We know that many more people will die as a result of exposure to this hazardous air pollutant. Rest assured that we will not relent in our advocacy to restore EPA to its former glory, and to see them once again vigorously enforce environmental regulations to protect vulnerable communities like ours.” – Vernice Miller-Travis, Co-Founder and Board Member of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, Executive Vice President at Metropolitan Group

“Dr. Clarice E. Gaylord, the first Director and Founder of EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice along with a cadre of early environmental justice grassroot community leaders and a multi-discipline force of dedicated individuals from academia, business, local government and nonprofit organizations laid the groundwork for such a Roadmap. Prime examples were created both Agency specific as well as via interagency partnerships to promote national community driven projects. Two of these examples I managed and are most proud of is the 2003 EJ Collaborative Problem Solving (EJCPS) Grant Program (led by Dr. Gaylord) and the 2005 Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) Program (led by Rob Brenner formerly of the Office of Air and Radiation). Most importantly, was the development of Agency wide management of these two programs. There was both a national management as well as a regional management. EPA headquarters and regions managed the EJCPS program and for the CARE program there was added specific federal interagency agencies to assist in management. Building upon the foundation of these two very successful programs, with adequate time and resources could begin tackling the complex social and economic problems in local communities across the nation.” – Dr. Marva King Lorthridge, former Senior Policy Advisor with the Environmental Justice Office of the EPA

“People-power built the EPA 55 years ago, and people-power must save it now. As corporate polluters work to gut safeguards and steer the agency away from its mission, we cannot lose sight of what’s at stake. The Environmental Protection Network stands with communities across the country in demanding an EPA that truly serves the public — one that centers communities, equity and justice in every decision.” – Michelle Roos, Executive Director, Environmental Protection Network

The City of Bloomington, in partnership with the Indiana Energy Independence Fund, has received a $250,000 Municipal Investment Fund (MIF) grant to advance its newly created Bloomington Energy Works program, which offers free energy audits and provides educational opportunities on the benefits of energy efficiency and clean energy projects.

The Municipal Investment Fund is a 50-state strategy launched by Coalition for Green Capital (CGC) and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability USA (ICLEI USA) to empower communities to use public/private investing to accelerate the development and construction of smart energy infrastructure projects across the country.

Bloomington Energy Works will drive a public-private partnership plan to develop finance ready clean power and energy efficiency projects. The program will use a ‘whole community approach’ to accelerate the development of a project pipeline that grows the local economy, lowers energy costs, and builds grid resilience. Further, participation in this program opens the door to potential $2 million in additional funding to accelerate energy projects that benefit Bloomington residents and businesses.

“Preparing Bloomington for the future means strengthening our infrastructure, lowering costs for residents, and supporting good local jobs,” said Mayor Kerry Thomson. “We’re proud to have been selected by the Coalition for Green Capital and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability to participate in the Municipal Investment Fund program and receive a $250,000 grant. This partnership gives us the tools to plan and deliver projects that make daily life more reliable, affordable, and efficient for everyone who lives and works here.”

Bloomington Energy Works offers free energy audits to developers and large commercial, manufacturing, nonprofit, and academic institution building owners located within the city limits. The audits will be completed by Donovan Energy, an energy efficiency consultant, on a first come, first serve basis. The audits will result in a list of impactful energy conservation measures tailored to each site plan review or building’s energy consumption such as HVAC optimization, heat pump HVAC upgrades, LED lighting upgrades, solar system installations, etc. Building owners will be provided information about available incentives and a complete financial analysis to understand the return on investments. Sign up for a free energy audit by visiting the Bloomington Energy Works’ website and filling out the application.

Additionally, Bloomington Energy Works will conduct a new public outreach campaign called Energy Navigator!, in partnership with Electrify Indiana, to promote energy efficiency solutions to Bloomington residents. Electrify Indiana will train volunteers to conduct a door to door campaign and give group presentations as well as organize show and tell open houses. To sign up to volunteer or learn about dates and times of events, visit the Bloomington Energy Works website.

“We are grateful that the Coalition for Green Capital and ICLEI – Local Governments for Sustainability chose our community from 114 applicants because we brought them a smart plan to increase renewable energy and energy efficient projects that both benefits the entire community and can leverage every public and private dollar spent,” said Shawn Miya, Assistant Director of Sustainability. “These resources will help us fund the next phase in planning that will result in funding shovel-ready projects that will bring investments to our community, lower cost, protect residents’ health and build local resilience in the face of rising energy costs impacting our community and others like ours across the country.”

Bloomington was selected by ICLEI USA because of the potential impacts that the projects would have directly for the community as well as the expected attractiveness the project would have for both future grants and private investments. By receiving the grant, Bloomington will develop a smart, competitive and ultimately cost-effective plan that would be a win-win for both the community as well as potential investors.

Richard Kauffman, the CEO of the Coalition for Green Capital, said, “We are honored to provide funding to communities across the United States under the MIF program so they can take initial steps toward bringing America clean, affordable energy in this time of crisis. We congratulate the winners of this vigorous competition. They are real heroes.”

“This funding is about unlocking local leadership and moving forward the kinds of projects that communities have been ready to deliver for years,” said Saharnaz Mirzazad, Executive Director of ICLEI USA. “These awards show how public-private partnerships can lead to real progress on energy, infrastructure, and economic resilience. These projects make communities safer, lower energy costs, and meet local needs head-on.”

“Smart, targeted federal support through funding, workforce development and improved threat intelligence sharing is essential,” Tim Lindahl, president and CEO of Kenergy Corp., testified at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy.

“This will help close the resource gap and ensure rural communities are not left behind in the national effort to secure our energy infrastructure.”

Specifically, Lindahl asked lawmakers to reauthorize the Department of Energy’s Rural and Municipal Utility Cybersecurity Program and release its remaining funds. RMUC, a $250 million, five-year program authorized by Congress through fiscal year 2026, represents what he called “a generational opportunity to improve the cybersecurity posture of electric cooperatives and municipally owned electric utilities.”

“RMUC prioritizes co-ops with the greatest need of support that serve the nation’s most critical infrastructure, including military installations, to help them make the necessary investment to secure the grid,” Lindahl said.

Last fall, DOE announced $80 million in RMUC funding that will directly support more than 400 electric co-ops’ cybersecurity programs.

“Much of that funding has yet to be released to the award winners,” Lindahl said. “We encourage DOE to move expeditiously to distribute the awarded funds so that electric cooperatives can put them into action to defend their critical infrastructure.”

Electric co-ops face unique challenges in securing the grid because of their rural, often remote, locations and the fact that they are not-for-profit businesses, he said.

“Because cooperatives operate without shareholders or profit incentives, financing costly investments often requires reliance on debt, which must be approved by their boards and is ultimately paid back through rates paid by their members,” Lindahl explained, adding that one in four households served by co-ops earns less than $35,000 a year.

“These resource constraints can make it difficult to invest in advanced technologies and recruit and retain a skilled cyber workforce necessary to defend against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks, especially those from nation-state actors.”

Despite these obstacles, co-ops are uniting to do everything they can to improve their cyber readiness, said Lindahl, whose Henderson-based co-op serves over 60,000 homes and businesses.

“Co-ops across the country are coming together and thinking innovatively to overcome these challenges,” he said. “The seven cooperative principles, like concern for community and cooperation among cooperatives, are the driving force behind what we do.

“Additionally, our national trade association, NRECA, is leveraging private and public dollars to develop cybersecurity tools and resources to improve information sharing, deploy new technologies and build a capable workforce.”

Among those tools, he said, are the NRECA Threat Analysis Center, a secure technology platform that helps the co-op community detect, analyze and communicate cybersecurity threats, and the Co-op Cyber Goals Program, which helps co-ops improve their cyber defenses.

Electric co-ops are committed to doing their part, but collaborating with the federal government remains crucial, Lindahl said.

“With continued partnership and targeted investment, we can strengthen our defenses, protect critical infrastructure, and keep the lights on for 42 million Americans. The last two decades have seen significant advancement in how electric cooperatives secure our grid, but there is much more work still to do.”

(the ""Company"") (TSXV: DME) (U.S. OTC: DMEHF) (Frankfurt: QM01) from the President of the Company. DME is pleased to announce it has signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to form a joint venture to build and operate a sodium–nickel–chloride (""SNC"") battery manufacturing facility in Roswell, New Mexico. The proposed operation would utilize produced water from regional oil and gas wells as part of an environmentally responsible cooling and processing system designed to support both battery production and a planned artificial-intelligence (""AI"") data-center complex.

Strategic Use of Produced Water & Integration with AI Data Center

Under the contemplated structure, produced water from area operators would be treated and repurposed for cooling and processing needs, thereby significantly reducing the volume of water extracted from the aquifer, as well as lowering operating costs for smaller oil and gas producers. Desert Mountain Energy's own wells generate minimal produced water, but the Company's processing expertise positions it to serve as a strategic solutions provider to neighboring operators.

The initiative also supports the Company's plan to use its natural-gas resources to generate local electricity for the produced-water system and the adjacent AI data-center infrastructure, creating a vertically integrated and energy-efficient footprint.

Sodium, REE and By-Product Management

As part of the produced-water treatment process, salts and certain critical rare earth elements (""REEs"") are extracted and separated.

Sodium will be dried and utilized directly in the production of SNC battery units.

Isolated REEs will be dried, sealed, and shipped to qualified facilities for further refining.

This creates multiple value-added revenue streams while minimizing waste and maximizing the commercial usefulness of extracted materials.

About SNC Battery Technology

Sodium–nickel–chloride batteries are known for their stability, long lifecycle, and strong safety profile. Unlike lithium-ion systems, SNC batteries cannot burn or explode, making them well-suited for grid support, industrial power systems, and data-center applications. Altech Batteries Ltd., a global leader in the space, is currently constructing a US$170 million SNC plant in Saxony, Germany, underscoring the technology's growing commercial relevance.

Altech's publicly available research notes several advantages for SNC chemistry, including the potential for alumina sourced from recycled specialty aircraft components—supporting broader circular-economy initiatives.

Economic Benefits for Roswell and the State of New Mexico

The joint venture and associated AI-infrastructure development are expected to create new job opportunities and diversify revenue sources for Chaves County and the State of New Mexico. Increased support services for smaller oil and gas operators—including lower disposal costs and extended well life—are expected to lead to higher production levels, which in turn increase tax contributions to local schools, counties, and state programs.

The initiative aligns with local, state, and federal programs offering incentives for energy-transition manufacturing, critical-materials management, and advanced-technology deployment, including elements referenced in yesterday's Genesis Mission Executive Order from the White House.",https://www.nacleanenergy.com/images/,N,,2025-12-02 22:58:48.045419

That’s a design, manufacturing, and governance reality, not a marketing claim. As Steve Richey, VP at eBliss Global, puts it: “Battery safety in all applications is and should be a concern for all people. This starts with good stewardship and understanding of any assembly, manufacturing, and use of a battery pack. Brands own a responsibility to design and produce safe products and an obligation to share proper usage.”

Recalls, and battery supplier risk

Recent headlines highlight the risks. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) urged consumers to stop using and properly dispose of certain Rad Power Bikes batteries (models RP-1304 and HL-RP-S1304) after dozens of reports of fires and significant property damage. The New York Times reports on the CPSC advisory, emphasizing the urgency of the issue.

CPSC said in its news release the following: “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris. CPSC is aware of 31 reports of fire, including 12 reports of property damage totaling approximately $734,500. Some of these incidents occurred when the battery was not charging, the product was not in use, and the product was in storage. The batteries were manufactured in China.”

China is the world’s largest source of lithium-ion cells and packs, with both top-tier manufacturers and low-cost vendors, making robust battery suppliers vetting essential. The key risks with third-party battery suppliers include inconsistent cell grading and matching, undocumented part substitutions, relabeled or counterfeit cells, weak battery management system calibration, inadequate process controls for moisture and contamination, poor weld and insulation quality, gaps in traceability, and logistics exposures such as temperature extremes and handling damage.

Tesla recently recalled about 10,500 Powerwall 2 home battery systems due to a third-party battery cell defect that could cause overheating and, in some cases, smoke or fire. If a high-end, stationary system can be exposed to a supplier defect, the risk from third-party or mismatched batteries and chargers in e-bikes is even clearer.

Rad Power Bikes disputes the CPSC’s findings, citing a low incident rate compared to over 100,000 units and claiming compliance with high standards, stating, “The incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent. While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products.”

The statement continues: “Contrary to the CPSC's statement, mere exposure to water and debris does not create a hazard; rather, significant water exposure, as warned against in our manuals, can pose a hazard. These risks apply across industries and exist even in products that are fully UL compliant.”

Certify the system, not just the pack

This kind of conflict is precisely what unified, enforceable standards aim to prevent, where everyone in the e-bike ecosystem agrees to follow — manufacturers, third-party battery suppliers, importers, retailers, building managers, and riders.

When standards are harmonized, independently verified, and tied to traceable certifications, disputes can be resolved with data against an agreed baseline. Without that baseline, safety becomes a negotiation, with different rules by city, landlord, marketplace, or brand allowing risky products or practices to linger in the market and in homes.

Uniform standards must address the entire electrical system, not just the battery pack. That means mandating recognized certifications for both the pack and the complete e-bike system, validating cell quality, battery management architecture, thermal and abuse performance, ingress protection, and charger compatibility, to name a few.

Enforcement, traceability, and rider education

But paper standards without enforcement are promises without protection. Regulators should harmonize requirements across jurisdictions and enforce them at ports, during market surveillance, and on online platforms, blocking uncertified or counterfeit packs and mismatched chargers. Retailers must require third-party documentation, maintain verifiable serial numbers linked to certification files, and support rapid incident reporting. When hazards emerge, recalls and advisories need practical pathways for collection and safe disposal through municipal hazardous waste channels.

Riders need accessible, certified service options when battery packs are damaged, water-intruded, or show early warning signs. As Richey emphasizes, education is part of the engineering solution: proper charging, storage, and use, plus recognition of “key warning signs of battery degradation and or failure,” supported by “recent certifications, warnings, and education.”

Battery safety is not just a marketing claim; it is a system property that must be engineered, verified, and enforced. To prevent fires from making headlines, a baseline with unified standards is necessary, along with providing riders with education and access to certified service and end-of-life collection. When all stakeholders operate under the same rules and face the same consequences, safety stops being a matter of debate.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt36e77ec5607b90bc/692f3eb8494432e501a2fa5b/GettyImages-2217284511.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 16:01:49.385409

The news isn’t surprising, of course, as federal tax credits have disappeared. What is surprising, however, is the rise of gas-powered Mustang sales. In November, Ford sold nearly as many pony cars as it did EVs. I don’t just mean the Mach-E, but all electric Ford offerings combined.

Mustang sales have been slow this year up until this point. The automaker moved just over 1,800 examples in September. But Mustang shoppers turned out in force in November, with Ford selling an impressive 4,207 Mustangs last month.

By comparison, the Blue Oval brand only sold 4,247 EVs. That would be the Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning, and the E-Transit. Each of those models experienced a rapid drop-off last month. But one month only tells part of the story.

Overall, the EV lineup has achieved a greater sales volume year-to-date compared to the Mustang alone. Ford has sold nearly 80,000 electric vehicles in 2025 compared to just over 40,000 Mustangs.

While Mustang sales are still down year-to-date, the November uptick helps close the gap. This time last year, Ford had sold 41,528 Mustangs. In 2025, that figure is 40,870. The electric vehicle drop-off is worsening for Ford, particularly for the Lightning and E-Transit.

Ford moved just 227 electric vans in November. Just a year prior, Ford sold 1,240 examples of the electric Transit in the same month. That’s an 82 percent dip. The Lightning is down 72 percent this month compared to the prior year.

There are a few bright spots in Ford’s sales numbers. The Maverick is doing great. Ford sold 9,883 units in November, compared to 6,899 at the same time last year. Additionally, the Ranger is up 36 percent in November compared to the same month last year. As a whole, the automaker is up over 6 percent year-to-date.

It will be interesting to see if the Mustang finishes the year on a high note. The iconic pony car is experiencing a 1.6 percent decline in sales year-to-date compared to 2024. A strong December, however, could push it in the right direction.

As for the EVs in the family, the drop is likely to continue unless Ford serves up some serious incentives. So if you’re shopping for an EV, keep your eyes peeled for some serious deals as we head deeper into the holiday season.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBXv6k/s1/2026-mustang-ecoboost-with-the-rtr-package.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:00.931859

Two LNG export projects with a combined 0.6Bcf/d are under construction.
The country stands to benefit economically from serving as a distribution hub while also expanding its influence in global gas markets.
North America’s combined LNG additions through 2029 place the region at the center of global supply growth.","North America is positioned for a major expansion of liquefied natural gas export capacity by the end of the decade, with the United States, Canada and Mexico expected to add more than 17Bcf/d of new liquefaction capacity by 2029, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration. The additions would more than double the region’s export capacity and represent more than half of global LNG growth projected through 2029.

The United States remains the primary driver of this expansion. With 15.4Bcf/d of existing capacity, US developers plan to add 13.9Bcf/d between 2025 and 2029 through a series of Gulf Coast projects. Several terminals, including Plaquemines LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 and Corpus Christi Stage III, have begun limited cargo shipments despite not having entered commercial operation. Five additional projects are under construction after reaching final investment decisions: Port Arthur LNG Phase 1, Rio Grande LNG, Woodside Louisiana LNG, Golden Pass LNG and CP2 Phase 1. Pipeline construction delays remain a key risk for the timing of future export flows.

Canada is advancing capacity on the Pacific Coast. LNG Canada shipped its first cargo from Train 1 in July 2025 and is expected to reach full capacity of 1.84Bcf/d in 2026. A proposed second phase would double the facility’s capacity after 2029. Two more projects, Woodfibre LNG and Cedar LNG, with a combined capacity of 0.7Bcf/d, are scheduled to begin exports between 2027 and 2028. Their location shortens shipping times to Asian markets compared with exports from the Gulf Coast.

Mexico is emerging as a strategic component of this regional expansion, even though its new capacity is comparatively smaller. Two LNG export projects with a combined 0.6Bcf/d are under construction. The Fast LNG Altamira platform off the East Coast, supplied with US gas through the Sur de Texas–Tuxpan pipeline, produced Mexico’s first LNG export cargo in August 2024. On the Pacific Coast, Energía Costa Azul is adding 0.4Bcf/d of capacity, also reliant on US feedgas. Both projects support Mexico’s shift toward becoming a re-export and transit hub for North American natural gas.

Implications of North American LNG Growth for Mexico

Mexico’s geographic position and growing midstream network are central to this shift. The country’s pipeline interconnections with the United States, along with access to both the Gulf and Pacific basins, have strengthened its role as a distribution corridor for regional gas flows. Industry analyses note that Mexico is positioned to expand from a net importer to a commercial platform that can process, store, and re-export natural gas to global markets. This evolution aligns with private-sector interest in leveraging LNG infrastructure to connect US supply with Asian and Pacific demand.

However, the strategy also raises structural questions for Mexico’s domestic energy system. The country remains heavily dependent on US pipeline gas for power generation and industry, and its emerging LNG capacity is not tied to increased local production. Independent analysts warn that large-scale export-oriented buildouts could raise wholesale gas prices and affect electricity affordability for consumers and industrial users, especially if global LNG markets tighten. Growing reliance on cross-border gas flows also places greater importance on regulatory stability, permitting timelines and pipeline reliability.

The broader geopolitical context adds another layer of complexity. US energy diplomacy has increasingly centered on securing long-term LNG influence, encouraging partner countries to sign multi-decade supply contracts. This approach offers supply stability but can lock importing nations into fossil fuel systems with long-term financial commitments. Global analyses indicate that as renewable energy and storage technologies become more cost-competitive, long-term LNG infrastructure could carry opportunity costs for emerging markets. These dynamics are relevant for Mexico, whose energy policy prioritizes sovereignty and domestic production but must also respond to regional market pressures.

Latin America is already grappling with the implications of this shift. Analysts note that new LNG import infrastructure across the region, including in Mexico, can reinforce long-term dependence on fossil fuels and divert investment away from renewable generation and electrification. The United States has also demonstrated willingness to use tariffs to influence energy behavior, as seen in its recent tariff increases on India for continued purchases of Russian energy. Such actions signal the potential for trade and energy policy linkages to affect future decisions in Mexico and across the hemisphere.

Mexico’s role in the regional LNG network is therefore multifaceted. The country stands to benefit economically from serving as a distribution hub while also expanding its influence in global gas markets. At the same time, increased exposure to LNG volatility and structural reliance on imported gas require careful coordination between regulators, state-owned companies and private investors. Future policy decisions will influence whether LNG infrastructure reinforces long-term national strategies or creates new dependencies during a period of rapid global energy transition.

North America’s combined LNG additions through 2029 place the region at the center of global supply growth. The timing and execution of US, Canadian, and Mexican projects will shape international gas markets and regional energy security, with Mexico increasingly positioned at the crossroads of these shifts.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/pexels-photo-13378350%20%281%29.jpeg?h=62c404c8&itok=D7L-z16m,N,,2025-12-02 16:03:49.185600

Automakers are betting on hybrids as they cope with an EV slowdown

Ford sold only 4,247 all-electric vehicles last month.

The loss of key electric-vehicle tax credits is still hurting automakers. That pain could linger, but there's a lone bright spot for the industry: Hybrid sales are surging.

First, the bad news. Ford Motor Co. (F) said Tuesday that it sold just 4,247 all-electric vehicles last month, a nearly 61% decline from the 10,821 units the Detroit automaker delivered in November 2024. That steep hit stems from poorer sales of each of Ford's EV models.

Sales of Ford's most popular EV, the Mustang Mach-E SUV, dropped by more than 49%, while deliveries of the E-Transit van took an 81.7% hit compared with a year earlier. Just 1,006 F-150 Lightning pickup trucks were sold last month, which reflects a 72.4% year-over-year decline as Ford reportedly considers axing the model.

At the same time, Ford is selling more hybrid vehicles. The Detroit automaker has delivered more than 206,000 hybrid vehicles through November, a 19.4% increase compared with the same 11-month period in 2024. It sold 16,301 hybrids last month, up 13.6% from a year before.

Part of that dynamic is because hybrids are typically viewed by consumers as an attractive alternative to expensive all-electric vehicles, since they are more eco-friendly than traditional gas-powered cars. In the wake of the expiration of the U.S. government's $7,500 tax credits for EVs, some automakers are also putting hybrids into focus.

More from MarketWatch: Tesla's Cybertruck is turning 2. It has been a big flop.

""We thought we were going to leapfrog the hybrids, but we can't,"" Kjell Gruner, CEO of Volkswagen Group of America, said at an October Reuters conference when discussing his company's plan to focus on EVs. ""We're all in"" on hybrids, he added.

That's part of why Toyota Motor Corp (JP:7203) plans to invest heavily to boost hybrid production in the U.S. over the next five years. Honda Motor Co. (JP:7267) also plans to double down on hybrids in the U.S., with a platform designed for large-scale vehicles.

Ford is ""prioritizing hybrids across our lineup, including the development of extended-range hybrid options,"" CEO Jim Farley said on his company's third-quarter earnings call.

Hyundai Motor North America said Tuesday that U.S. sales of its Ioniq 5 SUV and Ioniq 6 sedan more than halved in November compared with a year earlier. Kia America Inc. also reported steep declines in sales of its electric SUVs: the EV9 and EV6.

Executives at both companies owned by Hyundai Motor Co. (KR:005380) touted their hybrid lineups. Randy Parker, the chief executive at Hyundai's North American business, also noted that the brand hit a new monthly record for hybrid sales, which grew 42%.

Hochul’s decision to direct NYPA towards advanced nuclear development marks a pivotal moment for New York’s industrial future.","New York has taken a significant step toward reintroducing nuclear energy as a core component of its long-term industrial and economic strategy. In June 2025, Gov. Kathy Hochul directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to pursue development of an advanced nuclear facility, signaling that the state is preparing to meet rapid load growth driven by advanced manufacturing, data centers and electronification. This shift positions New York to compete for the next generation of power-intensive industries, including semiconductor fabrication, artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and advanced materials production.

For companies evaluating expansion or site selection in New York, this moment presents a rare opportunity to engage early as the state defines its approach to its advanced nuclear deployment.

New York’s Policy Shift Toward Advanced Nuclear

Gov. Hochul’s directive reflects a broader national and global trend: advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular rectors (SMRs) are moving from concept to commercial readiness. Her public statements frame nuclear power as a tool to:

Attract large, energy-intensive manufacturers to upstate New York;

Strengthen grid reliability as AI, cloud services and electronification accelerate demand;

Provide stable, zero-emission baseload that complements intermittent renewables; and

Position the state as a leader in next-generation clean-energy deployment.

The combination of strong public support from the governor and the NYPA mandate creates a strategic opening for companies with significant future energy needs.

Technology Landscape: Advanced Reactors Move Toward Deployment

Advanced reactors represent a fundamental shift in how nuclear energy can be deployed and financed.

Modular manufacturing: SMRs can be factory-built, shipped and deployed quickly, reducing construction duration and cost risk.

Scalable output: Units can be sized to support industrial campuses, fabrication facilities or data-center clusters.

Enhanced safety: Passive safety systems decrease overheating or meltdown risk.

Grid stability: Advanced nuclear complements renewables and helps address transmission constraints.

These attributes directly align with sectors that require high-reliability and predictable long-term energy costs.

Remaining Barriers: Financing and Regulatory Certainty

Despite technological progress, deployment still faces:

Regulatory complexity, even as NRC modernizes its review process;

High capital costs in early phases; and

Financing gaps for first-of-a-kind projects.

Discussions in Congress regarding a potential national infrastructure financing authority could materially change the landscape. Federal credit support, long-term financing tools and project development incentives would reduce risk and enable deployment in markets like New York.

Strategic Considerations for Manufacturers and Large Load Users

Companies considering New York should evaluate opportunities to engage early in state planning processes. Early action can secure:

Preferential access to nuclear-enabled industrial hubs;

Priority positioning in procurement and interconnection discussions;

Eligibility for state and federal incentive programs;

Opportunities to partner with reactor developers, utilities and public agencies; and

Influence over emerging regulatory, siting and permitting frameworks.

This early engagement can materially affect cost structure, siting certainty and long-term operational competitiveness.

This milestone marks the dawn of a cleaner, more sustainable era in a place deeply rooted in Entergy’s history.

Honoring the past, powering the future

The solar facility site sits adjacent to what was once the iconic Sterlington Station, Entergy’s historic generating plant that first came online in November 1925.

In its earliest days, Sterlington Station was described as a “mighty power giant” for good reason: it started with two turbogenerators producing about 25 MW and was rapidly expanded into one of the largest power plants in the South by the late 1920s. The plant’s location was carefully chosen under the leadership of Entergy founder Harvey Couch for its access to abundant natural gas, water from the nearby Ouachita River, and its strategic position in a growing agricultural and industrial region.

Workers built a whole company town nearby: homes for about 50 families, a school, a church, even a boarding house for single employees. Over the decades, Sterlington Station fueled economic growth across northern Louisiana — and now, a century later, Entergy is writing a powerful new chapter by embracing renewable energy.

“To celebrate the ribbon-cutting of this solar facility at the very site where our roots first took place a century ago is profoundly meaningful,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president CEO. “It’s a testament to how far we’ve come — from the mighty power of Sterlington Station to the clean, sustainable promise of solar power. This is not just an investment in energy, but in Louisiana’s future.”

“The Sterlington Solar Facility stands as a powerful symbol of progress—honoring the legacy of Sterlington Station while embracing a cleaner, more resilient future for Ouachita Parish and all of Louisiana,” said Todd Edsall, president of Power Providers for Black & Veatch. “Our team’s dedication to safety and excellence is reflected in the thousands of incident-free man-hours invested here. This project is more than a source of renewable energy; it’s a catalyst for local jobs, economic opportunity and environmental stewardship. By working together with Entergy and our community partners, we’re helping to build a brighter tomorrow and ensure that Sterlington’s legacy continues to power Louisiana for generations to come.”

A clean-energy investment for the community

The Sterlington Solar Facility was approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission as part of a larger renewable energy build-out: the 49-megawatt solar project is among approximately 225 MW of new facilities greenlit to bolster Entergy Louisiana’s clean energy portfolio.

This development is more than symbolic — it reflects Entergy’s commitment to modernizing its fleet, reducing its carbon footprint and investing in north Louisiana.

“This facility reflects our long-term commitment to modernizing our energy portfolio, reducing emissions, and creating economic opportunity in Ouachita Parish and beyond,” May added. “It’s a legacy honoring the past while shaping the future.”

Economic and environmental benefits

Job creation and local spending: The project contributes to the local economy during construction and operation.

Cleaner energy: As a zero-emission solar resource, the facility helps reduce reliance on fossil fuels and supports Entergy’s sustainability commitments.

Community participation: The Sterlington Solar Facility is part of Entergy Louisiana’s “Geaux Green” (Rider GGO) program, enabling customers to opt into renewable energy and help drive demand for clean power.

Infrastructure resilience: Investing in diversified energy sources strengthens the grid and supports long-term energy reliability.

A legacy renewed

From its humble beginnings — when Harvey Couch built the Sterlington Station to bring affordable power to a growing region — to today’s solar-powered present, the Sterlington community remains at the heart of Entergy’s mission. This ribbon cutting celebrates continuity, innovation, and a shared vision for a cleaner, brighter tomorrow.

Ohio’s Marble Plastics began, as many good ideas do, from frustration and an unanswered question: Why were small, high-quality plastics slipping through the recycling system untouched? During his early career at the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, founder Joseph Klatt often found materials with clear value but no viable match, and those moments pushed him toward a different path. “I wanted to be on the side of actually doing the recycling part myself,” he said.

If there were a dictionary entry for Donald Trump’s catchphrase “drill, baby, drill”, it might be accompanied by a photo of Meg O’Neill.

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company’s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana’s history.

The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That’s basically equivalent to Woodside’s combined Australian operations. Trump’s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash “American energy dominance”. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking.

Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is “open for business”, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer.

We are bending the rules of this column: O’Neill and I are meeting for brunch, and the restaurant, Ai Fiori, has no real significance other than its convenient location at the Langham Hotel, where she is staying in New York.

We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O’Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee. Despite seven years in Australia, O’Neill is yet to embrace espresso culture. “I like American-style filtered coffee,” she says. “I brew coffee at home every morning and bring in a thermos.”

O’Neill grew up in the college town of Boulder, Colorado, studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined ExxonMobil. The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh – and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John’s on Newfoundland island.

In 2018, O’Neill joined Woodside as chief operating officer and moved to Perth, becoming its CEO in 2021. She spent most of her career in the closet – “I had a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ approach to who I was at work,” she says – but moving to Australia was the opportunity to come out. She is one of a handful of openly gay people to have led an ASX200 company.

This is O’Neill’s seventh trip back to the US this year. You can see why she might be more comfortable on this side of the Pacific right now. Here, the motto is “drill, baby, drill”, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

That includes an embarrassing 58 per cent of shareholders who voted against the company’s climate report at last year’s annual meeting, and a legal challenge to Environment Minister Murray Watt’s decision to approve an extension of Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG project to 2070. The UN’s special rapporteur on climate has just joined the case as an amicus curiae.

It doesn’t rattle O’Neill. She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels.

She says Trump’s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia.

“It’s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,” O’Neill says.

“It’s opening the conversation up to one that’s not just, ‘We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else’, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.”

O’Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy.

In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O’Neill calls “highly ambitious”. “I don’t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,” she says.

How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. “While there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,” she says.

“The question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input – that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry – has not been addressed. You’re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That’s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.”

O’Neill’s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it “very tasty”. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid.

For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found – from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

In the Australian National University’s recent study on the 2025 election, the proportion of voters who ranked climate change as their most important issue fell to 5 per cent, down from 10 per cent in 2022.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O’Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby’s bidding.

“In Australia, there’s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,” she says.

“So, I don’t know if it’s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it’s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it’s going to end up being poor for the consumers.” She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. “It’s not good for anyone.”

But the hugely controversial North West Shelf extension in Western Australia is expected to be responsible for nearly 90 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent a year – more than the annual emissions of some countries – despite conditions imposed by the federal government as part of its approval. Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country’s largest untapped conventional gas resource.

Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.

New laws that passed the federal parliament last week are a mixed bag for gas producers; coal and gas projects are not eligible for new “streamlined” approval pathways following negotiations with the Greens, but they may benefit from moves to eliminate duplication between state and federal assessments.

Part of this is, again, the Trump effect. Australia’s critical minerals deal with the US, agreed in principle during Anthony Albanese’s recent trip to Washington, means getting rare earth projects off the ground quickly. “Drill, baby, drill” is becoming not just a slogan but a policy the US exports to its allies.

O’Neill lays out a stark reality for a global company such as Woodside, which is eyeing a roughly 50-50 revenue split between Australia and the US early next decade. The US has plenty of gas, favourable taxation rates and a relatively quick process for environmental approvals. In Louisiana, the combined state and federal tax rate will be about 25 per cent.

“We have to ask ourselves first and foremost: where is the resource? Australia compares quite favourably to the US [on that],” she says.

“Where do we have confidence we can progress investments at a reasonable pace and generate returns for our shareholders? That’s where we’re fighting some headwinds in Australia.”

There has been speculation Woodside could shift its primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, but O’Neill says that’s not true. “We intend to maintain our primary listing in Australia.”

Before we leave, I ask O’Neill about life in Perth. She lives in City Beach with her wife, Vicky Hayes, and their teen daughter. Despite its isolation, O’Neill enjoys the relaxed pace and what she calls an “entrepreneurial spirit” that seems to imbue west coast cities.

“I like that feel of a city where people are ready to roll up their sleeves and make a difference,” she says. “It’s got a bit of the wild west to it.”

An NFL fan who backs the Houston Texans, O’Neill has been forcibly acquainted with Australian rules football, courtesy of Woodside’s sponsorship of the Fremantle Dockers. Woodside chairman Richard Goyder is also the outgoing chair of the AFL Commission.

O’Neill says she found the rules “a little fuzzy” and difficult to follow at first, but is now a convert and attends half a dozen matches a year. “I love the game. It’s fast-paced, it’s high scoring, there’s tremendous athleticism. It’s the full package.”

Not that the rules have gotten any easier to understand. “Like, why was this thing a push in the back and that thing was not?”

I could try to explain, but our time is up, and O’Neill is off – more meetings, and more drilling, await.

Demand for electric vehicles has taken a hit after Republican U.S. President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill ended the $7,500 tax credits for new EV purchases in October.

Ford also had to contend with the impact of a fire at one of the plants of a key aluminum supplier, hitting production of its F-150 Lightning electric pickup.

Sales of Ford's EVs, such as the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 Lightning, were down about 61% to 4,247 vehicles in November from last year.

Several automakers released November U.S. sales tallies Tuesday, including South Korea's Kia Corp. 000270 , which posted a 2.7% gain, and Honda Motor 7267, which said sales for the month fell 15%, hurt by a shortage of semiconductors.

Sales of Hyundai’s two top-selling EV models in the U.S. – the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 – each fell more than 55% in November. Overall sales slipped 2%.

Randy Parker, Hyundai’s CEO of North America, told Reuters the automaker expected a sharp decline following the tax credit’s expiration. He said some shoppers who may have been interested in a fully electric car have chosen hybrids, sales of which surged 42% for the month.

""We were ahead of them by a mile, by 10 miles, on the internal combustion engine. They went into EVs, and then they convinced the Western world to go into EVs and play their game,"" the freshman lawmaker from Ohio said during an auto industry conference.

""That was just irrational, dumb policy.""

Moreno, an auto dealer turned influential policymaker in Washington, has frequently railed against Biden-era moves to set aggressive emissions targets and boost federal support for EVs. He again condemned those policies and criticized American allies for allowing Chinese autos inside their borders, even as many in the industry stress that U.S. manufacturers need to find their own success with electric powertrains or risk ceding the future to China.

The senator called out Europe as a warning sign for the United States. Chinese automakers nearly doubled their market share in the European market during the first half of 2025, now exceeding 5% of new vehicle sales per data from JATO Dynamics Ltd.

""You have to be insane to allow the Chinese to take over the auto industry all over the world in a predatory way like that,"" Moreno said, responding to a question about China's excess automotive manufacturing capacity.

""You guys have Chinese infrastructure. You have Chinese automobiles,"" he continued.

""Why would you allow a country to bring in automobiles that would destroy your own industrial sector? That is, they're not here to compete. They're here to destroy. And you have, what, 90 car companies in China, all subsidized by the government, trying to kill each other.

""That's not about healthy competition. It's about taking over the auto industry and making the world dependent on their technology.""

Moreno also celebrated major policy changes during the first year of the Trump administration that cut back on the Biden-era federal push toward EVs. He highlighted congressional action to cancel stringent state-level EV regulations, the zeroing out of fuel economy fines and an end to federal EV subsidies.

Yet more changes are coming, as the Trump administration completed a review last month of key fuel economy standards. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the White House is expected to announce the new regulations Wednesday.

""We're not going to play (China's) game. We're playing our game, and we're not going to allow these cars to come into the U.S. market,"" Moreno said. He also said consumer preferences should guide automakers in the adoption of EVs and other new technologies.

The lawmaker's remarks came during an on-stage conversation with John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. His organization, the top automotive lobbying group in Washington, put on the conference Tuesday, bringing together policymakers, analysts and industry leaders.

Bozzella probed at Moreno's EV stance: ""Do we need to have a balance, though, between supporting our current leadership on internal combustion engines and remaining a cutting-edge technology developer for automotive technologies of the future? Do you worry that we risk becoming sort of an island market if we aren't keeping up with technology investments?""

The senator was unmoved. ""I pushed back on the premise that EV somehow is about innovation,"" he said. ""Electric vehicles were around in 1910. It's not like this new technology.""

""I'm all for innovation, but having a car driven by a 2,000-pound battery is not innovation in my mind. Now, maybe at some point in the future, there's somebody out there that invents something new. Who knows what comes up? But government shouldn't play the role of putting their hands in the scale.""

More data center worries It’s crucial to manage data center development to prevent transferring costs to other customers and to avoid worsening climate impact, said Jimenez, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.","In early October, one hand after another shot up across a packed room at Matthews Town Hall, where more than 100 people impatiently waited to speak. They called out comments for over two hours, eager to challenge a developer’s vision for a sprawling data center campus near downtown.

The proposed complex would span 123 acres and place five two-story buildings on a mostly wooded lot, with capacity for 600 megawatts — dwarfing all other data centers in the state and requiring enough juice to power about 450,000 average homes for a year.

Many residents felt like Lindsay Sawey, who lives near the proposed site. “They can’t change my mind,” she told The Charlotte Observer during the meeting. “I’m just here so that I can complain.”

The room grew heated as people peppered officials with questions about noise, power bills, water usage and fire safety. Still, not everyone opposed the plan. One man stormed out, calling his neighbors close-minded and yelling: “You won’t listen to the experts.”

It’s a ferocious debate playing out across the Charlotte region, as well as nationally and globally.

Over the past couple of years, the surging use of artificial intelligence fueling apps, websites and other tech has turbocharged the need for rapid expansion of massive data centers to handle the demand. The Carolinas is now seen nationally as a rising hub that’s helping expand that supply.

At this tipping-point moment for the industry here, new and serious concerns have emerged, The Observer found:

The energy needs of 30 data centers that are planned or under construction across the Carolinas, according to one industry report, would more than double the current energy needs in the Carolinas.

Projected demand on the power grid creates a slew of unknowns that North Carolina utility regulators have only recently begun to grapple with publicly.

The lack of public disclosure about the industry’s growth leaves the public in the dark over such basic questions as: how many data centers are in the Charlotte region now, what’s coming next and how much energy will they use?

“Without any transparency, without any sort of central source of information, it’s understandable to be very worried,” said Nick Jimenez with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit.

Understanding data centers

Americans have lived with data centers for the better part of a century. They began in 1945 at the University of Pennsylvania with the advent of computers.

Such centers operated inconspicuously in the Charlotte region for decades. Two data centers on a block on East Trade Street in uptown went virtually unnoticed until one of them filed for expansion in September.

But over the past couple years, their rapidly expanding scale is unprecedented and impossible to ignore.

“AI is really transforming the data center landscape,” said Eric Masanet, professor in sustainability science for emerging technologies at UC Santa Barbara. “A lot of investments are being made, a lot of competitive models being developed, that’s requiring lots and lots of additional AI servers, which require lots and lots of additional data centers.”

Today’s data centers are warehouse-like facilities housing computer servers and components essential for storing, processing and disseminating large amounts of data.

Tech giants such as Google and Amazon own Charlotte-region data centers. Other owners include Digital Realty and Segra, whose sites are built for a single user or as “colocation” sites with space leased to multiple businesses.

Not all data centers are alike. AI-oriented data centers are designed to support complex AI workloads, while traditional data centers focus on general computing tasks.

That means the facilities also operate differently. For example, Segra’s data center near Charlotte airport is cooled using HVAC while bigger data centers proposed for the region, like the one proposed in Matthews, use a closed-loop water system.

Segra, a Charlotte-based fiber network, recently doubled its size to 28,000 square feet at International Airport Drive with a $10 million investment.

Digital Realty, a Texas firm, plans to knock down a pair of century-old office buildings and construct a four-story, 12 MW data center on East Trade Street covering nearly the entire block. It also intends to open what would be the region’s largest data center campus in west Charlotte at 400 MW and 3 million square feet.

Here’s how such power usage breaks down, according to Duke Energy:

100 MW is equivalent to powering 75,000 homes.

1,000 MW equals 1 gigawatt, or GW, equivalent to powering about 750,000 homes.

Apple’s data center in Maiden, spanning 505,000 square feet, is currently the state’s largest data center with capacity for 100 MW. The $1 billion complex elevated the Catawba County area northwest of Charlotte as a data center corridor when it opened in 2010.

Big Tech continues to pour billions of dollars into Carolinas’ data centers to keep up with AI demand.

In February, Apple announced a $500 billion expansion plan for data center capacity and other projects around the U.S., including its North Carolina sites. And in October, Amazon broke ground on a 20-building, $10 billion data center to support its AI needs on 800 acres in Richmond County, between Charlotte and Raleigh.

Data center scale remains blurry

So how many data centers are in the Carolinas? Where are they and how much energy do they use?

No definitive public source can answer that.

Companies such as Chicago-based real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield offer some insight by combining information from multiple public and private entities. The Carolinas, counted as one group, appeared as an emerging market for the first time in the firm’s annual America’s Data Center Update list.

There are 67 data centers operating in the Carolinas, according to the report released in September. Another 26 — many substantially bigger than existing ones — are planned and four are under construction.

The Charlotte region, including Rock Hill, accounts for more than half of the existing data centers with 38, said John McWilliams, head of data center insights at Cushman & Wakefield. The region also has one center under construction and another 22 planned.

A quarter of the centers under construction in the Carolinas are in the Charlotte area, McWilliams said.

All told, the Carolinas has projects requiring a combined 400 MW under construction and another 2.7 gigawatts for planned projects, McWilliams said. That’s nearly double the current energy needs in the Carolinas.

Another company examining growth, Datacentermap.com, tracks thousands of facilities and offers energy capacity statistics on some sites. But company founder Sune Christesen, who provided the Observer with the firm’s data, cautioned that the company wasn’t confident about the stage of development each center was in as changes are hard to track.

When the Observer set out to verify Datacentermap.com data, most companies on its list responded, but not all shared basic information.

For instance, Microsoft refused to confirm the project status of the data centers planned or under construction near Hickory, Maiden and Roxboro near Durham, despite having posts about the ones in the Hickory and Maiden markets on its website.

Other local projects also have been shrouded in secrecy.

Residents frustrated with data center approval

On Nov. 7, 2022, just over the state line from Charlotte, York County Council members in South Carolina unanimously approved a seemingly routine 27-item consent agenda. It included a plan little noticed at the time: the first step for the county selling 173 acres in the Lake Wylie area.

A week later, the board held a special meeting for second approval on what it now said was an economic development deal dubbed “Project Cobra.” The meeting lasted all of two minutes.

The council unanimously approved the sale the following week, with no mention of what “Project Cobra” entailed.

That picture began to get clearer seven months later. In June 2023, York officials said the project and a related incentives deal involved a whopping billion-dollar investment for a new data center — the largest economic investment in county history.

As is common in such development work, the name of the company still was not publicly revealed. But the Observer’s sister paper, The Herald in Rock Hill, soon sussed out that a Kansas data center firm called QTS was behind the deal.

A September 2023 county agenda officially disclosed that “Project Cobra” was for QTS, and the council unanimously approved the data center incentives deal.

QTS is investing $1 billion to build a nearly 5.3 million-square-foot data center campus on 400 acres in the Lake Wylie area. County leaders later approved allowing the campus to be built 80 feet high, 20 feet taller than other industrial or commercial properties.

But QTS said it does not release expected megawatts totals of its data centers.

More than three years after the county first referenced “Project Cobra,” and over two years after York County revealed who was behind the project, QTS held an informal community meet-and-greet Nov. 4 in Lake Wylie.

“This has been secretive like I’ve never seen,” one of the residents said, as a group of people huddled around QTS Development Program Manager Ryan Wehmann, bombarding him with questions.

Stacy Armstrong agreed. “We could not win because we didn’t know it was coming,” said Armstrong, whose Wedgefield Drive home borders the data center construction site.

Armstrong carried an inch-plus-thick notebook of documents and illustrations from research she’d done on the QTS plans, along with questions about potential risks from light pollution, noise levels and electric bill hikes.

“And the more we ask, the less scientific data we get,” Armstrong said. “ I have a ton of questions. I have less answers.”

She was about to undertake a major house renovation, but no more. Now, she’s planning to move.

Power demand impact

Public sector and nonprofit organizations are tuning in to the implications of this tech-sector boom.

In August, Gov. Josh Stein created the North Carolina Energy Policy Task Force, noting the need to power data centers amid the emergence of AI, among other trends, prompted new questions about how to “maintain an adequate, reliable, affordable, and clean electricity supply”.

And in October, the North Carolina Utilities Commission hosted a conference to study how to fairly and efficiently manage the growing electricity demand.

Key concerns included whether the power grid can handle the new demand, whether existing customers will have to pay more and what energy companies would do if they put resources into a big expansion only for the project to fall through.

The Carolinas risk power outages during winter storms in the mornings and evenings, said Stony Martin, manager of reliability, models and studies at the Southeastern Electric Reliability Corp. The nonprofit is a watchdog for the electric grid in the southeastern and central U.S.

Martin said at the conference that “the risk will only get worse” with expected demand from major energy customers like data centers.

Duke Energy is aware of the concerns.

The Charlotte-based utility giant assesses each high-demand proposal to determine if it’s feasible with the existing power grid, if it would require updates and whether the location is feasible, Duke Energy spokesman Garrett Poorman said.

Duke Energy holds these customers to minimum billing requirements and other terms to ensure they “pay their fair share,” Poorman said.

And for the first time, Duke Energy published a report this year tracking forecasted growth from major energy users like data centers.

It counted 35 large-electric-load projects in the advanced planning stages in the Carolinas. From January 2024 to last spring, the number of projects didn’t change, but the report stated their forecasted energy needs grew by 50%.

While the report doesn’t specify how many are data centers, it’s clear that their growth is transforming the Carolinas.

“It’s not the same market that existed to serve local demand anymore,” Cushman & Wakefield’s McWilliams said. “It’s really growing into a regional player, and potentially has the opportunity to grow into a global player as well.”

A data center ‘evolution’ in the Carolinas

North Carolina and South Carolina have become an industry focal point as operators seek alternatives to “Data Center Alley” Virginia and, more recently, Atlanta, experts say.

“It was only a matter of time before the Carolinas began to experience the surge in activity seen over the past year,” Cushman & Wakefield’s latest annual report said. “Centrally located on the East Coast, the region boasts strong power infrastructure, robust fiber connectivity and favorable deal economics.”

The Charlotte area stands at the core of the Carolinas’ boom, McWilliams said.

Most of the current construction activity covers hyperscale sites by major tech companies. Hyperscale data centers are large-scale facilities that can rapidly handle massive computing power and data storage, typically consuming more than 50 MW annually.

But there’s a shift underway in the Charlotte region. It features more wholesale colocation sites by providers like Digital Realty.

Many colocation centers in the Carolinas, with an average facility size under 5 MW, are not equipped to meet the heavy demands of hyperscalers that now average 73 MW, according to Cushman & Wakefield’s report. “This market is at the beginning of its evolution,” the report stated, “and will soon host a growing hyperscale presence.”

Duke Energy and data centers

As the sector keeps growing, and residents keep pressing for more information, power utilities really are the only ones with the answers, according to CBRE. The commercial real estate services firm tracks data center growth within leasable space, but not the big, owner-operated facilities.

That brought us back to Duke Energy.

Data center developers trying to locate here sign contracts with Duke Energy committing to pay for certain amounts of energy before they launch. Duke Energy does not make the details of those agreements public, including the company that signed.

At the conference, both Sierra Club climate and energy advisor Jeremy Fisher and the Data Center Coalition’s director of energy policy Lucas Fykes, told utilities commissioners that they want to see more transparency in data center development planning.

“By the time we’re looking at a small number of customers that have the potential to consume more than 20% of the utility’s energy consumption, we need to start ... wondering what the implications are for other customers,” Fisher said.

Duke Energy ensures that data centers pay the “full cost of the infrastructure required to serve them, so those costs aren’t passed on to residential customers,” Poorman told the Observer.

Not everyone’s convinced.

Speaking at the utilities conference, Fisher said existing energy customers bear the brunt of the risk of rising electricity costs as data centers plan to move in.

More data center worries

It’s crucial to manage data center development to prevent transferring costs to other customers and to avoid worsening climate impact, said Jimenez, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.

In northern Virginia, data centers already are being blamed for higher utility bills.

Fisher cited a 2024 Virginia legislature study, which concluded that data center energy demands would likely increase costs for the typical Dominion Energy customer by $14 to $37 a month by 2040. Dominion is proposing a new rate class for utility customers that use more than 25 MW.

Poorman told the Observer that comparing North Carolina and Virginia’s electricity systems is “apples to oranges” because they are regulated differently, which presents key differences in how resources are planned and rates are set.

In North Carolina, the Power Bill Reduction Act became law in July. It allows Duke Energy to charge customers for new power plants, such as gas and nuclear, before construction is complete to keep up with growing energy needs, including from data centers.

Stein had vetoed the bill, which was overridden by state lawmakers. The governor cited a bill analysis by N.C. State University researchers that showed it could cost North Carolina ratepayers up to $23 billion through 2050 due to higher fuel costs, the News & Observer reported.

Duke Energy has argued the changes will allow it to lower the price paid by customers for new generation facilities over a project’s lifetime by decreasing financing costs, and that legislators have cited an overall cost savings of as much as $15 billion.

Other concerns about hyperscale data centers in communities around Charlotte and the rest of the country include:

Water consumption: Data centers require lots of water to cool their systems. A single center can consume up to 5 million gallons a day, or enough daily drinking water for 50,000 households or farms, according to a University of Tulsa in Oklahoma report.

Land use and visual impact: These facilities are typically large, utilitarian buildings surrounded by security fences that cover large plots of land that some critics say could be better used.

Limited job creation: While data center construction provides many jobs, the long-term workforce is often small, typically several dozen or so.

‘What Matthews is all about’

While some Charlotte-area communities have embraced new centers, others, like Statesville and Mooresville, remain resistant.

Back in Matthews, neighbors were adamant they wanted nothing to do with a data center. Such a development isn’t as good a fit for the town as several hundred homes would be, resident Jim Dedmon said at the October meeting.

“You’re helping improve the town with families, not data centers,” he said. “You’re building community. That’s what Matthews is all about.”

Six days after that meeting, developers Engineered Land Solutions and Crosland Southeast withdrew the rezoning request for the project.

Matthews residents celebrated the news. Developers withdrew the request due to “overwhelming public distaste” for it, Mayor John Higdon said, and he doubted they’d resubmit it.

But despite all the unanswered questions and concerns enveloping similar projects, experts say one thing remains certain: more data centers are coming to the Carolinas.

It’s possible.

Energy leaders in 10 southern states, including Kentucky, are working to launch the Southeast Energy Resilience Accelerator, or SERA, group — an initiative responding to funding opportunities currently being afforded by the Economic Development Administration.

If approved at the regional, state and federal levels, this part of Kentucky might have the option to be involved.

According to the October 2025 Kentucky eClearinghouse Report, which is provided as a monthly update through the Pennyrile Area Development District, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation is beseeching Commonwealth officials to procure at least $5 million in federal appropriations — with a $1.25 million applicant buy-in — in order to:

+ Create a collaboration between the Southeast Hydrogen Energy Alliance, E4 Carolinas, several regional energy trade associations and three Georgia Tech interdisciplinary research institutes: the Strategic Energy Institute, the Advanced Technology Development Center and the Manufacturing Institute, in hopes of responding to an Economic Development Administration funding opportunity.

+ And, then, run no less than a 30-month program that could discover avenues forward in sustainable energies, and their ultimate production and distribution.

Sources indicate that initial funding, again, if approved, would come from the EDA’s FY 2025 Disaster Supplemental Implementation Path, with longer-term support expected from industry sponsors.

SERA would then serve 544 FEMA-designated disaster counties in the 2022-24 window across these 10 southeastern states — focusing on nuclear, hydrogen and similar resilient energy technologies capable of on-site fuel storage, micro-grid support or mobile deployment.

For Kentucky and the News Edge listening area, this would include Caldwell, Christian, Crittenden, Hopkins, Lyon, Logan, Muhlenberg, Todd and Trigg counties.

This is all building on prior federal funding of two completed regional studies — “The Economic Impact of the Nuclear Industry in the Southeast United States” and “The Green Hydrogen Value Chain in the Southeast United States” — which, among many insights, notes that:

+ Hydrogen production units are located in the Southeast U.S.— primarily in Calvert City and Catlettsburg in Kentucky; Decatur, McIntosh and Saraland in Alabama; and the country has other active production units in Georgia, West Virginia, Florida and North Carolina.

+ As of 2020, Kentucky already has a varied and well-respected renewable energy profile, with 10 dams producing 7% of the state’s electricity generation, 10% of green generation came from biomass, solar accounted for 0.2% of all electricity provided, and biofuels come from two ethanol plants.

+ Christian County has a hydrogen demand of 4,000 to 10,000 kilograms per square kilometer per year.

+ The Tennessee Valley Authority already has two nuclear plants in its profile, capable of producing no less than a combined 4,800 megawatts of power: Sequoyah in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, and Watts Bar in Spring City, Tennessee. Construction of a third unit, a small modular reactor near the Clinch River in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, is currently underway.

+ And the top 10 nuclear firms in the southeast are Japan’s Mitsubishi Power, London’s Rolls-Royce SMR, Pittsburgh’s Westinghouse Electric, Seattle’s Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp, Boston’s General Electric, Kansas City’s Burns & McDonnell, Japan’s Toshiba Energy Systems, Germany’s Siemens Energy, Alameda’s Kairos Power and Lynchburg’s BWX Technologies.

Specific inventories have reportedly identified more than 180 interested power companies, and nearly 20 utilities, that are willing to help SERA define resilience needs, mentor startups and host demonstrations, and SERA, if given the go ahead, will be looking to recruit early- to growth-stage companies in these 500-plus counties to be ready for “an intensive acceleration process,” in order to “support commercialization and foster partnerships that enhance disaster resilience, diversify local economies, and generate new jobs and investment.”

In a written statement to the News Edge, Southeast Hydrogen Energy Alliance Advisor David A. Doctor said the project remains in the application review stage with the EDA — which typically operates on a 90-day review cycle.

However, he noted that with the federal government being closed for six weeks, and the EDA needing to sort through its project backlog, expectations are the review “takes a bit longer.”

Senior executives from GM, Ford, and Stellantis plan to attend the White House announcement, signaling critical industry support for the policy shift.

This action formally resets the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, replacing stringent targets set under President Biden. The previous rules would have required automakers to achieve an average fleet efficiency of roughly 50 miles per gallon by the 2031 model year. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which oversees CAFE standards, declared in June that the prior administration improperly considered electric vehicles when setting future requirements. The new rule establishes a legal foundation for standards that exclude such considerations.

The rollback represents the latest victory in President Trump's concerted campaign against regulations he has labeled an ""EV mandate."" His administration has already eliminated federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchasers and moved to revoke California’s long-standing authority to set its own, stricter tailpipe emissions limits. In August, the Environmental Protection Agency took the foundational step of proposing to rescind the 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" the determination that greenhouse gases harm public health, which underpins federal regulation of vehicle emissions.

Legal experts note that this aggressive federal retreat could ironically empower states. Ann Carlson, a former NHTSA official and UCLA law professor, argues that if the federal government determines greenhouse gases are not covered by the Clean Air Act, ""then California could presumably regulate them - and so could every other state."" California is already preparing for this conflict, with its air board launching a multi-year process to develop its own post-Trump vehicle emission rules, targeting a vote in 2027.

The administration’s push guarantees a protracted legal and regulatory battle.

Just months ago, he made headlines by betting against the AI frenzy, snapping up put options on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR). Those moves signaled his skepticism toward the tech sector’s explosive growth, driven by hype over artificial intelligence.

Now, Burry has turned his gaze to another high-flyer: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). In a recent Substack post, he labeled the electric vehicle giant “ridiculously overvalued,” unveiling a fresh short position. This isn’t Burry’s first dance with Tesla — he held a $530 million bearish bet in 2021 — but it underscores his view that the stock’s surge defies fundamentals amid intensifying competition and questionable leadership decisions.

Decoding Burry’s Tesla Critique

Burry’s takedown of Tesla hinges on a core issue: its sky-high valuation. With shares trading around $430 and a market cap exceeding $1.4 trillion, Tesla commands a price-to-earnings multiple of over 287 times trailing earnings — dwarfing traditional automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) or General Motors (NYSE:GM), which hover below 15.

Burry argues this premium stems from relentless optimism among investors, who keep pivoting narratives to justify the price. “Tesla’s market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,” he wrote bluntly. He points to the “Elon cult” — die-hard fans who championed electric cars until rivals like BYD and legacy players ramped up, then shifted to autonomous driving dreams, and now hype humanoid robots like Optimus. But Burry warns competition will inevitably erode these edges, as it has Tesla’s 41% U.S. EV market share.

Error loading chart data: Turnstile challenge failed: 600010

The Musk Factor Risk

No Burry critique lands without a jab at leadership, and Elon Musk draws sharp fire here. Burry slams Musk’s newly approved $1 trillion compensation package as a massive dilution threat, exacerbating Tesla’s already aggressive stock-based pay. He calculates the company hands out about 3.6% of shares annually to employees, with zero buybacks to counter the erosion.

This practice, Burry contends, inflates the share count without proportional value creation, punishing long-term holders. Musk’s package, tied to ambitious performance milestones, could flood the market with billions more shares if met — further pressuring the stock. Burry’s disdain echoes his broader beef with tech CEOs who prioritize spectacle over shareholder returns, likening Tesla’s trajectory to a bubble waiting to pop.

This short revives Burry’s 2021 Tesla wager, which he cashed out quickly as “just a trade.” Today, it fits his pattern of targeting frothy tech names. After shorting Nvidia and Palantir on AI overhyping and dilution parallels, Burry deregistered his Scion Asset Management hedge fund last month to go independent via Substack. There, he dissects overvaluations unfiltered, framing Tesla as exhibit A in a market detached from reality. At nearly 200 times forward profits, the stock leaves little margin for error if growth falters.

Key Takeaway

Burry’s Tesla short pits him squarely against bullish titans like Cathie Wood of ARK Invest, who forecasts $2,000 shares by 2027 on robotaxi and AI dominance, or Ron Baron, who touts Tesla’s moat in energy and autonomy.

Wood’s optimism hinges on exponential tech adoption, while Burry bets on mean reversion through competition and economics. History favors Burry, but Tesla’s cult-like following and Musk’s execution track record (SpaceX, xAI, The Boring Company) give bulls ammunition. Still, at these multiples, a correction feels probable if EV demand softens further or robots underdeliver.

For investors, don’t pick sides blindly. Diversify beyond Tesla, eye put options for downside protection, or trim exposure if shares hit resistance near $450. In volatile times, Burry’s caution provides an important reminder: Valuations matter more than visions.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry23-XRT.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 14:02:40.712954

The 625-MW Wolf Summit Energy plant, which will feature GE Vernova gas turbines and includes partners Kindle Energy and Wolf Summit Energy to manage and operate the facility, is fully contracted and financed following its Nov. 13 final investment decision, according to Blackstone.

County commissioners in 2024 also authorized Equitrans Midstream to survey Harrison County-owned land for a natural gas pipeline to the site.

It is not clear if other partners have any financial stake in the project, which has received state and local incentives, including a 30-year county exemption from paying local property taxes.

Plant site preparation, including controlled blasting, is underway, with operations expected to begin by 2027, said Blackstone, adding that it expected to create about 500 jobs during construction. A Blackstone spokesperson declined to respond to an ENR query on contractors selected for the project.

Blackstone acquired last year a majority stake in Plano, Texas-based Westwood Professional Services Inc., an engineering firm described as specializing in wind and solar energy, energy storage, power delivery, EV infrastructure, public infrastructure projects and other construction. The firm ranks at No. 77 on ENR's Top Design Firms list, reporting $412.8 million in 2024 revenue, about 44% in the power sector and 39% in building construction. Dean Palumbo, a former Stantec senior vice president, was named in August as Westwood chief operating officer.

Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, a Virginia-based co-op with about 1.5 million customers through its 11 member-owner firms in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, including data centers and other industrial facilities, agreed in July to buy the power that will be generated by the Wolf Summit plant.

“Helping meet the rising demand for electricity from AI and other areas is among our highest conviction investment themes at Blackstone,” said Bilal Khan, a Blackstone senior managing director, in a statement.

Originally proposed in 2017 by the Energy Solutions Consortium as a 579-MW combined-cycle plant and a $615-million investment, project development halted following a lawsuit over air permits and financing issues, according to local media reports. The consortium withdrew from the project. Wolf Summit Energy, a subsidiary of General Electric, subsequently revived and expanded the project in 2023. The Blackstone spokesperson also declined to say if the plant will be co-located with a data center or if it is being designed to also use hydrogen-blended fuel.

Blackstone, based in New York City, is considered the largest investor in global data centers and AI infrastructure, according to a ranking by Data Centre, an online sector publication. The company also announced in September its $1-billion acquisition of Hill Top Energy Center, a 620-MW gas-fired power plant in Pennsylvania, and a similarly valued purchase in January of Potomac Energy Center, a 774-MW gas-fired power plant in Virginia. Blackstone said it has been in ""late stage development or construction"" of about 1.6 GW of new-build U.S. power generation capacity since early 2022 and that its Blackstone Energy Transition Partners unit has ""committed over $27 billion of equity globally across a broad range of sectors within the energy industry.""",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/12/02/Blackstonepowerplant-FORMERPLANt.-cred-EnergySolutions.jpg?height=635&t=1764695221&width=1200,N,,2025-12-02 14:01:26.689858

Paddock noted that when the council approved rezoning for the property in late 2023, officials did not raise the issue of large-scale backup power needs. He said the project had been described as a quiet operation with minimal impact on surrounding neighborhoods.

The data center was first linked to Google in January 2024 after operating under the name Project Zodiac. The company initially planned an $845 million investment, which expanded to $2 billion in April.

The development is expected to add about 200 jobs over several years.

Paddock has asked IDEM to ensure the company pursues the safest and most efficient backup energy options and uses top pollution control practices. He has also called on Google representatives to hold a public forum in Fort Wayne to address the generator proposal and respond directly to community concerns.",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Geoff-Paddock-Featured-Image.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 16:02:44.088375

The Triodos Bank energy transition strategy, ‘Dare to Act. Now.’, sets out measurable targets to drive climate and biodiversity action by 2030.

Triodos Bank’s new four-pillar strategy marks the first time the bank has unified its climate and biodiversity ambitions.

The plan includes a commitment to cut absolute financed emissions by at least 42% by 2030, up from the 32% target set in 2022.

The focus is on three key activities that together account for 90% of the bank’s emissions footprint: business loans, mortgages, and listed equities and bonds managed by Triodos Investment Management.

Another pillar of the Triodos Bank energy transition strategy is the financing of 275 energy transition projects over the next five years. The bank aims to support next-generation, decentralised and community-led solutions, building on its “strong track record” in renewable energy finance.

The deal-count target is designed to ensure that finance reaches not only large utilities but also cooperatives, innovators and smaller community-led initiatives that often face challenges in accessing mainstream capital.

In addition to the energy transition targets, Triodos Bank plans to channel €500m ($580.39m) into high-integrity, nature-based solutions (NbS) by 2030. These projects are intended to deliver measurable ecological and social benefits, addressing both climate and biodiversity challenges together.

From 2026, the bank will begin reporting on its progress towards this investment goal, as well as on the positive biodiversity impacts of its financed projects. The aim is to provide greater transparency on how investments in NbS contribute tangible benefits for biodiversity.

Triodos Bank’s fourth strategy includes a strong advocacy component. The bank has called for systemic change in the financial sector.

It has stated that banks are still directing €650bn annually into fossil fuels, which sustains dependency on non-renewable energy sources.

The bank is advocating for international agreements such as the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty to phase out fossil fuels and create robust frameworks for high-integrity NbS.

Additionally, Triodos Bank is campaigning for energy-efficient housing and bio-based building standards.

As part of its advocacy, Triodos Bank has sought for binding rules including mandatory fossil-phase-out pathways for all banks; required short-term emissions reduction targets for 2030–35, with transparent action plans; alignment of financial regulation with the Paris Agreement and adherence to 1.5°C reduction pathways; separate targets for emissions reduction and carbon removal; and robust integrity standards for nature-based solutions.

Triodos Bank CEO Marcel Zuidam emphasised the interconnectedness of climate change and biodiversity loss, stating: “Climate change and biodiversity loss are not separate crises. They are deeply interconnected. Restoring ecosystems is essential to stabilising the climate, and climate action must protect biodiversity. Our strategy is about real reductions, real solutions and real leadership.

“We invite the financial sector to join us in embracing long-term well-being and taking action for a hopeful future. Together, we can drive the systemic change needed to stay within planetary boundaries. This means aligning financial flows with the Paris Agreement, investing in nature restoration and a clear road map to end the financing of the fossil fuel industry.”

U.S. electricity customers experienced an average of 11 hours of power outages in 2024, nearly twice as many as the annual average across the previous decade, according to a new report from the Energy Information Administration.

Hurricanes accounted for 80% of those lost hours, with most of last year’s outages resulting from major weather events like hurricanes Beryl, Helene and Milton, EIA said in the report released Monday.

“Interruptions attributed to major events averaged nearly nine hours in 2024, compared with an average of nearly four hours per year in 2014 through 2023,” EIA said. “Service interruptions that aren’t triggered by major events routinely average about two hours per year.”

Customers in South Carolina were significant outliers in terms of outage duration, the report said, experiencing an average of 53 hours of outages in 2024. Much of this was due to last September’s Hurricane Helene, which left 1.2 million customers in South Carolina without electricity.

The report appears to build on a growing body of evidence that extreme weather is taking a heavier toll on the electric power system in parts of the country. In October, JD Power released a report that found the average length of the longest outages are getting longer and concluded that disasters have become a “fact of life” for many utility customers.

Helene, in particular, caused severe damage to utility systems in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.

Duke Energy said after the hurricane that transmission infrastructure in upstate South Carolina “was severely damaged and, in many cases, destroyed” and would need to be entirely rebuilt.

Three days after the hurricane struck, 900,000 Duke customers remained without power across North Carolina and South Carolina, the utility said. Following hurricanes Helene and Milton, Duke reported needing to replace around 16,000 transformers — more transformers than utilities generally require in an entire year, WoodMac Senior Analyst Ben Boucher said in February.

South Carolina, along with North Carolina and Florida, “dealt with strong winds and flooding from Hurricane Helene that affected transmission and distribution power lines as well as substations leading to prolonged power outages,” EIA said. The following month, Hurricane Milton “left 3.4 million customers in Florida without power,” it added.

“In contrast, customers in states such as Arizona, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Massachusetts experienced, on average, less than two hours of service interruptions in 2024,” EIA said

Project Overview

We’re seeking approval to construct and operate a 76-megawatt alternating current (MWac) utility-scale solar power center and associated facilities in Darlington and Chesterfield counties, S.C. The associated facilities will include a new 230-kilovolt (kV) solar generation substation and a new 230-kV generation tie line spanning approximately 225 to 250 feet between the solar generation substation and the existing Darlington power plant’s 230-kV switching station (the point of interconnection).

Construction is expected to begin in late 2026 or early 2027. The facility will provide fuel-free power and capacity to meet the growing needs of the Pee Dee region of South Carolina.

Transitioning to cleaner energy sources, while also meeting growing energy needs, requires a diverse mix of resources to help ensure continued reliability as older plants are retired. As energy needs continue to grow significantly, Duke Energy must invest in new infrastructure to keep jobs and investment coming to South Carolina.

We are using an “all-of-the-above approach” that incorporates renewables like solar, next-generation and existing nuclear, natural gas and hydroelectric sources. This diverse mix will help Duke Energy meet customer expectations for cleaner energy while also reliably powering communities across the state.

Since 2021, Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

GREENVILLE, S.C., Dec. 2, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are wrapping up a monthlong initiative to support organizations that address food deserts, insecurities and inequities across South Carolina by announcing nearly $275,000 in surprise microgrants and contributions to community organizations across the state.

The big picture: The announcement wraps up a monthlong campaign of financial support to and employee volunteerism with organizations in South Carolina that fight hunger across the state. These include programs that distribute food boxes, fill backpacks for weekend food programs for students, provide help to veterans and senior mobile meal programs, among other feeding initiatives.

In total, the initiative provided more than $600,000 to critical community partners that do this incredible work, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina, https://sc211.org/One SC Fund and AIM, among many others.

The microgrants and contributions were not solicited by the receiving organizations. The 'surcee' funding opportunities recognize the important gaps these typically smaller agencies fill in the neighborhoods they serve. A complete list of recipients can be found here.

Why it matters: Every community in South Carolina is home to families who face hunger. The statistics are remarkable – more than 750,000 of our friends and neighbors lack consistent access to high-quality meals. That's 1 in 7 people facing hunger in our state every day, and 1 in 6 of those are children.

What they're saying

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""If you grew up in South Carolina, you are likely familiar with a 'surcee' – a small, unexpected gift. Giving Tuesday is the perfect opportunity to give a little something extra and highlight the great work these organizations do throughout the year to help keep our friends and neighbors from going hungry.""

Mark Champagne, executive director, Sumter United Ministries: ""Thanks to the generosity of the Duke Energy Foundation's $5,000 grant, we will be able to place food into the hands of neighbors who are struggling more than I've seen in many years. As requests continue to rise and our shelves grow thin, this gift brings real hope at a time when our community truly needs it.""

Traci H. Kennedy, executive director, TOTAL Ministries: ""We so appreciate everything Duke Energy Foundation does for TOTAL Ministries. The grant is making an immediate and meaningful difference, allowing us to meet rising needs and care for families who are struggling the most.""

Melinda Waddell, executive director, The Manna House: ""The support from Duke Energy for our mission to create a hunger-free Florence allows us to continue to provide hot, healthy, nutritious meals to our clients. With more than 100,000 individual meals served in 2024, we truly appreciate their dedication and commitment to our neighbors and community.""

Go deeper: Every bit of support to local food banks or soup kitchens is helpful. It could be as simple as a couple of hours of your time or even a monetary donation, but anything you can contribute will make a difference.

“Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas.
The EPA ignored the groups’ request for a comment period extension.","WASHINGTON, DC — Major environmental organizations including the Sierra Club have submitted comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during its comment period on the proposed restructuring of the Regional Haze Rule, calling on the EPA to abandon its attempts to weaken the rule, and instead maintain the rule to ensure continued progress toward clean air and clear skies at national parks and wilderness areas across the U.S. The comment period closed December 1.

Under the EPA’s current Regional Haze Rule, states must submit state implementation plans every 10 years to protect visibility in treasured national parks – like Yosemite, Acadia, Shenandoah, and Rocky Mountains – and wilderness areas – like Sipsey, Joyce Kilmer, Dolly Sods, and Boundary Waters Canoe Area – to demonstrate continued, reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal of the Clean Air Act. The EPA intends to weaken the rule, and as a first step, issued a public comment period for its advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. A second public comment period on the rulemaking is expected in early 2026.

“The Regional Haze Rule is a time-tested, effective program that requires federal and state agencies, federal land managers, and stakeholders to work together to restore clear skies in 156 national parks and wilderness areas (Class I areas). The Haze Rule has delivered significant cost-effective clean air benefits to national parks, wilderness areas and communities across the nation in the past 15 years — over 1.4 million tons of visibility impairing pollution has been reduced, improving scenic views and making air healthier to breathe across the nation,” reads the sign-on letter. “But there is still a lot of work to do as visitors regularly miss out on over 50 miles of scenic views and experience unhealthy air when visiting these treasured places.”

In both letters, the groups expressed concern that EPA’s deregulatory direction, as stated by Administrator Lee Zeldin in March 2025 and in Project 2025, will run contrary to the visibility goals of the Clean Air Act, weaken the Regional Haze Rule, and undermine years of progress toward cleaner air in parks and wilderness areas. The groups reject any efforts by the EPA to weaken the effectiveness of the rule, including by allowing states to avoid requiring pollution control systems, avoid identifying emissions reduction measures, and avoid developing regular regional haze plans altogether.

“Many sources of air pollution that were expected to retire, clean up, or otherwise reduce emissions can no longer be assumed to be on that same course given dramatic changes in the last year to clean air policies, facility or pollution control operations, and pollution exemptions granted by presidential decree,” reads the sign-on letter. “Americans and people from around the world love and cherish our national parks and wilderness areas. We must ensure continued reductions in haze pollution in the years and decades to come to benefit these treasured places and our communities.”

The Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, Earthjustice, National Parks Conservation Association, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center also expressed concerns about the timing of the comment period due to the government shutdown, which prevented affected agencies like the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Forest Service from providing adequate feedback. The EPA ignored the groups’ request for a comment period extension.

The technical comment letter was submitted by 12 organizations: Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Environmental Law & Policy Center, Healthy Environment Alliance of Utah, National Parks Conservation Association, Montana Environmental Information Center, Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law Center, and Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment.

The circular economy plays a small role in each of our lives.
I would encourage other states to follow Arkansas’s lead because it is clearly a winning play for our economy and the environment.","Across the country, companies are bringing production closer to home to strengthen supply chains, reduce dependency on imports and create jobs.

Notably, this process — known as “reshoring” or “nearshoring” — only succeeds when manufacturers have access to reliable, high-quality materials. That’s where Arkansas is leading the way, transforming recycled inputs into steel, plastics and paper products that power modern manufacturing in addition to helping build a circular economy that keeps critical resources at home and North American supply chains strong.

Circularity ensures yesterday’s waste is reintegrated while reducing dependence on mined ore or new, unused plastics shipped across oceans.

Added benefits include shortened supply lines, slashed transportation costs as well as emissions, and diminished exposure to global market shocks.

It’s also a workforce success story: sustaining thousands of high-wage jobs while ensuring the materials needed for cars, bridges, appliances and packaging remain readily available.

Recycling is not just good environmental policy –– it’s supply chain resiliency in action.

As old buildings and bridges are torn down to make way for new construction, and automobiles and washing machines reach their end of life, Arkansas recyclers accumulate and process them to recover high-quality ferrous metals. The result is a product that meets the same stringent performance standards as brand new steel made from mined ore.

Today, more than 70 percent of the steel forged in the U.S. is manufactured with recycled materials, and Arkansas is at the center of this story. Nucor’s mills in Mississippi County — one of the leading steel-producing counties in the nation — transform recycled materials into the steel that builds our cars and bridges.

The Natural State is also home to national leaders in plastics recycling. Revolution, one of the largest recyclers and manufacturers of agricultural plastics in North America, has a recycling hub in Stuttgart and manufacturing operations in Little Rock that have helped reutilize over 1 billion pounds of plastics. In Arkansas, it converts used farm plastics into new products like polytube and trashcan liners made with the highest certified post-consumer resin in the industry. Revolution’s success demonstrates how circularity drives economic growth.

That same story holds true for the simple cardboard box, one of the most widely recycled materials in America. A fixture of our modern economy, almost every product sold domestically is at some point contained in cardboard.

Corrugated cardboard is one of the most recyclable materials in use today. With six sustainable packaging facilities in Arkansas, International Paper plays a pivotal role in creating new corrugated packaging by reusing more than 5 million tons of recycled fiber annually to turn yesterday’s boxes, newspapers and office paper into sustainable packaging.

Since 2013, International Paper has increased its recovery rate of corrugated packaging by 93 percent and its overall recovery rate by 40 percent, removing unwanted waste, extending the lifespan of our fiber and timber resources, and creating well-paying jobs for Arkansans.

Seeing the success of the recycled materials industry in the Natural State has directly informed my policy priorities in the U.S. Senate.

Whether passing pro-growth and investment policies like tax reform or leading the Senate Recycling Caucus to promote awareness around this evolving sector, I am proud to work in bipartisan fashion and advance commonsense ideas. This year, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously advanced my legislation, the Steward Act, to strengthen voluntary standardized data collection efforts that help Arkansas manufacturers make informed business decisions while discerning industry trends.

The circular economy plays a small role in each of our lives. From the bridges we drive across to the appliances we replace and cardboard boxes we break down, what is recycled today becomes the durable materials we rely on tomorrow. I would encourage other states to follow Arkansas’s lead because it is clearly a winning play for our economy and the environment.

Independent power producers and the PJM Interconnection’s market monitor are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject a waiver request from American Electric Power utilities that would allow them to sell up to 750 MW in an upcoming “incremental” capacity auction.

It appears the utilities — Appalachian Power, Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power and Wheeling Power — want to offload capacity they acquired to serve data centers that didn’t materialize, said Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s market monitor, and the PJM Power Providers Group, a trade organization, in separate filings at FERC.

The utilities are Fixed Resource Requirement entities that supply their own capacity and don’t participate in PJM’s capacity market.

Early last month, the AEP utilities asked FERC for a waiver from FRR rules so they can sell up to 750 MW in an incremental auction set to begin on Feb. 24 for the 2026/2027 delivery year. Typically, PJM holds annual base capacity auctions three years in advance of a delivery year. It then holds incremental auctions for that delivery year to reflect any changes in supply and demand forecasts.

The AEP utilities said PJM needs more capacity and its offer in the incremental auction would help lower capacity prices to the benefit of ratepayers. Also, it is unlikely that offering 750 MW into the auction would hurt third parties because the upcoming capacity year, which begins June 1, is subject to a price cap and floor, the utilities said.

PJM supports the waiver request, saying it will ease resource adequacy concerns for the upcoming capacity year.

FERC in 2015 ruled that rigid enforcement of the FRR sales cap was not “necessary to protect competitive investment,” PJM said in a Nov. 21 filing.

However, Monitoring Analytics and P3 contend the AEP request fails to meet FERC’s standard for issuing waivers to rules it has approved.

“The waiver would allow generators with fully guaranteed cost recovery paid for by their customers to undercut the capacity market in which investors take the risks,” Monitoring Analytics said in a Nov. 26 filing. “The primary result of the proposed waiver would be that the AEP FRR entities would be able to take advantage of the high PJM capacity market prices.”

The AEP request fails to meet FERC’s requirement that a waiver be limited in scope, partly by setting a precedent that would undermine the PJM market design, according to the market monitor.

“If the cap can be waived whenever it proves inconvenient, it ceases to serve its market discipline function, undermines incentives for market based generators, and creates uncertainty for all participants in the PJM capacity market,” Monitoring Analytics said.

Further, the request doesn’t meet FERC’s requirement that a waiver address a concrete problem, saying neither PJM nor AEP has shown the grid operator will be short of supply for the incremental capacity auction, according to P3.

“Given recent downward adjustments for the 2026 load forecast, there is reason to believe that PJM may have over procured capacity for the 2026/2027 delivery year,” P3 said in a Friday filing at FERC.

Also, the waiver would harm market participants, the trade group said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xE5pnWNVVs2WgWR2KCUl4D6MLIwuf2VIvi8X_O2c8hU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Kb2huX0UuX0Ftb3NfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnQuX1VuaXRzXzFfYW5kXzIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-02 13:01:01.323497

So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.
But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.
The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work.
It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.","But before we get to Edison, let’s talk about why the Trump administration just pulled EV tax credits for commercial trucks. It’s not some political statement or shift in environmental priorities, it’s an acknowledgment of reality. America isn’t ready for wholesale adoption of electric trucks because we never did the planning and infrastructure work necessary to make it viable.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

Ford just announced an electric truck for the European market in 2026 with a 186-mile range. For UK operations where you can cover the entire country in a day and the charging infrastructure is relatively dense, that may work. Drop that same truck into American long-haul operations, and it’s useless. The geography doesn’t match, the infrastructure doesn’t exist, and the operational economics don’t work when you’re stopping for multi-hour charging sessions that turn a 10-hour driving day into a 15-hour ordeal with no additional revenue.

Range anxiety isn’t just about miles, it’s about operational flexibility and peace of mind. With diesel, if you need to adjust your route for traffic, weather, or a last-minute load change, you do it. If you’re running low on fuel, you pull into any of the thousands of truck stops and refuel in 15 minutes. That flexibility is what makes trucking work. Battery-electric trucks with fixed range and dependency on sparse charging infrastructure eliminate that flexibility. You’re locked into planned routes with no room for adjustment, and if something goes wrong, you could be stranded waiting for a tow or an hours-long charging session.

For someone whose career has depended on CAT diesels that work in conditions where failure means you’re stuck until a mechanic can reach you, which might be hours or days depending on where you broke down, the idea of voluntarily introducing that kind of vulnerability through technological limitations makes no sense. Diesel works because it’s proven, reliable, and supported by infrastructure that exists everywhere trucks operate.

But Edison Motors changed my thinking on whether EVs can work in trucking, because they approached the problem differently than everyone else.

Edison emerged from logging operations in British Columbia. If you know anything about logging, you know it’s an environment where equipment either works or you’re in serious trouble. You’re operating in remote areas, harsh weather, demanding terrain, and conditions where breakdowns can strand you far from help. Chase Barber and his partners weren’t building trucks to meet regulatory requirements or chase government subsidies, they were solving problems they faced daily running equipment in some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable.

When they looked at available EV options, they saw the same problems every trucker faces: range limitations, reliance on charging infrastructure, and operational disruptions that make battery-electric trucks impractical for how trucking actually works. So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.

Edison’s trucks feature electric drivetrains with onboard CAT diesel generators that continuously recharge the system. It’s basically a diesel-electric locomotive concept adapted for highway trucking. The electric motors provide instant torque, regenerative braking, and reduced maintenance on brake systems and transmissions. But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.

Here’s what makes this brilliant for someone who trusts diesel: you get the efficiency and performance benefits of electric drive without giving up the reliability and infrastructure compatibility that makes diesel work. You’re not dependent on charging stations that may or may not exist where you need them. You’re not locked into a fixed range with no flexibility. You maintain an unlimited range as long as you can find diesel fuel, which is everywhere. And you’re using proven CAT generator technology rather than betting operations on battery systems that are still evolving.

The peace-of-mind factor is huge. With Edison’s hybrid approach, you can adjust your route or extend your day. If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, you’ve got a diesel generator that can get you to a repair shop rather than being stranded waiting for a specialized EV technician.

Edison just received Canadian regulatory approval to manufacture and sell these hybrid heavy-duty trucks commercially. That’s an actual production vehicle competing in the real market. The approval validates that hybrid approaches can meet safety and emissions standards while addressing operational realities that pure battery-electric solutions ignore.

The fact that this innovation came from a small company emerging from logging operations rather than from major manufacturers or government programs tells you something important about where practical solutions come from. Legacy manufacturers built EVs around battery technology that doesn’t meet operational requirements, then expected infrastructure and regulations to catch up. Government mandates pushed carriers toward technology that doesn’t work for their business models. Meanwhile, Edison listened to what truckers actually need and built solutions that address real-world problems.

This pattern keeps repeating. When FMCSA couldn’t build practical tools to combat chameleon carriers, private companies like Freight Validate and Genlogs stepped in with solutions that work. When legacy systems couldn’t keep pace with technological change, startups built better platforms. When manufacturers focused on removing drivers through automation, Edison focused on giving drivers better tools to be more productive.

The UK’s EV success stems from matching technology to operational environments. Shorter distances, denser infrastructure, coordinated planning, and fleet operations aligned with current EV capabilities created conditions in which the technology could succeed. The US has none of those advantages for long-haul trucking, which moves most freight across the country. We needed better planning, more infrastructure investment, and technology that fits American trucking’s operational realities before pushing aggressive electrification timelines.

The Trump administration’s pulling EV tax credits acknowledges what should have been obvious from the start, we’re not ready. The infrastructure isn’t there. The technology doesn’t match how American trucking operates. And throwing subsidies at the problem without addressing fundamental operational and infrastructure gaps was never going to work.

But that doesn’t mean electric trucks can’t work in trucking. Edison’s success in some of the most demanding conditions imaginable, logging operations in BC’s interior, where equipment failure isn’t an inconvenience, it’s a crisis, proves that EVs can work if you engineer them right. The key is to build around operational realities rather than forcing operations to adapt to technological limitations.

For me, diesel will always be what I know and trust. CAT 3406s have kept me moving and freight delivered through conditions that would have killed lesser equipment. That reliability and peace of mind aren’t something you give up lightly. If Edison Motors has taught me anything, it’s that EV technology can work even in the woods of British Columbia if you approach it with practical engineering rather than regulatory fantasy.

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work. You keep the infrastructure compatibility, operational flexibility, and the peace of mind that come with proven technology. But you add efficiency benefits, reduced maintenance, and emissions improvements that address legitimate environmental concerns without sacrificing operational viability.

That’s the kind of innovation that deserves attention, not because it’s revolutionary or disruptive or any other marketing buzzword, but because it actually solves problems that matter to people running trucks. It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.

Ford’s 186-mile-range European EV might work fine in the UK, where geography, infrastructure, and operational profiles align with its technology capabilities. It won’t work in American long-haul operations, and removing tax credits that were propping up technology adoption before infrastructure and operations were ready is an acknowledgment of that reality.

What we need isn’t more aggressive mandates or bigger subsidies, it’s better planning, infrastructure investment that matches operational needs, and technology designed around how trucking actually works rather than how regulators wish it worked. The UK did that planning. The US didn’t. Edison Motors did that engineering. Most manufacturers didn’t.

I’m still a diesel guy. I trust what I know works. But I’m also paying attention to what Edison is building because they’re approaching the problem the right way, starting with operational needs and working backward to the technology that addresses them. That’s how practical innovation happens, and it’s proof that EVs can work in trucking if you’re willing to engineer solutions grounded in reality rather than regulatory timelines.

If Edison can make electric hybrids work in logging operations in BC, there’s hope that thoughtful engineering can bridge the gap between diesel reliability and electric efficiency. But it requires listening to what truckers actually need rather than telling them what they should want. The removal of EV tax credits might slow down the rush to electrification. Still, if it creates space for practical solutions like Edison’s hybrid approach to develop and prove themselves, that’s probably a better path forward than subsidizing technology that doesn’t work for how American trucking operates.

Sometimes the best innovations come from the people closest to the problems. Edison Motors getting approval to build electric hybrid heavy-duty trucks in Canada might matter more for trucking’s future than anything Ford or Tesla or any other major manufacturer announces, precisely because Edison was built by truckers who understand what actually works when you’re 100 miles from anywhere and your equipment has to perform or you’re in trouble.

That’s the kind of peace of mind I can respect, even from a diesel guy like me.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02/Rob-C-12-1-C.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 15:01:26.709323

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25.
Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas.
But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers.","The Southwestern Public Service Company has asked the state of New Mexico to grant exceptions to the state’s Energy Transition Act for two proposed gas-fired power plants, including one exception that would see approximately one-third of the energy produced at one plant qualify as a “zero-carbon resource” like solar panels or wind turbines.

A second exception would exempt both plants from the act’s zero-carbon requirement, “to preserve system reliability and protect customers from unreasonable bill impacts.”

The two proposed plants would be in Texas, with the larger of the two — called Gaines County Power Plant — to be built just across the border from Hobbs, New Mexico. Even though the two wouldn’t be in the state, New Mexico’s Energy Transition Act requires that all energy sold in the state by investor-owned utilities be from zero-carbon-emission sources by 2045, no matter where it is generated. The act was an early environmental win for Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.

The request is part of a wide-ranging application the Southwestern Public Service Company, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy, has before the Public Regulation Commission of New Mexico for new transmission lines, extended closure dates for existing coal-fired power plants and eight new power facilities — two each of natural gas, solar, wind and battery systems. The $10 billion plan covers the company’s service area in the southeast corner of the state and parts of West Texas.

While most of the proposed plants would generate renewable energy, the two gas plants would generate 51% of the total energy in the application.

“To pretend that natural gas in some way or another is a zero carbon resource is just a bald-faced lie,” said Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter, and an energy watchdog. “It’s profound greenwashing.”

Southwestern Public Service Company has requested that all costs associated with two new solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers.

The majority of Southwestern Public Service Company’s coverage area and energy sales are in Texas, but, according to Xcel, much of the projected increase in energy would be used in New Mexico, particularly in the state’s portion of the Permian Basin, the nation’s largest oil field. More than 50% of the company’s energy sales in New Mexico already go to oil and gas companies to power their wells and other infrastructure with grid-based electricity. Oil and gas revenues are also the state’s biggest single source of income.

According to the application, replacing the two proposed gas plants with renewable energy sources would cost New Mexico customers an additional $5.5 billion and raise residential electricity rates by more than 40%.

And the gas plants may be on the way. “We have already signed and executed contracts for the turbines,” Kaley Green, a senior media relations representative for Xcel Energy, said. “We anticipate a 40-year service life for each of the plants.”

In the application the company requests that all costs associated with the two solar projects be borne by New Mexico ratepayers because they will be built to meet New Mexico Energy Transition Act requirements, “not because they were needed for the overall system.” In addition, it asks for a speedy approval of the solar plants to secure renewable energy tax credits that were enhanced under President Joe Biden but had their timeframes dramatically curtailed under President Donald Trump.

These and other moving parts create an unusually large, wide-ranging and controversial application that landed before the New Mexico Public Regulatory Commission on Sept. 25. The commission plans to reach a decision on the Gaines Plant zero-carbon request by Dec. 10 and a decision on the full application by May 7. Green said that Southwestern Public Service Company began work on the proposal in 2022.

“It is a lot for one filing, but it’s not absurd,” said AnnaLinden Weller, senior policy adviser with Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit that fights climate change and its impacts across the western U.S. Previously she spent four years as a policy director at the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “It’s certainly the biggest one that I’ve seen, but not by a huge amount.”

Southwestern Public Service Company cites several factors for the size and complexity of the application: It wants to close two aging coal-fired plants in Texas; it sees increased demand from oil and gas producers in the Permian Basin, data centers and other industries; and there are new requirements from the power-sharing system in which the new plants would operate, the Southwest Power Pool. Despite its name, the pool runs from southeast New Mexico north to the Canadian border, balancing production loads from utility companies in 14 states along the way.

In August 2024, the pool raised the production reserve requirements of member utilities like Xcel from an annual 15% to 16% in summer and 36% in winter. (A production reserve requirement is extra power production capacity available for unexpected peak loads.) The new winter load requirement was in part a response to the winter storms of 2021 and 2022 that created sudden, massive electrical demands from damaged energy systems across the Southwest Power Pool.

The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

The request to keep the new gas-fired plants beyond 2045, when New Mexico pledged to reach zero carbon emissions, aims for a possible loophole in the law.

“So there’s a weird thing about the Renewable Energy Act. It doesn’t prohibit fossil fuels per se,” Weller said, so long as the utility can convince the Public Regulation Commission that it will be producing zero carbon electricity for New Mexico customers by 2045 while hitting ever smaller targets along the way.

Xcel’s Green said, “We will continue to work towards compliance with the 2045 goals and adjust our grid planning as we proceed, based on technology and other factors.”

If that’s not possible, Weller said the commission has the discretion to give utilities “wiggle room” for the 2045 zero carbon requirement if the utility faces reliability or affordability issues — both of which Southwestern Public Service Company explicitly claimed in its application. No utility has tried for such an exemption before, Weller said.

In 2020, the commission shot down a gas-fired power plant proposed by El Paso Electric, which provides electricity in parts of southern New Mexico and far West Texas. That plant would have produced about 11% of the electricity that the proposed Gaines County and Tolk plants would generate together. But, “They didn’t have a plan for how it would be possible for them to comply with the Renewable Energy Act,” Weller said — such as asking for exemptions from the act.

Another loophole in the act allows a utility to claim a fossil fuel plant is a “zero carbon resource” if that plant’s use reduces methane emissions “as a result of electricity production” by a 10-to-1 ratio or better of carbon dioxide to methane emissions. Southwestern Public Service Company hired an outside economist to show how electrifying oil and gas operations in the Permian Basin could offset enough methane emitted by wells and associated facilities to qualify roughly one-third of the electricity from the Gaines County plant as “zero carbon.”

“We’re still thinking about that as a legal question,” Weller said. “A plain reading of the Renewable Energy Act [the underlying law for the Energy Transition Act] says that the generation resource has to be zero carbon, not the effects of the generation resource.”

She added, “Are there climate impacts? Yeah. The question is are they big enough or worthwhile enough given what you’re building.”

Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate warming, but methane is far more potent, producing more than 80 times the warming potential as carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The next 20 years are critical for mitigating catastrophic future warming — but that goal may already be out of reach due to increasing oil and gas use.

“There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

~ Camilla Feibelman, director, Sierra Club Rio Grande Chapter

On Nov. 12, the International Energy Agency released its 2025 World Energy Outlook, which concluded that oil and gas demand will not peak before 2050, as previously hoped for — and needed — if the planet is to avoid increasingly frequent climate change catastrophes. The report goes on to say that with the increase in fossil fuel use, “exceeding 1.5°C is now inevitable.” Holding global warming to 1.5°C above preindustrial levels was the stated goal of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.

“There is some low-hanging fruit that we can get from electrifying the oil field, and ideally the infrastructure would be communicable to some future replacement industries that might help the state head in some different direction,” said Feibelman, the Sierra Club director.

“But you can’t deny the fact that it basically builds a more permanent infrastructure around oil and gas extraction,” she continued. “There’s this fantasy that we’ll be able to make oil and gas extraction something that’s sustainable in the short or long term, and that’s just not a fact.”

In 2023, Chevron touted a 20-megawatt solar field it built in southern New Mexico to power a nearby gas facility and reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions. For a while, the facility was a prominent focus of the company’s social media advertising in New Mexico.

But on the same day that the International Energy Agency released its World Energy Report, Chevron announced plans to build a natural gas power plant in Texas to power data centers. The plant is expected to produce 2.5 gigawatts of electricity, 125 times the amount of the solar field.

When asked about the fossil fuel power plants in the Southwestern Public Service Company application and how they mesh with the Energy Transition Act her administration championed, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s office punted.

Jodi McGinnis Porter, the governor’s deputy communications director, wrote, “Nearly half of this proposal is renewable energy. The same law that sets those aggressive renewables targets provides an exception process for utilities to protect system reliability. We’re confident the [Public Regulation Commission] can make the technical determination about whether it’s truly necessary. We’ll let that process move forward.”

If approved, Southwestern Public Service Company will build the Gaines County plant about five miles south-southeast of Hobbs, a town of about 40,000. The prevailing wind patterns would carry much of the exhaust from the new plant right over town.

“It’s not like there’s some bright-line border separating New Mexico and Texas’ pollution,” Feibelman said, and the region already suffers from bad air pollution. The American Lung Association has given both Lea and Eddy counties — the center of New Mexico’s portion of the Permian — failing grades for their ozone levels. The American Lung Association does not have ozone figures for the Texas side of the basin.

“The Permian Basin is basically out of compliance with federal ozone standards,” Feibelman said. “It’s kids, it’s communities, it’s elderly people that are going to pay the price of this poor air quality no matter where they live.”

This research paves the way for more robust, uncertainty-aware energy transition planning, especially for regions facing extreme weather and institutional constraints.","A new article published in Nature Communications offers insight into how government planners can better account for the many uncertainties that accompany the transition from fossil-fuel power systems to renewable or decarbonized systems. The paper, titled “Identifying key uncertainties in energy transitions with a Puerto Rico case study,” is the work of a team from the University of Virginia including first author Kamiar Khayambashi, a Ph.D. student in the Engineering in the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

Khayambashi and his advisor, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering Negin Alemazkoor, worked with co-authors Andres Clarens, a CEE professor and associate director of the UVA Environmental Institute, and UVA emeritus professor of public policy William Shobe. In the paper, they make a compelling case that planners need to do better at taking the right uncertainties into account when readying for an energy transition.

The team developed a three-stage analytical framework and applied it to the electricity system of Puerto Rico, a hurricane-prone island heavily dependent on fossil fuels. The study analyzed three transition pathways: Business as Usual (BAU), Fully Renewable (FR) by 2050 and Fully Decarbonized (FD) by 2050.

Key results show that changes in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes due to climate change emerged as the single largest source of uncertainty in the expected total system cost. Organizational inefficiency (e.g., delays, miscoordination in restoration of infrastructure services) was the second most important uncertainty but is rarely included in energy-system modeling.

Demonstrating that uncertainty can be reduced to a few key factors may encourage planners to account for those critical uncertainties, rather than ignoring them because they seem overwhelmingly complex.

“In a high-hurricane-risk region with a history of institutional inefficiencies such as Puerto Rico — and the case of grid restoration after Hurricane Maria — the yearly cost of the power grid cannot be accurately judged without explicitly modeling the uncertainties in climate, technology, fuel and institutional performance,” Khayambashi said.

Unfortunately, when it comes to planning and investments, the appropriate uncertainties are not considered, which leads to inaccuracies. As utilities and regulators plan long-term investments in clean energy transitions, many models assume a fixed “best-guess” value for fuel prices, technology cost declines, and weather or climate trends. This new research shows that such deterministic planning may miss critical cost-risks from multiple interacting uncertainties, especially in regions vulnerable to extreme weather and with consistent institutional efficiency challenges.

This study offers a strategic way to focus on data collection, modeling refinement and risk-mitigation efforts: identify which uncertainties matter most.

“Demonstrating that the high-dimensional uncertainty in long-term planning can be reduced to a few key factors may encourage planners to explicitly account for those critical uncertainties, rather than ignoring them because the problem seems overwhelmingly complex,” Alemazkoor said.

For example, in Puerto Rico, energy planners should integrate climate extreme risk models — here, that would be hurricane frequency and intensity — into infrastructure cost and resilience assessments. And organizational risk, such as restoration delays after storms, should be treated as a quantifiable input cost, not just a sidenote.

While the case study is specific to Puerto Rico, the authors emphasize that the framework can be applied in other geographies and under differing policy horizons.

“Our results show that resilience and organizational performance can matter as much as fuel price volatility when designing energy systems for the long term,” Clarens said.

Should the handy credits expire on December 31, a so-called “subsidy cliff” will be reinstated, putting Americans at risk of soaring health insurance costs.

Should the enhanced ACA premium tax credits expire on December 31, the roughly 22.4 million people relying on these subsidies would be hit with steep increases in their health insurance premiums starting in 2026.

Their premiums could more than double next year, per a preview of the available plans released by the Trump administration.

Millions more would lose subsidized ACA marketplace coverage, and roughly 3.8 million people are projected to lose health insurance coverage entirely and become uninsured each year from 2026 to 2034 due to high costs, per the Congressional Budget Office.

Around 47% of American adults reported fears that they would not be able to cover the cost of necessary health care should the tax credits expire, per a West Health-Gallup poll from last month.

The poll saw the highest level of concern surrounding health care in the past four years and also found that roughly 20% were unable to afford their prescriptions in recent months.

Rising medical costs are not sustainable in the long run, Joel White, president of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage, told NewsNation.

“If current trends persist, by 2032 the typical American family will pay 40% … of their income just on health care premiums,” said White.

“The subsidies are a temporary fix. We’ve got a very expensive system. Subsidizing an expensive system will get you a more expensive system,” he added.

As Americans currently enrolled in ACA Marketplace plans are already seeing the higher premium costs reflected in plan previews during the ongoing Open Enrollment Period, Congress is planning to vote on the subsidies before the end of the month.

‘SUBSIDY CLIFF’

A major point of contention during the lengthy government shutdown earlier this year, the enhanced premium tax credits were originally established by the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act.

These refundable tax credits were intended to help Americans afford health insurance bought via the ACA marketplace.

They work by capping the amount that individuals and families must spend on their health plans, with the government subsidy covering the remaining portion.

Before 2021, only households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level were eligible for the tax credits, ultimately creating a “subsidy cliff” in which a small jump in income could completely disqualify a family for assistance.

The American Rescue Plan Act and Inflation Reduction Act enhancements temporarily removed this subsidy cliff by allowing access to the tax credits for households with incomes greater than 400% of the federal poverty level.

The changes also made the subsidies more generous overall, spiking marketplace enrollment significantly from roughly 12 million Americans in 2021 to a record 24.2 million in 2025, according to an explainer from the Commonwealth Fund.

“Green tech manufacturing is being built in an era when advanced digital technologies are mature and widely accessible.
The Workforce Challenge Despite the promise of high-tech careers, talent pipelines remain thin.","For decades, manufacturing has been synonymous with job creation, a pillar of economic growth and stability. Today, the industry is evolving into something far more dynamic: a hub for innovation, sustainability, and purpose-driven careers. Experts say this transformation is reshaping not only what manufacturing looks like but why it matters.

Beyond the Assembly Line: A High-Tech Reality

“People still picture manufacturing as the assembly lines of the early 20th century,” says Thomas Kurfess, executive director of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute. “The reality is very different. Modern plants are among the most advanced environments you’ll find, packed with robotics, automation, and data-driven systems. In fact, if you want to see the largest number of robots in one location, it will be at an automotive assembly plant.”

That disconnect between perception and reality is one reason manufacturers struggle to fill roles despite record demand. Kurfess notes that students often overlook manufacturing careers because they assume the work is low tech. “We need to expose educators, parents, and students to what manufacturing truly looks like,” he says. Facility tours and partnerships with technical colleges can help shift the narrative.

Pinar Keskinocak, H. Milton and Carolyn J. Stewart School Chair in the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, agrees: “Showcasing innovations like AI-driven automation, 3D printing, and smart factories is key to changing perceptions.”

Green Tech and Digital Transformation

The rise of electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy is accelerating this shift. “Green technology presents a transformative opportunity for U.S. manufacturing,” Kurfess explains. “It is not just about sustainability; it is about national security and global competitiveness.”

These sectors are inherently digital, says Nagi Gebraeel, Georgia Power Term Professor in the College of Engineering. “Green tech manufacturing is being built in an era when advanced digital technologies are mature and widely accessible. Factories are designed from the ground up with automation and sensing embedded, creating highly interconnected systems.”

This evolution demands new skills. The labor force must navigate environments where operational technology and information technology converge. Gebraeel predicts that by 2035, manufacturing leaders will increasingly come from operations and data-driven backgrounds rather than traditional IT.

The Workforce Challenge

Despite the promise of high-tech careers, talent pipelines remain thin. Manpreet Hora, senior associate dean in the Scheller College of Business, points to a “demand-supply mismatch” driven by rapidly changing skill requirements. “Manufacturing now needs workers who combine technical, digital, and soft skills,” he says. “Meanwhile, younger workers often gravitate toward service industries for perceived growth and tech exposure. The manufacturing sector will collectively need to reposition themselves as employers of choice by making their digital tools visible, highlighting career progression, and offering flexible learning pathways.”

Experts agree that education must adapt. Kurfess advocates for a systemwide approach starting in elementary school, while Gebraeel emphasizes integrating AI into curricula and offering modular micro-credentials for upskilling. Hora adds that hands-on training should reflect realities like AI-enabled operations and sustainability-focused processes.

Purpose and Innovation

For younger professionals seeking meaningful work, manufacturing offers more than a paycheck. “These are high-tech, high-impact roles where workers build products that move the world, from aircraft and medical devices to renewable energy systems,” Kurfess says.

To position the industry as an innovation hub, leaders must embrace technologies that enhance efficiency and quality while fostering collaboration across schools, businesses, and government. “Modernizing the image of manufacturing demands aligned messaging and shared investment,” he adds.

Looking Ahead

By 2035, experts envision a workforce fluent in AI, committed to lifelong learning, and working in environments where cyber and physical systems are seamlessly integrated. Manufacturing will remain a cornerstone of economic strength, but its true value will lie in its ability to innovate, adapt, and deliver purpose-driven careers.",https://news.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/hg_media/2025-02/fileKdkuny,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:41.885574

So, what are the consequences for real-time dynamics of adding these huge sources of demand to existing networks? And can domestic production meet significant demand growth from both LNG production and power generation?

Gas production and pricing and the impact of large-load real-time behaviour on power markets were key themes at our recent Power and Gas Trading Conference in Houston. Fill out the form at the top of the page to download slide decks from the event covering these and other topics, or read on for a brief overview.

Theme 1: The impact of large loads on power markets

Large loads are the new volatility source for power trading

Power market traders are used to tracking a range of issues that can impact real-time pricing in energy markets, from generating facility downtime, network outages and renewables intermittency to more serious weather-related disruption. However, our real-time analysis of US power markets shows that large-load behaviour is driving a critical shift, with large loads increasingly a major source of volatility.

Our case studies of the Lake Mariner Data Center in upstate New York and Meta’s 2.5 million square feet Henrico Data Center campus in Virginia show these single facilities are the source of massive, un-forecasted load swings. Lake Mariner executed 13 demand response events in July 2025 alone, more than twice the number of Emergency Actions taken by NYISO, the regional independent system operator. With the Lake Mariner campus representing around 9% of Zone A demand in NYISO, demand fluctuations at the facility are having clear price impacts.

Concentrated demand amplifies congestion risk

Real-time power market dynamics driven by Tesla’s Gigafactory in Austin Texas highlight a further issue caused by concentrated demand from large loads: the amplification of congestion risk. This huge manufacturing facility employs around 20,000 people and is the world’s second largest building by volume. The site has an assumed consumption capacity of around 250 MW, with onsite solar generation and battery storage helping to reduce the amount of power drawn from the grid during peak summer pricing.

Fluctuating demand and generation at the facility bring congestion risk. For example, during the first week of September 2025, a constraint in Bell County coupled with a long-standing line outage in the area resulted in elevated real-time prices for the plant throughout peak consumption hours (see dotted lines on the chart below). This demonstrates how concentrated demand coupled with onsite generation can be susceptible to basis risk, that must then be managed around.

Real-time visibility into un-forecasted load ramps gives traders the edge

The ability to monitor and detect un-forecasted load ramp-ups and ramp-downs caused by large-load facilities like Lake Mariner and Gigafactory Texas is a vital advantage in fast-moving power markets. Wood Mackenzie’s PowerRT solution provides the real-time visibility traders need to act quickly and exploit trading opportunities as these events unfold. At the same time, our new Nodal Price Forecast for ERCOT leverages our congestion expertise, allowing large load facilities to manage basis risk while enabling traders to capture spreads ahead of the market.

Theme 2: Meeting growing gas demand from LNG and data centres

US LNG production continues to grow

Several major projects have contributed to US LNG export capacity growing by over 30% year on year. Work has progressed ahead of schedule on the third phase of Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Liquefaction facility in Texas, with four of seven trains already online. At Venture Global’s Plaquemines LNG plant, all trains are online, with power island commissioning ongoing. And at ExxonMobil and QatarEnergy’s Golden Pass joint venture in Texas, Train 1 (of three) is expected to begin liquefaction around the end of the year.

Can gas prices incentivise enough production to meet LNG growth?

Based on projects under construction or nearing a final investment decision, we forecast durable growth in US LNG production, with an additional 18 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of capacity becoming operational over the next ten years.

Gas production and LNG exports have become increasingly interconnected over the past few years, with the US Lower 48 and Western Canada effectively turned into synthetic storage, adapting daily production to ongoing demand. At the moment, gas prices are incentivising enough production to meet current growth expectations for increased LNG production, with supply from Haynesville, Marcellus/Utica and Permian plays expected to increase steadily. However, if incremental gas supply is needed to meet additional demand growth from large loads, higher prices will be required.

Can gas production grow as needed to meet large-load demand growth?

In theory, domestic gas production should be able to grow to meet the significant added power demand from the growth in data centres and other large industrial loads. Pipeline capacity could present an obstacle to supply growth; for example, there are limits on export capacity in the Marcellus/Utica. However, local demand growth should debottleneck the region and allow for more production growth. Increasingly, the availability of gas as an electricity generating resource will be a key factor in the siting of data centres and other large-load facilities.

H2 201 Explained

As hydrogen adoption continues to grow across the U.S., particularly in transit and municipal fleets, so does the need for thorough safety training. Hydrogen's unique properties - including its dispersion behavior, pressure requirements, and wide flammability range - make fuel systems that use it fundamentally different from those in natural gas vehicles (NGVs). This course bridges the knowledge gap for technicians who may already be familiar with CNG but need specialized training for hydrogen.

H2 201 covers critical topics like:

Hydrogen fuel system component function and identification.

Required inspection tools and methods.

Depressurizing, defueling, and leak detection.

Hydrogen cylinder damage assessments and classifications.

Requirements under SAE2579, CGA C-6.4, and FMVSS 307 and 308.

Along with its prerequisite course, H2 101: Hydrogen Vehicle Essentials and Safety Practices, AFVi's hydrogen fuel system inspector certification program is designed so that technicians who complete the training and pass the certification exam are fully qualified to conduct inspections that meet all current safety codes and standards.

As much as various high ranking officials in the Trump administration would like to pretend that energy storage is not a thing existing in time and space, it does. Batteries are already replacing fossil fuels in vehicles and power stations. Now they are beginning to pull duty in the sticky world of hard-to-decarbonize commercial and industrial applications. In an interesting twist, the latest development in the C&I space involves a concentrating solar power system capable of delivering the clean kilowatts on a ’round-the-clock basis, with the help of thermal energy storage.

Energy Storage & Concentrating Solar Power

The concentrating solar power angle may come as a surprise, considering that the technology got a bad rap here in the US after a series of high profile flops in the early 2000s. However, CSP has caught on elsewhere around the world.

For those of you new to the topic, CSP systems are just what the name says. Instead of converting sunlight directly to electricity in a photovoltaic cell, CSP systems typically deploy large fields of specialized mirrors called heliostats. They collectively bounce sunlight onto a central point, where a reciever heats a liquid transfer medium typically composed of molten salt. CSP systems can also come in the form of long, parabolic troughs, and they can heat particles of sand or other matter instead of heating a liquid.

Either way, the transfer medium acts as a sort of two-way energy storage system. It can be called up when needed for commercial and industrial processes that require heat, even after the sun goes down. Or, the transfer medium can be shunted to a generating station, where it produces steam to run a turbine that spits out electricity (see lots more CSP background here).

If that sounds complicated and expensive compared to simply parking a solar panel out in the sun, it is. During the Obama administration, the US Department of Energy tried to help the domestic CSP industry launch itself into being, but nothing of consequence stuck. Still, the Energy Department continued to fund innovation in the CSP field all during the first Trump administration from 2017 to 2021. The Biden administration also picked up the CSP R&D torch and ran with it, all the way until January 20 of this year, when the task fell to Trump again.

As of March, the Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory indicated that third-generation CSP research programs were continuing during Trump’s second time in the Oval Office. However, last week Energy Secretary Chris Wright changed NREL’s name to “National Laboratory of the Rockies,” so who knows what goes on there.

247Solar Has Fossil Fuel’s Number

The US startup 247Solar is among the CSP innovators not waiting around for further support from the Energy Department. The company’s flagship “247Solar Plant” heat-plus-power system combines CSP with a heat-storing battery, enabling it to last longer than earlier CSP-based energy storage systems. As a backup, the battery is also designed to be source-agnostic, running on alternate fuels in case of a shortfall in solar availability. The battery is also compatible with wind power and grid-sourced electricity, too.

The company is new to the CleanTechnica radar, so now is a good time for catch-up. It launched in 2015, co-founded by the late MIT Professor Emeritus David Gordon Wilson and longtime solar engineering and architecture professional David Anderson, who serves as CEO.

MIT News profiled the company last year, noting that Professor Wilson’s high-temperature heat exchanger provides the technology platform for the system. As described by Anderson, the heat exchanger is integrated with a conventional turbine. Similar to those used in jet engines, the turbine circulates hot air without requiring combustion or producing emissions.

MIT News reporter Zach Winn provides some further details about the system. The central tower in the CSP part of the operation supports a proprietary solar receiver capable of reaching 1,000 degrees Celsius. Some of the hot air can go directly to drive the turbines to produce electricity while the sun is shining. The rest is routed to a long duration solid-state thermal energy storage system, which takes over when the sun goes down.

“We offer round-the-clock electricity, but we also offer a combined heat and power option, with the ability to take heat up to 970 Celsius for use in industrial processes,” Anderson told MIT News. “It’s a very flexible system.”

Who’s Gonna Pay For All This?

247Solar has already cultivated a $250 million pipeline of projects around the world for its heat-plus-power CSP system, reportedly including a major utility in India. Accordingly, earlier this week 247Solar announced the launch of a new Series B capital raise aimed at hitting the $25 million mark, enabling it to scale up operations.

In a press statement, 247Solar indicated that its that its existing investors have already put up $3.5 million towards a successful raise, and that forthcoming commitments are in the pipeline pending due diligence.

The demand is certainly there. Although US President Donald Trump has done his best to throttle down the domestic wind and solar industries, the global race for reliable, economical clean power is continuing apace. 247Solar notes that its project pipeline includes Africa, Europe, Australia, and South America, as well as India, with a focus on mining and desalination operations, among other industrial applications.

“Industrial companies worldwide face the urgent need to decarbonize their energy use — without sacrificing reliability, cost, or performance,” 247Solar emphasized in a press statement dated December 1. “And 60% of industrial energy use across sectors is to produce heat, not power, typically by burning fossil fuels.”

Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Typical CSP systems are sprawling, one-of-a-kind facilities tailored to their location, adding risk as well as expense. In contrast, 247Solar has developed a cost-cutting, modular system that can be fabricated in a factory setting and hauled out to the site.

With the combination of heat and power in hand, 247Solar notes that cutting carbon emissions down to the bone is just part of the picture. In addition to reducing the carbon footprint of an operation’s energy systems by up to 95%, 247Solar estimates that energy costs can be cut by 25% or more.

Adding to the attraction is 247Solar’s EaaS (Energy-as-a-Service) business model. EaaS contracts typically provide business with the ability to upgrade their energy systems without paying up front for new equipment. “In addition, 247Solar solutions typically increase reliability and improve performance,” 247Solar also says of itself.

That remains to be seen. However, considering the extent of 247Solar’s global project pipeline, apparently some leading energy consumers have seen enough. If all goes according to plan, 247Solar will deploy the Series B funding to establish a cost-cutting, mass production system for a new 3.5-megawatt module. That’s a big leap up from the company’s current size of 400 kilowatts, but the timeline calls for full development to be completed within the next six months or so, leading to deployment in 2027.

Don’t be surprised to see 247Solar cropping up here in the US, too. 247Solar includes North American on its to-do list, along with its overseas pipeline. For all the hot air about “American Energy Dominance” blowing out of the White House, solar power is the fastest, most abundant, and most economical way to add more kilowatts to the nation’s power profile.

Clean Energy has completed its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas.

The site, now one of the largest RNG plants in the U.S., can produce ~2.6 million gallons of RNG per year.

The project processes 300,000 gallons of manure daily using four anaerobic digesters.

EPA has approved the facility to generate RINs under the Renewable Fuel Standard, with LCFS credits expected in 2026.

The company's leaders and the dairy owner highlighted circular-economy and emissions-reduction benefits.

Clean Energy Brings New RNG Production Facility Online

Clean Energy has announced the successful completion of its renewable natural gas (RNG) facility at South Fork Dairy in Dimmitt, Texas. The plant, now producing pipeline-quality RNG, has begun injection into the interstate natural gas pipeline.

The facility, financed entirely by Clean Energy, represents an $85 million investment and is among the nation’s largest RNG production sites. South Fork Dairy houses approximately 17,500 cows and is capable of producing around 2.6 million gallons of low-carbon RNG per year.

Clay Corbus, Senior Vice President at Clean Energy, said, “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply… but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

Clean Energy Highlights Circular Benefits for Agriculture

Designed to process up to 300,000 gallons of dairy manure per day, the facility uses four anaerobic digesters along with advanced gas-conversion equipment. The RNG produced is injected directly into an on-site gas line, and Clean Energy will receive 100 percent of the output.

Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy, commented: “Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us… Being a part of something so circular that allows the dairy to reduce its emissions while providing an additional income stream is an added bonus.”

Construction temporarily paused due to a fire impacting the dairy, but operations at both the dairy and the RNG facility have since been fully restored.

Regulatory Approvals Advance Clean Energy’s RNG Expansion

The RNG produced at South Fork Dairy has been approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for generating Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

Duke filed a petition in February asking the US Supreme Court to take the case.
The full 4th Circuit voted, 11-2, in November 2024 against hearing the case en banc.
Appeals Court Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the unanimous 4th Circuit panel that ruled against Duke.","The US solicitor general opposes Duke Energy’s request to have the nation’s highest court review an anti-monopoly lawsuit against the utility company. A federal Appeals court ruled in 2024 that competitor NTE Carolinas could move forward with its suit against Duke.

The suit claims that Duke attempted to block Florida-based NTE from competing to provide electricity for the city of Fayetteville.

Duke filed a petition in February asking the US Supreme Court to take the case. The high court issued a June order inviting Solicitor General John Sauer to submit a brief expressing the federal government’s view of the case.

“This appeal arises out of a campaign by an established monopolist to stop a more efficient rival from disturbing its long-dominant hold over a regional energy market,” according to the brief Sauer’s office filed Monday. “Applying the established summary-judgment standard, the court of appeals concluded that this exclusionary campaign did not involve competition ‘on the merits,’ because petitioner could not compete with respondent on the basis of efficiency. And the court found that this campaign produced the very harms the federal antitrust laws are designed to prevent — ‘reduced consumer choice, higher prices in the long term, and market foreclosure.’”

The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals “properly held” that Duke was not entitled to summary judgment in the case. “That fact-bound decision does not warrant further review,” Sauer’s brief argued. “Nor is this case a suitable vehicle to announce any broader rule of antitrust law.”

The solicitor general labeled Duke Energy the “beneficiary of a government grant more than a century ago.” Duke “has controlled the wholesale-power market in the Carolinas for generations. It has maintained that position in part because many barriers to entry exist in this industry.”

“Power plants have high startup costs, and ‘anchor’ clients sizable enough to cover those costs are rare,” the solicitor general argued. “By dissuading such customers from switching to a potential competitor, an entrenched monopolist can prevent new entrants from gaining a foothold in the region — without creating a better product, producing a better service, or implementing a general price cut.”

The record in the case “would support a finding that that is exactly what happened here,” according to the brief.

“Petitioner’s older plants were ‘not competitive’ with respondent’s plants, which used superior technology to produce cleaner power at a far cheaper rate,” Sauer’s brief argued. “So when respondent sought to build a new facility in the Carolinas, petitioner sought to target the competition itself. Petitioner recognized that this new plant would be viable only if respondent could sell power to the City of Fayetteville, the one sizable customer in the area whose contract was coming due. Petitioner therefore took a variety of steps intended to deter Fayetteville from switching to a new supplier.”

“Petitioner succeeded — and respondent presented sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that petitioner did so through means ‘other than efficiency,’” the brief continued. “For instance, petitioner ‘manufactured’ a ‘sham breach’ of an interconnection agreement to make it appear that respondent’s plant would be ‘unable to transmit its power.’”

“Likewise, petitioner restructured Fayetteville’s contract to give the City a short-term discount and lump-sum payment, which petitioner would recoup through a long-term price hike on other customers,” Sauer’s brief added. “All told, without ever competing with respondent on the merits (i.e., offering a better service), petitioner was able to prevent respondent from operating its superior facility.”

“When a monopolist engages in a coordinated campaign to squelch competition, no circuit holds that each discrete aspect of the defendant’s conduct must be analyzed in isolation,” the solicitor general argued. “Instead, courts uniformly agree, consistent with this [Supreme] Court’s precedent, that a holistic analysis is appropriate in circumstances like these.”

A unanimous three-judge 4th Circuit panel ruled against Duke Energy in August 2024. The panel threw out a trial judge’s ruling in the dispute. The full 4th Circuit voted, 11-2, in November 2024 against hearing the case en banc.

Duke’s Supreme Court petition criticized the 4th Circuit panel’s decision.

“This petition presents an important and recurring question of antitrust law: when can 0 + 0 = 1? The district court found that antitrust math is no different from ordinary arithmetic. If an antitrust plaintiff pleads a series of independently lawful acts, each of which does not violate this Court’s precedents, those acts cannot together add up to some nebulous antitrust violation,” Duke’s lawyers wrote. “The court of appeals concluded otherwise, embracing a ‘monopoly broth’ theory prominent in the 1960s to 1980s but long since discarded.”

“This Court’s intervention is needed to restore antitrust law to the principles that have governed for the last three decades,” the petition continued.

The 4th Circuit “bucked” the consensus of “[f]ive courts of appeals, numerous district courts, and the leading antitrust treatise” about the proper approach to the case, Duke’s lawyers argued.

“[T]o get around this Court’s well-established tests for predatory pricing, refusals to deal, and sham litigation, NTE dusted off the old monopoly-broth playbook, arguing that Duke was liable because of its overall ‘anticompetitive scheme,’” the petition argued. “This time, the move worked. Breaking from decades of case law, the Fourth Circuit held that antitrust plaintiffs can add up distinct, independently lawful actions and put their ‘combined effect’ before a jury.”

NTE Carolinas responded to Duke’s arguments in its Supreme Court brief.

“The Fourth Circuit held that respondents have a triable monopolization case for two independent reasons,” the brief explained. “First, a reasonable jury could find multiple acts by Duke unlawful under this Court’s canonical tests for predatory pricing and refusal to deal. Second, petitioners’ conduct involved ‘a complex or atypical exclusionary campaign, the individual components of which do not fit neatly within pre-established categories.’”

“Because this Court’s specific tests for common types of monopolistic conduct do not cover all the ‘many different forms’ of anticompetitive conduct, which ‘cannot always be categorized,’ the court below also considered Duke’s course of conduct ‘as a whole’ and found that a reasonable jury could find it anti-competitive,” NTE Carolinas’ lawyers wrote.

Appeals Court Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote for the unanimous 4th Circuit panel that ruled against Duke.

“In particular, NTE presented evidence in the district court that Duke devised a plan to ensure that NTE, its only serious competitor, would not have the opportunity to compete for the business of Fayetteville, North Carolina, the only major wholesale customer whose long-term contract with Duke was expiring soon enough to allow NTE to compete for its business,” Niemeyer wrote.

“The district court granted Duke’s motion for summary judgment, in which Duke argued that the conduct that NTE imputed to Duke constituted legitimate competition in seeking to retain Fayetteville’s business and that none of the actions on which NTE relied was unlawful,” Niemeyer added. “While the court concluded that there was a question of fact on whether Duke had monopoly power, it also concluded as a matter of law that Duke did not engage in anticompetitive conduct but rather legitimate competition to retain Fayetteville’s business.”

“While we recognize that much of Duke’s conduct can be understood to be legitimate competitive conduct, … we also have found much from which a jury could conclude that Duke’s actions were illegitimate anticompetitive conduct that violated § 2 of the Sherman Act,” the 4th Circuit opinion continued. “Because genuine disputes of material fact exist, we vacate the district court’s summary judgment and remand for further proceedings.”",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/john-sauer.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:04:41.313754

(PGY), a joint venture between Plankton Energy and Gratitude Railroad, announced the final close of its inaugural fund, surpassing its $10 million equity target to support a portfolio of 35 – 40 solar projects worth an estimated $40 million. The launch comes amid a surge in U.S. electricity demand — driven by electric vehicle adoption, AI data centers, and the broader electrification of industry — and demonstrates that distributed clean energy can continue to get financed and developed amid policy changes.

PGY’s development and operational strength is powered by Plankton Energy, an experienced distributed solar developer with a track record of energizing projects and delivering compelling financial returns. With a team specialized in development, engineering, operations, and asset management, Plankton enables PGY to aggregate projects into a diversified portfolio representing an under-served, high-potential market segment that can deliver predictable, tax-advantaged cash yield.

“The energy transition won’t happen solely on vast utility-scale fields,” said Dan Giuffrida, CEO of Plankton Energy. “It’s also taking place on rooftops, campuses, and buildings in our communities. By investing in the mid-market, we’re using existing infrastructure to generate renewable power close to where it’s consumed — improving grid reliability and accelerating decarbonization.”

Plankton Energy has developed a robust pipeline of projects across retail, industrial, office, nonprofit, and school facilities. PGY has already acquired eleven projects — three currently energized and eight in various stages of construction — that meet its financial and impact criteria. Plankton Energy is underway with development of an additional 25 projects across three northeastern states. More than half of the projects will be community solar, enabling low- and moderate-income residents to participate in the clean energy economy and save on their energy bills.

Anchoring this partnership is Gratitude Railroad, which brings more than a decade of experience in financial asset management, a committed network of investors, and a disciplined focus on opportunities that deliver both strong financial performance and meaningful impact. Identifying market gaps and shaping joint ventures are core to Gratitude’s work.

“This new fund represents a step forward for distributed clean energy,” said Rebekah Saul Butler, Managing Partner at Gratitude Railroad. “We aim to demonstrate that small commercial and community solar delivers solid financial returns alongside community benefits — reducing pollution, lowering energy costs, and powering the technologies that define our future.”

PGY recently closed a $7.5 million revolving construction facility with Locus that will enable the building of all of the portfolio projects. The fund also partners with RSF for term debt and receives additional financing through tax-credit transfers. Revenue is generated through a diversified stream of electricity sales and state incentives in the form of Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs).

Amid ongoing policy shifts and evolving federal tax-credit guidance, PGY has moved decisively to leverage incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act — including community solar and domestic-content “adders,” as well as new tax-credit transferability provisions — which continue to be available for projects advancing in the lower middle market. These mechanisms expand project eligibility, increase available capital, and strengthen the economics of distributed solar, making it attractive to investors who are nimble and attuned to the policy context.

PGY meets rising investor demand for cash yield with meaningful impact at a time when reducing emissions and making energy more affordable are urgent priorities.

About the Long Island Sound Partnership The Long Island Sound Partnership, developed under the EPA’s National Estuary Program, is a cooperative effort between the EPA and the states of Connecticut and New York to protect and restore the Sound and its ecosystem.","Connecticut (December 2, 2025) – The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) and partners today announced nearly $12 million in grants to organizations and local governments to improve the health of Long Island Sound and its wildlife populations. The grants will leverage more than $8 million in matching contributions from the grantees themselves, resulting in more than $20 million in total conservation impact for projects in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont.

The 2025 Long Island Sound Futures Fund (Futures Fund) grants will support projects that:

Prevent 618,934 gallons of stormwater and 2,996 pounds of nitrogen pollution from entering the Long Island Sound

Remove 161,250 pounds of marine debris

Restore 70 acres of coastal habitat

Engage more than 300,000 people through programs that promote stewardship of the Sound

Conserve and enhance habitats for shorebirds, songbirds, diamondback terrapins, native pollinators and other wildlife

Restore fish passage for brook trout and migratory aquatic species such as alewives, blueback herring, shad and eel

Launch new oyster restoration efforts

Funding for the grant program comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as part of the Long Island Sound Partnership (LISP), with additional support from NFWF and The Zoetis Foundation.

“Estuaries and their surrounding lands and waters represent some of the most productive wildlife habitats and most economically important areas in the world,” said Jeff Trandahl, executive director and CEO of NFWF. “The Long Island Sound is the second-largest estuary on the East Coast and one of North America’s most biologically diverse estuaries. Its watershed stretches 16,820 square miles across five states, with more than 16,000 miles of rivers feeding fresh water into the sound.

“Sustaining the health of Long Island Sound benefits a wondrous assortment of wildlife while also ensuring prosperity for thousands of communities, large and small.”

The LISP initiated the Futures Fund in 2005 through EPA’s Long Island Sound Office and NFWF. The grant program has a strong history of making environmental improvements by supporting people and communities who value the Sound and take a direct role in its future.

Since its inception, the Futures Fund has invested $68 million in 688 projects. The program has generated an additional $87 million of grantee matching contributions toward these projects for a total conservation impact of $167 million. The projects have reduced 130,000 pounds of nitrogen from entering the Sound, restored 862 acres of fish and wildlife habitat, treated 212 million gallons of stormwater pollution, and engaged 5 million people in protection and restoration of the Sound.

“This year’s Futures Fund projects will support water quality improvements, habitat restoration, and other critical efforts across the watershed that are vital to protecting Long Island Sound,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Mark Sanborn. “Long Island Sound is a national treasure, and this funding exemplifies EPA’s commitment to supporting the economic and recreational benefits the Sound offers to millions of people.”

“EPA is proud to support conservation and restoration efforts in the Long Island Sound, working alongside our state and local partners,” said EPA Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci. “These practical projects not only preserve vital ecosystems but also help build a legacy of environmental stewardship for future generations.”

“The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) stands proudly with the Long Island Sound Partnership and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation in welcoming another year of impactful Futures Fund projects across the Long Island Sound Watershed,” CT DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. “In Connecticut, eleven distinct NGOs took home a total of 12 awards (Save the Sound was awarded two!) for projects ranging from riparian buffers to fish passage restoration, hands-on science programs to saltmarsh restoration, and a green roof. These are just a few of the ways that today’s grantees are embracing this funding opportunity to further the health of our resources and residents across the Long Island Sound Watershed.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said ""DEC is committed to protecting Long Island Sound, one of New York’s most important natural resources, a vital economic engine, and a place cherished by communities along its shores. The Futures Fund supports projects that strengthen the Sound’s ecosystem by improving water quality, restoring habitats, and encouraging local stewardship, while reflecting a shared commitment with our partners at EPA, NFWF, and CTDEEP. DEC applauds the awardees for the meaningful benefits their work will deliver.""

FW: What is the outlook for renewable energy in 2026 and beyond?
In addition, interest and inflation rates will likely eventually moderate, thus making renewable energy projects more viable.","FW: What do you see as the most transformative trends currently reshaping the global renewable energy landscape?

McWilliams: The global renewable energy landscape is shifting from climate-first to security-driven economics. China, Europe and the US now prioritise supply chain resilience and industrial competitiveness alongside long-term 2050 goals. China’s dominance – over 80 percent of solar manufacturing, 75 percent of batteries and 95 to 97 percent of rare earth processing – creates structural dependencies that the policies of other countries are aiming to unravel. A further structural trend is artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) rapidly rising electricity demand: industry projections suggest data centres could exceed Japan’s consumption by 2030, with grid bottlenecks already delaying around 20 percent of new projects. Renewables overtook coal as the largest source of global power in early 2025, but further gains depend on also allocating capital to grid infrastructure, storage and industrial electrification, where significant system-wide returns may now sit.

Duman: While the current economic and political climate has slowed down investments in renewable energy projects in certain jurisdictions and renewable energy developers and operators are contending with higher interest and inflation rates, more expensive renewable energy projects and a weakening of state government support and incentives – as demonstrated by the US federal government’s opposition to offshore wind projects, as well as the UK government’s recent consultation paper to change or pause the inflation escalator index for UK renewable energy credits – renewable energy still continues to remain a focus globally with global renewable power output continuing to increase rapidly. As a result, renewable energy developers have become more circumspect and selective with their investments. In this more selective environment, solar photovoltaics (PV) and onshore wind continue to be the backbone of new renewable capacity. According to the International Energy Agency, around 95 percent of the next wave of renewables are likely to come from solar PV and onshore wind. Cheap solar in particular continues to be transformational, with declining module costs, faster installation and modularity – from rooftop to utility scale – pushing solar deeper into emerging markets. One of the biggest barriers to high renewables penetration is variability and the growing need for stable energy. Energy storage, especially battery storage, is developing at pace, both in scale and cost reduction.

Moir: Geopolitical tensions are fuelling volatility in energy markets, and in some regions, consensus on the energy transition is being questioned. Against this backdrop, four trends are reshaping the global renewable energy landscape. First, electricity demand is growing faster than overall energy demand, driven by AI adoption, electrified transport and cooling systems, while renewables dominate new capacity additions. Second, rapid electrification and renewable deployment are exposing grid constraints as a critical bottleneck, with connection queues far exceeding available capacity, highlighting the need for major transmission upgrades. Third, grid flexibility is becoming essential – integrating intermittent renewables requires assets that stabilise the grid, including short and long duration storage, such as batteries, hydrogen and pumped hydro, nuclear, including small modular reactors, dispatchable low-carbon power, and gas power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Finally, governments are responding to inflationary pressures by lowering the cost of capital and consumer prices through long term, transparent frameworks such as contracts for difference (CfDs), capacity markets and regulated asset base (RAB)-style models.

FW: How are recent advances in energy storage technologies changing the economics and reliability of renewable power systems?

Duman: Battery storage operators are now using AI to analyse complex and large datasets such as weather patterns, historical data and market prices to forecast energy needs and renewable energy output from solar and wind facilities. Analysis has shown that the forecasts of such AI models are 25 percent more accurate than forecasts using traditional methods. By using such AI models, battery storage operators are able to predict energy supply and demand more accurately and navigate the peaks and troughs of energy supply and demand more accurately, thus allowing them to maximise the arbitrage between the electricity they purchase from the grid and store in their battery systems during troughs, and the electricity they sell and discharge to the grid during peaks.

Moir: Recent advances in electricity storage are transforming the economics and reliability of renewable power systems. Storage is shifting from a niche role in ancillary services to a core component of system infrastructure. Falling battery costs and wider price spreads enable profitable arbitrage and co-location with wind and solar, reducing curtailment and negative pricing risk, improving revenue stability and project bankability. Long-duration electricity storage (LDES) is gaining traction, supported by mechanisms such as the UK’s cap-and-floor regime and Italy’s MACSE auctions, which de-risk debt and enhance financing. As short-term markets saturate, flexible resources and duration diversity become essential to manage multi-hour renewable lulls, intermittency and seasonal swings. Battery storage is now central to the energy transition, which is critical for higher renewable penetration amid grid constraints and rising electricity demand. Looking ahead, we expect seasonal storage to become increasingly important as renewables dominate supply.

McWilliams: Energy storage economics have flipped dramatically – global battery demand in one week of 2024 exceeded total annual demand a decade prior, reaching 1TWh for the first time. China’s control of over 75 percent of battery cell manufacturing delivers cost advantage through vertical integration and scale. Lithium-ion batteries have become cheaper despite raw material volatility, enhancing renewable project viability by mitigating intermittency. Beyond batteries, the EU leads in liquid air storage while pumped hydro delivers 46GW of EU capacity. Sodium-ion, flow batteries and solid-state technologies help diversify risks. However, regulatory frameworks and supply chain constraints for critical minerals remain challenges. Policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), EU Battery Regulation and UK Energy Act provide clarity on recycling mandates and manufacturing incentives, de-risking long-term storage investments essential for renewable reliability at scale.

FW: To what extent are policy frameworks like the Inflation Reduction Act or the EU Green Deal driving long-term investment in renewables?

McWilliams: The US IRA is reshaping deployment economics, mobilising over $1 trillion in projected investment through 2032. Solar additions are tracking around 40-50 percent above pre-IRA expectations, with around three-quarters of new clean energy investment flowing into below-median income counties. This reverses longstanding patterns of uneven regional investment and arises at a time when COP30’s Baku to Belém Roadmap targets $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035. The EU Green Deal is positioning wind as both a climate solution and a strategic industry, supporting around 300,000 jobs today and projected to become Europe’s largest power source by 2027. Policy risk remains, but framing decarbonisation through energy security has proven more politically durable and continues to anchor long-term private investment.

Moir: Investors seek certainty, stable policy and transparency. Political risk, including upcoming elections, often deters investment. A recent example is the uncertainty surrounding the IRA, which has shaken investor confidence in the US, delaying capital flows into renewable assets and slowing the energy transition. In contrast, Europe and the UK have earned credibility through stable frameworks like CfDs, capacity markets and regulated models, such as RAB for carbon dioxide (CO2) transport and storage, and new nuclear. These mechanisms are designed to reduce financing costs by providing predictable cash flows. Initiatives in the UK, such as Clean Power 2030 and targeted support for LDES, reinforce long-term commitments to renewables, flexibility and low-carbon dispatchable power. The lesson is clear – complex or shifting rules and political reversals deter investment. Stability, simplicity and credible delivery remain the decisive catalysts for attracting long-term capital.

Duman: Policy frameworks have been highly effective in attracting private capital to investments in renewable energy projects, by creating stable investment regimes and promising predictable investment returns for private investors. Indeed, both the IRA and the EU’s Green Deal have been recognised for rallying hundreds of billions of dollars of private investments into renewable energy projects, while creating and reskilling workers for numerous high-quality, well-paying jobs in the renewables sector. However, investors have become more cautious with respect to policy frameworks, noting that they can be easily withdrawn due to a change in governments or political headwinds and they can also lead to malinvestments in the renewables sector.

FW: What role do you foresee for green hydrogen in decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors by 2026 and beyond?

Moir: Green hydrogen is entering early deployment, with its near-term role concentrated in hard-to-abate sectors where electrification is not feasible. Industrial heat, refining, chemicals and sustainable aviation fuel remain the most promising applications, but only if costs decrease. However, the buzz around green hydrogen a few years ago has started to fade, with many projects being delayed or cancelled – even those that have received generous government subsidies – and several players deciding to leave the market entirely. Aside from the challenging economics, the two key challenges being faced are the lack of an offtake market and of large-scale transportation and storage infrastructure. There simply is not a broad market of creditworthy offtakers willing to commit to long-term contracts with material potential liabilities, particularly if it may involve material capital expenditure to enable the facility or asset to use hydrogen or increased operational risk. And the lack of existing infrastructure heightens the risk of there being a single point of failure, for both the supplier and the offtaker, with no easy way to mitigate. If green hydrogen is to fulfil its potential, governments will need to address both these issues, including helping to solve the ‘chicken and egg’ issue in relation to building new infrastructure.

Duman: While hard-to-abate sectors are major contributors to global CO2 emissions – the production of steel, cement and fertiliser accounts for approximately 9 percent, 8 percent and 2 percent of annual global emissions respectively – the products of such sectors are necessary for human development, and we can only expect global usage of such products, and related CO2 emissions, to grow as the world population increases and global living standards rise. Therefore, green hydrogen will have a key role in the decarbonisation of these industries as it remains the most promising solution to this conundrum. However, large scale green hydrogen technology is still in its infancy and further investments, government support and incentives, alongside continued research and development, will likely be required to further develop and scale-up the technology.

McWilliams: By 2026, green hydrogen will primarily scale in sectors where consumers or manufacturers can absorb a sustainability premium, notably green steel and low-carbon logistics. China holds more than 60 percent of global electrolyser manufacturing, replicating the pattern seen in solar and batteries and complicating reshoring efforts elsewhere. Recent demonstrations show viable hydrogen use in glass, ceramics and minerals processing, with feedstock replacement and seasonal storage expected to follow. Hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation will rely on hydrogen-derived fuels, while blue hydrogen provides transitional volumes because it can be produced at industrial scale using existing gas infrastructure, bridging supply until green hydrogen becomes cost-competitive. Infrastructure remains the constraint, as pipelines, storage and port facilities must develop in parallel with demand. Amid all of this, companies are increasingly structuring contracts to preserve optionality as hydrogen economics evolve.

FW: How are supply chain vulnerabilities and critical mineral dependencies influencing project timelines and costs in the renewable sector?

Duman: The supply chain shocks stemming from recent events – ranging from the Houthi rebels’ attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, to tariff wars over solar panels and critical and rare earth minerals – have pushed the issue of supply chain vulnerabilities to the forefront of renewable project developers’ minds. Developers now have to plan for mitigants to counteract such vulnerabilities, including rerouting supply chains, finding contingency suppliers or replacing suppliers altogether, and purchasing more expensive insurance policies – all of which results in more costs for the project and potentially extensions to the project timeline. In relation to tariffs on supplies and equipment for renewable projects, developers are now keen to negotiate with their counterparties to allocate liability for unforeseen tariffs.

McWilliams: Supply chain brittleness is now the primary cause of renewable project delays, regardless of policy support. The 2025 US-Australia critical minerals framework, which is an $8.5bn pipeline with $1bn initial financing, highlights geopolitical realignment as Australia navigates friendshoring with other allies and while China tightens rare earth export controls. Analysts still expect 10-20 years before meaningful supply independence, with diversification constrained by China’s structural dominance comprising 95-97 percent of rare earth processing and major control of polysilicon. Operational limits compound these pressures because, even when materials are available, shortages in engineering capacity, fabrication and specialised installation vessels slow the shift from approval to construction. The UK faces a 1-2GW annual solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) shortfall, and vessel scarcity threatens delivery of roughly 42GW of approved offshore wind capacity, requiring near-doubling of installation capability. In this environment of structural constraint, nickel, cobalt and graphite may stabilise, but copper risks a 30 percent deficit by the mid-2030s. Developers are therefore lengthening procurement windows and adding escalation clauses, yet mine development cycles of 7-10 years mean supply cannot adjust quickly.

Moir: Supply chain vulnerabilities and critical mineral dependencies are increasingly shaping renewable project timelines and costs. Geopolitical tensions have exposed concentration risks, with China controlling most lithium, cobalt and rare earth refining. Export restrictions and price volatility for copper, steel and specialised components, compounded by tariffs and inflation, are extending lead times and raising EPC costs. Added scrutiny of Chinese components for environmental, social and governance, as well as cyber and broader national security concerns, are further tightening terms and affecting bankability. Offshore wind illustrates the challenge, as long waits for heavy-lift vessels, turbines, high voltage direct current cables and other key components are slowing deployment. Developers are responding with longer, more collaborative procurement, earlier supplier engagement and more robust standardised supply contracts, covering contingencies such as force majeure, change in law, and so on, realistic schedules and cost-control provisions. Governments are rolling out industrial strategies and port upgrades, but these measures will take time. For now, proactive risk management and disciplined planning remain essential to protect returns.

FW: In your view, how is digitalisation through AI, smart grids and the internet of things enabling more efficient and scalable deployment of renewables?

Moir: Digitalisation has shifted from being an add-on to a core enabler of renewable integration and scalability. AI-driven optimisation improves dispatch, revenue stacking and battery cycling strategies across multiple markets, while predictive maintenance reduces downtime and extends asset life. Smart grids and advanced system planning, centralised through bodies like the National Energy System Operator, use real-time data to prioritise reinforcements, manage congestion and unlock connections, moving from ‘first-come’ to ‘first-ready and needed’. At the edge, internet of things (IoT) devices enable consumer-led flexibility, complementing utility-scale storage and interconnectors, though progress has been slower than expected. Meanwhile, the AI and data centre boom driving demand is also catalysing flexible power purchase agreements and co-location with low-carbon dispatchable power. These projects benefit from low-cost integration at scale and the creditworthiness of offtakers, often major tech companies.

McWilliams: AI, IoT and digital grid controls are enabling more efficient renewable deployment and simultaneously increasing system stress. AI-enabled building and industrial management systems can cut energy use by 16-36 percent, easing peak loads at a time when global grids may need 80 million kilometres of new transmission by 2040. China leads large-scale smart grid rollout, using AI-controlled microgrids and smart inverters to integrate solar and storage while creating new revenue opportunities through virtual power plants. IoT sensors improve real-time grid visibility and fault detection, yet AI’s power demand is rising fast, pushing data centre developers to choose locations based on power availability rather than network infrastructure, with many planning onsite generation, including renewable sources, by 2030. The constraints are, however, familiar – high upfront costs, interoperability issues, cyber security exposure and regulatory lag. Coordinated investment in both digital and physical grid infrastructure is essential for renewables to scale reliably.

Duman: The digitalisation of the entire energy ecosystem will allow all stakeholders to better optimise their production, transmission and consumption of electricity, for example by improving the collection of energy data, which will then be used for more accurate energy demand and supply forecasts. It may also improve the monitoring and control of electrical grid balance, especially for the purposes of energy storage and integration of renewable energy facilities into the grid. End-users will also be provided with real-time information of their energy usage to enable them to make more informed decisions on their energy consumption. Digitalisation is also likely to increase the grid’s resilience with automated fault detection and mitigation measures. All of these effects will help overcome the wider public’s two main bugbears of renewable energy – its intermittent nature and perceived high cost of electricity production – and hopefully make the widespread deployment of renewable energy more attractive.

FW: What is the outlook for renewable energy in 2026 and beyond? How might supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and social equity concerns influence future demand?

McWilliams: The outlook for 2026 and beyond is defined by strong ambition but uneven capacity. COP30’s Baku-Belém Roadmap targets $1.3 trillion in annual climate finance by 2035, but delivery depends on navigating China’s dominance across manufacturing and materials. Geopolitical tensions, particularly those linked to Russia, have also accelerated Europe’s pursuit of energy independence, boosting renewables even as supply chain bottlenecks slow deployment. Vessel shortages, rare earth dependencies and limited construction capacity remain critical risks that policy cannot resolve quickly. Social equity will shape political durability. Renewables create substantial jobs, but legacy energy workforce transitions must be actively managed to maintain support. Upfront system costs remain a barrier for low-income households despite improving economics. The outlook for 2026 and beyond depends on balancing these tensions. Countries that deepen domestic supply chains, secure critical minerals and manage social transitions effectively will capture outsize investment and deployment growth through the late 2020s.

Duman: Renewable energy technology is still becoming cheaper and more efficient, and this will continue to drive the investment case for the renewables sector. In addition, interest and inflation rates will likely eventually moderate, thus making renewable energy projects more viable. Finally, the trend of deglobalisation, which has been one of the root causes for supply chain constraints, geopolitical tensions and social equity concerns, could work toward solving some of the issues the sector currently faces as a result of governments’ focus on developing onshore industries – eventually leading to an increase in domestic manufacturing and enhanced national energy security.

Moir: We expect that renewables, storage and nuclear will continue to grow, driven by economics, electrification and AI mainstream adoption. The main constraint remains grid infrastructure. Transmission build-out, both on and offshore, the integration of flexible assets and connection reforms will determine how quickly queued projects reach commercial operations date. Due to the penetration of renewables, we expect more volatility and seasonality in power markets, increasing the value of flexibility and long-duration storage. Supply chain pressures should ease gradually with industrial policy, such as US nearshoring, but vessel availability, critical mineral diversification and geopolitics will continue to shape costs. Trade tariffs, election cycles and policy reversals will influence investor appetite and financing costs. Markets with stable, simple frameworks and credible delivery will attract capital. Finally, governments must manage consumer costs and deliver local benefits, including jobs and infrastructure upgrades, to maintain public acceptance and political stability.

Canada’s Gibson Energy just renewed decades-long contracts at its key Edmonton terminal, greenlit a new US infrastructure project, and laid out a fully funded growth and maintenance budget for 2026.

What does this mean?

Gibson Energy renewed a 20-year take-or-pay refined products services deal and added another 10 years to a terminal storage take-or-pay agreement at its Edmonton, Alberta terminal with major integrated oil sands customers. Those take-or-pay contracts guarantee Gibson a minimum level of revenue whether or not customers use the full capacity, smoothing cash flows in a volatile commodity world. The firm says these extensions prove the growing demand for its infrastructure and highlight how essential the Edmonton terminal is to oil sands producers’ logistics. South of the border, Gibson has approved a new infrastructure project in Texas that will tie into its Wink-to-Gateway system, supporting US-led growth. To back all this up, the company issued 2026 growth capital guidance of C$150 million – including about C$50 million of already sanctioned spend – plus a C$50–60 million replacement capital program, stressing that its 2026 plan is fully funded from existing resources.

Why should I care?

Markets: Locked-in cash flows soothe energy sector nerves.

Long-term take-or-pay contracts are prized in the midstream world because they provide clear visibility on future revenue, regardless of short-term oil price swings. By renewing a 20-year refined products agreement and tacking on 10 more years of storage services, Gibson is effectively pinning down a big slice of its future earnings with bond-like cash streams. That kind of stability can help support valuations and dividends in a sector where plenty of rivals still lean on more volume-sensitive, shorter-term deals. And with the Texas project tying into Wink-to-Gateway, Gibson is signaling that capital is still flowing into North American oil logistics, hinting that investors expect steady demand for oil sands and Permian barrels even as the energy transition rolls on.

The bigger picture: Pipelines still shape the energy transition’s messy middle.

Oil sands producers need dependable storage and transportation to keep exports flowing, and Gibson’s Edmonton terminal is part of that backbone. When “senior integrated oil sands customers” commit to 10–20 years of service, they are effectively betting on meaningful production and refining activity well into the 2040s, despite mounting climate policy pressure. At the same time, the Texas expansion and Wink-to-Gateway integration point to resilient cross-border energy trade between Canada and the US, even as both countries pour money into renewables. For policymakers and executives, that underscores a key reality: large midstream assets are still attracting multi-decade commitments, which will influence how the energy mix shifts and how capital gets split between fossil fuel and low-carbon infrastructure.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2FM3515607_xml.jpeg?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=51712c2911317f791a3052e388c11439,N,,2025-12-02 12:04:04.381309

Total sales declined 0.9% to 164,925 vehicles for the month. Dealer services provider Cox Automotive Inc. forecasted U.S. sales for the industry would fall to 1.27 million in November, down 7.8% from last year. Two fewer selling days, the end of the federal EV tax credit and higher vehicle prices from tariffs affected the total.

Sales of F-Series pickups, the country's best-selling trucks and the Dearborn automaker's profit engine, fell 9.6%. Multiple fires at an aluminum sheet plant in New York over the past seven weeks halted electric F-150 Lightning production and disrupted Super Duty and F-150 volumes.

Ford expects to make up some of the lost production next year with an added shift at Dearborn Truck Plant and additional workers at Kentucky Truck plant. It's not clear when F-150 Lightning manufacturing will resume, and reports have suggested Ford is considering ending the program. The company plans to launch in 2028 a next-generation electric full-size pickup at its new BlueOval City plant in Tennessee.

The decision to suspend Lightning production came after the end of the federal tax credit. That's part of a campaign by the administration of President Donald Trump to dismantle what he has termed an ""EV mandate"" on consumers. It comes alongside efforts to revoke California's waiver to set its own tailpipe emissions standards that other state can adopt and to roll back federal emissions requirements.

Despite the EV drop, consumers did embrace some form of electrification: Hybrids were up 14%, being a more flexible option for buyers with EV range anxiety. Gas- and diesel-powered vehicles were up 2.2%, as dealers look to sell off 2025 model-year cars, trucks and SUVs.

Total truck sales were flat, while SUV deliveries declined 4.9% with the electric Mustang Mach-E down 49%. The Mustang coupe rose 79%. The Lincoln luxury brand declined 12%.

For SUVs, Expedition, whose production also was hit by the Novelis Inc. aluminum plant fires, was down 8.8%. Escape fell 32% ahead of the end of its production for retooling at Louisville Assembly Plant for an electric midsize truck built on the next-generation Universal EV Platform and Production System. Explorer grew 42%. Bronco was up 7%, but Bronco Sport fell 4.1%.

F-150 Lightning sales declined 72%. Ranger midsize truck grew 36%. Maverick small pickup was up 43%. Transit commercial van rose 17%, while the E-Transit fell 82%. General Motors Co. said last month it was ending production of its Chevrolet BrightDrop electric vans built in Canada.

At Lincoln, Navigator and Aviator rose 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Nautilus fell 30% and Corsair, which is ending production alongside the Escape, declined 12%.

Elsewhere, Kia Corp.'s U.S. sales rose 3% in November. Hyundai Motor Co.'s were down 2%. GM and Stellantis NV don't report monthly sales. The Detroit Three will report fourth-quarter and full-year U.S. sales after the new year.

It is touted by reshoring proponents that when a manufacturing facility moves back to the United States or expands, it creates domestic jobs that generate significant tax revenue.
These incentives often include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation and exemptions that reduce the immediate taxable income, lowering the initial tax revenue.
In addition, for every one worker in manufacturing, 4.8 workers are added to the overall U.S. economy.","The Trump administration has stated that its economic agenda is designed to address the debt crisis by focusing on pro-growth policies that it expects will generate enough revenue to reduce the debt burden.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” is the cornerstone of the plan and involves significant tax cuts, which the administration argues will unleash rapid economic growth. The belief is that this accelerated growth will generate a larger tax base, ultimately leading to greater tax revenues that will help pay down the debt.

Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other non-partisan analysts, have estimated that the net effect of the tax plan, when fully accounted for, will likely add several trillion dollars to the national debt over the next decade due to lost revenue.

The administration’s trade strategy, which includes imposing new tariffs on imported goods, claims these duties will generate “trillions of dollars” for the federal government, providing a new source of revenue to offset the deficit. However, based on recent estimates from non-partisan economic think tanks, the new tariffs are generally projected to generate revenue in the range of $200 billion to $240 billion in 2026.

The final, official figure for the Fiscal Year 2025 federal budget deficit is estimated to be approximately $1.8 trillion based on the final estimates and reporting from the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Treasury Department. For the first time, net interest payments on the national debt surpassed $1 trillion due to both high debt levels and higher interest rates.

Spending on major entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continued to rise significantly, growing by about 8% collectively. While revenues increased overall due to individual income and payroll taxes, this was partially offset by a decline in corporate tax receipts, potentially due to new tax deductions.

What could be a genuine game changer in attacking the $38 trillion federal debt is the speed and magnitude of the reshoring of foreign manufacturing to U.S. states. When looking at potential future revenue streams, aside from raising taxes to offset deficit spending, generating hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs that work in tandem with AI is a viable option that carries large tax revenue implications.

There are no specific estimates of future tax revenue from the reshoring of manufacturing. Reshoring generates tax revenue through two primary mechanisms, the largest being increased payroll and income taxes, and corporate and investment taxes. It is touted by reshoring proponents that when a manufacturing facility moves back to the United States or expands, it creates domestic jobs that generate significant tax revenue.

The second primary source of tax receipts is revenue from the profits of the new or expanded U.S.-based manufacturing companies, as well as revenue from taxes on capital investment, new construction and local property taxes for the new facilities. But reshoring is heavily incentivized by federal acts (like the CHIPS Act, Inflation Reduction Act, etc.) and state programs. These incentives often include refundable tax credits, 100% bonus depreciation and exemptions that reduce the immediate taxable income, lowering the initial tax revenue. Hence, specific revenue estimates are elusive.

But the potential numbers look promising. According to the National Association of Manufacturers, for every $1.00 spent in manufacturing, there is a total impact of $2.65 to the overall U.S. economy. In addition, for every one worker in manufacturing, 4.8 workers are added to the overall U.S. economy. This figure represents one of the largest sectoral multipliers in the economy. In 2024, manufacturing workers in the United States earned $106,691 on average, including pay and benefits. For all categories of manufacturing workers, average hourly earnings were $35.50, up 3.9% year over year.

Over the next decade, because of organic growth and reshoring efforts, 3.8 million manufacturing jobs will likely be needed, and 1.9 million are expected to be unfilled if more people do not pursue modern manufacturing careers. Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute found that of open jobs, 2.8 million will come from retirement and 760,000 from industry growth, and an estimated 230,000 jobs will be created from recent legislative and regulatory actions.

America leads the world in innovation, and manufacturers in the United States perform 52.9% of all private-sector R&D in the nation, driving more innovation than any other sector. R&D in the manufacturing sector has risen from $132.5 billion in 2000 to a record $404.8 billion in 2023. In the most recent data, pharmaceuticals accounted for 36.1% of all manufacturing R&D, spending $146.1 billion in 2023. Semiconductor and other electronic components (13.7%), other computer and electronic manufacturing (13.6%) and motor vehicles and parts (9.6%) also contributed significantly to R&D spending in 2023, with each hitting new all-time high levels of R&D for the year. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis)

At a time when there is growing concern about AI-related job destruction in several service sectors of the economy, the ramping up of reshoring and expansion of domestic manufacturing is timely. With retirements rising and digital fluency growing, manufacturers are capturing institutional knowledge, redesigning roles for human-machine collaboration and upskilling at scale. Based on what we now know about the fragility of global supply chains during the pandemic, it is in our national and economic interest to “Build Baby Build” factories as far as the eye can see.",https://www.stockinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_130449392.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:59:01.290552

Decarbonization is taking on new importance among companies who must reduce emissions to meet investor & customer expectations, while also delivering enterprise value. It is not a coincidence that decarbonization, when done correctly, enables companies to fulfill both obligations, given how interwoven emissions are with commercial value.

This third and final blog in our three-part series on operational decarbonization explores how companies can use tailored building management to reduce their real estate-based emissions while also bolstering operational performance. As with our first two blogs on industrial heat and fleets, we highlight real-world case studies to bring building sector decarbonization to life and highlight the unique challenges and opportunities associated with emissions across the built environment.

Reducing building sector emissions is a win-win for companies

Globally, energy used directly within buildings and for generating electricity and heat for buildings accounts for 26 percent of all energy-related emissions.These emissions are largely driven by electricity imports and fossil fuels such as natural gas, used for building heating applications.

The significant energy consumption giving rise to these emissions is naturally a major cost for building owners and occupiers, making reductions attractive both from an economic and emissions perspective.

Given these factors, reducing building energy consumption is a growing focus for building owners and occupiers, as is reducing associated emissions by switching to cleaner energy sources. The technologies needed to accomplish both objectives are mature and proven. Heating needs, for example, can be addressed by adopting heat pumps or connecting to heat networks and improving the building fabric with more efficient insulation and glazing solutions, as well as lighting upgrades. Building owners and occupiers can leverage smart technologies linked to advanced building management systems to optimize energy use, while also benefiting from the rapid growth of on-site renewables to generate low-cost, zero-carbon electricity.

There are clear benefits to tackling building energy use and reducing emissions. For example, building owners are more likely to attract tenants seeking a space with lower operating costs and who increasingly have emissions targets to meet, sometimes commanding a rent premium. Mandatory energy efficiency standards are also increasingly common. Thus, improving building performance helps avoid stranded assets, while also potentially offering access to preferential lending terms and higher valuations from sustainability-focused investors.

With real estate-based emissions being such a significant source of emissions for most companies, tackling them is a critical part of achieving any corporate-wide emissions reduction target. When paired with the cost savings from lower energy bills, building emissions reductions represent a major commercial opportunity.

Call to action

To get started on building decarbonization, consider the following practical steps and read on to see how real-world companies are putting them into action.

Unlock hidden savings: Conduct a building energy audit to identify cost savings and emissions reduction opportunities through building efficiency improvements.

Invest in future-proof technologies: Invest in proven technologies like heat pumps, smart building management systems, and on-site renewables to increase operational efficiencies and attract tenants.

Move ahead of the curve: Avoid stranded assets, access preferential lending terms and higher valuations, and meet emerging energy efficiency standards by investing in building emissions reductions now.

Case study one

The situation

A global leisure and entertainment company with a portfolio of more than 120 sites worldwide sought a costed emissions reduction roadmap for its buildings portfolio to support its company-wide net zero target, and deliver an increased enterprise value via lower opex and an enhanced customer proposition.pe

The solution

ERM identified several sites that were representative of the company’s full portfolio, including a theme park, aquarium, museum, and mixed leisure attraction, before conducting deep-dive energy and carbon assessments on each archetype to establish its energy use profile.

For each archetype, ERM assessed a suite of carbon reduction measures, including energy efficiencies, on-site renewables, renewable energy procurement, and electrification of fossil fuel heating, cooling, and food preparation.

ERM then calculated emission impacts, costs, and benefits for the company’s full portfolio, adjusting for local climate and energy mixes at all global sites.

Lastly, ERM recommended measures to reduce the GHG emissions of the company’s building portfolio by over 90 percent. Key recommendations included: upgrades to heating, ventilation, cooling systems, lighting, motors, and pumps; installing rooftop and car-park solar photovoltaics; and procuring renewable electricity.

The impact

The site evaluation found that 73 percent of the building portfolio’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions could be eliminated with a total investment of just under $50 million. Furthermore, these measures all had a positive net present value or had no net cost impact.

ERM identified a further 20 percent of Scope 1 and 2 emissions that could be eliminated for an average cost of ~$100/tonne CO2

The assessment identified highly attractive energy efficiency measures, delivering GHG emissions savings of nearly 20 percent of base year emissions with payback periods of less than two years.

Lessons learned

Rapid progress towards an actionable decarbonization plan for large portfolios can be achieved through an ‘archetype-driven’ analysis focused on a sample of representative sites.

Companies can quickly evaluate and implement emissions reduction measures relevant to their global building portfolio, while accounting for regional climate and energy market contexts.

Layered assessments of multiple building decarbonization options can identify significant concurrent benefits, including operational cost savings, access to more favorable financing, and enhanced revenue protection.

Case study two

The situation

An automotive parts manufacturer with more than 60 manufacturing sites worldwide pursued energy consumption reductions across its site portfolio, using external capital funding through an Energy Saving as a Service (ESaaS) program.

The solution

ERM personnel applied a four-phase approach:

Identified Energy Conservation Measures (ECMs) based on data collected from each site, on-site and remote audits of the manufacturer’s portfolio, plus workshops with local site teams. ERM personnel held workshops with each site team to “fill the gaps”, jointly, where there was missing data.

Secured funding for these ECMs, using a mix of energy supplier funding and performance guarantees.

Installed and commissioned the new

Delivered maintenance services for the installed equipment and provided active energy performance management via a dedicated digital platform to generate additional energy savings and drive behavioral change among employees (e.g., using energy more efficiently).

The impact

ERM personnel conducted audits on more than 60 sites across 10 countries and identified more than 250 ECMs and installed and commissioned the new equipment.

Over 500 GWh of energy use is now monitored for the manufacturer through a dedicated energy monitoring platform.

The above actions delivered an annual energy reduction of more than 10 percent across the site portfolio, representing annual CO2 savings of 40,000 tonnes, with no upfront investment by the company. Furthermore, the manufacturer achieved annual estimated cost savings of €6.2 million.

Lessons learned

Complex global companies can achieve significant energy and carbon reductions by implementing energy savings programs, with little or no capital investment, leveraging supplier funding and performance guarantees.

Data gaps do not have to block Companies can fill gaps via collaborative workshops with local site teams who better understand the specifics of their own operations and buildings portfolio.

Companies considering their own energy savings programs should ensure that their approaches are holistic (i.e., site- and company-wide, including process improvements) and verifiable through a comprehensive metering & monitoring campaign.

Conclusion

Our three-part blog series on operational decarbonization demonstrates how targeted emissions reduction initiatives can enhance corporate resiliency and performance amidst recent shifts in the business and geopolitical landscapes. These benefits are not exclusive to a select few companies. With the right actions, organizations operating across all sectors can access them regardless of their operational circumstances.

Taking lessons learned from the case studies covered above, companies with significant real-estate/built environment assets can translate decarbonization from ambition to actuality, reaping benefits along the way. Remember these key takeaways.

With the absence of the EV tax credit, automakers are predicting a market-wide slowdown over the next few quarters, and that puts brands in a weird limbo where executives expect the electric vehicle segment to stagnate despite the billions of dollars in recent investments.

But there's one market that automakers seem to be ignoring: the commercial one. It might seem obvious, but business-to-business sales aren't exactly paying the bills like the consumer auto market. They could be, though, and that's what one former General Motors executive is betting big on.

30%: Automakers Are Retreating From Consumer EVs, But The Commercial Market Is Begging For Them

ZMD Truck Render

Former General Motors executive Dave Stenson believes that automakers are going about this perceived EV slowdown all wrong. While the big three in Detroit are seemingly leading a pullback in all things electric, Stenson is instead throwing his John DeLorean card onto the table and betting that his new startup has unlocked the secret to the next stage of electrification.

Stenson knows the drill—after all, he spent three decades in Detroit working through the algorithm of high-margin, high-volume consumer sales. Sell crossovers to suburbanites and the F-150s of the world. But when the government unstacks the deck and EVs no longer have a competitive edge, what can automakers do to ensure their new powertrains stay competitive?

Enter ZMD Motors, a startup that believes mainstream automakers have misjudged the timeline and approach to electrification. Essentially, ZMD is aiming to break the mold by moving into the medium-duty truck market. Stenson and ZMD see these platformed vehicles are the next big thing in the EV space.

Here's what Stenson revealed in an interview with Automotive News:

Stenson’s ultimate goal is to fill an untapped niche: the electrified Class 5 work truck category, to which the Ford F-550, Ram 5500 and Silverado 5500 belong. It’s been untapped for a reason, though. Automakers focused on light-duty, high-volume EVs first. Heavy-duty electrification poses unique challenges — range limitation being high on the list — with even less certain ROI prospects than light-duty electrics.

[...] The opportunity might be tough to see from Detroit, but in California, the business case is clear, Stenson said in an interview with Automotive News affiliate Crain’s Detroit Business.

“Nobody has brought a pickup cab-based, medium-duty EV to market,” Stenson said. “Whether it’s diesel or gas, you go out to California, and they don’t want either. They want electric where it fits their work needs.”

I know that you're just begging to hear about the next company that promises what might as well be vaporware. But ZMD's approach could just be the missing link in EV adoption.

See, the commercial segment of the auto industry is a completely different beast from passenger cars. Government, utility companies, construction firms and the like aren't shopping for the next big thing or a screen the size of a small TV. These consumers just want consistency and practicality, which gives brands an opportunity to focus on the tech and execution that can not only sustain a vehicle program but also build tech that will flow into the passenger car market in the future.

ZMD's truck-sized holes are the Class 5 work trucks. This opportunity represents an annual volume output of around 80,000 units. That's hardly an earth-shattering figure—GM sold nearly double that in passenger EVs through Q3 so far this year. But it is the perfect volume for a small startup that is eyeing up trucks with an ideal operating radius of less than 100 miles.

California in particular, is basically a goldmine in the waiting:

Electric medium-duty truck is a segment in high demand in California ZMD’s focus is on utility bucket trucks, municipal service trucks and the like, which make up a small but growing piece of the medium-duty niche. In California, there is huge demand for the product segment, said Daryl Trueblood, general manager at North Highland, Calif.-based vehicle upfitter One Stop Truck & Equipment.

Stenson's pitch is for automakers to supply the cab and chassis, then let ZMD do the rest. This lets both companies take a foothold in the Class 5 market while also supplying companies with a product that they so desperately want.

Will it work? Maybe. But what's keeping automakers from simply pivoting and copying ZMD's homework?

60%: Nvidia Gives Everyone The Brain Behind Self-Driving Cars

Nvidia Lidar

Nvidia has decided that if the world insists on building self-driving cars, it might as well give everyone a brain smart enough to handle the task.

The company officially released its newest self-driving model, Alpamayo-R1, this week. Nvidia is pitching it as the Rosetta Stone of robot driving that uses natural language to describe exactly what it sees and then acts on that description accordingly. Reuters explains:

On Monday, Nvidia released Alpamayo-R1 for self-driving vehicles. The software is what is known as a ""vision-language-action"" AI model, which means that the self-driving vehicle translates what its sensor banks see on the road into a description using natural language. [...]

For example, if the car sees a bike path, it will note that it sees the path and is adjusting course.

This seems like a basic problem to solve, but one of the biggest problems that engineers have reiterated time and time again is how difficult it can be to understand how self-driving models make the decisions they do. But with a model that describes its reasoning in an easy-to-understand natural language, that black box problem is less and less of a concern.

Most previous self-driving car software was limited in how it explained why the car chose a particular path, making it hard for engineers to understand what needed to be fixed to make the cars safer.

""One of the entire motivations behind making this open is so that developers and researchers can... understand how these models work so we can, as an industry, come up with standard ways of evaluating how they work,"" Katie Young, senior marketing manager for the automotive enterprise at Nvidia, told Reuters.

Nvidia says that the dataset has a total of 1,727 hours of recorded driving over 310,895 clips (each one about 20 seconds long). It isn't just perfect road conditions, either. The company says that it captured ""diverse traffic, weather conditions, obstacles and pedestrians"" in the model and also blends multi-camera and lidar for about half of the clips while 163,850 also have radar coverage as well. Half of the data is from U.S. roads.

If you're interested in exploring the model, you can download the dataset on Hugging Face and the developer kit on GitHub.

90%: Americans Have Had It With High Car Prices

For nearly half a decade, consumers have been paying the COVID-19 tax on new and used cars. Sticker price? Merely a suggestion as dealers are capitalizing on the ""Sure, I'll pay that!"" attitude since 2020.

But Americans have finally had enough of it. The average transaction price of a new car has skyrocketed to around $50,000, while new EVs are hitting a high of $59,125.

Those same dealerships are now noticing it in their sales trends. Analysts are also seeing in car-buying data that cars sit on lots for longer periods of time, and cash-on-the-hood discounts (which seemingly went extinct as the chip shortage started) are even making a comeback. The Wall Street Journal spills what's on consumers' minds:

Car buyers are downsizing, buying used vehicles, taking on longer car loans and holding out for deals.

“People are asking, ‘How can I afford this?’” said Robert Peltier, who owns dealerships in East Texas. He said traffic, while still solid, has slowed at his dealerships and more customers are gravitating toward less-costly cars such as the pint-size Chevrolet Trax. “There are people who are in debt and living paycheck to paycheck.”

This is kind of an unexpected, dramatic turn. 2025 was meant to be a victory lap—tax cuts, deregulation and American factories humming with domestic production that pump out affordable, home-grown cars. Basically, another year of people buying anything with four wheels and a made-in-America stamping.

But that's not what happened. Instead, the EV market is facing an anticipated collapse with Q4 being just the start. The loss of the $7,500 EV tax credit seemingly yanked thousands of theoretical sales off the board.

The loss of new car sales isn't just limited to electric cars, either. Gas cars are also showing signs of a downturn with fewer sales and longer times-to-turn. Some lenders are even easing up on their borrowing requirements, while auto loan defaults are encroaching on levels similar to the 2008 recession.

More from the WSJ:

Signs of strain are beginning to show up in the data. Cars are sitting longer on dealer lots. Dealers are piling on extra discounts to make sales. Lower-income borrowers are defaulting on car loans. Americans as a whole are spending less overall on vehicle purchases than they did a year ago.

“Other components of the economy are tugging on the consumer,” said Ivan Drury, an automotive analyst for the car-shopping website Edmunds.com. [...] The cost of car parts and repairs has climbed as well, so hanging on to old vehicles comes with its own costs. “You can’t really find relief,” Drury said.

This leaves American car buyers at an interesting crossroads. Keep an old car on the road while repair costs are soaring, or spend $50,000 on a new crossover?

Dealers know the jig is up. Discounts are rising, negotiations are back and earning your business is once again climbing the priority ladder. Meanwhile, consumers are simply refusing the notion of a $700-per-month car payment. Car buyer fever is breaking.

In this paper, the Bipartisan Policy Center presents a comprehensive timeline of major U.S. tax reform efforts from the end of World War II to the present, most recently passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). Our analysis includes the political dynamics, major policy details, and the budgetary effects of signature tax legislation throughout modern history. For this analysis, we define legislation as enacted on a bipartisan basis if its passage received at least one vote from a member of the opposite party. Our review also examines the trajectory and composition of federal revenue since the 1940s.

A few broad themes emerge from this review:

Increasing Partisanship: Tax laws were broadly bipartisan in the postwar era through the 1990s. At the turn of the century, each party started using the reconciliation process more frequently to advance partisan legislation—often including major tax revisions. Partly as a result, tax laws have become much more partisan in the 21st century than they were in the 20th.

Rising Spending and Deficits: Although this paper focuses on revenue changes, an unmistakable trend in the past quarter century has seen government spending rising as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) while revenue declined slightly. As a result, debt has been rising as a share of GDP—in good economic times and bad, in war and in peace. Major tax cuts this century have contributed to declining revenue, but significant increases in spending complete the picture.

Inflation Adjustments, then Extenders: From the 1940s through the 1970s, Congress frequently revisited the tax code because dollar amounts and thresholds were not automatically adjusted for inflation. This became a particular issue in the 1970s, as the country confronted high and persistent inflation. In 1981, Congress began automatically indexing various portions of the tax code for inflation, including income tax brackets. Since that change, lawmakers have needed to update the tax code for inflation less often. The inflation adjustments process was replaced through the 2010s with “tax extenders,” in which Congress would make temporary tax policies with an expiration date and extend them for only one or a few years at a time.

The Postwar Era: 1945-1969

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, the U.S. national debt rose to the highest levels in history. Federal expenditures then fell precipitously due to the war’s end, but tax rates stayed high well into the early 1960s. It wasn’t until the end of the 1960s that Congress significantly lowered tax rates.

Revenue Act of 1945

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The federal government’s need for revenue declined quickly as WWII ended. Although the national debt was high, Congress sought to provide economic relief from higher wartime tax rates.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law had three main components. It 1) lowered all individual tax rates, with the top rate falling from 94% to 86.45%; 2) repealed the excess profits tax on companies; and 3) reduced the top corporate tax rate to 38%.

Budgetary Projection: The Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation (JCIRT, predecessor to the Joint Committee on Taxation, or JCT) projected that the Revenue Act of 1945would decrease revenue by $5.9 billion over the fiscal year (which ran from July-June before 1974).

Revenue Act of 1948

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Policymakers expressed a growing concern over the tax treatment of married couples in two different types of states—“community property” states and “common law” states.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law eased marriage penalties in the tax code by, for example, making it easier for two spouses in a couple to split income and allowing marital deductions for estate and gift taxes. It also increased personal exemptions and established the additional exemption for the elderly and the blind (later the additional standard deduction).

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1948 would decrease revenue by $5 billion over the full year after enactment.

Revenue Act of 1950

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The Korean War began in June 1950. The United States needed to again raise military expenditures, which slowed down efforts to provide tax relief.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law raised individual tax rates across the board, with the lowest rate increasing from 16.6% to 20%, and the top rate increasing from 82.1% to 91%. Congress raised the top corporate tax rate from 38% to 45%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1950would increase revenue by $4.5 billion over the full year.

Excess Profits Tax of 1950

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: With government spending increasing in the face of the prolonged Korean War, Congress reinstated the excess profits tax.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law placed a 30% surcharge on excess business profits, meaning that some corporations faced a marginal rate of 77% (inclusive of surtaxes and excess profits taxes).

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Excess Profits Tax of 1950would increase revenue by $3.3 billion over the full year.

Revenue Act of 1951

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As the federal government faced additional financing needs for national defense, the Truman administration asked Congress for nearly $11 billion in tax increases that would close a budget deficit of around $10 billion. Congress managed to approve $5 billion in this 1951 tax law, which one economist noted ended a long period of relative harmony between Congress and the president on tax reform.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased individual income tax rates, corporate income tax rates (basic rate from 47% to 52%); capital gains tax rates (top rate from 25% to 26%); cigarette taxes (from $0.07 per pack to $0.08); gas taxes (from $0.015 per gallon to $0.02); and a variety of other excise taxes.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1951 would increase revenue by $5.4 billion over the full year.

Internal Revenue Code of 1954

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Congress engaged in the first wholesale revision of the U.S. tax code since 1876, “renumbering every section” and “making over 3,000 technical changes in the law.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reorganized the tax code into seven subtitles, including for income taxes, estate and gift taxes, employment taxes, and two subtitles for excise taxes. The law also reduced some tax rates. The lowest individual income tax rate fell from 22.2% to 20%. The highest rate fell from 92% to 91%. The top corporate tax rate was extended at 52% through March 1955 and was set to fall to 47% thereafter, although the 52% was subsequently extended through 1963.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 would decrease revenue by $0.2 billion over the full year after enactment.

Revenue Act of 1964 (“Kennedy Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Continuing to seek relief from the high tax rates of the 1940s and 1950s, Congress prioritized lowering taxes. The law inspired plenty of debate in Congress around “the wisdom of reducing taxes in a period of prosperity when the government was already running a sizeable deficit.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced the top individual tax rate from 91% to 70%, and the bottom rate from 20% to 14%. The law also reduced the top corporate tax rate from 52% to 48%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1964 would decrease revenue by $11.5 billion over the full year.

Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1965

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As part of President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty,” Congress created Medicare and Medicaid. These mandatory entitlement programs altered the tax code and contributed to the elevated status of payroll taxes as the second-largest revenue generator after income taxes.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law implemented a new federal payroll tax to finance the cost of Medicare, at a 0.70% rate (0.35% each for employees and employers) in 1966. Congress set the rate to increase in subsequent years, and then accelerated those rate increases in future years.

Budgetary Projection: Estimates for what the 1965 law’s payroll tax increases would have raised are difficult to come by, but Medicare costs quickly outstripped early projections. In 1965, the House Ways and Means Committee projected that annual Medicare expenditures would be $238 million; instead, Medicare cost $4.6 billion in 1967, its first full year.

Tax Reform Act of 1969

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: President Richard Nixon had asked Congress for a new set of tax reductions earlier that year, but the Tax Reform Act of 1969 was the product of years of discussions between Congress and the Treasury Department (across several administrations) to reform the nation’s tax code.

Notable Tax Provisions: This law introduced new distinctions between single and married filers and differential rates. It also introduced a low-income allowance, functionally raising the minimum standard deduction for taxpayers to $1,000 (at this time, the standard deduction was a percentage of income rather than a fixed dollar amount). The law also set the maximum standard deduction to increase to $2,000 by 1973, and increased the charitable deduction amount to 50% of a person’s contributable base in that year. On the revenue-raising side, the 1969 law increased capital gains taxes, repealed the investment tax credit, and created a minimum tax for individuals.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Tax Reform Act of 1969would increase revenue by $6.2 billion over a two-year period.

The Stagflation Era: 1970-1983

The 1970s saw the end of the Vietnam War and the start of stagflation in which high inflation and weak growth gripped the U.S. economy. Tax policy sought to spur the economy and minimize the effects of persistent inflation. America experienced several recessions from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, in part due to the Fed’s aggressive efforts to curb inflation.

Revenue Act of 1971

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Beginning in the early 1970s, the U.S. economy began to slow. Concerned by the growing economic pressures on Americans, Congress sought ways to lower tax burdens.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased the personal exemption from $650 to $675 in 1971 (and to $750 in subsequent years), and the minimum standard deduction from $1,000 to $1,300. The law also provided a 7% tax credit for businesses investing in expansions to their facilities and equipment, and repealed a 7% excise tax on passenger vehicles.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Revenue Act of 1971 would decrease revenue by $11.3 billion over a two-year period.

Tax Reduction Act of 1975

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Amid high inflation and a sagging economy, President Gerald Ford and members of Congress expressed interest in stimulating the economy and adjusting several parts of the tax code for inflation. Lawmakers also wanted to address a sense of unfairness in the code due to the regressive nature of tax deductions, which provided a larger benefit to high-income taxpayers than to lower-income ones, by shifting policy from providing deductions to providing credits.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law provided refunds to those filers who had a tax liability in 1974, up to $200 for taxpayers making under $30,000. It also increased the low-income allowance, provided a $30 tax credit per person (including dependents), and created the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The law increased the investment tax credit from 7% to 10% for two years (1975-1976), with a scheduled decline back to 7% from 1977 onwards. It also reduced the rate of the corporate surtax and amount of income subject to the tax for 1975 only, and the lowest corporate tax rate from 22% to 20%.

Budgetary Projection: The JCIRT projected that the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 would decrease revenue by $9.4 billion over a two-year period.

Tax Reform Act of 1976

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The 1973 Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil embargo placed economic strain on American households that lingered for years after the resumption of normal trade relations. Congress also had a general interest in simplifying an increasingly complicated tax code, improving tax administration, and improving equity in the tax system without negatively impacting economic growth.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased alternative minimum taxes for individuals and corporations, with the individual minimum tax rate rising from 10% to 15%. The law also extended the holding period for long-term capital gains and phased in an increase for maximum capital loss deductions from $1,000 to $3,000. It expanded tax advantages for individual retirement accounts (IRAs); converted the child care deduction into a child care credit; increased the minimum standard deduction from $1,300 to $1,700 ($2,100 for joint returns) and the maximum deduction from $2,000 to $2,400 ($2,800 for joint returns); extended the EITC that was enacted in the year prior; provided estate tax relief; and extended the investment credit.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Reform Act of 1976 would decrease revenue by $50 billion over five years (FY1977-1981).

Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: President Jimmy Carter had campaigned in 1976 on simplifying the tax code and stimulating a sagging economy. Congress and the president negotiated in the early months of 1977 on a tax law to fulfill those promises.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law changed the standard deduction from 16% of income to a flat $2,200 for single filers ($3,200 for joint), referred to as the “zero bracket amount.” It revised and simplified tax tables for filers. The law also extended the EITC for families with children through 1978. Finally, it extended through 1978 the corporate tax rate cuts for lower-income brackets that began in 1975 and created a new jobs credit for employers.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Reduction and Simplification Act of 1977 would decrease revenue by $34 billion over three years (FY1977-1979).

Revenue Act of 1978

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: As stagflation continued to plague the U.S. economy, Congress sought to further cut taxes to minimize the economic burden on households and businesses and boost the economy.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased the amount of income exempt from taxes in the “zero bracket,” which temporarily replaced the standard deduction, and increased personal exemptions from $750 to $1,000. The zero bracket rose for both single and married filers ($2,220 to $2,300 and $3,200 to $3,400, respectively). The law also lowered the top corporate income tax rate from 48% to 46%, reformed the alternative minimum tax, expanded and made permanent the EITC, and made permanent a 10% investment tax credit.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Revenue Act of 1978 would decrease revenue by $117 billion over five years (FY1979-1983).

Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 ( “Reagan Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The United States was in a recession in 1981, triggered in part by Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes to combat high inflation. Congress lowered tax burdens to stimulate economic activity, a top priority of the newly elected President Ronald Reagan.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law cut tax rates across the board, including the top individual rate from 70% to 50%. The law also indexed tax brackets and the personal exemption to inflation for the first time and created a deduction for married couples filing jointly. Allowable IRA contributions were increased from a maximum of $1,500 to $2,000. Congress also introduced the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), which changed the depreciation schedule for business investments. And the law reduced estate tax rates and increased the credit against estate taxes.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act would decrease revenue by $482 billion over five years (FY1981-1985).

Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: The 1981 tax cuts contributed to a spike in deficits and spurred concern about the long-term sustainability of the law. Seeking to reverse or moderate the largest tax cuts, the 1982 law rolled back a number of reforms from 1981.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law pulled back on some of the 1981 accelerations in business deductions and put new limits on claiming the investment tax credit. The law also increased tax withholding on certain dividends and interest; required employers of tipped workers to report receipts and tips to the IRS; included new tax enforcement measures; and increased airport, cigarette, and telephone excise taxes.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 would increase revenue by $215 billion over five years (FY1983-1987).

Social Security Amendments of 1983

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Warnings that Social Security insolvency was imminent triggered congressional bipartisan action to extend the program’s solvency. The recessions of the early 1980s likely contributed to the accelerated depletion of the trust fund. This was due to rapidly rising unemployment, which peaked at 10.8% by the end of 1982.

Notable Tax Provisions: Federal government and nonprofit workers hired after 1984 became eligible for Social Security. The law thus broadened the payroll tax base to these workers. More broadly, the law increased payroll tax rates from 5.4% on Social Security taxes and 1.3% on Medicare taxes (each paid by employee and employer) to 6.2% and 1.45%, respectively, by 1990. The law also taxed Social Security benefits for high-income beneficiaries for the first time. Congress has changed payroll tax rates and rules several times since World War II. In this overview of major tax laws, BPC generally only covers the 1965 law that created Medicare and Medicaid and the 1983 law that extended Social Security solvency.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Social Security Amendments of 1983 would increase revenue by $57 billion over a five-year period.

The Reform Era: 1984-2000

Over the next 15 years, Congress focused on simplifying the tax code, broadening the tax base, and eventually balancing the budget. Three of the four major tax bills were bipartisan, and some were wrapped into broader budget negotiations.

Tax Reform Act of 1986

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA) was the second of President Reagan’s major tax reform efforts. The 1986 law sought to revamp the entire tax code, driven primarily by a desire for simplification. Today’s tax code still reflects many of the reforms from 1986, and TRA still stands out as one of U.S. history’s most bipartisan, comprehensive federal tax reform laws.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced the top individual tax rate from 50% to 28%, and it collapsed more than a dozen tax brackets into just two—15% and 28%. The law also eliminated the preferential tax treatment of capital gains, taxing gains at a top 28% rate as well. The law phased out the ability to deduct several kinds of personal interest expenses, other than mortgage interest. The law also cut the top corporate tax rate from 46% to 34%, but overall it increased corporate tax liabilities by repealing the investment tax credit, changing corporate deduction rules, and expanding the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT).

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 1986 Tax Reform Act would decrease revenue by $300 million over five years (FY1987-1991).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 1990)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: President George H.W. Bush and Democrats in Congress—who controlled the House and the Senate—negotiated for months over a bipartisan budget agreement that would reduce deficits. The final package cut mandatory spending, increased taxes, and placed caps on discretionary spending.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law increased individual income taxes by raising rates (including the top rate from 28% to 31%), phasing out personal exemptions, and limiting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. The law also increased and/or extended several excise taxes, including on gas, alcohol, aviation, telecommunications, and tobacco. It also increased the amount of wages subject to Medicare payroll taxes.

Budgetary Projection: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and JCT projected that OBRA 1990 would increase revenue by $158 billion over five years (FY1991-1995).

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 1993)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: A newly elected President Bill Clinton and Democrats in Congress—who controlled both the House and the Senate, although they did not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate—negotiated for months on a budget deal to reduce deficits in the years ahead. CBO ultimately projected that the deal would reduce deficits by $433 billion over five years, with a roughly even mix of tax increases and spending cuts.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law added a 36% individual income tax bracket and a surtax on income above $250,000, bringing the top rate from 31% to 39.6%. The 1993 OBRA also increased gas taxes, the amount of wages subject to Medicare payroll taxes, and the top corporate tax rate from 34% to 35%.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that OBRA 1993 would increase revenue by $241 billion over five years (FY1994-1998).

Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: The Taxpayer Relief Act was one of two bills signed into law by President Clinton that together enacted a bipartisan budget agreement between the Democratic president and the Republican-controlled Congress. After months of negotiations, policymakers agreed on a package that reduced spending but also cut taxes.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law created the Child Tax Credit (CTC), allowing families to receive a credit of up to $500 per child. It also created tax credits for higher-education expenses, a deduction for student loan interest (up to $2,500 per year from 2001 onwards), and Roth IRA accounts that allowed people to contribute to tax-advantaged retirement accounts with after-tax dollars. The law reduced capital gains taxes (the maximum rate decreased from 28% to 20%) and increased the credit against estate taxes.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 would decrease revenue by $68 billion over five years (FY1997-2001).

The Tax Cut Era: 2001-Present

At the turn of the century, the combination of a strong economy and bipartisan action to reduce deficits created the first budget surpluses in decades. Those surpluses would not last. Both parties have passed major tax cuts in the 21st century, albeit Republicans have done so more often than Democrats. These tax cuts have contributed to a decline in revenue as a share of GDP over the 21st century.

Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (“2001 Bush Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan (reconciliation).

Context: President George W. Bush had campaigned in 2000 on tax reform, and Republican policymakers advocated using the federal government’s newfound surpluses to finance tax cuts. Although Congress used reconciliation to pass the 2001 tax law to avoid the Senate’s 60-vote filibuster, several Democrats in both chambers of Congress joined nearly all Republicans in supporting the bill.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law created a 10% individual income tax bracket (the previous lowest bracket was 15%); reduced individual income tax rates across the board; provided $300 stimulus payments; increased the CTC from $500 per child to $1,000 per child over several years; reduced marriage penalties in the tax code; phased down and scheduled a repeal of the estate, gift, and generation-skipping transfer (GST) taxes; and increased contribution limits for tax-advantaged retirement accounts.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2001 Bush tax cuts would decrease revenue by $1.2 trillion over 10 years (FY2001-2010).

Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (“2003 Bush Tax Cuts”)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: President Bush and congressional Republicans pursued a second major round of tax cuts to spur economic growth amid a slow economic recovery from the 2001 recession.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividends; accelerated individual income tax rate reductions; accelerated the increase in the CTC to $1,000 per child; and provided additional relief from the AMT.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2003 Bush tax cuts would decrease revenue by $351 billion over 10 years (FY2003-2012).

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: After the 2009 stimulus package in the wake of the Great Recession, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats made expanding health insurance coverage and reducing health care costs a top priority. Their efforts culminated in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Notable Tax Provisions: Although the bulk of the law was focused on health spending provisions, it included several changes to the nation’s tax code. The ACA created premium tax credits to subsidize the purchase of health insurance on new state-based exchanges. To help pay for the premium tax credits and Medicaid expansions in the law, the ACA created several new taxes and fees, including the net investment income tax (NIIT); the Additional Medicare Tax; the Cadillac tax; individual and employer penalties for failure to obtain or provide health insurance; the medical device tax; and fees on brand drugs and insurers. Congress later repealed the Cadillac tax, medical device tax, and insurers fee.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the ACA would increase revenue by $525 billion over 10 years (FY2010-2019).

Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Congress and President Obama faced a December 31, 2010, expiration of trillions of dollars in 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts. After the midterm elections in which Republicans regained the House, policymakers settled on a temporary extension of the expiring Bush tax cuts through the end of 2012.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law extended the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts through 2012, reinstated the estate tax after a one-year repeal, and extended more-generous business expensing allowances through 2012. It also introduced a temporary 2-percentage-point payroll tax cut for 2011 that was a key ask of the Obama administration as it sought to stimulate the economic recovery from the Great Recession.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the 2010 tax law would decrease revenue by $858 billion over 10 years (FY2011-2020).

American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) of 2012

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: After the bipartisan 2010 tax law extended the expiring Bush tax cuts for two years, Congress faced another tax cliff on December 31, 2012. Weeks of negotiations between the Republican-led House, Democratic-led Senate, and President Obama produced a bipartisan deal that made permanent the majority of the expiring 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law made most of the Bush tax cuts permanent, including lower individual income tax rates, lower capital gains tax rates, AMT relief, a larger CTC (then $1,000 per child), and an expanded EITC. The law raised the top individual income tax rate from 35% to 39.6% and the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. It also extended dozens of individual, business, and energy tax provisions through 2013.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that ATRA would decrease revenue by $3.9 trillion over 10 years (FY2013-2022).

2015 Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: Dozens of tax provisions expired at the end of 2014, with more expirations scheduled for the end of 2016 and 2017. Both parties in Congress and President Obama sought to address several of these expiring policies once and for all through permanent extensions, rather than treating them as “extenders” to be revisited every few years.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law permanently extended a more generous CTC, the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for higher-education expenses, the state and local sales tax deduction, the R&D credit, Section 179 expensing for small businesses, and exceptions to taxes on foreign income, among dozens of other provisions. Congress extended many additional provisions for a shorter period, through 2016 or 2019.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the PATH Act would decrease revenue by $622 billion over 10 years (FY2016-2025).

2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: During the 2016 campaign, several Republican presidential candidates and policymakers expressed an interest in comprehensive tax reform. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans turned their attention in summer 2017 to the law that became TCJA.

Notable Tax Provisions: TCJA significantly overhauled both the individual and business sides of the tax code. The law lowered individual income tax rates across the board; suspended personal exemptions; doubled the standard deduction; limited itemized deductions like the state and local tax (SALT) deduction; doubled the CTC; and provided relief from the AMT and estate tax. TCJA also lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% (and eliminated the graduated corporate income tax schedule, leaving just one 21% rate); created a 20% deduction for pass-through business income; enacted a temporary expensing allowance for business machinery and equipment; and overhauled the tax treatment of U.S. multinational companies’ income earned abroad.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that TCJA would decrease revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years (FY2018-2027).

2020 COVID Relief Legislation

Partisan or Bipartisan: Bipartisan.

Context: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented economic and social disruptions. Congress and President Trump enacted four laws on a bipartisan basis in 2020 to address those disruptions and provide tax relief, the largest of which was the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Notable Tax Provisions: The CARES Act included $1,200 stimulus checks to tens of millions of Americans, delivered as refundable, advanceable tax credits through the IRS. The CARES Act also created the Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) for businesses that kept employees on payroll during the pandemic and provided businesses with increased flexibility to carry back tax losses. The CARES Act was followed by a December 2020 COVID relief law that provided an additional $600 stimulus check to tens of millions of Americans.

Budgetary Projection: CBO and JCT projected that the 2020 COVID relief laws would decrease revenue by $809 billion over 10 years.

American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats were motivated in early 2021 to pass additional tax relief and stimulus to address the ongoing economic and public health effects of the COVID pandemic.

Notable Tax Provisions: The law included $1,400 stimulus checks to tens of millions of Americans, delivered once again through the IRS. The law also expanded the CTC from $2,000 per child to $3,000 per child (and $3,600 for children under six) for 2021 only, expanded the EITC for childless workers for 2021 only, and expanded ACA subsidies for 2021 and 2022.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that ARPA would decrease revenue by $590 billion over 10 years (FY2021-2030).

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: After ARPA’s passage, President Biden and congressional Democrats turned their attention to major domestic tax-and-spending legislation. Failure in the Senate to pass the Build Back Better (BBB) agenda led to deliberations over what became the Inflation Reduction Act in summer 2022.

Notable Tax Provisions: The legislation included hundreds of billions of dollars in new or expanded tax incentives for clean energy, from electric vehicles to wind and solar projects to advanced manufacturing projects. The law also extended expiring ACA tax subsidies through 2025, restored a corporate AMT (previously repealed by TCJA), created a stock buyback tax, and appropriated $80 billion to the IRS for enhanced enforcement and modernization efforts. (The clean energy incentives and IRS funding have since been rolled back.)

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that the Inflation Reduction Act would increase revenue by $91 billion over 10 years (FY2022-2031).

One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) of 2025

Partisan or Bipartisan: Partisan (reconciliation).

Context: The top priority of President Trump and congressional Republicans in 2025 was extending the expiring individual tax cuts from the 2017 TCJA. President Trump also sought to enact several new tax cuts he had promised on the campaign trail, such as “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime.”

Notable Tax Provisions: The law permanently extended the vast majority of expiring TCJA tax cuts, including lower individual income tax rates, a doubled standard deduction and CTC, and relief from the AMT and estate tax. It included several temporary tax cuts aimed at President Trump’s campaign promises, including a tips income deduction, an overtime pay deduction, a manufacturing expensing allowance, and a larger senior deduction—all scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. The law cut business taxes significantly, extending TCJA’s pass-through deduction, making bonus depreciation for machinery and equipment permanent, and restoring full expensing for business R&D. OBBB also rolled back most of the clean energy tax incentives enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act, mostly by ending them early.

Budgetary Projection: JCT projected that OBBB would decrease revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years (FY2025-2034).

Overall Trends: 1945-Present

Research Notes

For determining whether a law was partisan or bipartisan, we rely on roll call vote data from GovTrack and from Congress.gov. For determining the budgetary effects of major tax laws, we use one methodology for laws from 1945-1975 and a different methodology for laws from 1976-2025. For the earlier years, we rely on a 2006 Treasury Department paper that succinctly summarizes the revenue effects of major tax laws in current dollars. JCT (formerly called JCIRT) used a variety of budget windows during that time period; first one year, then two, then three, and so on. For the later years, we generally rely on scores available from JCT’s website (and, in some cases, supplemented by CBO reports). We use five-year effects from 1981-2000, and 10-year effects from 2001-present",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tax-Reform-Papers.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:03:43.261273

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule The original TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule established a one-time, nationwide reporting obligation for any company that manufactured or imported PFAS — including PFAS contained in articles — at any time from 2011 through 2022.
The EPA estimates this significant change will eliminate approximately 80% of the total cost of compliance with the PFAS reporting rule, saving small businesses more than $700M.
These adjustments would further align the PFAS reporting rule with the Chemical Data Reporting framework under TSCA.
As long as the rule is finalized by Aug. 1, 2026, the required PFAS reporting information, for all 12 reporting years, will be due to EPA in calendar year 2026.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed amendments to simplify its Toxic Substances Control Act Section 8(a)(7) PFAS Reporting and Recordkeeping Rule, first released in 2023. Compliance deadlines have been postponed several times.

The proposed rule, announced in November, would narrow the rule’s scope and reduce compliance burdens by exempting certain categories not likely to produce high value information for the EPA, while maintaining many of the core reporting requirements for PFAS manufactured or imported between 2011 and 2022.

Under the proposed rule, the EPA would offer two key exemptions (among others) and adjust the submission period to reflect the narrowed obligations.

The reporting window would now open 60 days after the final rule’s effective date and remain open for three months, meaning regulated entities should anticipate a condensed reporting timeline in 2026.

TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule

The original TSCA PFAS Reporting Rule established a one-time, nationwide reporting obligation for any company that manufactured or imported PFAS — including PFAS contained in articles — at any time from 2011 through 2022.

It required detailed, compound-by-compound submissions covering each year in that period, including data on chemical identity, categories of use, production volumes, byproducts, environmental and health effects, worker exposure and disposal practices.

The rule applied broadly, even to entities that had never before filed under TSCA, and did not include exemptions for de minimis, imported-articles, or other customary TSCA chemical data, making compliance particularly challenging for manufacturers and importers with complex or global supply chains.

The EPA’s intent was to build a comprehensive database of PFAS presence and use across U.S. commerce to inform future regulatory and risk-management actions.

Key Proposed Exemptions

1. De Minimis Exemption (0.1%)

The EPA proposes to exempt from reporting all PFAS present at concentrations below 0.1% in mixtures or articles.

The EPA cited both legal precedent and practical considerations, noting that such trace-level information is generally unknown or not reasonably ascertainable for manufacturers and importers based on historical recordkeeping and labeling standards.

The 0.1% threshold aligns with long-standing Safety Data Sheet notification levels and recognizes that many PFAS used at low levels were never disclosed by suppliers during the 2011–2022 lookback period.

The exemption is intended to eliminate disproportionate compliance efforts to locate information of minimal regulatory or environmental value, while still capturing reportable PFAS above that concentration.

This will allow most manufacturers and importers to reasonably rely on their supplier SDSs as the justification for reporting (or not reporting) under the rule.

2. Imported Articles Exemption

The EPA also proposes to exclude PFAS imported as part of a finished article from the rule’s scope.

EPA found that importers of finished goods are least likely to have direct knowledge of PFAS content in those products and that Congress, in drafting TSCA Section 8(a)(7), intended reporting to apply to manufacturers of PFAS themselves, not to importers of products merely containing PFAS.

The EPA reasoned that this exemption will still preserve meaningful data through reporting by the original PFAS manufacturers, who remain responsible for identifying downstream uses of their PFAS in articles.

The EPA estimates this significant change will eliminate approximately 80% of the total cost of compliance with the PFAS reporting rule, saving small businesses more than $700M.

Other Clarifications

Although affecting a much smaller subset of industry, additional proposed exemptions include PFAS manufactured as byproducts or impurities, or used as non-isolated intermediates within a closed system and PFAS manufactured or imported in small quantities solely for research and development purposes.

These adjustments would further align the PFAS reporting rule with the Chemical Data Reporting framework under TSCA.

Practical Implications

While the proposed changes provide significant relief, especially for importers of finished goods/articles and small manufacturers, companies should not interpret the revisions as removing all PFAS-related reporting obligations under TSCA.

The rule remains broad in coverage for entities that directly manufacture or import PFAS compounds or mixtures containing them above the de minimis threshold and it will be important to continue internal compliance efforts.

Importantly, the reporting window will likely be shorter and the expected start date in 2026 means affected companies should begin re-scoping (hopefully in progress) compliance efforts in 2025 to align with the revised submission requirements.

Next Steps

The EPA’s proposed revisions are open for public comment until Dec. 29, 2025.

Sixty days after the rule is finalized, the submission period of regulatorily required reporting information (on a yet to be published online form) will open and run for three months.

As long as the rule is finalized by Aug. 1, 2026, the required PFAS reporting information, for all 12 reporting years, will be due to EPA in calendar year 2026.

Takeaways

The proposal is a shift to a narrower and more manageable PFAS reporting framework, emphasizing data from entities most likely to have meaningful information.

The de minimis and imported-articles exemptions are expected to simplify compliance while preserving the EPA’s ability to collect the most critical PFAS manufacturing data.

Manufacturers and importers should continue efforts to ensure compliance, as the EPA has recognized industry has been aware of this rule since 2023 and expects companies will need less time to prepare reports based on work to date.

The plant, located in Chile’s Ñuble region, will convert biogas into liquid biomethane, which Lipigas will distribute to transport companies and industries across the country as part of Chile’s move toward cleaner energy, reports Bioenergy Insight.

The new plant uses a modular, container-based “plug and play” system made up of six interconnected units. Three of the units handle biogas treatment processes — including cleaning and liquefaction — while the remaining three manage essential services such as water and dry air supply. This design enabled faster installation and commissioning.

The site will form part of a Southeast Asian power grid initiative and further connect to Singapore to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.

While the final scope hasn’t been announced, the initial sizing of the scheme is for a 2,000 square kilometre hybrid solar and battery energy storage system zone, with some 10,000 acres set for the initial phase of the project. This initial phase was said to be “expected” to include up to 4 GWp of solar capacity and 5.12 GWh of energy storage capacity.

The ‘Cooperation Document’ exchanged by key parties, including the Johor state, also brought together many initiatives. One is a pan-Southeast Asian grid initiative, dubbed the ASEAN Power Grid or APG, that aims to connect Malaysia’s Johor region with Singapore as part of a Johor–Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) masterplan and facilitate cross-border electricity trade.

It is also part of the Johor Renewable Energy Policy 2030, which details in an outline joint efforts across project development, technical support, and further potential financing for the project, and ties into the stated ambitions of the Johor Green Development Policy 2030.

There are some surprises in the details of the players involved.

Other investors, alongside the World Bank’s private sector arm known as the International Finance Corporation (IFC), included the strategic investment arm of the Johor State Permodalan Darul Ta’zim (PDT), and Ditrolic Energy, an independent clean energy company in Southeast Asia, headquartered in Malaysia. No funding splits or details were announced at a ceremony attended by officials and dignitaries, including the Queen of Malaysia, Raja Zarith Sofiah.

While likely to offer attractive renewable energy for the city-state of Singapore, the announcement also detailed that Johor is aiming to attract both manufacturing and hyperscale data center operators. Some 125,000 jobs were said to be created through the lifecycle of the project.

One of the surprise players is Ditrolic Energy, which according to ESS News information, has only 300 MW of active projects built, making this project dwarf its other engagements.

What they said:

Dato’ Ramlee bin A Rahman, President and Group Chief Executive of PDT: “As the state agency entrusted to formulate the Johor Green Development Policy 2030, PDT is proud to witness our strategic framework transition into tangible reality today. “The Southern Johor Renewable Energy Corridor (SJREC) was conceived as the cornerstone of this policy, specifically Strategy 1, to unlock the immense solar potential of the Kota Tinggi and Mersing districts.

“By partnering with global leaders like IFC and Ditrolic Energy, we are operationalizing the SJREC not only to power the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ), but to actively facilitate cross-border energy trading. This project confirms Johor’s readiness to serve as a primary renewable energy hub for the ASEAN Power Grid, realizing the vision we set forth for a sustainable, high-growth future. The project is expected to generate significant economic benefits for the region by creating an estimated 125,000 jobs through the construction, operations, and maintenance of renewable-energy infrastructure, enabling industrial expansion, and attracting high-quality, foreign-direct investment.”

Judith Green, World Bank Group Country Manager for Malaysia: “We are delighted to partner with Permodalan Darul Ta’zim and Ditrolic Energy on this innovative project. Not only will this project support the broader sustainable development ambitions of Johor, it will also create jobs, potentially attract foreign direct investment, while facilitating cross-border clean energy trade between two key ASEAN economies, bolstering the broader ASEAN Power Grid initiative.”

Tham Chee Aun, Chief Executive Officer of Ditrolic Energy: “We are proud to partner with the Johor State Government and the largest global development institution focused on the private sector, IFC, in this historic initiative. As a Johor-born company that has expanded across Asia and become one of Malaysia’s largest developers, Ditrolic is deeply committed to contributing back to our home state. Our 4GWp solar-plus-storage catalytic development within the SJREC will anchor Johor’s clean energy export potential and provide a foundation for industries seeking renewable, low-cost power in the region.”

Greening Singapore’s grid

Singapore’s relative lack of land to develop large-scale energy projects has led to somewhat of a boom in ideas, concepts, and projects to supply the region.

Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.
FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance.
“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall.
Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.","Extreme weather is making the grid more prone to outages — and now FirstEnergy’s three Ohio utilities want more leeway on their reliability requirements.

Put simply, FirstEnergy is asking the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to let Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., Ohio Edison, and Toledo Edison take longer to restore power when the lights go out. The latter two utilities would also be allowed slightly more frequent outages per customer each year.

Comments regarding the request are due to the utilities commission on Dec. 8, less than three weeks after regulators approved higher electricity rates for hundreds of thousands of northeast Ohio utility customers. An administrative trial, known as an evidentiary hearing, is currently set to start Jan. 21.

Consumer and environmental advocates say it’s unfair to make customers shoulder the burden of lower-quality service, as they have already been paying for substantial grid-hardening upgrades.

“Relaxing reliability standards can jeopardize the health and safety of Ohio consumers,” said Maureen Willis, head of the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel, which is the state’s legal representative for utility customers. ​“It also shifts the costs of more frequent and longer outages onto Ohioans who already paid millions of dollars to utilities to enhance and develop their distribution systems.”

The United States has seen a rise in blackouts linked to severe weather, a 2024 analysis by Climate Central found, with about twice as many such events happening from 2014 through 2023 compared to the 10 years from 2000 through 2009.

The duration of the longest blackouts has also grown. As of mid-2025, the average length of 12.8 hours represents a jump of almost 60% from 2022, J.D. Power reported in October.

Ohio regulators have approved less stringent reliability standards before, notably for AES Ohio and Duke Energy Ohio, where obligations from those or other orders required investments and other actions to improve reliability.

Some utilities elsewhere in the country have also sought leeway on reliability expectations. In April, for example, two New York utilities asked to exclude some outages related to tree disease and other factors from their performance metrics, which would in effect relax their standards.

Other utilities haven’t necessarily pursued lower targets, but have nonetheless noted vulnerabilities to climate change or experienced more major events that don’t count toward requirements.

FirstEnergy’s case is particularly notable because the company has slow-rolled clean energy and energy efficiency, two tools that advocates say can cost-effectively bolster grid reliability and guard against weather-related outages.

There is also a certain irony to the request: FirstEnergy’s embrace of fossil fuels at the expense of clean energy and efficiency measures has let its subsidiaries’ operations and others continue to emit high levels of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Now, the company appears to nod toward climate-change-driven weather variability as justification for relaxed reliability standards.

FirstEnergy filed its application to the Public Utilities Commission last December, while its recently decided rate case and other cases linked to its House Bill 6 corruption scandal were pending. FirstEnergy argues that specific reliability standards for each of its utilities should start with an average of the preceding five years’ performance. From there, FirstEnergy says the state should tack on extra allowances for longer or more frequent outages to ​“account for annual variability in factors outside the Companies’ control, in particular, weather impacts that can vary significantly on a year-to-year basis.”

“Honestly, I don’t know of a viable hypothesis for this increasing variability outside of climate change,” said Victoria Petryshyn, an associate professor of environmental studies at the University of Southern California, who grew up in Ohio.

In summer, systems are burdened by constant air conditioning use during periods of extreme heat and humidity. In winter, frigid air masses resulting from disruptions to the jet stream can boost demand for heat and ​“cause extra strain on the grid if natural-gas lines freeze,” Petryshyn said.

“All the weather becomes supercharged,” Petryshyn said. ​“We can all expect stronger storms, stronger winds, and more frequent extreme weather that threatens grid stability.”

Contributing to the problem?

FirstEnergy has a long history of obstructing measures that would both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate stress on the power grid.

In February 2024, the company abandoned its interim 2030 goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and said it would continue running two West Virginia coal plants. Before that, FirstEnergy backed plans to weaken Ohio’s energy-efficiency goals. And during the first Trump administration, the company urged the Department of Energy to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal and nuclear plants running.

FirstEnergy also spent roughly $60 million on efforts to get lawmakers to pass and protect House Bill 6, the law at the heart of Ohio’s largest utility corruption scandal. HB 6’s nuclear and coal bailouts have since been repealed, but the state’s clean-energy standards remain gutted.

Meanwhile, regulators have let FirstEnergy’s utilities charge customers millions of dollars for grid modernization, ​“which are supposed to support the utility’s ability to adapt and improve the electric grid to rigging challenges from climate change,” said Karin Nordstrom, a clean-energy attorney with the Ohio Environmental Council.

“However, FirstEnergy has not provided the same investment in energy-efficiency programs, which can help manage rising demand at lower cost than expensive capital investment,” Nordstrom said. FirstEnergy should fully exhaust those tools and customer-funded grid-modernization investments before regulators relax the company’s requirements, she added.

Limited transparency makes FirstEnergy’s plan even more problematic, according to Shay Banton, a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate for the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. Earlier this year, Banton reported on grid disparities in FirstEnergy’s service territories that leave some areas more prone to outages.

“It feels too early for them to request leniency without proposing or implementing more comprehensive mitigations based on a detailed understanding of the root cause,” Banton said.

It’s also likely that FirstEnergy’s rate increase of nearly $76 million for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.’s roughly 745,000 customers, approved on Nov. 19, already accounts for some weather-related factors. This summer, spokesperson Hannah Catlett told Canary Media that ​“the Illuminating Co. service territory generally sees bigger storm impacts” than areas served by FirstEnergy’s other Ohio utilities.

“Our request to adjust the reliability standards is not a step back in our commitment,” Catlett told Canary Media this fall. ​“We are confident in the progress underway and remain focused on improving reliability through continued investment in the communities we are privileged to serve.”

But fundamentally, additional leeway for weather variation is unnecessary, said Ashley Brown, a former Ohio utility commissioner and former executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group. Averaging utility performance over several years — the way most regulators do as part of setting reliability standards — should already account for that.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/51155404126_79c5193be4_c.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0cf0feeab3f5538062084b4e3769bb6d,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:54.040564

Through its Climate Justice Grant Program, community organizations now lead proposals in partnership with cities, shifting who shapes climate solutions.
“This represents a fundamental reimagining of how climate action happens — not to communities, but with them,” said CNCA’s Director of Climate Justice Tracy Morgenstern.
Tackling the toughest challenges CNCA cities are also pioneering work in policy areas that have traditionally received less attention, but offer huge opportunities.
In most cities, buildings represent the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet cities have struggled to address the pollution generated throughout buildings’ entire lifecycles.","In Stockholm, city planners are reimagining how buildings can absorb carbon instead of releasing it into the air. In Melbourne, community advocates are working alongside city officials to ensure clean energy reaches neighborhoods that have historically been left behind. In Amsterdam, discarded solar panels are finding new life, preventing waste while expanding renewable energy access to those who need it most.

These aren’t isolated success stories — they’re part of a growing movement of cities around the world refusing to accept incremental change at a time when our communities need transformational action to thrive.

More than half the world’s population now lives in cities, and these urban centers account for approximately 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, cities hold tremendous power to slow climate change by shifting from fossil fuels to clean energy and eliminating those greenhouse gas emissions. While many cities have adopted climate action plans, most haven’t set goals big enough to fully remove all carbon pollution from city systems like transportation and buildings.

But a trailblazing group of cities is charting a different course. The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA) brings together leading cities worldwide committed to achieving carbon neutrality within 10 to 20 years, among the most ambitious targets undertaken by any city globally.

Created in 2015 with support from Kresge, CNCA enables these pioneering cities to advance their transformational efforts, collaborate to overcome barriers, foster innovative approaches and share lessons with others pursuing similar goals.

“The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance connects U.S. cities with international knowledge and resource hubs, and creates opportunities to learn from and workshop with peers and partners across regions,” said Kresge Environment Senior Program Officer Jessica Boehland.

Moving beyond technology to systems change

What sets this work apart is CNCA’s fundamental approach. Rather than focusing solely on technology and emissions reduction, CNCA champions a systems-based framework that addresses the root causes of climate change while putting people and nature at the center of climate solutions.

The alliance’s shared purpose is clear: mobilize transformative climate action to achieve prosperity, equity, resilience and better quality of life for all on a thriving planet.

“We believe that by supporting cities in developing and implementing game-changing climate policies, we will accelerate transformative climate action and generate replicable models for cities worldwide,” says Simone Mangili, executive director of CNCA. “This isn’t just about reducing carbon — it’s about reimagining how cities function, who benefits from climate action and stewarding natural systems for generations to come.”

Putting bold ideas into action

Through its Game Changer Fund, CNCA has already invested more than $5 million in 76 city-led projects since 2015, leveraging an additional $46 million in continued support. These aren’t conventional projects that fit neatly into traditional public funding streams. They’re bold experiments tackling high-impact challenges at the intersection of climate change and equity.

Recent investments show this approach in action. Amsterdam’s project creates a system to reuse old solar panels instead of throwing them away. Melbourne is developing a community-driven plan to fight energy poverty grounded in data.

In the U.S., New York City and Washington DC joined with Copenhagen to explore equitable models for congestion pricing, which reduces traffic in certain areas of the city, improving air quality while providing revenue to support public transit and bicycling and walking paths. These projects don’t just reduce pollution — they make communities stronger and help local people create sustainable solutions.

Justice at the center

CNCA is also helping cities move toward genuine power-sharing in climate policy development. Through its Climate Justice Grant Program, community organizations now lead proposals in partnership with cities, shifting who shapes climate solutions.

The alliance facilitates learning cohorts where cities in the U.S. and around the world share strategies for building relationships with communities and designing context-specific policies. The goal is to create climate policies and programs that maximize benefits and mitigate burdens for communities that have historically borne the greatest impacts of environmental injustice.

“This represents a fundamental reimagining of how climate action happens — not to communities, but with them,” said CNCA’s Director of Climate Justice Tracy Morgenstern.

Tackling the toughest challenges

CNCA cities are also pioneering work in policy areas that have traditionally received less attention, but offer huge opportunities. In most cities, buildings represent the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet cities have struggled to address the pollution generated throughout buildings’ entire lifecycles.

CNCA now supports 15 European cities in identifying and implementing local policies to reduce carbon pollution embedded in buildings while ensuring these policies address housing, jobs and social inclusion.

The alliance also recently hosted a climate justice workshop where teams from five North American cities – Boston, Portland, Seattle, Toronto and Boulder, Colorado – and partners from community-based organizations joined their European counterparts to explore strategies and tools for improving buildings and infrastructure to benefit people’s lives and the economy. A new resource titled Embodying Justice in the Built Environment: Just and Equitable Land Use Transitions reflects some of the challenges and opportunities cities are facing on their journeys.

In addition, CNCA also plans to host a climate justice workshop for five teams of city staff and community partners from cities in the Midwest to support participatory and whole-of-government approaches to climate action planning.

Similarly, the alliance is helping cities tackle consumption-based emissions, transition towards more circular economies that reduce resource extraction and develop initiatives that pull carbon from the air and improve quality of life while regenerating natural systems. These approaches recognize that the same green infrastructure that captures carbon can also cool cities, reduce flooding and improve air quality — delivering multiple benefits to communities.

A network built on peer learning

At its heart, CNCA succeeds because it creates space for staff from cities at the cutting edge of climate action to build relationships and learn from each other. Annual meetings, regional convenings and virtual learning cohorts allow practitioners to share what’s working, troubleshoot challenges and inspire each other to stay the course even when facing political headwinds.

“CNCA’s annual meetings and virtual convenings have become an essential moment for members to commune with one another and inspire each other, deepen collaboration among city agencies and departments and work across city administrations to mainstream climate action,” said long-time CNCA member of CNCA Doug Smith, deputy general manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability at the City of Vancouver.

This peer learning accelerates innovation in ways that top-down approaches cannot. When cities with similarly ambitious goals share experiences, they move faster together than any could alone.

Looking ahead

As national and regional climate commitments waver, cities are proving that transformative action remains possible – and is often pioneered at the local level.

The window for climate action is narrowing rapidly. But in cities from Rio de Janeiro to Yokohama, and from Seattle to Copenhagen, practitioners are demonstrating that we can build a future that is not only carbon neutral but also more beautiful, more just and more livable for all.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/PHOTO-2022-10-12-09-24-56.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:07:11.748224

Clarkson’s project focuses on scaling up a non-thermal plasma spinning-disc reactor that produces plasma-activated water (PAW). PAW contains nitrogen available for immediate uptake through roots and leaves, enabling farms to generate fertilizer on-site. New York farms currently rely on nitrogen fertilizer produced with fossil fuels and transported up to 2,000 miles, contributing to 47 percent of the state’s greenhouse-gas emissions.

“This technology has the potential to transform fertilizer production from a global supply chain into a local, low-emission process,” Selma Mededovic Thagard, the Richard and Helen March Professor in Clarkson’s Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering. “It’s about creating practical solutions that support farmers while protecting the environment.”

The Clarkson team will develop a farm-scale reactor prototype, conduct a lifecycle analysis and test PAW effectiveness on New York crops such as tomatoes and lettuce. The work aims to demonstrate that on-farm fertilizer generation can significantly reduce carbon footprints, lower nitrogen runoff and decrease economic vulnerability for rural and smaller farms.

The project, led by Mededovic Thagard and Thomas Holsen, Jean S. Newell Distinguished Professor of Engineering and Co-Director of CAARES, is one of seven statewide initiatives selected for funding through the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute’s (NYSP2I) 2025–26 Research and Development Program.

Currently, the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff race holds the title of most expensive Senate race, with $472 million spent by the candidates and outside groups.
State politics has also become more nationalized, and as a result, US Senate race outcomes match presidential election results most of the time.
Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said three battleground Senate races are scheduled in 2026 — in Maine, Georgia and North Carolina.
If the court sides with the political parties, as expected, it would probably extend the amount by which the Senate race in North Carolina breaks spending records, Heberlig said.","The race to replace outgoing US Sen. Thom Tillis, R-NC, is set to break records. Political strategists anticipate it will be the most expensive US Senate race in history — between $600 million and $800 million will likely be spent, according to Politico. Currently, the 2022 Georgia Senate runoff race holds the title of most expensive Senate race, with $472 million spent by the candidates and outside groups.

Former North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper will face the winner of the Republican primary. Michael Whatley, former chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party and Republican National Committee, secured President Donald Trump’s endorsement against Navy veteran Don Brown in the primary election. Many observers think Whatley is likely to cruise to the general election.

A lack of competitive Senate races nationwide, North Carolina’s history of expensive campaigns and the current political climate all contribute to the level of expected spending, according to political experts who spoke to Carolina Public Press.

Money talks, loudly and often. Voters should anticipate an avalanche of political ads as candidates attempt to convince their supporters to get out and vote, sell their vision to persuadable voters and weaken their opponents.

One of few Senate battlegrounds

The level of anticipated spending on North Carolina’s Senate election starts with a simple math problem: national donors have a lot of money to burn, and very few places to effectively spend it.

Fewer truly competitive Senate races are expected in 2026 would have been the case a few decades ago. Voters have geographically sorted themselves based on their political ideologies. State politics has also become more nationalized, and as a result, US Senate race outcomes match presidential election results most of the time.

Catawba College political science professor Michael Bitzer said three battleground Senate races are scheduled in 2026 — in Maine, Georgia and North Carolina.

Currently, Democrats effectively hold 47 seats in the US Senate, with the votes of two Independents. Republicans have 53 seats. To stand any chance of gaining a majority, Democrats have to keep Georgia and Michigan, pick up North Carolina and Maine, and upset at least one Republican-leaning contest in Ohio, Iowa or Texas, Bitzer said.

Republicans, on the other hand, need to stand their ground. With so few seats to fight over, much of the national donor money will flow to North Carolina.

A costly precedent has also been set in North Carolina Senate races, said Douglas Wilson, a political consultant who has worked for Hagan, former President Barack Obama, Jeff Jackson and other state Democrats.

In 2014, the race between Tillis, then Speaker of the NC House, and incumbent US Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC, for a spot in the North Carolina congressional delegation was the most expensive of the cycle, at $121 million in spending.

The next time around, in 2020, groups supporting Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham spent $296 million, enough for third-highest spending. While Tillis won that race easily against the former state senator, the race had been close before a sex scandal undermined Cunningham’s support in the final weeks before the election.

But the 2026 race for an open seat is on another level. Wilson blames that on the current political climate, economic headwinds and the threat of losing Medicaid expansion in North Carolina — “ground zero for health care.”

Campaign finance

Past and future Supreme Court rulings may also contribute to spending levels. In 2010, the Supreme Court made a landmark ruling in Citizens United that effectively opened the floodgates to unlimited outside spending on elections.

The court ruled that corporations had a First Amendment free speech right to spend money as they wished, as long as it didn’t flow directly to candidates. As a result, corporations and outside groups can launch political ads, get out the vote campaigns and more on behalf of favored candidates without financial barriers.

More recently, the Supreme Court heard a case that would loosen restrictions on certain political party spending. If the court sides with the political parties, as expected, it would probably extend the amount by which the Senate race in North Carolina breaks spending records, Heberlig said.

“But the parties already have quite a bit of flexibility,” he added. “It won’t be a revolutionary change.”

These rulings impact who is backing candidates. Campaign finance watchdog and former Democracy North Carolina Executive Director Bob Hall thinks it’s for the worse.

“The whole political process is warped by private money,” he said. “It’s a public election, but unfortunately, private money has an enormous impact, and it’s just the result of Supreme Court decisions that protect the rights of campaign spenders.”

There may be a point of diminishing return; a time when candidates have squeezed as much as they can with their money, and it becomes less effective.

“When you have so many ads, it just becomes noise to the average voter,” Heberlig said. “Practically speaking, what all these groups are doing is just offsetting the spending and advertising of the other side. You don’t want to leave the other side to dominate the air wars, because then people are only going to receive information from one perspective, and therefore are more likely to go with that.”

Early bird gets the worm

As soon as Tillis announced his departure from Congress, all sights were set on Cooper. Among politicos, it wasn’t so much a matter of whether the former governor would run for U.S. Senate, but when he would declare his intention to do so.

He did so early. On July 28, Cooper announced that he would run for office — nearly a year and a half before the 2026 general election, and four months before he could officially file to run in North Carolina.

Three days later, Whatley followed suit.

By the end of September, both had garnered millions of dollars to support their campaigns. According to the latest Federal Election Commission filings, Cooper’s campaign and associated committees raised about $14.5 million, while Whatley’s raised $5.8 million, by the end of September.

Starting early offers an advantage, said Eric Heberlig, UNC-Charlotte political science professor.

“Early spending gives you the ability to define yourself positively and your opponent negatively before people have any other sources of information,” he said. “If you can do that over long periods of time, that means people get more hardened in the information they have and are less persuadable as we get closer to the election.”

Cooper is already well-known in North Carolina, as a two-term governor, four-term attorney general and longtime state lawmaker. His reputation will make it harder for Republicans to change people’s perception, Heberlig said.

However, Whatley is relatively unknown to voters, despite holding very powerful positions in the Republican Party. Cooper may be able to use Whatley’s lower name recognition, as well as the tendency for the president’s party to perform poorly in midterm elections, to his advantage, Heberlig added.

Despite those handicaps, Whatley’s certainly still a “formidable” opponent, Wilson said. After all, Trump won North Carolina three times, if only by a small margin.

“Republicans have a pretty good infrastructure here from their wins in General Assembly races, judicial races and statewide races, so he’s going to be able to run a pretty aggressive campaign,” Wilson said.

The primary election could help Whatley “warm up” and test out messaging before the general election, he added.

At the end of the day, it probably won’t matter who raises or spends more money; it’s about how candidates target their spending that makes the difference, Wilson said.

If it were up to him, he’d focus on a broad media spectrum, from traditional television advertisements to local and national podcasts to social media platforms.

“I would also be physically present in a lot of these communities that are suffering economically, and present a plan that folks can understand and grab hold to,” he said. “If you can do that, you can win this race.”

Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event’s done.
Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.
Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society that promotes sustainable floral practices, said that beyond being more sustainable, local and seasonal flowers can make an event more meaningful.
“If you care about local flowers for your wedding, then you know the story of where those flowers were grown,” she said.","Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada — a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.

Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.

Because her flowers were dried, they’ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms — from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.

As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event’s done.

Carbon emissions from importing fresh flowers

The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.

Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.

“It’s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work … you’re fighting against nature at every turn,” Chan said.

He said buying flowers from local, small-scale farmers is generally favorable because the blooms don't travel as far and the farmers typically follow practices attuned to the local environment.

Shopping local for sustainable flowers

Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she’ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.

“When I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,” Lukasiewicz said.

Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.

For decades, much of the flower industry moved abroad because of trade policies and lower costs. Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.

“Some people prefer locally-grown, sustainable products and are willing to pay that higher price point. But oftentimes most consumers go, ‘I’m going to buy the cheapest one that’s there,’” said Neil Anderson, professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota.

Debra Prinzing, founder of the Slow Flowers Society that promotes sustainable floral practices, said that beyond being more sustainable, local and seasonal flowers can make an event more meaningful.

“If you care about local flowers for your wedding, then you know the story of where those flowers were grown,” she said. “Next year, when your anniversary comes up and you see those flowers in bloom or you see them at the farmers market, they’ll remind you of your wedding.”

Esther Lee, editorial director at The Knot wedding planning website, said that a significant number of couples say sustainability is important to their wedding plans. She said couples hope to personalize their event and give guests a sense of the region where the event is being held.

“There is just such a unique ambiance and element to the local flora of a place,” Lee said.

Artificial flowers are sometimes advertised as a sustainable alternative to fresh flowers, but it is important to evaluate data from manufacturers that back up this claim, said Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business at Columbia Business School. Many artificial flowers are made of plastic and are imported, so “we shouldn’t take the claim that they are more sustainable at face value,” she said.

For Day, the bride that grew her own flowers, that story didn’t end when the night was over. Her guests took home the dried flowers, and a friend later borrowed several arrangements for her own ceremony.

“That’s what’s cool about them too, is you can reuse them time and time again,” Day said. “And then when they get beat up, unlike plastic flowers, you can just throw them in your compost and say, ‘go back to the earth, see you later.’”","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/02/PDTN/87564614007-ap-25295540824705.jpg?crop=5995,3374,x0,y306&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 11:07:18.837343

US battery energy storage capacity has expanded by 13,809 MW over the past year, a 59.4% annual growth rate, according to EIA data.

EIA data reviewed by the SUN DAY Campaign confirms the storage sector surge experienced throughout 2024, where the battery capacity increased 66% in the calendar year, has continued deep into 2025.

While percentage growth off a smaller base means that storage is easily outpacing any other traditional generations, it was also second only to utility-scale solar in raw megawatts added, with solar capacity growing by an impressive 31,620 MW over the past year. In comparison, natural gas capacity added 3,417 MW, and nuclear added a neglible amount over the same period.

The EIA data suggests this trajectory will accelerate in the coming year. The administration projects developers will bring an additional 22,053 MW of battery capacity online over the next 12 months, with a map showing the additions with large concentrations of batteries noticeably clustering in Texas (ERCOT), California (CAISO), and more. While Arizona is showing good growth, California and Texas hold over 70% of the total national capacity combined.

At the MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) Fall Colloquium, Kelty explored how GM is bringing next-generation battery technologies from lab to commercialization, driving American battery innovation forward. The colloquium is part of the ongoing MITEI Presents: Advancing the Energy Transition speaker series.

At GM, Kelty’s team is primarily focused on three things: first, improving affordability to get more electric vehicles (EVs) on the road. “How do you drive down the cost?” Kelty asked the audience. “It's the batteries. The batteries make up about 30 percent of the cost of the vehicle.” Second, his team strives to improve battery performance, including charging speed and energy density. Third, they are working on localizing the supply chain. “We've got to build up our resilience and our independence here in North America, so we're not relying on materials coming from China,” Kelty explained.

To aid their efforts, resources are being poured into the virtualization space, significantly cutting down on time dedicated to research and development. Now, Kelty’s team can do modeling up front using artificial intelligence, reducing what previously would have taken months to a couple of days.

“If you want to modify … the nickel content ever so slightly, we can very quickly model: ‘OK, how’s that going to affect the energy density? The safety? How’s that going to affect the charge capability?’” said Kelty. “We can look at that at the cell level, then the pack level, then the vehicle level.”

Kelty revealed that they have found a solution that addresses affordability, accessibility, and commercialization: lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries. Previously, the industry looked to reduce costs by lowering the amount of cobalt in batteries by adding greater amounts of nickel. These high-nickel batteries are in most cars on the road in the United States due to their high range. LMR batteries, though, take things a step further by reducing the amount of nickel and adding more manganese, which drives the cost of batteries down even further while maintaining range.

Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries are the chemistry of choice in China, known for low cost, high cycle life, and high safety. With LMR batteries, the cost is comparable to LFP with a range that is closer to high-nickel. “That’s what’s really a breakthrough,” said Kelty.

LMR batteries are not new, but there have been challenges to adopting them, according to Kelty. “People knew about it, but they didn’t know how to commercialize it. They didn’t know how to make it work in an EV,” he explained. Now that GM has figured out commercialization, they will be the first to market these batteries in their EVs in 2028.

Kelty also expressed excitement over the use of vehicle-to-grid technologies in the future. Using a bidirectional charger with a two-way flow of energy, EVs could charge, but also send power from their batteries back to the electrical grid. This would allow customers to charge “their vehicles at night when the electricity prices are really low, and they can discharge it during the day when electricity rates are really high,” he said.

In addition to working in the transportation sector, GM is exploring ways to extend their battery expertise into applications in grid-scale energy storage. “It’s a big market right now, but it’s growing very quickly because of the data center growth,” said Kelty.

When looking to the future of battery manufacturing and EVs in the United States, Kelty remains optimistic: “we’ve got the technology here to make it happen. We’ve always had the innovation here. Now, we’re getting more and more of the manufacturing. We’re getting that all together. We’ve got just tremendous opportunity here that I’m hopeful we’re going to be able to take advantage of and really build a massive battery industry here.”",https://climate.mit.edu/sites/default/files/post-images/MITei-Kurt-Kelty.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:02:00.666509

If we invest in and develop community buy-in and coalition- and trust-building, North Carolina rural communities can define clean energy success for themselves.","On November 13, 20 folks attended the second annual rural clean energy convening in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, co-sponsored by the Center for Progressive Reform and the Center for Energy Education. Attendees included academics, energy policy advocates, small-scale developers, technical experts, and government representatives. We built off last year’s convening, addressing the new North Carolina policy landscape and context given the repeal of federal funding, the state’s proposed unfavorable carbon plan, and rising energy burden in communities.

The main topics of the day were the challenges and opportunities for an equitable and just clean energy transition for North Carolina’s rural communities. Across a diverse range of perspectives, there was one consistent theme: North Carolina’s rural communities are incredible, socially vibrant places, and they deserve better: better housing, better renewable energy resources, and better economic development.

Energy burden — or the high share of household income that goes to energy — is acute in North Carolina, which sits in the top half of states with the highest energy burdens for low-wealth ratepayers. Nearly 1.5 million North Carolinians are “overburdened” by energy costs, meaning that they pay more than 6 percent of their income on energy. Some even pay more for energy than for housing, and many live in rural communities.

Across all income brackets, rural counties have the highest energy burden in the state due to energy-inefficient housing, climate change, and structural disinvestment that has led to disparate rates of poverty and unemployment. North Carolina counties with the highest energy costs — also disproportionately rural — interestingly also tend to have a larger portion of renewable energy projects. While utility-scale renewable energy projects may produce benefits such as higher tax revenues, these projects can ignore structural issues of ownership, wages, and distribution of benefits and may even reinforce or exacerbate extractive practices in the production of electricity.

Participants at the convening highlighted some of the barriers to addressing these energy-related injustices. The rise of AI data centers has complicated what communities can leverage as a benefit. We also discussed false solutions like small nuclear reactors that take a long time to build, compared to clear, easy, real-time solutions like solar and wind resources.

As federal funding has been held up in lawsuits or otherwise totally rescinded — as is the case with most Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding — communities are grappling with understaffed agencies trying to dole out energy efficiency funds or otherwise undertake clean energy projects.

The EnergySaver program is just one example of a new state program intended to lower energy bills but faced with staffing hurdles. The EnergySaver program is supposed to help homeowners and renters across North Carolina cover the cost of energy efficiency and electrification upgrades through HOMES (Homeowners Managing Efficiency Savings) and HEAR (Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates) from the IRA. Staff at the Center for Energy Education have heard that some program participants have reported delays processing applications.

Participants also stressed the importance of making sure basic needs are always forefront in the conversation about a clean, healthy, equitable energy transition. Moldy or asbestos-filled housing, lack of clean drinking water, and mental health burdens are all examples of the multilayered concerns in rural communities, some of which are often directly connected to structures that lack energy efficiency or weatherization features. We discussed how to support and educate our commissioners on how renewable energy projects owned by the community are assets. These commissioners may otherwise be persuaded by organized corporate interests, which tend to ignore issues beyond installing and connecting large-scale energy projects to the grid.

Still, there are significant natural strengths of rural North Carolina that can overcome these barriers: social capital, strong communities, growing diversity, and, namely, a growing rural population: of 100 total counties in the state, 80 of them are rural. Indeed, North Carolina’s rural population is the 2nd largest in the country (after Texas). There were 3,474,661 people living in rural North Carolina as of April 1, 2020, with a 2.9 percent increase from 2010 to 2020. With a growing population comes new opportunities to position rural communities as epicenters of wealth-building clean energy initiatives.

Rural communities are also primed for renewable energy development. The rise of agrivoltaics can be mutually beneficial for farmers and communities. Resilience hubs in rural communities can be beacons for cooling and resilience before and after natural disasters. Microgrids and the emergence of balcony solar can encourage energy independence and also promote resilience in the wake of severe weather. Participants also highlighted the role of educating children about solar and their role in the ecosystem to build a more sustainable future through direct participation.

Ultimately, a “rural agenda” is needed to address the multifaceted challenges to a clean energy transition. If we invest in and develop community buy-in and coalition- and trust-building, North Carolina rural communities can define clean energy success for themselves.

Gitanyow Lax’yip (Northwestern British Columbia, Canada) – Ahead of an anticipated Final Investment Decision in 2026, Simigigyet’m Gitanyow (Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs) – a traditional Indigenous government mandated to protect Gitanyow Nation’s lands, resources, and laws – submitted a letter today to 43 banks and pension funds to respect Gitanyow rights, and urge against providing financing or equity investments for the proposed Ksi Lisims liquefied “natural” gas (LNG) project or its developers.

Read the full letter from Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs to major banks and pensions.

Simogyet Watakhayetsxw/Deborah Good:

“Investors considering financing Ksi Lisims LNG need to know that this project is an extremely risky bet for many reasons and continues to face mounting opposition. Gitanyow’s message is clear: we’ll continue to fight for our way of life and stand up against projects like this that threaten our Lax’yip.”

This comes amidst decades of resistance, from these lands and around the world, to LNG and other forms of fossil fuel expansion. 128 civil society organisations have endorsed the Gitanyow letter in solidarity.

Addressing the lack of consent by at least four additional First Nations, the mounting financial risks of LNG projects as the world rapidly transitions to renewable energy, and legal and regulatory climate and environmental threats, the letter states:

“We would like to alert you to significant negative impacts and risks posed to our people and the natural resources on which we rely from the proposed Ksi Lisims liquefied natural gas project. Given our serious concerns, growing legal uncertainty and the withholding of consent for the project by Indigenous Peoples — including Gitanyow — as required under the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to which Canada is a signatory, we strongly urge your institution not to provide financing or consider equity investments for this project or its developers.”

On November 13, Prime Minister Mark Carney designated Ksi Lisims LNG of national significance and referred it to the Major Projects Office for fast-tracking and possible taxpayer-backed support. The 12 million tonnes of gas exported by Ksi Lisims would escalate climate-killing emissions while putting billions in the pockets of foreign-owned and MAGA-linked private equity firms. This also comes on the heels of COP30 in Brazil where the rights and inclusion of Indigenous Peoples rightfully dominated the negotiations.

The letter continues:

“The Gitanyow have never ceded or surrendered title to their lands, rights to their resources, or the power to make decisions within the Lax’yip (Territory)…We have challenged the project in court over threats to salmon populations in the Nass Watershed, climate impacts, inadequate consultation and absence of Indigenous consent..… consent and/or a decision on consent has not been granted for Ksi Lisims LNG by four of the six participating Nations: Lax Kw’alaams, Metlaktla, Kitsumkalum, and Gitxalaa.”

Multiple First Nations have challenged Ksi Lisims LNG legally, including ongoing individual federal court challenges from Lax Kw’alaams Band and Metlakatla First Nation launched in October 2025; Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs challenged Ksi Lisims LNG in BC Supreme Court over dangers to salmon, climate impacts, and failure to properly consult, which was recently dismissed are considering an appeal.

Offering four clear recommendations for financial institutions considering Ksi Lisims LNG financing, Gitanyow leaders requested direct response to this letter within two weeks, by December 15, confirming decisions around denying financing to this project as part of a broader LNG exclusion policy.

Gas-based power-generating resources, such as gas turbines, are well positioned to meet current needs and have seen renewed demand amid the data center boom.
A disproportionate share of expected data center capacity is planned for some of the most constrained grids, such as PJM Interconnection.
A range of resources can enable data center load flexibility, from backup diesel generators to on-site battery energy storage solutions.
In practice, apart from Google, few IT companies have successfully integrated data center load flexibility into utility plans on a large scale.","Although pockets of excess generating capacity exist across the US, data centers' impact on load growth is expected to exceed grid-based power generation and transmission capacity.

Limits to grid-based power generation and transmission capacity do not mean data center power demand will go unmet. Instead, technology, market, and policy approaches that deliver power supply for the grid's most constrained hours and locations will command a premium, as will strategies that quickly provide power independent of the grid.

Gas-based power-generating resources, such as gas turbines, are well positioned to meet current needs and have seen renewed demand amid the data center boom. Battery energy storage solutions also offer scalable near-term capacity but depend on evolving market rules and requirements.

With concerns rising over the slow pace of grid-connected capacity expansion, customer-sited energy resources and capabilities offer a faster path to power. Expansion of these resources may continue long term, especially as data center campuses grow.

US power grids have significant excess generating capacity to accommodate load growth throughout most of the year. In many industries, average capacity utilization is used as a measure of market tightness. In the power sector, coal and natural gas combined-cycle fleets averaged 50% to 55% utilization over the past decade. This suggests incremental new loads could be accommodated by increasing utilization of the existing fleet. However, power markets require supply and demand to stay balanced at all times, from peak summer afternoons to cold winter mornings. To estimate how much new load US power grids can integrate, it is essential to understand the supply-demand balance during the most constrained hours.

During the most constrained hours, excess generating capacity across the US totals about 70 GW, slightly greater than California’s peak electricity demand. Over the next few years, surplus generating capacity is expected to remain within this range, based on the current pipeline of new projects and the outlook for generation retirements and load growth outside of data centers.

At first glance, with a pipeline of about 85 GW of new data center capacity requests expected by 2030, US power markets face a seemingly modest generating capacity deficit of 15 GW. However, data center operators face a much higher level of grid constraints for several reasons. First, to reliably support an additional 85 GW of demand, approximately 100 GW of total capacity, including surplus, is required. Another reason is that surplus generating capacity is not well aligned with expected data center growth on a regional basis. A disproportionate share of expected data center capacity is planned for some of the most constrained grids, such as PJM Interconnection. PJM, named for the original three core states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland, is the largest US Regional Transmission Organization; it operates the electric grid and competitive wholesale electricity market for all or parts of 13 Eastern US states and the District of Columbia. PJM surplus capacity has declined sharply in recent years, with recent record-high-capacity auction outcomes pointing to persistent near-term tightness. Upside risk to load growth from other industrial demand — particularly in the grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) — threatens to exacerbate the capacity deficit in that region as well.

Even within a market, spare generating capacity may not be immediately deliverable to new data centers because of regional transmission grid constraints. As the size of new data center facilities or campuses grows — reaching hundreds of megawatts or even gigawatt scale within a few years — the concentration of power demand strains local transmission systems. This may require extensive, time-intensive upgrades, including installation of large transformers and breakers.

Although orders for large turbines have surged over the past 18 months, supply constraints and lengthy project timelines will push much of this new capacity into production in the late 2020s and early 2030s. The power crunch appears most severe through 2028 and 2029, when supply begins to catch up.

For example, PJM’s fast-tracking initiative, completed earlier this year, shows that most new gas capacity will not be in service before 2029, with uprates to existing facilities providing the bulk of near-term additions. Similarly, state-led efforts in Texas to expedite new gas projects are expected to have limited impact until 2029.

Overall, we expect 55 GW to 65 GW of new grid-based gas capacity in the US from 2025 to 2030, roughly double our expectations prior to the data center boom, but still short of incremental needs.

Beyond large gas turbines, utilities and regional power markets have raced to shore up near-term capacity by extending existing resources. Since the start of 2023, plans to retire over 37 GW of coal capacity (one-third of all previously announced coal retirement capacity) have either been delayed or avoided through planned conversions to gas-fired generation — including at least 10 GW since the start of 2025. Deals to restart recently retired nuclear power plants and uprate operating ones are set to deliver around 3 GW of incremental nuclear capacity by 2030. Uprates at existing gas-fired plants will also contribute. Even the restart of recently retired coal plants — likely remade as gas-fired resources — is now under consideration, a scenario unimaginable just a few years ago but revived by tight market conditions and supportive federal actions.

Although grid-connected battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity is poised for significant growth, the data center boom has so far given this technology only a modest 8 GW or 15% uplift through 2030. Faster timelines give BESS an edge relative to other resources, but grid-connected BESS still faces long development queues, while tougher economics persist outside of Texas, California and the Southwest. Still, with scalable near-term capacity in short supply, BESS can enable data centers to capitalize on the potential emergence of new market processes to fast-track grid connections in exchange for self-supplied capacity.

Most incremental near-term capacity will come from new generation capacity and retirement delays, but demand-side strategies — such as deploying enhanced network-utilization technologies, repurposing existing crypto-currency mining facilities into traditional data centers, or adopting advanced chip-cooling techniques to reduce facility peak cooling demand and improve data center energy efficiency — may help avoid some incremental capacity needs. Expanding existing demand-response programs is another option, but it remains uncertain whether market prices can incentivize data center operators to curtail grid consumption, even temporarily, due to operational complexity and the enormous cost of potential service interruptions.

For data centers, load flexibility means dynamically restraining electricity consumption through workload management — such as rescheduling, slowing or re-routing IT tasks to other data centers — or temporarily relying on an on-site power supply during periods of grid stress. If enabled by supportive market rules and processes, flexibility can speed load interconnection by reducing the need for new grid infrastructure.

A range of resources can enable data center load flexibility, from backup diesel generators to on-site battery energy storage solutions. These approaches can be tailored to site-specific factors such as commercial requirements, emissions limits or operator expertise. Instead of waiting for new grid upgrades, flexible data centers that assume delivery risk — the risk that electricity will not be deliverable during periods of grid stress — can position themselves for faster grid connection.

However, making IT workloads grid-responsive remains novel in data center operations and design. In practice, apart from Google, few IT companies have successfully integrated data center load flexibility into utility plans on a large scale. Microsoft’s decade-old collaboration with Black Hills Energy used backup diesel generators to help avoid major investment in new generating resources. Future use cases must continue to address emissions limits, refueling logistics, and potential community opposition.

Moreover, although flexibility addresses the key data center bottleneck of grid-based power generation and transmission capacity, most states and markets do not yet offer a faster path to grid connection for flexible loads. Many of the load flexibility options that states, utilities, and operators are developing for large energy consumers remain undefined and do not yet have regulatory approval.

It seems clear, though, that as new load flexibility rules evolve, especially if they impose more stringent availability requirements, they will favor on-site resources and configurations that rely more on gas-based technologies than on energy-limited resources like shorter-duration BESS.

Because load flexibility does not yet offer a clear path to faster grid connections and requirements remain uncertain, many data center operators are looking to deploy more on-site resources to provide a fully independent power supply, at least temporarily until a permanent grid connection is established.

Since late last year, specialists like Crusoe, Frontier Infrastructure, and Enchanted Rock have unveiled plans to colocate over 26 GW of power supply with data centers by the early 2030s, with potential for more. Clusters have emerged in Texas and the Mid Atlantic (PJM), which are strong natural gas producing regions and have the greatest expected grid-capacity deficit.

On-site power often features smaller generators — such as small gas turbines, fuel cells and reciprocating engines — which are currently favored for their speed, scalability, modularity and availability. Many data center operators envision their on-site power assets shifting to backup roles after a grid connection is secured, while others are considering deeper integration of on-site resources with regional markets. For now, while most on-site generation projects remain in development, several gigawatts are already operating, under construction or backed by firm orders for gas resources.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/corp_1120_USPower?$responsive$,N,,2025-12-02 12:03:02.117048

But about 3,800 additional treatment plants – more than triple the current number – could potentially build biogas capture systems.
Anaerobic digesters generally become economical for plants treating at least one million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD).
But in 2020, the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated adding co-digestion capacity to the state’s wastewater treatment operations would cost about $1.4 billion.
“Most people’s perception of wastewater treatment is that we’re simply a ‘dirty-water utility.’ But [these projects] demonstrate that today’s wastewater utilities are really resource recovery facilities.","Greater Peoria Sanitary District (GPSD) treats 20 to 25 million gallons of wastewater each day and uses some of the resulting biogas to heat its boilers while flaring the rest. But now the Illinois utility has other plans for some of the excess and is banking on monetary and environmental returns.

That biogas will be converted to renewable natural gas (RNG), injected into the natural gas pipeline, and sold as transportation fuel—a slow but steady growing trend among water utilities looking to reduce their emissions while capitalizing on their waste byproduct. And they have the ideal feedstock. Their gas is high in methane and low in nitrogen, meaning its energy-rich and requires relatively minimal treatment steps.

Wastewater treatment plants have actually been capturing and digesting their biogas for about a century, though in the early days, the goal wasn’t energy recovery; it was simply to reduce the sludge they needed to manage. Over time, plant operators realized they were sitting on a resource that could power their pumps, aerators, boilers, and other energy-intensive equipment.

While some projects go a step further and upgrade to RNG, only about 4% of these operations currently do so, says Patrick Serfass, executive director, American Biogas Council (ABC). But about 3,800 additional treatment plants – more than triple the current number – could potentially build biogas capture systems. And if every wastewater facility with enough daily flow installed systems, the sector could capture 171.8 billion cubic feet of biogas each year, producing enough energy to power 1.3 million U.S. households, reports ABC.

What’s holding some operators back is that these projects can be financially risky, especially for small to midsized operations as they come with high capital and operating expenditures. Anaerobic digesters generally become economical for plants treating at least one million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD). Only about 5,000 of them see this volume—that’s less than a third of them. But for the utilities that can and choose to make the investment, there are potential payoffs.

With hundreds of millions of gallons of wastewater entering a treatment plant each day, there can be significant environmental and financial reasons to recover these resources, says Cynthia Finley, director of Regulatory Affairs at National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Operators can lower their emissions, generate revenue if the RNG is sold for injection into the grid, and reduce their energy costs and reliance on fossil fuel if it’s used internally. As importantly, using the RNG onsite can improve the resilience of the utility, allowing operations to continue if there is an interruption in other energy sources.

“But since the cost of building and operating these projects is high and the cost of fossil natural gas is low, they really do not pay for themselves without other incentives, such as state green energy programs or the federal Renewable Fuel Standard program for transportation fuels. These incentive programs can provide enough revenue for the utility to tip the balance in favor of a biogas to RNG project,” Finley says.

Now new private-public partnerships are emerging to help make these projects pencil out for more operators—and to tap into tremendous volumes of stranded biogas. In GPSD’s case, project developer Burnham is managing the risks by absorbing costs to build the processing infrastructure and through performance guarantees, namely ensuring that treatment levels are met.

The utility has no upfront costs and gets tax credits and a royalty on the gas it produces.

“Where we can most help is where facilities have a large capital need. For instance, where discharge volumes are out of compliance and more treatment infrastructure is required. By capitalizing on the byproduct of their process, we tend to be able to bring down net treatment costs while helping meet state and federal standards,” says Chris Tynan, founder and CEO, Burnham.

More states are adopting food waste diversion policies; about 11 of them have done so to date. This movement is opening project opportunities for plants that co-digest their biogas and food scraps. They already have the infrastructure to digest the materials and tend to be in close proximity to the generators.

“It’s a win-win: food processors and municipal solid-waste departments get a cost-effective and sustainable disposal option, while the treatment facility generates more biogas—offsetting energy costs and, in some cases, generating revenue,” Serfass says.

New York City’s Newtown Creek Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility is one of a few that now co-digests organics and sludge to help meet a food scrap diversion mandate while generating product. The facility produced nearly 355,000 MMBtu of RNG in just under two years –enough to heat over 7,400 homes annually. And the project has yielded negative greenhouse gas emissions, avoiding the methane release associated with traditional landfill disposal.

But what about the steep upfront cost? That expenditure and payback varies. But in 2020, the California Environmental Protection Agency estimated adding co-digestion capacity to the state’s wastewater treatment operations would cost about $1.4 billion. But it would save $255 million a year, delivering a return on investment in five to six years.

“These facilities have a long, long lifespan. So, the economics of it really make sense,” Serfass says.

To Brian Johnson, executive director, Greater Peoria Sanitary District, it’s about more. It’s also about helping the public understand what water utilities do.

“Most people’s perception of wastewater treatment is that we’re simply a ‘dirty-water utility.’ But [these projects] demonstrate that today’s wastewater utilities are really resource recovery facilities.

“We can show that we are turning a waste byproduct into a renewable fuel that reduces emissions, generates revenue for ratepayers, and strengthens our region’s sustainability. It’s a smart environmental solution built from infrastructure that the community already owns. And we are using energy from something they produce every day.”",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt4a147f9e36f0754a/blt53dd34158e663329/692eef3e16c66f4e7aae064e/wastewater_treatment_plant.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:59.728777

This worked fine during the decades when there was slow load growth, but electrification brings two sources of uncertainty that break this framework.
Spend too little and the grid is overloaded and unable to reliably serve customers or accommodate electrification.
In this case, SCE could only spend that money on distribution grid capacity expansion.
The utility could also spend approved money on less urgent grid upgrades or other items entirely, knowing that the CPUC is unlikely to deny future requests for urgent grid upgrades.","Typically, a utility presents one scenario of future electricity demand and grid investment needs, stakeholders provide input, and then regulators approve how much the utility can spend. This worked fine during the decades when there was slow load growth, but electrification brings two sources of uncertainty that break this framework.

First, timing uncertainty. We know California will eventually host millions of electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps. We don't know exactly how much of that will happen in the next 5 to 10 years. California is standing strong by its electrification goals, but recent federal actions are making it harder and more expensive to electrify.

Second, location uncertainty. People and businesses purchase electric cars and trucks when they want to and charge them wherever it is convenient. Mostly, that means predictable locations where vehicles are parked for a long time, like overnight at homes or in depots, where the vast majority of charging needs can be met when there is plenty of spare capacity on the grid. But public charging is more variable and requires more power in a shorter period of time, resulting in hot spots that require power line upgrades.

Timing and location are especially important because whether a part of the grid needs an upgrade or not depends on the capacity of each piece of equipment, how much load it serves today, and how much load it will serve tomorrow.

The number of components that SCE needs to upgrade could vary around 20 percent in either direction from its primary forecast. The old approach—presenting regulators with a single forecast and requesting a fixed budget—no longer works when the range of possible futures is that wide.

Spend too little and the grid is overloaded and unable to reliably serve customers or accommodate electrification. Spend too much and electricity rates increase, which means that fewer people can afford the clean technology that California desperately needs to meet its climate goals.

Our proposal for threading the needle

NRDC recommended that SCE establish a two-way balancing account to fund future grid upgrades to thread the needle between encouraging proactive spending and accommodating uncertainty in how much grid investment is needed. A two-way balancing account provides SCE with an initial reduced budget, allows SCE to collect more money (with limits) if needed, and requires SCE to return unspent money to customers.

There are a couple of ways the CPUC could set the initial approved budget and provide guardrails. For the initial budget, they could go with a conservative approach and approve an amount based on the lower end of future upgrades that are likely needed, or CPUC could approve the amount SCE originally requested, which NRDC found falls in the middle of the range of upgrades we believe are likely necessary.

For both scenarios, SCE would have more rigid limits on the uses of these funds. In past rate cases, SCE would have been given the ability to spend distribution system funding on a wide range of projects. In this case, SCE could only spend that money on distribution grid capacity expansion. Ratepayers are off the hook if these grid upgrade needs don’t materialize. And in either case, CPUC could impose a total spending cap to further protect utility customers, ideally based on the higher end of the likely grid upgrade range.

While other balancing accounts exist, they are a departure from the status quo in California, wherein a utility is approved to spend a set amount for all the near-term investments it can justify; but once this money is approved, the utility can spend it however it wants. Although this model provides utilities with flexibility if investment needs change from the original plan, it can lead to inefficient spending because the utility will aim to spend the full approved budget, even if the projected load growth used to justify the budget does not materialize. The utility could also spend approved money on less urgent grid upgrades or other items entirely, knowing that the CPUC is unlikely to deny future requests for urgent grid upgrades.

A balancing account, with an upper spending limit restricted to distribution grid upgrades, provides the right amount of flexibility in the face of uncertainty and encourages SCE to spend on necessary grid infrastructure in a timely manner.

The CPUC authorized SCE to spend an initial $532 million on grid upgrades based on a conservative scenario that only includes a fraction of the electrification necessary to meet state policy goals. Additionally, to comply with state law and policy goals, SCE can create a memorandum account through which it can spend up to an additional $100 million on the upgrades necessary to support electric transportation load growth only. SCE could spend even more if it must, but that spending is riskier because SCE will have to spend first and collect the money later—and only if the commission approves of what the utility did.

By guaranteeing some recovery in the typical manner without guardrails and also providing an avenue for additional recovery based on reasonableness review, this well-intentioned proposal has two shortcomings.

First, if SCE thinks it may be denied recovering the money it spends, it may not invest enough to keep the grid reliable, which would affect all electricity use, not just electric cars. It could also pinch pennies today and make smaller upgrades, thereby missing out on long-term savings from economies of scale and leaving ratepayers worse off.

Second, because the $532 million authorized has no guardrails, SCE could spend that money on less important things, knowing that it could always justify additional spending through the memo account as critical needs come up.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:31.838642

The renewable energy industry continues to see downsizing for projects and other initiatives. Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back more than $4.4 billion worth of large-scale renewable energy projects and factories in October, bringing the total cost of projects canceled in the private-sector to more than $28.7 billion in 2025 alone, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of renewable energy projects. The cancellations and scale backs will eliminate nearly 9,000 previously announced and current jobs, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects to nearly 30,000 this year.

October’s cancellations and closures (one project was disclosed on Sept. 30) included nine previously announced battery, storage, solar, and electric vehicle factories in Michigan, Mississippi, Ohio and California. Only a single new large-scale project was announced last month according to E2’s tracking — the lowest number of new projects announced in a month since E2 began tracking.

According to the analysis, cancellations, closures, and downsizes are outpacing new project investments and jobs nearly two to one in 2025. About $11 billion in investments and 17,000 jobs have been announced so far in 2025. At the same time, $28.7 billion and nearly 30,000 jobs have been canceled.

“Cancellations are clearly accelerating,” said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2. “The abandonment of 51 projects this year alone reflects the long-term uncertainty manufacturers and investors are facing about the long-term future of U.S. energy leadership.”

Republican states suffering most

Republican-held congressional districts continue to lose the most from cancellations. Nearly $17 billion in investments that would have created almost 22,000 jobs have been canceled in Republican districts so far in 2025, compared with almost $10 billion and 13,000 jobs in Democratic districts.

“Companies, including many that had already broken ground, begun hiring, or made major capital commitments, are reversing course at an increasing rate,” Timberlake added. “Communities and their constituents are paying the price through lost job opportunities, lost economic development investments and lost tax revenues.”

According to E2’s tracking, new investments were not enough to offset impact from scaled back and abandoned projects. The only new clean energy project announced in October was Eos Energy Storage’s $352 million plans to relocate its headquarters to Pittsburgh and expand its Pennsylvania-based battery manufacturing operation. The Eos project brings total investments announced since E2 began tracking in August 2022 to $132.2 billion.

Cancellations tracked by E2 include projects that were announced or completed prior to August 2022 that are not added to E2’s announcement tracker. This results in inconsistencies between the jobs and investment totals between the cancellation and announcement trackers since many cancelled and closed projects would not impact E2’s announcement tracker.

Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2025

COVINGTON COUNTY, AL — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rejected #Reliant Southwest Alabama Storage LLC’s permit application for the Pine Hills Sequestration Hub as incomplete, according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by local residents.

In an August 14, 2025 Notice of Deficiency, EPA informed the company that critical information is missing from their Class VI permit application, including a complete Area of Review map showing all injection wells, producing wells, abandoned wells, water wells, homes, surface water, springs, mines, and other structures where people live or work.

“The EPA is requiring basic public information that should have been included from the start,” said local landowner and attorney Wes Laird. “Our community has a right to see a complete picture of what’s being proposed before a project of this magnitude moves forward.”

The proposed Pine Hills facility would inject approximately 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (waste) per year into underground formations in Covington County — what would be among the largest carbon sequestration projects in the world. The aquifer that supplies fresh water to Covington County residents also supplies much of the Alabama Wiregrass and Northwest Florida.

However, documents released to the community are heavily redacted, with entire pages marked as “proprietary business information.”

Community members note that the application itself acknowledges the presence of wells in the area that were not properly plugged, raising concerns about potential pathways for CO₂ migration.

“This project could impact our groundwater and land for generations,” Laird said. “The public should see the same information as the EPA, not heavily redacted documents.” Community organizers plan to formally appeal the extensive redactions with the EPA. Under FOIA regulations, appellants have 90 days from the date of EPA’s response letter to file their appeal.

In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.","The Trump administration has renamed the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, now calling it the National Laboratory of the Rockies, marking an identity shift for the Colorado institution that has been a global leader in wind, solar and other renewable energy research.

“The new name reflects the Trump administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado,” said Jud Virden, laboratory director, in a statement.

He did not specify what this “broader vision” would mean for the lab’s programs or its staff of about 4,000.

The renaming is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump administration to deemphasize or cut the parts of the federal government that support renewable energy, while also expanding federal support for fossil fuels.

Asked for details, the Department of Energy said in an email that the renaming “reflects the Department’s renewed focus on ‘energy addition,’ rather than the prioritization of specific energy resources.”

A lab spokesman had no additional information about whether there will be changes to programs or headcount at the lab.

Bill Ritter, a Democrat who was governor of Colorado from 2007 to 2011, said it’s reasonable to assume that the name change signals that the federal government is abandoning the lab’s status as a world leader in energy research.

“It’s an iconic research facility,” he said.

Underscoring this point, he recalled a trip to Israel while he was governor.

“The head of their renewable energy laboratory said, ‘I have nothing to tell you, because you come from the place that has the best renewable energy laboratory in the world,’” Ritter said.

After leaving office, he founded the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University, which specializes in energy policy research, and is now a consultant on energy business and policy.

Based on this experience, he thinks that anything the Trump administration does to divert from the lab’s mission is harmful to the United States’ ability to remain a major player in the energy economy of the near future.

“We’ll no longer be competitive in renewables research with China or India or other countries that are still heading toward the renewable energy transition at a very fast pace,” he said.

People with close ties to the lab were not surprised by the name change, given the administration’s broader goals.

“In the early days of DOGE people there were whispering about a name change to avoid the ire of MAGAs,” said Matt Henry, a Montana-based social scientist who worked at the lab from February 2024 to August 2025, in a post on Bluesky. “It pissed me off—prioritizing the preservation of the institution at the expense of its [stated] mission? So disappointing.”

He was referring to Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which sought to cut federal spending in the early months of the Trump administration. The term MAGA refers to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan and movement.

Dustin Mulvaney, a San Jose State University environmental studies professor, said if the name change is a sign of a significant change in the lab’s work, it would be “like losing several major land grant research universities all at once.”

Mulvaney has done projects in partnership with people at the lab. An important part of the institution’s work, he said, is that its research is free and accessible to the public, helping businesses and universities that may not be able to afford the work of private research firms.

The lab’s mission has included consulting to help communities benefit from new energy technologies, and ensure smooth transitions away from fossil fuels.

This work meant that the lab was out of step with an administration that has said it disagrees with the idea of a transition away from fossil fuels and has sought to impede funding and development of renewable energy.

The lab was established in 1974 as the Solar Energy Research Institute, part of a law signed by President Gerald Ford to facilitate alternatives to importing oil from the Middle East, according to a history on the lab’s website. The U.S. was suffering through high gasoline prices amid tensions with oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” said Audrey Robertson, assistant secretary of energy, in a statement. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources. Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand.”

In 1977, the federal government selected Golden, Colorado, as the location for the lab. In 1991, the Solar Energy Research Institute became the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, part of a change by the administration of President George H. W. Bush that also elevated the institution to become part of the country’s national lab system.

But the lab’s history has also included budget cuts and periods when its work fell out of favor with presidential administrations, including layoffs and funding cuts under President Ronald Reagan. President Donald Trump proposed substantial cuts during his first term, but Congress retained much of the funding.

The Trump administration’s budget proposal, issued in May, calls for cuts across non-defense discretionary spending, including on energy research, but the budget process is still underway.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/98079-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 12:02:58.312857

Why are CCAs using green bond prepayment transactions?
Investors gain access to tax-exempt green bonds.
How do green bond prepayments generate savings?
Why is interest in green bond prepayments growing?","Frequently Asked Questions: CCA Green Bond Prepayment Transactions

1. Why are CCAs using green bond prepayment transactions?

Prepayment transactions allow CCAs to reduce the cost of long-term renewable energy contracts by using tax-exempt financing, leading directly to lower utility bills for customers.

2. How much money have CCAs saved through CCCFA so far?

CCCFA has issued $23 billion in prepayment bonds, saving CCA customers roughly $150 million every year, totaling about $4.6 billion over the life of these contracts.

3. How do energy prepayment contracts work?

CCAs prepay for a long-term supply of electricity using proceeds from tax-exempt municipal bonds. Because these bonds carry lower interest rates, the resulting energy price is discounted compared to traditional procurement.

4. How do prepayment transactions support clean energy development?

Prepayments help finance the purchase and construction of new renewable energy projects by providing developers with upfront capital and long-term revenue certainty.

5. Why can CCAs use tax-exempt bonds for energy prepayments?

Federal law permits tax-exempt public entities—including CCAs—to finance prepaid energy contracts using municipal bonds. The IRS and Congress codified this framework in the 1990s.

6. Why are green bond prepayments a competitive advantage for CCAs compared to IOUs?

CCAs can access tax-exempt financing, which investor-owned utilities cannot use. This enables CCAs to secure meaningfully lower energy prices—an important competitive advantage in California’s energy landscape.

7. Have prepayment bonds been used before?

Yes. Municipal utilities have long used similar structures to prepay for natural gas. CCCFA is now leveraging this framework for renewable energy purchases on behalf of CCAs.

8. What is the California Community Choice Financing Authority (CCCFA)?

CCCFA is a joint powers authority created by CCAs to issue green bonds that facilitate energy prepayments. By working together, CCAs gain access to lower-cost capital and greater purchasing power.

9. Who participates in a typical prepayment transaction?

A standard transaction includes:

A CCA purchasing electricity

CCCFA, which issues the bonds and coordinates the structure

A taxable energy supplier providing electricity under a prepaid contract

10. What major parties benefit from the prepayment structure?

CCAs benefit from lower-cost renewable energy.

Customers benefit from lower rates.

Investors gain access to tax-exempt green bonds.

Energy suppliers secure long-term revenue from prepaid contracts.

11. Are more CCAs planning to use these structures?

Yes. Several CCAs that are not yet part of CCCFA have expressed interest, and demand from both CCAs and investors suggests more issuances are likely.

12. How do green bond prepayments generate savings?

Savings come from the difference between taxable and tax-exempt interest rates. Investors accept lower, tax-exempt returns; CCAs pass these lower financing costs directly into discounted energy prices.

13. Is the typical 10% savings rate reliable?

Ten percent is a useful benchmark but not guaranteed. Actual savings depend heavily on market conditions at the time of issuance, and some recent transactions have produced lower discounts.

14. Are there additional fees CCAs must pay to participate?

Underwriting fees and other issuance costs are built into the transaction cashflows. The only additional cost to CCAs is minimal internal staff time.

15. What does it mean that CCCFA’s bonds are “non-recourse”?

Non-recourse means CCAs are not financially responsible for repaying the bonds beyond the structured transaction revenues. The bonds are secured only by the contract rights and cashflows within the prepayment deal—not CCA general funds.

16. Why is interest in green bond prepayments growing?

Early savings have been substantial, the structures are scalable, and investors continue to show strong demand for tax-exempt, climate-aligned bonds. As a result, future issuances are highly likely.",https://cal-cca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/7-22-CalCCA_Logo_400x400_Cleaned-Up-Simplified-on-Green.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:40.541916

During the Chairman’s Remarks portion of the meeting, Dare County Board of Commissioners Chairman Bob Woodard provided an update on the county’s ongoing efforts to address the significant challenges occurring on Hatteras Island—particularly persistent flooding and overwash along N.C. Highway 12 and the collapse of 15 homes in Buxton over a six-week period.

Chairman Woodard reported that county officials recently met with NC Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Reid Wilson and representatives from Governor Josh Stein's office, the NC Division of Coastal Management, and the North Carolina Board of Transportation to enable state leadership to fully understand the severity of the conditions impacting the island and its critical infrastructure. He emphasized that these meetings are part of a broader effort to allow officials to see firsthand what residents and visitors are experiencing. Woodard also noted that county officials plan to travel to Raleigh after the first of the year—once legislators return to session—to meet individually with lawmakers.

As he continued his remarks, Chairman Woodard shared a letter he recently sent to North Carolina Governor Josh Stein and every member of the General Assembly regarding the escalating erosion and overwash issues. The letter issues an urgent call for statewide support to address rapidly worsening conditions on Hatteras Island. It outlines severe coastal erosion that has led to repeated home collapses, the increasing vulnerability of N.C. Highway 12—the sole transportation link for Hatteras Island—and the mounting strain on local resources despite more than $275 million invested in beach nourishment by Dare County and its five oceanfront towns over the years.

The letter also details several key requests, including funding the long-established but never-capitalized State Beach Nourishment Fund, advancing long-term strategies identified through the N.C. 12 Task Force and reconsidering the state’s ban on hardened shoreline structures in areas where nourishment alone is no longer sufficient. Chairman Woodard further emphasized that protecting N.C. Highway 12 and stabilizing the coastline is critical not only for the safety and well-being of island residents but also for safeguarding the economic engine that benefits the entire state.

Chairman Woodard concluded his remarks by assuring the public that the Dare County Board of Commissioners and Dare County officials are working diligently every day to address and resolve the challenges facing Dare County and its coastal communities.

Dare County Board of Commissioners Vice Chairman and OBX Jeep Charities President Steve House provided an update on the 2025 OBX Jeep Invasion and the nonprofit’s efforts to support the community. OBX Jeep Charities is a 501(c)(3) organization that provides various resources, programs and activities designed to enhance the lives of Dare County citizens. During the meeting, House—who was joined by OBX Jeep Invasion Junior Vice President Jared Weibley—announced that funds raised through the event will benefit multiple local organizations:

$10,000 – OBX Room in the Inn

$3,500 – Kitty Hawk Police Department

$3,500 – Kitty Hawk Ocean Rescue

$10,000 – Wounded Warriors in Action

Dare Early College Principal Kassie Mount delivered a presentation titled “Mission, Vision and Mascot Development” regarding the new Dare Early College facility currently under construction on the College of The Albemarle – Dare Campus in Manteo. The presentation—which provided an overview of the foundational work underway to define the school’s mission, vision, values and identity—also highlighted stakeholder discussions focused on the purpose of Dare Early College, the impact the school aims to have on students and the broader community, and the qualities that will guide and distinguish its graduates.

During her presentation, Mount also reviewed the key themes shaping the school’s development—including equity and opportunity, goal orientation and perseverance, and individualized support—and introduced the school’s mascot, the Mariners, which embodies the Dare Early College’s values of resilience, self-discovery, courage and integrity.

For a moment, the North Carolina State Board of Elections listed Rep. Ray Pickett as a primary challenger to House Speaker Destin Hall.","Congressional, judicial, and district attorney hopefuls across the state flocked to Raleigh on Monday to get their names on the ballot.

The Caucus spoke with several first-time and returning candidates about their vision and what to expect from them if elected.

Order in the Court

Democratic Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls was among the first to submit paperwork for her reelection bid. She doesn’t have any primary challengers and is expected to face Republican state Rep. Sarah Stevens of Surry County in the general election.

In an interview, Earls expressed concern with Stevens’ legislative background.

“The voters will have a real choice if Sarah Stevens is my opponent,” Earls told The Caucus. “She has voted to take away so many of the rights that I think are fundamental.”

Earls cited Stevens’ support of abortion restrictions and changes that she sees as reducing North Carolinians’ ability to vote.

Stevens accused Riggs of judicial overreach.

“Anita Earls is a liberal judicial activist who wants our courts, not our duly elected legislature to write the laws,” Stevens said in a statement. “I welcome the opportunity to expose her radical leftist agenda to all North Carolina voters.”

The Democrat also addressed recent pushback to a statement she issued last month criticizing the U.S. Border Patrol’s presence in Charlotte and Raleigh. Republican Supreme Court Justice Phil Berger Jr. called Earls’ statement “irresponsible” and questioned her neutrality.

“Judges are not political commentators and we are not supposed to be advocates,” Berger Jr. wrote. “When we speak as if we are, we blur the boundaries.”

Earls defended her statement, saying she has a First Amendment right and obligation as a statewide candidate to put a spotlight on issues she cares about.

“It’s important not to confuse two different things,” Earls said. “What we do as justices in our opinions is one thing, but voters have the right, I think, to know what our values are and what we stand for. That’s maybe different than in the past.”

Democratic Court of Appeals Judges Toby Hampson and John Arrowood also submitted paperwork for their reelection campaigns. There also will be a competitive Democratic primary for an open Court of Appeals seat between James Whalen and Christine Walczyk.

The Caucus asked Hampson about his involvement in the long-running state Supreme Court election dispute in which Republican Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin sought to overturn his defeat by Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs.

A three-judge panel including Hampson sided with Griffin and ordered the removal of several longtime voters falsely labeled as “never residents.” (The Assembly was first to report that many of those voters actually did live in the state or had in the past.) Hampson dissented, and a federal Trump-appointed judge ultimately ruled in Riggs’ favor.

“There’d never been any evidentiary hearing to determine which of these voters were, in fact, in the right categories or not in the right categories,” Hampson said. “We were just making assumptions about these voters based on their appearance on a list. It just underscores that facts matter.”

Congressional Chaos

Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis announced Monday that he’d seek reelection in the redrawn 1st Congressional District, though he hasn’t yet filed with the State Board of Elections. Republican state lawmakers redrew the northeastern voting lines in an effort to net their party an additional congressional seat. (Punchbowl News first reported on Davis’ plans.)

Davis had debated whether to challenge Republican Rep. Greg Murphy in the 3rd District, since he lives in Snow Hill, which is now in Murphy’s district. Unlike those running for the North Carolina General Assembly, congressional candidates don’t have to live in their districts.

“Many feel Washington, D.C., isn’t serving their needs, and the redistricting battle clearly proves it,” Davis said in a statement. “I’m running in NC-01 to ensure everyone, from the northeast to the coast, has a powerful voice in Congress.”

Republican state Sen. Bobby Hanig filed to run against Davis on Monday. He told reporters he was happy to learn of Davis’ decision to stay in the 1st District.

“We’ll expose Don,” Hanig said. “What he is and what he says he is are two totally different things.”

Hanig must first get through a crowded GOP primary that so far includes Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson, Lenoir County Commissioner Eric Rouse, attorney Ashley Nicole Russell, and Carteret County Sheriff Asa Buck.

Thirteen people submitted paperwork to run for Congress on Monday, including GOP incumbents Chuck Edwards and Richard Hudson and Democratic Rep. Val Foushee.

Foushee, who is in a deep blue district, said she’s optimistic about Democrats’ chances next year and hopes the party adopts an affordability-centric message. “For Democrats, we should be most focused on healthcare and returning jobs,” she said.

Hudson, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee, said he’s hopeful voters will reward Republicans for their legislative agenda, which includes the One Big Beautiful Bill tax and spending law.

“The American people in the last election returned Donald Trump to the White House with a very specific agenda, and the Congress has delivered on that agenda,” Hudson said. “So I believe the people are going to reward Republicans.”

Edwards is the lone Republican seen as potentially vulnerable. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report ranks Edwards’ district as Likely Republican. Democrats hope voters in Western North Carolina will want a change in congressional leadership over what they see as a slow federal response to Hurricane Helene.

Edwards said he’s pleased more funds have been approved for North Carolina recently, including $155 million in FEMA grants for infrastructure repairs, but has found himself frustrated over the past year over local governments waiting on reimbursements to be approved.

“It’s inaccurate to say that the recovery has been slower than expected,” Edwards said. “The thing that has been slower than expected is the reimbursement to local governments for the investment that they’ve made in the recovery. The recovery continues to operate at breakneck speed.”

Jamie Ager, a farmer and CEO of Hickory Nut Gap Farms in Fairview, is running in the Democratic primary in hopes of challenging Edwards. He said he respects Edwards’ business experience and accessibility to constituents but feels he’s fallen short on supporting recovery efforts.

“He’s not represented our district and gotten the money from Hurricane Helene that we need to get our feet back under us,” Ager said. “He’s been tone deaf to the frustrations around Helene and to just how much the cost of living is. He doesn’t understand the district.”

Legislative Angling

The showdown is officially on between Republican Senate leader Phil Berger and Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page. Both filed paperwork for what is likely to be the most consequential and intriguing primary race in the state.

In a twist, Democratic Sen. Dan Blue of Wake County also filed for reelection. Blue’s colleagues ousted him from leadership earlier this year, and Blue told me the 2025-2026 legislative session would be his last.

He’s had a change of heart, though. Blue was the most conservative-voting Democrat in his chamber, siding with the GOP on 69% of votes this year. By comparison, new Democratic leader Sydney Batch has voted with the majority 62% of the time. If Democrats break the GOP supermajority in the Senate next year, Blue could become a key swing vote and thorn in the side of the new Democratic caucus leadership.

One other filer of note: Sen. Norman Sanderson of Pamlico County was arrested earlier this year for a DWI and has since apologized to his constituents. He filed Monday to seek reelection.

So far, seven incumbents have primary challengers:

Page aims to unseat Berger, the state’s top Republican.

Harnett County Commissioner William Morris is challenging Republican Rep. Joe Pike.

Holly Ridge Mayor Pro-Tem Joshua Patti is running against Republican Rep. Carson Smith of Pender County.

Former Democratic Rep. Michael Wray will have a rematch with Rep. Rodney Pierce of Halifax County (in the closest legislative primary last year, Pierce defeated Wray by 34 votes, or 0.3 percentage points).

Armstrong Farms manager Darren Armstrong is running against Republican Rep. Keith Kidwell of Beaufort County.

Democratic Rep. Amanda Cook, who was recently tapped to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Cecil Brockman of Guilford County, has a contested primary that so far includes Angie Williams-McMichael of High Point and Joe Alston, a former executive director of the NC NAACP.

Caroline Eason of Lawndale is looking to unseat Republican Rep. Kelly Hastings of Gaston County.

Random Tidbits:

Don Brown, a staunch vaccine critic, and Elizabeth Temple, a former substitute teacher who was accused of making offensive comments to elementary school students, filed for the U.S. Senate primary against Republican Michael Whatley (who hasn’t submitted paperwork yet).

While he may not have a good chance at winning in a strong Republican seat, he was hands-down the tallest candidate I’ve ever seen: At 6 feet, 9.5 inches, Democrat Harry Morley is looking to upset Republican Rep. Pat Harrigan in the 10th Congressional District.

For a moment, the North Carolina State Board of Elections listed Rep. Ray Pickett as a primary challenger to House Speaker Destin Hall. The error was quickly corrected. (They both represent parts of Watauga County.)

Full text of the letter is available by clicking here and below:

Dear Lieutenant General Graham,

We write to respectfully request a 45-day extension of the public comment period for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) regarding operations of the Detroit Dam within Oregon’s Willamette Valley System. The draft SEIS was released on November 14, with the comment period closing on December 29. We urge the Corps to provide a longer and more accessible comment window that will allow meaningful and informed public engagement on this highly impactful document.

The SEIS is both lengthy and technically complex, addressing issues that directly affect drinking water quality, economic stability, and public health across several communities in the Santiam Canyon and Willamette Valley. Recent experience with deep drawdown operations, including those at Green Peter Reservoir, have revealed the potential for extensive turbidity, severe impacts to drinking water systems, and significant economic losses for surrounding communities. These concerns underscore the importance of ensuring that residents, local governments, Tribal governments, utility providers, business owners, and other stakeholders have sufficient time to review and respond to this SEIS.

While a 45-day comment period is already a relatively short timeline for a document like this, the currently scheduled comment window also spans the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Hanukkah, among others. These weeks are among the most challenging of the year for public participation, as reduced staffing, competing obligations, and widespread travel mean most Oregonians are far more concerned about weather delays and family recipes than comment periods. The combined effect of a shortened timeline and a holiday-dominated review period will significantly hinder the ability of Oregonians to provide thoughtful and informed feedback.

Given the anticipated impacts of potential operational changes at Detroit Dam, including those related to drinking water for more than 200,000 downstream residents, the Kokanee fishery, and economic conditions in the Santiam Canyon, it is essential that the review process maximize transparency and accessibility. A reasonable extension of the comment period would help accomplish this goal and ensure that the Corps receives the robust, substantive input needed to support a well-informed decision.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the USACE extend the comment period by an additional 45-days to provide stakeholders with adequate time to fully assess the SEIS and prepare comprehensive comments. We believe this extension is both necessary and in the public Interest.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to continued collaboration to ensure that the management of the Willamette Valley System supports the recovery of endangered fish species while also meeting the needs, safety, and well-being of Oregonians and the communities they call home.",https://www.merkley.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Press-Release-Photo-3.jpeg,N,,2025-12-02 18:03:13.148770

In November 2024, the 2023-vintage welcomed California State Teachers’ Retirement System as its institutional anchor and Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund as its corporate anchor.

Environment Agency Pension Fund investment manager Becky LeAnstey said in a statement: “Climate and nature are inextricably linked. We are excited to partner with Just Climate who not only recognize this but understand the investment opportunities that arise when you protect and enhance nature.”

Just Climate has not disclosed a fundraising target for the vehicle.

The fund pursues a strategy of investing in natural climate solutions associated with food and agriculture.

“Through its investments, the strategy aims to drive transformation in the land use, water and waste sectors to achieve global net-zero and nature positive goals,” added the statement.

Just Climate has also invested in AgroStar, an Indian platform that helps smallholder farmers improve their income and sustainability through climate-resilient practices and products.

Natural Climate Solutions made its debut investments at the start of 2025, as it backed British biodiversity monitoring company NatureMetrics and GreenLight Biosciences, a developer of next generation biosolutions for agriculture.

Just Climate senior partner Clara Barby, added: “We are proud to welcome a diverse group of partners who share our conviction that investing in the land transition is essential to building a sustainable economy.

“Together, we can scale solutions that deliver measurable impact for climate, biodiversity and people. With initiatives like our investment in AgroStar, we are demonstrating how nature-based solutions can drive climate-resilient growth in India and other emerging markets.”",https://media.agriinvestor.com/uploads/2024/02/Soil-carbon_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 13:02:18.266566

A third plant in St. Charles Parish slated to help meet the tech company's energy needs is currently awaiting permits, said Brandon Scardigli, a spokesperson for Entergy Louisiana.
Entergy officials stress that the plants will benefit all utility customers because of Meta's contributions to the infrastructure.
Meta's data center in Richland Parish and the nearby plants are located in one of the poorest regions of the state.
Proponents of the facility highlight the opportunity for economic development, including 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs once the data center is complete.","Entergy broke ground Monday on a pair of new electricity plants being built to power Meta's massive AI data center in northeast Louisiana, part of the utility's plan to roll out billions of dollars in new infrastructure for the tech company's historically large project.

The gas-fired plants located near the data center will deliver around 1500 megawatts of power and will begin generating in 2028. A third plant in St. Charles Parish slated to help meet the tech company's energy needs is currently awaiting permits, said Brandon Scardigli, a spokesperson for Entergy Louisiana.

The utility is constructing other resources for Meta as well, including substations and transmission lines, totaling more than $5 billion in new infrastructure.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, president and CEO of Entergy, the state's largest utility.

But while Entergy has described the project as beneficial to ratepayers since much of the new infrastructure will be paid for by Meta, it has come under sharp criticism from environmental groups, consumer advocacy organization and other large industries. Criticism includes concerns that other ratepayers will have to cover project costs and whether the data center's large power demands will affect grid reliability.

Meta’s data center will need roughly three times the amount of electricity that the city of New Orleans uses in a year and increase Entergy's electric needs in the state by around 30%.

Savings?

Entergy officials stress that the plants will benefit all utility customers because of Meta's contributions to the infrastructure. The tech company will pay for all costs of the new generators over a 15-year contract, as well as storm recovery costs, leading to a projected $650 million in customer savings, according to the utility.

But both environmental advocacy and oil, gas and petrochemical companies disputed Entergy's plan to build the new infrastructure, arguing over the months-long regulation process that the plan risked increased bills for all types of customers.

Of particular concern to opponents is the plants' lifespan of up to 40 years compared to Meta's contract of 15, which could potentially leave other ratepayers on the hook if the tech company leaves. All customers will also pay for a $550 million transmission line.

Environmental and consumer advocacy groups opposing the plan have also warned of grid reliability and environmental risks of the new fossil fuel-powered plants, which will produce pollution and climate-warming emissions.

Entergy, meanwhile, says the new generation added to the system will be ""among the most efficient in the state"" and provide long-term reliability benefits to customers. Meta is also planning to build 1500 megawatts of solar power in Louisiana through its deal with Entergy.

The utility also argues that the relatively newer plants will be able to serve all customers if Meta leaves, allowing them to retire older facilities after the 15-year deal.

Meta's data center in Richland Parish and the nearby plants are located in one of the poorest regions of the state. Proponents of the facility highlight the opportunity for economic development, including 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs once the data center is complete.

With just over 11 months to go, all signs point to a favorable environment for Democrats. If the elections were held today, it’s a good bet that they would win back the House of Representatives, as they did the last time Trump was president. They may even flip one or two governor’s seats and a handful of state-legislative chambers.

Currently, however, it’s unclear just how strong a national environment they will enjoy next year, and whether it will be capable of lifting candidates in places that voted for Trump by significant margins in 2024. So today, we’ll take a look at where things stand across several key metrics and determine what we can glean from the data we have.

The 2025 Election Results

One sign of very real optimism for Democrats is the party’s performance in last month’s elections—specifically, in the races for New Jersey and Virginia governor. Yes, both states have voted blue at the top of the ticket for the better part of at least the last decade-and-a-half. But it was the fashion in which Democrats won that impressed:

In both contests, the Democratic candidates won by double digits;

They outperformed the party’s past nominees in both places dating back to 1993 in New Jersey and 1965 in Virginia, and their approximately nine-point over-performance of Kamala Harris was a stronger showing than Democrats enjoyed in 2017 versus Hillary Clinton in these states;

Turnout in each state also surpassed levels seen in the 2022 midterm election, a sign of very real enthusiasm among Democratic voters; and

Especially important: there is evidence in both the exit polls and post-election polling that the Democratic gubernatorial candidates won back small but meaningful shares of 2024 Trump voters.

It’s difficult to extrapolate from these results as we look forward to 2026 to guess what the national House popular vote margin might look like. In 2017, Democrats won the Virginia governor race by nine points and the New Jersey race by 13.5, but the following year they won the House popular vote by a smaller 8.4 points. However, the fact that Democrats’ margins in this year’s contests were larger than they were in 2017 portends a national environment that may well be at least as favorable as the one they experienced in 2018.

Special Elections

Perhaps the most hopeful sign for Democrats right now is their performance in special elections. According to data from election analyst Nathaniel Rakich, the median swing in states and districts with special elections this cycle (relative to the partisan baseline of those places) has been 11 points toward Democrats. In the Trump era, that is the largest swing for either party.

As the above chart shows, Democrats in the Trump era have routinely had an edge in these off-year elections, and yet that has not always translated to success in the subsequent general election. However, the last time the party came close to their current 11-point median swing was a nine-point margin in 2018—when, like now, they were the out-party looking to bounce back in a midterm at a time when Trump was president. Coupled with this year’s election results, this is a signal that Democrats are likely heading into a “blue wave” type of environment next year.

The Generic Ballot

Perhaps the best tool available for gauging how the country is thinking about the midterms outside of actual election results is the generic congressional ballot (or GCB), a poll question asking which party Americans want to see control Congress in the upcoming election. As we have previously noted, these polls in recent midterm cycles have been predictive—as far as 18 months out—of not just which party is likely to have the advantage in the upcoming elections but sometimes even what their margin in the national House popular vote will be.

According to two different trackers, at the time of this year’s November elections the GCB was around three points in favor of Democrats (and their candidates in the most high-profile races far exceeded that). Since then, it has ticked up by a point or two. In another poll conducted by

, likely voters were pushed to pick one party or the other and gave Democrats a 7.6-point edge (53.8 to 46.2).

By comparison, though, around the same time in the 2018 cycle, the GCB already showed an 8.9-point advantage for Democrats. Moreover, the final margin that cycle indeed ended up being an almost identical 8.6 points. So, currently, even in their best-case scenario, Democrats are underperforming relative to their last big midterm as the out-party.

All this also suggests that the GCB has been a better predictor of the midterm picture than the 2025 elections or special elections that precede it. One of these two metrics will have to give come next November. It’s possible the Democrats’ advantages in the GCB will improve before then to match their other performances. But there is a world of difference between a national environment that mirrors this year’s (~D+15) or even 2018’s (D+8.6) versus one that is only D+4.

Trump’s Approval Rating

A quick reminder of how a president’s approval rating affects their party’s midterm prospects:

[One] strong historical predictor of midterm results is the approval rating of the incumbent president, which correlates highly with their party’s seat loss in the House. The only presidents in the polling era whose parties experienced a net seat gain in a midterm election (Bill Clinton and George W. Bush) enjoyed approval ratings north of 60 percent (66 percent and 63 percent, respectively). But even a strong approval rating doesn’t guarantee success for a president’s party. […]

In his first term, Trump’s Republicans lost 42 House seats. Given the more constricted House map this time around, it’s very unlikely his party’s losses will be that deep next year, no matter his personal standing. However, a low approval won’t do them any favors…

Indeed, one phenomenon that has remained consistent in politics for decades: a poor approval rating for the president virtually guarantees his party will lose seats.

After a relatively stable period stretching from the beginning of July to mid-October, President Trump’s net approval rating has taken a hit, dropping from -7.6 percent on October 20 to -14.7 as of last week (though it has ticked back up slightly to -13.1 this week). This trend is evident at the issue level as well. On his best issue, immigration, Trump had been holding steady for much of the July to October period, with a net approval rating of around -3 percent. Over the past month, however, that dropped to -8.1 percent, the worst standing of his second term. He is in even worse shape on the economy, as his approval ratings on trade (-17.8), the economy (-21), and especially inflation (-34.1) have all slid.

It is possible that Trump, who has defied political gravity time and again, is now being weighed down by the six-year itch.

Perceptions of the Economy

Much like presidential approval, the state of the economy can have a strong influence on election outcomes. A robust economy isn’t always a guarantee of success for the incumbent party, but a bad one—or at least one that voters believe is bad—almost always creates an unfavorable national environment for them. The problem for Trump and the Republicans is that there are few signs that any metric is better today than it was back in 2018, when they got shellacked, while several key things are worse.

On the surface, the economy today looks somewhat similar to that of 2018. Inflation has come down from its recent surge to just three percent today, though this is still higher than it was seven years ago (2.5). The unemployment rate is around 4.4 percent, up a bit from seven years ago (3.8 percent) but not terribly alarming.

The problem for Republicans, however, is that many voters still do not feel as though things have gotten better under their leadership, and many are worried about the future. According to the University of Michigan, the current consumer sentiment index, which gauges how consumers feel about the state of the economy, is just 53.6. For comparison, that figure was 98.6 in the run-up to the 2018 midterms.

We can see a similar story in a recent (and brutal) Fox News poll. Among the results:

Three-quarters (76 percent) of voters said that economic conditions today are either “only fair” (34 percent) or “poor” (42 percent, a plurality);

A strong plurality (46 percent) said they had been “harmed” by the economic policies of the Trump administration (for context, no more than 43 percent ever said the same about President Biden’s policies in Fox’s polling);

Sixty-two percent blamed Trump rather than Biden (32 percent) for current economic conditions;

A majority (52 percent) said inflation is “not at all” under control;

Majorities said their costs have gone up since one year ago for groceries (85 percent agreed), utilities (78 percent), healthcare (67 percent), housing (66 percent), and gas (54 percent); and

Perhaps worst of all for Republicans: 53 percent of respondents in the poll said they think Democrats have a better plan for making things more affordable than does the GOP (43 percent).

In a September CBS poll, the top words Americans gave to describe the country’s economy were “uncertain” (61 percent) and “struggling” (54 percent). Sixty-seven percent expected prices to go up in the coming months.

These poor economic perceptions have already hurt Republicans in one election. As we discussed in our post-election analysis last month, voters in places like Virginia who believed the economy was not in good shape voted overwhelmingly Democratic. And as we established above, many are souring on Trump’s handling of the economy. According to Nate Silver’s latest aggregates, the president’s net approval on inflation, specifically, is deeply underwater, with just 31.3 percent of Americans approving against fully 65.4 percent disapproving.

If things don’t improve between now and next November, Republicans will likely be in for a world of hurt.

Issue Trust

One of the most important predictors of Trump’s success in last year’s election came in pre-election polling from Gallup, which found that voters saw Republicans as the party “better able to handle the most important problem” facing America. Gallup considered this question to have a strong relationship to past presidential election outcomes—and it turned out to be prescient.

Fast-forward one year and that same indicator has now flipped. Whereas voters before the last election trusted Republicans over Democrats by a margin of 50 to 44 to handle the top issue, they now trust Democrats by four points, 47 to 43.

Polls from David Shor and The Argument have shown a similar reversal in the Democrats’ fortunes. According to the Argument’s Lakshya Jain:

We asked voters about their top two issues and, unsurprisingly, 60 percent of voters ranked “cost of living” as a top-two issue in our survey. But despite Trump’s tariff policy and the continuing frustration with high grocery and consumer-goods prices, Democrats won these cost-of-living voters by just under half a percentage point in our survey.

However, he adds:

Those numbers aren’t good for Republicans, but they’re a lot better than Trump’s nightmarish approvals on those issues are… This suggests that Democrats face real trust problems on the economy that haven’t really gone away yet, despite voters giving Trump exceptionally poor marks for his economic stewardship.

A year from now, Democrats may have a more robust trust advantage over the Republicans on handling the economy, but they still have work to do to restore that trust following four years in with which many voters were left feeling completely dissatisfied with the party’s leadership on this issue.

Overall, the picture looks promising for Democrats ahead of next year. However, we want to end with an obligatory note of caution, specifically, regarding the Senate. In a world in which the national environment mirrors 2018, Democrats can expect to successfully defend all of their Senate seats and likely flip two of Republicans’: Maine and North Carolina. But beyond those, they will be forced to win seats in states that voted for Trump by at least 11 points last year, such as Iowa, Ohio, and Texas. And that means the party will need an even stronger national environment than they had in 2018 to win back the majority.

Jain put together a helpful graphic showing what the outcomes in these types of Senate races would look like if Democrats merely repeat their last “wave” performance:

This is why we at TLP write so often about the need for Democrats to address their structural issues. Winning big in midterm and other off-year elections delivers real benefits for the party—namely, they gain power and subsequently get to wield it. But three of the most important institutions in American politics—the presidency, Senate, and Supreme Court—will become harder to capture over time if they can’t address their longstanding weaknesses and become more competitive in right-leaning places.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yatA!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325a1150-6c29-4557-87d4-e20553adb502_1024x683.jpeg",N,,2025-12-02 12:03:07.338085

Key senators on permitting, like Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), have made similar demands in response to the Trump administration’s attack on renewable energy projects.
“Senators don’t spend a lot of time negotiating with the House; they negotiate with the White House,” Golden said.","Maine Blue Dog Democrat Jared Golden is chasing the permitting white whale during his last year in the House, but he doesn’t seem to care if many other Democrats join him.

Golden is the primary co-sponsor of the “Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act,” H.R. 4776 from Natural Resources Chair Bruce Westerman (R-Ark.), which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act review process, including enacting new litigation limits. It could reach the House floor as soon as next week.

But Golden is not necessarily working on convincing lawmakers to his left about the legislation’s merits. In fact, Golden says, he was at times willing to be even more aggressive than Westerman.

Advertisement

It’s that independent streak that has defined his time in the House and helped him secure reelection in a swing district — and that is contributing to his planned departure.

Golden said he would support immediately “deeming projects approved if the government can’t get their ducks in a row in a certain amount of time.”

“I’d rather put the impetus on the government — if you can’t do it in like two years or whatever it is, you move forward,” said the fourth-term lawmaker.

Such thinking has separated Golden from most other Democrats, who want to either preserve NEPA scrutiny of projects or only make modest changes. Golden is not spending too much time on them.

Rep. Adam Gray of California, also a member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition, was the only other Democrat who voted for the “SPEED Act” in committee during a markup last month. Outside Natural Resources, the bill has a handful of other moderate Democratic co-sponsors.

The day before the markup, wearing blue jeans, a blue flannel shirt and work boots, Golden came across more like a frustrated apolitical outdoorsman than a congressional dealmaker.

Indeed, the 43-year-old Marine veteran’s frustration with Capitol Hill prompted his decision to retire, writing, “Simply put, what I could accomplish in this increasingly unproductive Congress pales in comparison to what I could do in that time as a husband, a father and a son.”

Looking ahead at his last year at the Capitol, Golden offered light scorn for just about everyone, from his fellow Democrats who he says don’t understand the NEPA bill to Republican strategists who don’t seem to want Democrats to support the legislation anyway.

“I want to see something get done,” he said. “So I’m going to ignore their political desires and think more about how do we show momentum in the Senate.”

Westerman wants a vote on the NEPA bill before the end of the year. He can probably make it pass the Republican-controlled House with ease. The big negotiations, Golden says, will be in the Senate, where legislation needs a filibuster-proof majority.

“Westerman knows that his bill is not going to become law without working with Democrats, but they’re also not going to negotiate if they feel like Democrats aren’t sincere in wanting to get to ‘yes,'” Golden said.

Golden did help negotiate a bipartisan amendment — passed during the markup — to prevent the president from canceling permitted projects.

Key senators on permitting, like Environment and Public Works ranking member Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), have made similar demands in response to the Trump administration’s attack on renewable energy projects.

Still, many Natural Resources Committee Democrats wanted more guarantees for renewable energy. Some call the legislation a giveaway to fossil fuels. Members like Democrat Scott Peters of California have been working on finding compromise between both camps.

Golden says he’s “not hostile” to renewable energy but thinks some Democrats tend to ignore the fine print, pointing to offshore wind projects’ impacts on fishermen, which he called the “lifeblood of the entire coastline.” He also has concerns about Maine’s rush to build commercial solar energy, including ramifications for farmland.

There could be changes to the legislation when it hits the House floor. But those amendments would probably not be favorable to Democrats.

Golden said that “based on some conversations I’ve had,” Republican leaders will “probably try and pull the bill right.” “Maybe Bruce convinces them not to do that,” Golden said, referring to Westerman.

“I’m usually of the mind, on any given issue, half the people that are toeing the party line in either party, it’s actually not what they fully believe,” Golden said. “If you could remove all the various political pressures, they would be closer to where my head is at.”

Golden said he hasn’t talked about the NEPA bill with the top Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, ranking member Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.

“Senators don’t spend a lot of time negotiating with the House; they negotiate with the White House,” Golden said.

House Natural Resources ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), a progressive, is often on the opposite side of Golden on many energy and environmental issues, but Huffman says the lines of communication are open.

“Obviously Jared Golden and I have different politics. But I have appreciated him as a straight shooter. He doesn’t blindside you. He communicates with me and my staff in a way I appreciate, and that doesn’t always happen,” said Huffman.

Members on both sides — including Huffman — insist they’re open to a broad, bipartisan deal on permitting. They’ve been saying that for years now.

“The R’s are going to have to decide if they want to take credit for getting something done,” Golden said. “And the Dems will have to decide if they want a share of that. Or if it’s just going to be like, ‘Oh no, we’re going to win the House in ’26 and the White House in ’28. But, oh shit, the margins are tight.‘”

Golden added, “You could see how in another world we’re just like sitting here having this conversation in 2030.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/94/33/f3b6d128482eae05de37e0ffcd38/u-s-congress-41832.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 10:02:42.734607

The U.S., the world’s top LNG exporter, shipped 10.9 million metric tonnes last month, up from 10.1 mmt in October despite having one fewer day in the month, according to LSEG data.

Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. LNG exporter, boosted shipments to 4.6 mmt from its two Texas plants, compared with 4.1 mmt in October. Venture Global LNG, the second-largest exporter, held steady at 3 mmt in November, LSEG ship-tracking data showed.

LNG plants typically operate more efficiently in cooler conditions. Average temperatures along the Gulf Coast were about 8 degrees Fahrenheit lower in November than in October, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.

Surging LNG exports pushed U.S. natural gas demand for liquefaction to a record 18 billion cubic feet per day in November. Daily demand topped 19 bcfd for the first time last week. Henry Hub gas prices averaged $4.47 per mmBtu in November, up from $3.36 in October.

EUROPE REMAINS KEY MARKET

Europe received 70% of U.S. LNG exports in November, or 7.5 mmt, up from 69% in October. Turkey emerged as a major buyer, taking 12 cargoes totaling 0.9 mmt, compared with just one cargo in October.

Exports to Asia fell to 1.75 mmt, or 16% of the total, from 1.96 mmt in October, as spot demand in Northeast Asia remained weak. Latin America received 0.66 mmt, slightly higher than October, while Egypt bought 0.84 mmt amid domestic supply challenges.

European benchmark Dutch Title Transfer Facility prices averaged $10.40 per million British thermal units in November, down from $10.88 in October. The Japan Korea Marker averaged $11.25, up from $11.11.

“The arbitrage opportunity for U.S. LNG cargoes to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope remains shut, which will lead to a continued influx of flexible U.S. cargoes into Northwest Europe,” LSEG said in a note.

“This project is a huge win for Randolph County and North Carolina,” said N.C.
“Environmental Air Systems’ expansion will create high-quality, skilled trade jobs right here in Randolph County and ensure our state remains a top destination for innovative manufacturing.","North Carolina Governor Josh Stein announced that Environmental Air Systems, LLC, a leading volumetric modular manufacturer of HVAC infrastructure, will create 300 jobs in Randolph County. The company will invest approximately $20 million to establish a new sub-assembly production operation in Asheboro.

“North Carolina continues to be a leader in advanced manufacturing, and Environmental Air Systems’ expansion to Randolph County reflects the strength and talent of our workforce,” said Governor Josh Stein. “This project will create hundreds of new jobs, support local families, and strengthen our state’s role in innovative industrial solutions.”

Environmental Air Systems (EAS), a subsidiary of Comfort Systems USA, Inc., will expand its operations to meet growing demand for specialized prefabricated equipment for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems in critical facilities. Operating in the Triad region of the state since 1953, the company’s new facility will produce sub-assemblies for industries including mission-critical, pharmaceutical, data center, semiconductor, and healthcare. The site will be 300,000 square feet of manufacturing space to serve both regional and national markets.

“EAS is proud to announce the continued expansion of our operations in North Carolina,” said Allen Absher, President of EAS - Manufacturing. “For over 70 years, we have been a dedicated part of the business community in this state and are fortunate to be in a position to generate more local employment opportunities. EAS is steadfast in its commitment to provide our customers with state-of-the-art, complex projects and to build an enduring legacy for our employees.”

“EAS’s decision to expand into Asheboro demonstrates the growing demand for North Carolina’s skilled workforce and business-friendly environment,” said North Carolina Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley. “This project will drive economic growth and enhance our state’s competitiveness in advanced modular manufacturing.”

These new jobs could create a potential annual payroll impact of more than $16.5 million for the local economy.

Environmental Air Systems’ expansion in North Carolina will be facilitated, in part, by a Job Development Investment Grant (JDIG) approved by the state’s Economic Investment Committee earlier today. Over the course of the 12-year term of this grant, the project is estimated to grow the state’s economy by $732 million. Using a formula that takes into account the new tax revenues generated by the new jobs and capital investment, the JDIG agreement authorizes the potential reimbursement to the company of up to $3,289,000, spread over 12 years. State payments occur only following performance verification by the departments of Commerce and Revenue that the company has met its incremental job creation and investment targets.

“This project is a huge win for Randolph County and North Carolina,” said N.C. Senator Dave Craven. “Environmental Air Systems’ expansion will create high-quality, skilled trade jobs right here in Randolph County and ensure our state remains a top destination for innovative manufacturing. Our local high schools and community colleges are already well-equipped to train the next generation of EAS employees, providing those students a clear pathway for success and future employment.”

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work.
The post The EV Truck Reality Check and Why Edison Motors’ Hybrid Might Be What Actually Works appeared first on FreightWaves.","I’m a diesel guy. Specifically, I’m a CAT guy. That’s not nostalgia talking or resistance to change, it’s 25-plus years of experience knowing what keeps trucks moving and freight delivered when conditions get ugly. Diesel has always given me peace of mind because it works. You can find fuel anywhere. The technology is proven. When something breaks, mechanics know how to fix it. In an industry where downtime means lost revenue and missed commitments, that reliability isn’t optional.

So when the EV conversation started dominating trucking discussions, my initial reaction was skepticism bordering on dismissal. Battery-electric trucks looked like solutions engineered by people who’d never operated in conditions where equipment failure has real consequences. The range limitations, charging infrastructure gaps, and operational disruptions seemed like deal-breakers that no amount of government subsidies or manufacturer marketing could overcome.

Then I started paying attention to what Edison Motors was building in British Columbia, and I realized something important: EVs can work in trucking if you actually engineer them for how trucking operates, rather than forcing trucking to adapt to technology limitations.

But before we get to Edison, let’s talk about why the Trump administration just pulled EV tax credits for commercial trucks. It’s not some political statement or shift in environmental priorities, it’s an acknowledgment of reality. America isn’t ready for wholesale adoption of electric trucks because we never did the planning and infrastructure work necessary to make it viable.

The UK’s relative success with commercial EVs didn’t happen by accident. They coordinated between government, utilities, fleet operators, and charging infrastructure providers before pushing mandates. They built charging networks that match operational needs. They focused deployment in applications where current technology actually works, shorter hauls, predictable routes, and operations that return to base for overnight charging. They planned the rollout based on what the technology could do rather than what they wished it could do.

The United States took the opposite approach. Throw tax credits at manufacturers, announce ambitious electrification targets, mandate technology adoption timelines, and assume infrastructure and economics will somehow sort themselves out. It’s the regulatory equivalent of throwing EVs at the wall to see what sticks, and, surprise, most of it didn’t stick.

The infrastructure problem is fundamental. Charging a passenger EV at home overnight is one thing. Charging Class 8 trucks that need megawatt-level power to recharge massive battery banks in timeframes that don’t obliterate productivity is something else entirely. The US doesn’t have that infrastructure. Building it requires grid upgrades, utility coordination, real estate acquisition, and capital investment measured in billions. Nobody figured out how to fund that at scale, so we’re left with announced initiatives, pilot programs, and scattered charging stations that don’t add up to functional networks.

Ford just announced an electric truck for the European market in 2026 with a 186-mile range. For UK operations where you can cover the entire country in a day and the charging infrastructure is relatively dense, that may work. Drop that same truck into American long-haul operations, and it’s useless. The geography doesn’t match, the infrastructure doesn’t exist, and the operational economics don’t work when you’re stopping for multi-hour charging sessions that turn a 10-hour driving day into a 15-hour ordeal with no additional revenue.

Range anxiety isn’t just about miles, it’s about operational flexibility and peace of mind. With diesel, if you need to adjust your route for traffic, weather, or a last-minute load change, you do it. If you’re running low on fuel, you pull into any of the thousands of truck stops and refuel in 15 minutes. That flexibility is what makes trucking work. Battery-electric trucks with fixed range and dependency on sparse charging infrastructure eliminate that flexibility. You’re locked into planned routes with no room for adjustment, and if something goes wrong, you could be stranded waiting for a tow or an hours-long charging session.

For someone whose career has depended on CAT diesels that work in conditions where failure means you’re stuck until a mechanic can reach you, which might be hours or days depending on where you broke down, the idea of voluntarily introducing that kind of vulnerability through technological limitations makes no sense. Diesel works because it’s proven, reliable, and supported by infrastructure that exists everywhere trucks operate.

But Edison Motors changed my thinking on whether EVs can work in trucking, because they approached the problem differently than everyone else.

Edison emerged from logging operations in British Columbia. If you know anything about logging, you know it’s an environment where equipment either works or you’re in serious trouble. You’re operating in remote areas, harsh weather, demanding terrain, and conditions where breakdowns can strand you far from help. Chase Barber and his partners weren’t building trucks to meet regulatory requirements or chase government subsidies, they were solving problems they faced daily running equipment in some of the most unforgiving conditions imaginable.

When they looked at available EV options, they saw the same problems every trucker faces: range limitations, reliance on charging infrastructure, and operational disruptions that make battery-electric trucks impractical for how trucking actually works. So instead of trying to force diesel operations into EV constraints, they built hybrid technology that captures EV benefits while eliminating the problems that make pure battery-electric trucks non-starters.

Edison’s trucks feature electric drivetrains with onboard CAT diesel generators that continuously recharge the system. It’s basically a diesel-electric locomotive concept adapted for highway trucking. The electric motors provide instant torque, regenerative braking, and reduced maintenance on brake systems and transmissions. But the onboard generator eliminates range anxiety, charging infrastructure dependency, and the operational flexibility problems that plague pure battery-electric designs.

Here’s what makes this brilliant for someone who trusts diesel: you get the efficiency and performance benefits of electric drive without giving up the reliability and infrastructure compatibility that makes diesel work. You’re not dependent on charging stations that may or may not exist where you need them. You’re not locked into a fixed range with no flexibility. You maintain an unlimited range as long as you can find diesel fuel, which is everywhere. And you’re using proven CAT generator technology rather than betting operations on battery systems that are still evolving.

The peace-of-mind factor is huge. With Edison’s hybrid approach, you can adjust your route or extend your day. If you’re in an area without charging infrastructure, which is most of America, you’re fine. If something goes wrong with the electrical system, you’ve got a diesel generator that can get you to a repair shop rather than being stranded waiting for a specialized EV technician.

Edison just received Canadian regulatory approval to manufacture and sell these hybrid heavy-duty trucks commercially. That’s an actual production vehicle competing in the real market. The approval validates that hybrid approaches can meet safety and emissions standards while addressing operational realities that pure battery-electric solutions ignore.

The fact that this innovation came from a small company emerging from logging operations rather than from major manufacturers or government programs tells you something important about where practical solutions come from. Legacy manufacturers built EVs around battery technology that doesn’t meet operational requirements, then expected infrastructure and regulations to catch up. Government mandates pushed carriers toward technology that doesn’t work for their business models. Meanwhile, Edison listened to what truckers actually need and built solutions that address real-world problems.

This pattern keeps repeating. When FMCSA couldn’t build practical tools to combat chameleon carriers, private companies like Freight Validate and Genlogs stepped in with solutions that work. When legacy systems couldn’t keep pace with technological change, startups built better platforms. When manufacturers focused on removing drivers through automation, Edison focused on giving drivers better tools to be more productive.

The UK’s EV success stems from matching technology to operational environments. Shorter distances, denser infrastructure, coordinated planning, and fleet operations aligned with current EV capabilities created conditions in which the technology could succeed. The US has none of those advantages for long-haul trucking, which moves most freight across the country. We needed better planning, more infrastructure investment, and technology that fits American trucking’s operational realities before pushing aggressive electrification timelines.

The Trump administration’s pulling EV tax credits acknowledges what should have been obvious from the start, we’re not ready. The infrastructure isn’t there. The technology doesn’t match how American trucking operates. And throwing subsidies at the problem without addressing fundamental operational and infrastructure gaps was never going to work.

But that doesn’t mean electric trucks can’t work in trucking. Edison’s success in some of the most demanding conditions imaginable, logging operations in BC’s interior, where equipment failure isn’t an inconvenience, it’s a crisis, proves that EVs can work if you engineer them right. The key is to build around operational realities rather than forcing operations to adapt to technological limitations.

For me, diesel will always be what I know and trust. CAT 3406s have kept me moving and freight delivered through conditions that would have killed lesser equipment. That reliability and peace of mind aren’t something you give up lightly. If Edison Motors has taught me anything, it’s that EV technology can work even in the woods of British Columbia if you approach it with practical engineering rather than regulatory fantasy.

The hybrid approach makes sense because it doesn’t ask truckers to give up the reliability and flexibility that make diesel work. You keep the infrastructure compatibility, operational flexibility, and the peace of mind that come with proven technology. But you add efficiency benefits, reduced maintenance, and emissions improvements that address legitimate environmental concerns without sacrificing operational viability.

That’s the kind of innovation that deserves attention, not because it’s revolutionary or disruptive or any other marketing buzzword, but because it actually solves problems that matter to people running trucks. It’s technology built by truckers for truckers rather than by regulators and manufacturers who think they know what trucking needs.

Ford’s 186-mile-range European EV might work fine in the UK, where geography, infrastructure, and operational profiles align with its technology capabilities. It won’t work in American long-haul operations, and removing tax credits that were propping up technology adoption before infrastructure and operations were ready is an acknowledgment of that reality.

What we need isn’t more aggressive mandates or bigger subsidies, it’s better planning, infrastructure investment that matches operational needs, and technology designed around how trucking actually works rather than how regulators wish it worked. The UK did that planning. The US didn’t. Edison Motors did that engineering. Most manufacturers didn’t.

I’m still a diesel guy. I trust what I know works. But I’m also paying attention to what Edison is building because they’re approaching the problem the right way, starting with operational needs and working backward to the technology that addresses them. That’s how practical innovation happens, and it’s proof that EVs can work in trucking if you’re willing to engineer solutions grounded in reality rather than regulatory timelines.

If Edison can make electric hybrids work in logging operations in BC, there’s hope that thoughtful engineering can bridge the gap between diesel reliability and electric efficiency. But it requires listening to what truckers actually need rather than telling them what they should want. The removal of EV tax credits might slow down the rush to electrification. Still, if it creates space for practical solutions like Edison’s hybrid approach to develop and prove themselves, that’s probably a better path forward than subsidizing technology that doesn’t work for how American trucking operates.

Sometimes the best innovations come from the people closest to the problems. Edison Motors getting approval to build electric hybrid heavy-duty trucks in Canada might matter more for trucking’s future than anything Ford or Tesla or any other major manufacturer announces, precisely because Edison was built by truckers who understand what actually works when you’re 100 miles from anywhere and your equipment has to perform or you’re in trouble.

That’s the kind of peace of mind I can respect, even from a diesel guy like me.

What is the salary of a renewable energy consultant?

The salary of a renewable energy consultant varies widely and one of the biggest factors is experience. At the early stages, such as internships, student roles or entry-level energy positions, salaries typically sit around £24,000-£30,000. After graduation, junior or early-career consultants usually move into the £28,000-£38,000 range, with roles in major cities such as London tending to offer salaries at the upper end.

As consultants gain more experience and begin managing their own projects, salaries rise accordingly. Mid-level consultants with roughly 3-8 years of experience commonly earn between £37,000 and £53,000, depending on their technical skills and responsibilities. Senior and principal consultants, who may oversee teams, deliver high-level client advice or manage large portfolios, typically fall in the £45,000-£60,000 bracket, with some extending into the £70,000+ range based on the size of the firm and complexity of the work.

At the top end, consultants who move into director-level positions, specialist expert roles or even consultancy ownership often earn £80,000 and above. However, salaries at every stage are strongly influenced by location, employer type and specialism – London markets, large engineering or energy firms and high-demand niches (such as offshore wind or energy storage) generally command higher pay.

Certifications, technical expertise and the scope of responsibilities also accelerate progression and earning potential within the sector.

Leverage your educational background and specialised training to contribute effectively to the goals of your workplace.

What would a typical day look like as a renewable energy consultant?

A typical day for a renewable energy consultant can vary significantly depending on the company and the type of projects they handle. Many consultants split their time between analysing energy data, preparing feasibility studies, developing proposals and meeting with clients to discuss project requirements or sustainability goals. Depending on the role, the day may also include site visits, modelling system performance, coordinating with engineers or project managers and writing reports or recommendations.

Here’s what a day in the life could look like:

8:30 AM – Email & project check-ins

Start the morning by reviewing emails from clients, project teams and equipment suppliers, followed by a quick look at performance dashboards for ongoing solar and wind installations to identify any overnight issues that may need attention.

9:00 AM – Client call: feasibility study review

Meet with a commercial client interested in installing rooftop solar panels, discussing key findings from the feasibility report, including estimated energy output, installation costs, return on investment and available funding incentives, before agreeing on next steps and scheduling site visit dates.

10:15 AM – Data analysis and modelling

Work on modelling the energy output of an off-grid wind-and-solar hybrid system using specialised software, adjusting variables such as wind speeds, panel tilt and storage capacity to optimise overall efficiency.

12:00 PM – Team lunch & knowledge sharing

Share updates with colleagues on new government grants and recent technological advancements in energy-storage systems, helping the whole consultancy stay informed and up to date through ongoing collaboration.

1:00 PM – Site visit

Drive to a client’s industrial facility to assess layout and shading for a potential renewable integration project, taking measurements, evaluating structural suitability and discussing the client’s energy needs and priorities with their operations manager.

3:30 PM – Reporting & documentation

Back at the office, begin drafting the technical and financial sections of a proposal for the recently visited site, incorporating system diagrams, cost estimates, projected savings and carbon-reduction calculations.

4:45 PM – Internal meeting: troubleshooting

Join a brief meeting with engineers to address underperforming wind turbines at an existing installation, discussing potential causes and planning a remote diagnostics session with the manufacturer.

5:30 PM – End of day

Review tasks for tomorrow, including finalising the proposal, evaluating procurement options for two projects in development and preparing for a stakeholder presentation later in the week.

What role will AI play in renewable energy consulting?

AI is set to revolutionise renewable energy consulting by enabling more efficient, data-driven solutions and strategic decision making. It allows consultants to do tasks with more ease, such as analyse vast datasets, forecast energy demand, optimise clean technology systems and identify inefficiencies. AI also plays a critical role in smart grid integration, risk assessment and project planning, helping professionals deliver precise and actionable guidance to governments and organisations. By automating routine tasks, AI frees consultants to focus on innovation and developing sustainable solutions that create tangible value. For those looking to deepen their expertise, the Renewable Energy Institute offers the Artificial Intelligence for Renewable Energy course, which explores the integration of AI and renewable energy technologies, equipping professionals to address global energy transition challenges effectively.

How to hire a renewable energy consultant

Hiring a renewable energy consultant begins with clearly defining your organisation’s goals, as understanding your needs helps you identify the right expertise. From there, it’s essential to look for consultants with strong qualifications and relevant training. Certifications from recognised institutions, such as the Renewable Energy Institute, demonstrate technical capability and a solid understanding of renewable energy systems.

Experience is another key factor when selecting a consultant. Review the individual’s past experiences to ensure they have worked on projects similar to yours and assess which technologies they specialise in. A reliable consultant should be able to explain their technical approach clearly, outlining how they will analyse your current energy use and develop data-driven recommendations tailored to your organisation.

Finally, gather proposals from multiple consultants to compare scope, methodology and cost. Checking references and evaluating communication style can help you determine whether the consultant will be a good long-term asset. Choose someone who not only delivers technical expertise but also communicates effectively and offers ongoing support and guidance throughout your energy transition journey.",https://www.renewableinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RECEC-WP-Small.png,N,,2025-12-02 10:02:34.393646

Multistate

A multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general succeeded in protecting four federal agencies from elimination by Executive Order. The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted the coalition’s motion for summary judgement, permanently enjoining the dismantling of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS), and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH).

A multistate coalition of 20 attorneys general announced a suit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in response to new restrictions on Continuum of Care grant programs. Those restrictions will reduce the grant funds available for permanent housing and housing continuity programs. The coalition asserts that HUD’s proposed changes are unlawful because HUD did not engage in the appropriate rulemaking procedures and did not receive congressional approval for the changes.

A multistate coalition of 17 attorneys general filed a comment letter with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) opposing a new rule that would relax the gradual phaseout of HFC use created by the AIM Act. The coalition argued that EPA’s new HFC standards would allow industries to reintroduce an extremely powerful greenhouse gas back into the environment.

A coalition of eight attorneys general entered a settlement with Greystar Management after alleging that Greystar used RealPage’s AI software to raise rent prices in violation of antitrust law. The settlement requires Greystar Management to pay $7 million and stop using any third-party algorithmic pricing models.

California

Attorney General Rob Bonta reached a settlement agreement with Jam City regarding the company’s alleged failure to provide consumers with a method to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. The settlement agreement requires Jam City to pay $1.4 million and prohibits Jam City from selling the personal information of consumers aged 13-16 without their express consent.

Colorado

Attorney General Phil Weiser entered into a settlement agreement with Instawork, an app based staffing agency in Colorado. The Attorney General alleged that Instawork misclassified employees as independent contractors and failed to pay required unemployment insurance premiums. The settlement is the first of its kind under the Colorado False Claims Act.

Michigan

Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a Notice of Intended Action to retail chain Five Below.

Apparently the new Porsche Cayenne Electric has already set a couple of records for the brand.

It is the most powerful Porsche ever built, and over 10,000 people have already registered their interest to buy one.

But there’s also another ‘record’ that Porsche never mentioned before.

DISCOVER SBX CARS: The global premium car auction platform powered by Supercar Blondie

The one thing Porsche never told us about Cayenne Electric

Porsche has just opened order books for the new Cayenne Electric in the United States and has also launched the online configurator.

According to the German automaker, over 110,000 users made unique builds using the online configurator, which is apparently a record for Porsche.

Furthermore, and let’s face it this is the part that truly matters, a significant percentage of online configurator users are ready to put their money where their online click was, so to speak.

Because they also said 10,500 buyers have registered their interest.

The company added something else that’s interesting, chiefly because it hasn’t exactly been advertised until now.

Apparently, the 1,139-horsepower Cayenne Electric is the most customizable Porsche ever.

The manufacturer never mentioned that before, but this is a bigger deal than people think.

When it comes to luxury vehicles, which is new Porsche Cayenne Electric definitely is, customization is a key selling point.

That’s why customization programs like Mulliner by Bentley and Q by Aston Martin are now as popular as ever.

The EV market keeps sending mixed signals

The EV market is still sending mixed (and inconsistent) signals.

Every time we think we found evidence of one thing, then something that proves the exact opposite happens.

For now, it seems there’s one universal truth: EVs are in demand.

But with a lot of caveats.

One of said caveats is that automakers are struggling to make EVs as profitable as gas cars, and the other is that there are certain segments where EVs don’t really work.

Dodge, for example, is likely doing a 180 on the Charger Daytona and is potentially bringing back an internal combustion version.

But Porsche doesn’t seem to have that problem.

Welcome back from the Thanksgiving holiday (for those of you in the United States). This edition of Projects Weekly highlights RWE’s newly commissioned 200 MW PV + 200 MWh storage Stoneridge Solar project in Texas. Plus, Wisconsin utilities received approval to add solar + storage and other renewables to the state’s energy supply. Additionally, the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) in northeastern Washington and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI) are collaborating to deploy microgrids across the reservation. Finally, a Minnesota school district is switching to solar energy through a partnership with All Energy Solar.

RWE energizes solar + storage project in Texas

RWE has commissioned its Stoneridge Solar project, delivering 200 MW of PV and 100 MW (200 MWh) of battery storage Milam County, Texas.

“Stoneridge Solar is a great example of the power of local partnership and the positive role energy projects play in economic stimulation,” said Andrew Flanagan, CEO of RWE Clean Energy. “We are helping Texas and the nation secure their energy future with scalable, homegrown energy while also delivering meaningful benefits to communities across America’s heartland.”

Cool factor: Stoneridge Solar created more 200 construction jobs and now supports permanent operational roles. The project is expected to generate millions in tax revenue for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District, with direct investments supporting first responders and educational initiatives. From funding renovations at Thorndale Elementary School to partnering with the local volunteer fire department, RWE is helping communities like Milam County remain resilient and prosperous.

RWE’s energy capacity across the United States has grown to more than 11 GW, reinforcing the company’s leadership in delivering reliable and affordable power to homes and businesses.

MGE adds solar + storage and other renewables to Wisconsin energy supply

Wisconsin utility companies have partnered to add more renewable energy to the state’s energy supply. Madison Gas and Electric (MGE), in partnership with We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service (WPS), subsidiaries of WEC Energy Group, received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to purchase solar capacity, battery storage and wind capacity from four renewable energy projects. MGE will own 35 MW of solar, 5 MW of battery storage and nearly 18 MW of wind in total from the different projects.

“The approval of these projects is another important step in our ongoing effort to reduce carbon emissions, increase our use of cost-effective renewable generation and advance new technologies to benefit all customers,” said Jeff Keebler, chairman, president and CEO of MGE. “With our current plans, by 2030, we will have added more than 40 renewable generation and battery storage projects since 2015, totaling more than 750 MW, propelling us toward our goal of net-zero carbon electricity by 2050.”

Cool factor: MGE will own a 10% share of four renewable energy projects, including two solar projects, the Saratoga Solar Energy Center and Ursa Solar Park. The Saratoga Solar Energy Center will include a 150 MW solar array and 50 MW battery energy storage system located in Wood County. MGE will own 15 MW of solar capacity and 5 MW of battery storage. The solar array and battery energy storage system are both expected to start serving customers in 2028. The Ursa Solar Park is a 200 MW solar facility that will be located in Columbia County. MGE will own 20 MW of solar capacity. The solar array is expected to begin serving customers in 2027.

The company will also own shares in two wind farm projects. The Badger Hollow Wind Farm is a 112 MW project in Iowa and Grant counties. MGE will own 11.2 MW of wind capacity. The wind farm is expected to begin serving customers in 2027. The Whitetail Wind Farm is a 67 MW wind farm will be located in Grant County. MGE will own 6.7 MW of wind capacity. The wind farm is expected to begin serving customers in 2027.

Colville Tribes seek energy sovereignty through microgrids

The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville Tribes) and Open Access Technology International Inc. (OATI) announced a landmark collaboration to advance tribal energy sovereignty and resilience through the design and deployment of multiple microgrids across the reservation in northeastern Washington. The program represents a significant step toward improving reliability, reducing outages, and providing long-term energy independence for the Colville Tribes. The initiative is backed by federal and state grant awards and addresses vulnerabilities such as winter storm disruptions and wildfire risks.

OATI is delivering professional project design and development services, hardware, and its advanced GridMind platform to support the microgrids through resource management and market integration. Planned sites include:

Nespelem HQ Campus (Lucy F. Covington Government Center): Rooftop solar PV, battery energy storage, EV charging, and microgrid controls, with an expansion to create a full campus resiliency hub.

Paschal Sherman Indian School (PSIS) Community: Microgrid design to support education and community resiliency.

Keller and Inchelium Districts: Additional distributed energy resources and microgrid infrastructure for local resilience.

Cool factor: The Colville Tribes microgrid program is rooted in the principle of energy sovereignty — the right of tribes to produce, deliver, and manage energy on their own lands. With the Colville Reservation served by multiple utilities offering varied levels of service, the ability to self-generate electricity provides resiliency and reliability for vulnerable communities and ensures critical services, including healthcare, commerce, and housing, remain powered during outages. Colville Tribes may also leverage the microgrids to offer additional grid benefits to local utilities and/or engage in energy markets as they evolve and grow.

“Since the Colville Reservation is in a remote location, subject to natural events like winter storms and fires, it has always been difficult for us to sustain a reliable supply of power,” said Jarred-Michael Erickson, chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. “Our hope is that this microgrid technology will not only keep our lights on, but will also position us for new economic opportunities.”

Future expansions envision integration with gaming operations and potential data centers, supported by tribal-owned utility and telecom infrastructure. With multiple microgrids underway, Colville Tribes is establishing itself as a leader in tribal energy innovation. The partnership not only secures reliable power but also positions the tribe for new economic opportunities, including data center hosting and advanced commercial development on tribal lands.

Minnesota school district switches to solar energy with All Energy Solar

Earlier this year, Minneota Public Schools made a powerful move to solar energy for its high school’s electricity needs. All Energy Solar, a leading solar installer in the Midwest headquartered in St Paul, Minnesota, helped the school make that transition with assistance from a state program designed for just this type of project.

“The school’s solar energy system has a capacity of 47.56 kW and consists of 82 panels installed on the gymnasium’s rooftop,” said Les Engler, Minneota facilities manager. “The system has been working very well for the school with the help of All Energy Solar.”

In 2021, the Minnesota State Legislature launched the Solar for Schools grant program for all school districts across the state. This program aims to encourage the installation of solar energy systems for educational institutions, while also providing an opportunity to incorporate renewable energy awareness and instruction into the schools’ curriculum.

Cool factor: Minneota Public Schools, a Kindergarten through 12th grade school district located in southwest Minnesota, is a beacon of academic excellence. With impressive rankings, including No. 17 in the state for State Assessment Proficiency and No. 19 in State Assessment Performance, coupled with a remarkable 100% graduation rate, the school’s commitment to educational excellence is unwavering. Upon learning more about the Solar for Schools program in 2024, Minneota Schools pursued a project as a forward-thinking solution that benefits both the environment and their community.

There are currently three science classes that are incorporating solar energy into their curriculum. Each class utilizes an innovative app that enables them to monitor the new array’s solar inverters and even individual solar panel output. This hands-on experience not only enriches their understanding of renewable energy but also empowers them to engage with real-world technology in a meaningful way.

A similar study by the Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.
But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.","Once every 10 years, ranchers must renew the permits that allow their cattle, sheep and other livestock to graze on the West’s public domain. These renewals are the government’s best opportunity to address how those livestock are harming the environment.

The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service, which manage the majority of public lands, are required by law to review each permit before deciding whether to place additional conditions on it or — in rare cases — to deny its renewal.

But in 2014, Congress mandated that the agencies automatically renew permits for another decade if they are unable to complete the reviews. This exemption has dramatically reduced scrutiny of grazing’s impact on public lands.

In 2013, the BLM approved grazing on 47% of its land open to livestock without an environmental review, a ProPublica and High Country News analysis of agency data showed. (The status of about another 10% of BLM land was unclear that year.) A decade later, the BLM authorized grazing on roughly 75% of its acreage without review, the analysis found.

A similar study by the Western Watersheds Project found a steep decline in environmental reviews on grazing land managed by the Forest Service.

This diminishing oversight has coincided with a sharp drop in the number of federal employees who complete the reviews. These staffers also conduct land-health assessments of large parcels to help determine whether permits in the area need changes to protect natural resources.

The BLM’s rangeland management staff shrank 39% between 2020 and 2024, according to Office of Personnel Management data. President Donald Trump’s administration is further hamstringing the BLM: About 1 in 10 rangeland staffers left the agency between last November’s election and June, according to agency records.

When agency staff aren’t monitoring the land, cattle can graze where they’re not supposed to, or in greater numbers or for longer periods than permitted. Such overgrazing can spread invasive plants by dispersing seeds and disturbing the soil, pushing out native species and increasing wildfire risk. When herds strip vegetation near creeks and streams, silt flows into the waterways, wiping out fish nurseries. And, without adequate staff to amend permits, agencies lose the chance to reduce the number of animals on an allotment — and the climate-warming methane they emit.

Once a permit is renewed, with or without a review, it becomes more difficult to rectify such harms for another decade.

Ten current and former BLM rangeland management employees said in interviews that they felt pressure to go easy on ranchers. This included downplaying environmental harm in permit reviews and land-health assessments, according to BLM staffers who worked in rangeland management. Several spoke on condition of anonymity because they still work for the government.

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth,” one BLM employee said of agency oversight.

In a statement, an agency spokesperson said, “The BLM is committed to transparency, sound science, and public participation as it administers grazing permits and considers updates to grazing regulations.”

In a shift, the Trump administration placed the approval process for all the BLM’s contracts and agreements of value in the hands of political appointees rather than career civil servants. In recent months, officials cut funding for an app that assists ranchers in collecting soil and vegetation data for use in permitting, for contractors who manage the data that informs grazing permits, for New Mexico farmers growing seeds used in restoration projects and for soil research in the Southwest, according to BLM records obtained by ProPublica and High Country News.

“Does not believe this action is needed to meet the administration priorities,” the cancellations read.

The Forest Service did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Ranching is often a multi-generation practice that serves to keep working landscapes intact, while also preserving open space, and benefiting recreation, wildlife, and watersheds.”

“Sometimes the truth was spoken, but, more often than not, it was not the truth.”

TO GAUGE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SHRINKING OVERSIGHT, ProPublica and High Country News toured federal grazing allotments in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada, finding evidence of either unpermitted grazing or habitat degraded by livestock in each state.In Arizona alone, reporters witnessed such issues in two national conservation areas, a national monument and a national forest.

On an allotment within Las Cienegas National Conservation Area, an expanse of desert grasslands and forested streams southeast of Tucson, the BLM lets up to 1,500 head of cattle graze across roughly 35,000 acres. These permits were recently reauthorized until 2035 using the exemption that allows environmental reviews to be skipped.

During a visit in late April, a grove of hearty cottonwoods stood against the afternoon sun, casting cool shadows over a narrow creek. This stretch of green sustains birds, frogs, snakes and ocelots. It’s also designated under federal law as critical habitat for five threatened or endangered species. Cattle are not allowed in the creekbed, but a thin barbed-wire fence meant to stop the animals lay crumpled in the dirt.

A native leopard frog broke the hot afternoon stillness as it leapt from the creek’s bank. Its launching pad was the hardened mud imprint of a cow hoof, and it landed with a plop in water fouled by cow feces and the partially submerged bones of a cow corpse. A half-dozen cattle crashed through the creek and up the steep embankment, tearing up plants that protected the soil from erosion and sending silt billowing into the water.

“Looks like a sewer,” Chris Bugbee, a wildlife ecologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, remarked as he took in the destruction. “This one hurts. There is no excuse.”

A 2024 BLM land-health assessment listed the grazing allotment as “ALL STANDARDS MET.” In April, a camouflaged trail camera bearing the agency’s insignia was pointed toward the creek. (ProPublica and High Country News submitted a public records request for images on the camera’s memory card in May, but the BLM has yet to fulfill the request.)

No ranchers paid to graze their livestock in this allotment last year, according to BLM data, so it is unclear who owned the cattle. The Arizona Cattle Growers’ Association, which represents ranchers in the state, did not respond to requests for comment.

Each year for the past eight years, Bugbee and his team have surveyed grazing impacts on the banks of streams and rivers in the Southwest that are designated as critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. Half of the 2,400 miles of streams they inspected “showed significant damage from livestock grazing,” according to their March report.

The industry maintains that the presence of livestock benefits many ecosystems, pointing to studies that have found, for example, that grazing can increase soil’s ability to hold carbon dioxide that would otherwise contribute to climate change. Other research suggests that, when managed properly, grazing can improve habitat health and allow it to support a more diverse mix of species.

Grazing also reduces vegetation that could fuel wildfires. Frank Shirts Jr., owner of the largest sheep operation on Forest Service land, said that sheep eat invasive weeds and brush, creating firebreaks. “These animals are fantastic,” he said.

Retta Bruegger, a range ecologist at Colorado State University, said that some ecosystems, especially those that receive more precipitation, can withstand more intense grazing. In regions where plants evolved over many years alongside large grazers like cattle, livestock can “provide a very important ecosystem function.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’” said Bruegger.

But answering those questions, she said, would require adequate staff to monitor the land.

AFTER A CENTURY OF INTENSE GRAZING WORE DOWN the public lands, a court ruled in 1974 that grazing permits were subject to environmental reviews, and Congress passed a law two years later mandating reviews every decade.

For years, a backlog of permit reviews grew, as federal land-management agencies lacked the staff to inspect all their territory — 240 million acres across BLM and Forest Service jurisdictions. Around 2000, Congress began giving temporary approval for regulators to skip reviews. Western Republicans, with the livestock industry’s support, pushed to enshrine the concept in law. The idea ultimately received bipartisan approval in December 2014, after being slipped into a must-pass defense spending bill.

Some conservationists now call it simply “the loophole.”

Many in the livestock industry lambaste the lack of reviews. When permits are automatically renewed, the law does not allow the terms to change, so ranchers are prevented from updating their grazing practices.

“It just locks people into grazing the same place, the same time, year after year,” said Chris Jasmine, manager of biodiversity and rangelands for Nevada Gold Mines, which owns 11 ranches in northern Nevada.

To help inform permit renewals, teams of BLM experts — rangeland specialists, hydrologists, botanists, soil scientists and wildlife biologists — assess the health of grazing allotments.

When the process is working as intended, these assessments are considered in permit reviews. But the current lack of staff has left large swaths of land without scrutiny.

All told, the BLM oversees 155 million acres of public lands available for grazing. But the agency has no record of completing land-health assessments for more than 35 million acres, nearly a quarter of its total.

Where the BLM has conducted such assessments, it found grazing had degraded due to livestock, at least 38 million acres, an area about half the size of New Mexico. And close to two-thirds of the land it listed as being in good shape had not been checked in more than a decade, the analysis found.

The situation, though, is even worse than these numbers indicate, as the agency has often skipped permit reviews on land in poor condition. Of the acreage the BLM had previously found to be degraded due to livestock, 82% was reauthorized for grazing without a review, according to ProPublica and High Country News’ analysis.

Several BLM employees said agency higher-ups instruct staff to study land that’s in better condition while avoiding allotments that are in worse shape or more controversial. Environmental groups such as the Western Watersheds Project as well as local stockmen’s associations are quick to litigate changes to permits. Automatic renewals avoid these drawn-out public fights. “We were just using a bureaucratic loophole,” one staffer said. “We were allowing ongoing degradation of habitat.”

“This can’t be the future of public lands,” Bugbee, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said of parcels degraded by cattle, likening the land to a “mowed lawn.”

Agency staff pointed to myriad reasons why the environment is suffering.

For example, after a wildfire, the BLM aims to keep livestock off the land for two years to allow the ecosystem to recover. But ranchers often negotiate an earlier return to the public pastures where their livestock graze, said Steve Ellis, who spent his career with the BLM and Forest Service, rising to high-level positions in both.

“There was always pressure to get back on,” Ellis said. “That’s not a new thing. It’s just part of working for the bureau.”

“We should be asking, ‘Are there individual producers who need to be doing a better job?’ instead of asking, ‘Should there be grazing or no grazing?’”

The government’s support for ranchers can add to the damage. Land-management agencies sometimes seed invasive grasses, which can benefit livestock. And state and federal agencies kill predators such as wolves and cougars — integral to healthy ecosystems — to protect ranchers’ economic interests.

BLM employees also said that in some permit reviews and land-health assessments, rank-and-file staff noted the presence of threatened and endangered species, which would have triggered tighter environmental controls, only for agency managers to delete that information from their reports.

One BLM staffer called the reviews “rubber stamping” and said higher-ranking staff who controlled the text of reports “wouldn’t let me stick anything into the official documentation that acknowledged things were in poor shape.”

Another complicating factor, according to BLM staff, is that ranchers are often invited to participate in fieldwork to gauge whether they are overgrazing. The result, employees said, was watered-down reviews and assessments.

The industry, though, is critical of the assessment process for other reasons. Erin Spaur, executive vice president of the Colorado Cattlemen’s Association, said it’s an inflexible “one-size-fits-all approach” that doesn’t sufficiently account for differences in ecosystems.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency,” said Dennis Willis, who spent more than three decades with the BLM, including managing rangeland, adding that “there’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

SOME RANCHERS ACKNOWLEDGE THE ENVIRONMENTAL impacts of their industry. But they say that more flexibility — not stricter oversight — would make them better stewards of the land.

Jasmine, with Nevada Gold Mines, contends that ranching can be done without denuding the West. A sixth-generation Nevadan, he oversees the mining company’s ranching operations, which run about 5,000 head of cattle.

On a sunny July day near Carlin, Nevada, Jasmine walked through chest-high vegetation to show off the recovery of Maggie Creek, a tributary to the Humboldt River that flows through a checkerboard of public and private lands. Photographs from the 1980s show barren ground around the shallow creek. When ranchers changed how they rotated their herds in the 1990s to give the streambed more rest, the land bounced back, Jasmine said. He credited a BLM biologist with initiating many of the projects that helped revive Maggie Creek.

“It’s a renewable resource. That grass that they’re eating right now will come back next year and the year after that if managed properly,” he said. “It’s about not eating the same plants in the same place year after year after year.”

Jasmine touted the company’s goal of protecting locally important species, its sage grouse restoration projects and its partnership with the BLM, which targeted grazing to remove unwanted vegetation and create a firebreak.

“There are huge cultural problems within the agency. There’s a real fear of dealing with grazing problems.”

But Nevada Gold Mines — a joint venture between two companies with a combined value of around $150 billion — operates in a different economic reality than most ranchers and can afford to keep cattle off the land long enough for it to recover.

Smaller ranchers face slim profit margins, making it attractive to heavily graze federal lands, where the cost is much lower than on state or private land.

For years, some politicians and environmental groups have proposed protecting degraded or sensitive habitats by paying ranchers to retire their permits, making the areas off-limits to grazing and preserving the land as wildlife habitat. Ranchers have occasionally taken these offers. But the industry as a whole is hesitant to surrender grazing permits.

In October, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, introduced a bill to further voluntary retirement, calling it “a pragmatic solution that supports local economies, protects biodiversity, and saves taxpayer dollars by reducing the cost of administering grazing programs.”

Louis Wertz, a spokesperson for the Western Landowners Alliance, said that the conservation-minded ranchers who make up his group want to both stay in business and “live in a place that is vibrant, full of life, provides clean water, has clean air.” But when it comes to food production, he added, “the expectations we have of both being environmentally harmless and healthy and cheap are untenable. Over the last 150 years in the United States, we have chosen cheapness at the expense of environmental quality.”

Like Jasmine, Wertz said that understaffing at the BLM and Forest Service deprives ranchers of an opportunity to change how they manage their herds, even when they want to.

“It is important that there be accountability for producers on the landscape,” Wertz said, but there should also be “flexibility so producers can be economically successful and so they can do what is right for the landscape.”

For decades, beef producers have relied on visible performance indicators such as body condition, weight gain, and reproductive success. Yet, one of the biggest drivers of profitability has remained hidden: individual animal methane emissions and what they reveal about feed efficiency.

Agscent Air is changing that. The technology provides real-time, on-farm methane measurement that enables producers to identify their most efficient animals, validate management interventions, and build more profitable, low-emission herds.

At Macka’s Black Angus Beef, producer Robert Mackenzie is proving that methane monitoring is more than an environmental compliance exercise – it is a productivity tool that delivers results directly to the bottom line.

The feed efficiency connection

Methane emissions and feed efficiency are closely linked. Cattle with lower residual feed intake (RFI), a measure of how efficiently an animal uses feed for growth or production, produce 15–25% less methane than their less efficient counterparts.1,2

This is not a coincidence. Methane represents lost feed energy – so animals that emit less methane convert more nutrients into growth. The performance and cost implications are significant.

Cattle with a feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 5.4:1 are more efficient — this means they need 5.4 kg of feed to gain 1 kg of body weight. These efficient cattle cost about AUD $115 less to finish and reach market 26 days sooner, saving an extra AUD $143 per head. In dairy systems, efficient cows can also save around AUD $675 per year in feed costs.

The implications extend throughout the operation. As Robert Mackenzie explained, “You eat less, you produce less methane.” This simple principle translates to “better feed conversion, which means lower costs, reduced pasture pressure, faster growth, and improved margins.”

The challenge lies in identifying which animals possess these valuable traits – and that is where methane monitoring becomes essential.

Making measurement practical

So how can producers access this critical data without disrupting their operations? Until recently, accurately measuring livestock methane required expensive respiration chambers or specialist research facilities. Agscent’s technology eliminates those barriers. The Agscent Air GHG systems use portable, sensor-based monitoring that integrates naturally into existing farm infrastructure, providing data on:

• Individual animal methane output

Variation across the herd

Response to feed and management changes

Genetic differences in efficiency

Macka’s Beef has been using the Agscent X Optiweigh system to validate a mineral supplement programme. “We developed a baseline with Himalayan rock salt and we got the animal to go into the Optiweigh X Agscent machine,” Mackenzie explained. The system is measuring methane output before and after introducing his ECO2 Feed mineral supplement. With reliable measurement now possible, the question becomes: what can producers actually do with this data?

Beyond compliance: Data that drives profitability

While sustainability credentials and carbon credits add value, Mackenzie sees the real payoff in productivity insights. Methane data helps producers:

• Identify superior genetics within herds

• Validate feed additives and dietary programmes

• Evaluate pasture species and management decisions

By 2026, Macka’s Black Angus plans to integrate methane measurement into its breeding programme, using verified data to select stud bulls and cows that combine genetic strength with environmental efficiency.

This genetic information has immediate commercial value – enhancing breeding decisions, marketing efficiency-verified genetics, and building long-term herd improvement strategies.

The measurement journey

For producers beginning their methane monitoring journey, Mackenzie recommends starting with the basics:

1. Establish baselines using carbon calculators and existing data

2. Identify priorities for emissions and efficiency improvement

3. Implement measurement with technology partners like Agscent

4. Test interventions such as feed additives or genetic selection

5. Refine and scale successful practices across the herd

Competitive advantage and the future of sustainable beef

Building on this foundation of measurement and improvement, early adopters are positioning themselves for a changing market landscape. As consumer demand for sustainable beef continues to rise and carbon accounting becomes standard, verified low-methane systems will offer a strong competitive edge.

Producers adopting these technologies early gain the ability to:

• Optimise operations before regulation mandates it

• Build premium, data-backed market positions

• Access carbon credit revenue streams

• Operate using insights other producers lack

“Sustainability means leaving the land better than we found it,” Mackenzie said. “But it’s also becoming a licence to produce – we’ll be required to become more sustainable whether we like it or not.”

The bottom line

Macka’s Black Angus Beef experience shows that the technologies reducing emissions are the same ones driving profitability. Methane measurement enables smarter decisions – whether through identifying efficient genetics, validating feed strategies, or refining herd composition.

“You can’t manage what you don’t measure,” Mackenzie concluded. His operation proves the point: methane measurement isn’t just about emissions compliance – it’s about unlocking hidden productivity potential that’s always been there.

The question for beef producers isn’t whether to measure methane. It’s whether they can afford to keep making breeding, feeding, and management decisions without understanding this critical dimension of herd performance. As sustainability requirements tighten and competition intensifies, the answer becomes increasingly clear.

The nickel market in India is expected to grow rapidly, with projections estimated to exceed $33 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.8%. Nickel is a crucial element in stainless steel manufacturing, as it enhances its corrosion resistance and durability, properties vital for infrastructure, construction, chemical processing, and marine applications. Simultaneously, nickel is indispensable in battery manufacturing, especially for lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (EVs), with its high energy density critical for improving battery life and efficiency.

India’s renewable energy targets — aiming for 500 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 — and accelerated EV adoption are driving unprecedented demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. Lithium demand alone is projected to increase tenfold by 2030, while copper demand is expected to more than double, highlighting the mineral-rich future ahead for India’s energy transition and industrial modernisation.

Bridging the demand-supply gap:

Despite the promising projections, India produces only a minimal amount of domestic nickel. The country sources most of its nickel from foreign suppliers, including Norway, Japan, Canada, Indonesia, and China. This import dependency exposes the Indian players to risks of global price volatility, geopolitical tensions, a new coalition of countries, and supply chain disruptions. For example, fluctuations in nickel prices or interruptions in supply can increase costs for battery manufacturers, potentially slowing EV production and undermining India’s clean energy transition plans. The projected nickel demand for EV batteries is expected to surge by more than 600% by 2040, intensifying the urgency to secure stable supplies.

The stainless-steel industry in India, which consumes roughly 70% of domestically available nickel, also faces pressures from unstable import prices. These cost fluctuations can negatively impact the competitiveness of Indian stainless-steel products both in domestic and global markets, making it harder for manufacturers to plan and price their goods efficiently. Moreover, environmental regulations and sustainability concerns tied to nickel mining and refining, and its overwhelming control by China, add to the complexity of securing reliable, ethically produced nickel supplies.

To address these multifaceted challenges, the Indian government launched the National Critical Minerals Mission (NCMM) in 2025. This program represents a cornerstone effort to increase domestic exploration and production of critical minerals like nickel. More than Rs 34,000 crore of investments through 2031 is expected to boost exploration, downstream processing, and mineral recycling capacities (targeting 270 kilotonnes annually). (4) The mission also seeks to establish technology hubs and Centres of Excellence to foster innovation and development in the sector. To complement domestic production growth, the government is also striving to diversify international sources to mitigate geopolitical risks and ensure continuous supply chains.

Strategic initiatives:

Recent strategic industry moves further underscore efforts to decrease import reliance. After Vedanta Nico acquired Nicomet in 2021, the company entered into a strategic memorandum of understanding (MoU) with AEsir in 2024 to become the preferred supplier of nickel, a vital raw material for AEsir’s advanced battery technology. This collaboration builds on a broader partnership where Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta’s sister company and a leading zinc producer, supports the supply of zinc for these nickel-zinc batteries.

Meanwhile, Odisha is recognised for its substantial nickel reserves estimated at around 175 million tons–Jaipur (140 million tonnes), Mayurbhanj (27 million tonnes), and Keonjhar (8 million tonnes) — positioning it as a key state for future nickel mining and processing growth.

Despite these proactive steps, India’s heavy dependency on nickel imports remains a primary challenge. India imported nearly $1.26 billion during 2024, according to the United Nations COMTRADE database on international trade. Unpredictable pricing, supply security concerns, and the need to comply with ascending environmental standards threaten to slow India’s industrial growth trajectory and delay its ambitious renewable energy and technology modernization goals.

The way forward

As India accelerates its journey towards a sustainable and self-reliant clean future, it will call for a comprehensive and forward-looking policy framework focused on the entire mineral lifecycle. And Vedanta Nico will play a critical role by ensuring a steady, high-quality supply of nickel—an essential metal for advanced battery technologies and green infrastructure, turning the challenges of global supply uncertainties into sustainable opportunities for national progress.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/nickel.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:05:51.684230

Advocates for public research say the public is less likely to benefit from private sector endeavors, no matter how good a lab’s intentions are.
The 16 researchers identified by NOTUS who left the EPA for the private sector were on the cutting edge of their field.","The country’s highest-achieving scientists have been leaving the Environmental Protection Agency in droves for the private sector.

It’s exactly what President Donald Trump’s administration said it was going to do: shrink the agency’s scientific research apparatus. It’s also an outcome that could come back to bite the EPA in times of crisis, departing researchers say.

NOTUS identified 16 researchers, all with doctoral or master’s degrees, many of them experts in using machine learning to speed up the identification and analysis of toxic chemicals, who have left the EPA for the private lab UL Research Institutes.

Most of these scientists worked for the EPA’s much-vaunted Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure, tasked with developing ways to quickly figure out chemical toxicity.

This was a team that advised crews dispatched to East Palestine, Ohio, where a train carrying hazardous materials derailed in 2023, causing massive environmental damage. One of the departing researchers said that the center had an “on call” scientist for the field teams in East Palestine.

The EPA has said that the agency should only be conducting research that is required by law for it to fulfill its duties. The agency has eliminated its Office of Research and Development, or ORD, and reassigned scientists to other offices focused on regulatory responsibilities.

“The unfortunate reality is that the work many people in ORD were doing was disconnected from our statutory obligations,” the agency said in response to NOTUS’ questions about the loss of the EPA researchers.

Departing scientists say that misses the impact of their work. The team of computational scientists was useful in the immediate aftermath of the East Palestine disaster because it had the tools to very quickly generate safety and toxicity data. The research at the Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure was intended to inform regulatory decision-making “more quickly after a chemical is discovered in the environment,” a former EPA researcher who went to UL said.

UL Research Institutes, a Georgia-based nonprofit lab, is in the process of expanding into a new chemical insights lab in North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park — the same place where the EPA’s largest office in the country is located, and where most of these researchers worked previously. It has been hiring almost exclusively former EPA scientists for the last several months, according to a review of their new hire announcements.

The lab is part of a “strategic expansion” intended to “provide additional access to top-tier talent,” a UL spokesperson told NOTUS.

Still, losing the center and so many of its researchers to the private sector may make it harder for the EPA to respond quickly to chemical events, the former EPA researcher at UL said.

Their team at the EPA didn’t just respond to emergencies; it also responded in the immediate aftermath of the discovery of a new mysterious chemical in the environment — like when GenX, an unregulated PFAS chemical, was discovered in the drinking water in eastern North Carolina in 2017, the same researcher said.

Advocates for public research say the public is less likely to benefit from private sector endeavors, no matter how good a lab’s intentions are.

“There’s not as much power, if you will, for research coming from a private lab or an NGO, because the government is the final decider,” said Kyla Bennett, the science policy director at the advocacy organization Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “When EPA does a draft risk assessment and they accept comments, they can and do ignore comments from academia, from NGOs and from private institutions.”

The Trump administration rejects these concerns.

“EPA has the resources it needs and remains well-equipped to respond to emergencies,” an agency spokesperson said. “We have excellent staff throughout the agency who will ensure that this type of science and research supporting our statutory responsibilities continues, and baseless gossip claiming otherwise should not be the source of your reporting.”

For the federal government’s top environmental and chemical researchers, the writing has been on the wall since June, when the EPA announced it would be closing down its independent scientific research arm.

The Trump administration has embraced the privatization of scientific research and pushed to move research out of the federal government wherever possible. The president’s chief science adviser has said that the private sector should take over funding more science, and the government should be doing “basic” research that serves the national interest.

The EPA shut its independent research office — which was its largest arm until now — and began to hand out reassignments to its scientists in September. Many researchers chose to leave the federal government rather than abandon their work.

“What we’re seeing is a drive to fundamentally change what is the role of the federal government in the U.S. and push to no longer have the federal government cover certain functions,” said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, who was the deputy administrator in charge of the Office of Research and Development during the Biden administration and spent 40 years at the EPA.

The EPA continues to insist that, despite the elimination of an independent research arm, it still plans to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” according to its announcement about the shuttering of ORD.

The 16 researchers identified by NOTUS who left the EPA for the private sector were on the cutting edge of their field.

“ORD was the focal point for that, nationally,” said Thomas Burke, a former EPA assistant administrator for ORD during President Barack Obama’s administration. “We’ve lost that, as a resource to the scientific community.”

One of the researchers, Russell Thomas, who led the Center for Computational Toxicology in Exposure, won the American Medical Association’s award for outstanding government service in 2024, for transforming how the health impacts of chemicals are evaluated.

“In the past, using animal testing to evaluate chemicals for endocrine disruption, EPA was only able to evaluate about 70 chemicals over 25 years, at a cost of approximately $1 million per chemical. By contrast, using approaches developed by Thomas’s team, over 2,000 chemicals were evaluated in three years for a cost of just $30,000 per chemical,” the American Medical Association wrote in 2024.

Thomas declined to comment for this story.

NOTUS found that at least four of the 16 researchers now employed by UL were hired or paid under EPA’s Title 42 program, which was designed to incentivize the world’s top researchers to work for the government instead of the private sector.

Although the full list of scientists hired until the Title 42 program is not public, NOTUS also identified at least three other researchers hired under that program who left the EPA in the last three months to work in the private sector.

“We just destroyed the top leadership, we lost the best and the brightest of the emerging stars, and they cut off the pipeline for the future,” Burke said. Last year, Burke, who now works as a professor at Johns Hopkins University, produced a congressionally required report on the benefits of the EPA’s Title 42 program that detailed the groundbreaking scientific talent the agency attracted through the program.

Many of the researchers now working for UL hope that they will be able to continue doing the work they were doing at EPA. UL is investing heavily in expanding its chemical safety research.

“I’m happy they were able to find a job and to be able to do the work that they were trained to do,” said Orme-Zavaleta. “But the bottom line is, who benefits now from this work? The American public is no longer the direct beneficiary.”

AI has been accelerating sustainability and energy goals particularly well over the last few years.

Now, in an effort to prioritise this area, Google has introduced its self-service Energy Assessment Tool (EAT) to help manufacturers improve efficiency while reducing both operational costs and emissions.

The EAT platform is designed to give facility managers the ability to perform preliminary energy assessments without requiring specialist expertise or expensive on-site support.

The primary function of the EAT is to lower the barriers to entry for energy efficiency projects. While manufacturers can realise considerable cost savings and emissions cuts through such improvements, many are hindered by challenges.

These can include the high cost of engaging energy assessment consultants, limited capital for new projects and a lack of in-house energy management knowledge. Such obstacles often mean that straightforward high-impact projects are not implemented.

Breaking down barriers with a self-service energy tool

To address these challenges, Google has developed EAT as a free platform for manufacturing facility and plant managers. It aims to identify energy-saving opportunities and accelerate progress on cost reduction and climate action initiatives.

The tool delivers actionable insights without demanding prior energy management expertise from the user. By inputting basic facility data, users can generate customised recommendations that cover more than 20 system areas, including air compressors, boilers, chillers and lighting.

Kate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) at Google, explained the motivation behind the project on LinkedIn.

“We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader,” she writes.

The tool is intended to foster collaboration and extend positive impacts throughout the value chain. It highlights projects with the highest potential for cost and carbon reduction and enables assessment across multiple facilities to help prioritise investment.

Data-driven audits and collaborative supply chains

Google’s objective with the EAT is to provide an accessible data-driven method for identifying potential energy efficiency projects. The platform offers analyses that are typically found in an ""ASHRAE Level 1"" standard energy audit.

The tool’s calculation methodology and comprehensive data were developed by engineering consulting firms, transforming what is often a complex and costly process into a simple and collaborative solution.

To support its adoption in key manufacturing regions, the platform is available in Chinese (simplified and traditional), Thai, Vietnamese and English.

Data security and confidentiality are key considerations. The EAT is built and managed by a third-party organisation and has been reviewed by Google to ensure it meets strict privacy and security standards.

Individual supplier data remains secure and suppliers retain control over which partners they collaborate with and what summary data, such as total potential savings, they choose to share.

Integrating EAT into Google’s wider sustainability strategy

This initiative is part of Google’s broader strategy for sustainable energy use across its operations and supply chain. Google, which is one of the world's largest corporate buyers of clean energy, is also investing in advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal and grid-enhancing technologies.

In 2020, Google announced its goal to achieve net zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030, supported by an ambition to operate entirely on 24/7 carbon-free energy.

Google's own data centres are designed for high efficiency, with its AI chips becoming more power-efficient over time.

Google also focuses on designing out waste, boosting material reuse and pursuing a more sustainable supply chain. This new tool extends that ethos to its partners.

“The journey to a more sustainable future is a shared one,” Google writes.

It adds: “By equipping our partners with the right resources, we can accelerate progress, reduce costs and build a more resilient and sustainable supply chain for everyone. The Energy Assessment tool helps pave the way for our mutual success.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/bae9b70651cbbf64a9871f1775abe5c4:c8e7a3964458faf437575d4d84836f20/alphabet-google-cloud.webp.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 04:58:20.286668

German-backed solar factory could shift Ghana from importer to regional producer, anchoring a new industrial base for West Africa’s green economy.

Renewables expand across Africa, but Ghana’s gains remain incremental; governance, tariffs and utility finances will determine the pace of real impact.

Ghana is moving closer to a modest but symbolically important milestone in its transition toward cleaner energy, with roughly 111 GWh of additional solar-based electricity expected by 2026. The projection, drawn from a recent African Development Bank (AfDB) implementation report, stems from the ongoing Ghana Mini Grid and Solar PV Net Metering Project, a US$85 million investment designed to expand rural electrification and reduce the country’s dependence on hydro and thermal generation.

Although the initiative will not significantly alter the national power balance, it represents a calculated effort to ease pressure on a sector long constrained by fuel-price exposure, liquidity stress among state-owned utilities, and the political sensitivity surrounding consumer tariffs.

Ghana’s electricity landscape continues to grapple with structural weaknesses that undermine performance and investor confidence. Chronic cash flow imbalances at the Electricity Company of Ghana, along with the persistent gap between cost-recovery requirements and politically driven tariff decisions, limit utilities' ability to invest sustainably. Technical losses remain high, and the system’s dependence on imported fuel exposes the economy to international market volatility. With electricity demand rising steadily—often by more than 4% per year—the government’s ambition to achieve universal access by 2030 has heightened the urgency to diversify supply sources and strengthen network resilience. Renewables, excluding hydro, currently account for less than 1% of Ghana’s generation mix, leaving the country behind frontrunners such as Kenya and South Africa.

Within this context, the AfDB-backed programme seeks to accelerate supply diversification. It foresees installing 67.8 MW of new solar generation capacity through the deployment of 35 mini-grids targeting lakeside and island communities, as well as 12,000 rooftop systems for households, small businesses, and public facilities. The Bank’s November 2025 review rates progress as satisfactory, though the project faces delays linked to slow tax-exemption approvals and the late release of government counterpart financing.

As of late 2025, only 12.6% of funds had been disbursed. Nevertheless, once completed, the initiative could provide reliable power to more than 84,000 people, generate nearly 3,000 temporary jobs, and reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 718,000 tonnes annually. It also fits within a continental trend that increasingly views mini-grids as an efficient mechanism for electrifying remote areas.

The solar programme also exposes Ghana’s vulnerability to imported components and underdeveloped maintenance ecosystems, both of which risk limiting the long-term viability of off-grid assets. This challenge underscores the importance of an industrial shift that is already taking shape. In late 2025, Germany’s development bank KfW launched an international tender for a solar module assembly facility in Kumasi, with an annual production capacity of 75 MW.

If delivered on schedule between 2026 and 2027, the plant would become the first of its kind in West Africa and anchor Ghana’s emerging green industrialisation strategy. It would also provide a platform for technology transfer, reduce dependence on Asian imports, and position Ghana as a potential supplier to ECOWAS markets. The industrial momentum coincides with a growing pipeline of domestic solar projects, including the 200 MW Norbert Anku Solar Park—expandable to 1 GW by 2032—which signals the country’s intention to strengthen its competitive position in the regional energy landscape.

Ghana’s progress mirrors a broader continental acceleration in renewable energy initiatives. Nigeria is expanding its portfolio of solar mini-grids as part of a clean-energy investment pipeline estimated at US$7.8 billion. Kenya remains a regional leader with more than 400 operational mini-grids and the continent’s largest wind installation at Lake Turkana. Angola is rolling out a 724 MW solar programme supported by Western partners, and Morocco continues to consolidate its large-scale solar and CSP infrastructure with an eye toward future exports to Europe. Africa as a whole could exceed 100 GW of installed solar capacity by 2030, up from roughly 10 GW today, provided that financing flows stabilise and supply-chain bottlenecks ease.

In the medium term, Ghana’s additional 111 GWh of annual renewable output will support incremental improvements in energy access and help reduce the carbon intensity of marginal supply. The more strategic development lies in the emergence of a local solar manufacturing base, which—if KfW’s initiative succeeds—could fundamentally shift Ghana’s role within West Africa’s clean-energy ecosystem.

Yet this outcome is far from guaranteed. The public sector will need to improve procurement efficiency, stabilise utilities' financial health, and implement more predictable tariff reforms to attract private investors. Sustaining off-grid systems will also require stronger operation and maintenance frameworks than those typically observed across the region.

For now, Ghana’s renewable expansion remains gradual rather than transformative. However, if industrial plans materialise as intended, the country could evolve into a regional hub for solar technologies, strengthening its competitiveness and reducing long-term energy vulnerability. The following two years, marked by the roll-out of the AfDB-supported systems and the potential commissioning of the German-backed plant, will be decisive in determining whether Ghana can convert momentum into a durable structural advantage.

United States Renewable Energy Industry Overview

In just over a decade, the renewable energy industry has shifted from a niche market to a core pillar of America’s energy infrastructure. Today, renewables—spanning solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and bioenergy—are central to both public and private decarbonization strategies. Businesses across the value chain are fueling growth, including utilities, battery manufacturers, investors, engineering firms, and technology developers.

A powerful mix of incentives—like the Investment Tax Credit (ITC), Production Tax Credit (PTC), and state-level Renewable Portfolio Standards—has transformed renewables from expensive to economically superior options. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), one of the most significant clean energy laws in U.S. history, further boosts investor confidence by promising long-term tax stability and encouraging domestic manufacturing of solar panels, batteries, and wind components.

As solar module improvements, advanced wind turbine designs, and utility-scale storage become more cost-efficient, renewables increasingly compete with, and in many cases, outperform fossil fuel generation. Smart grid technologies and AI-driven energy optimization are improving system reliability, while large infrastructure investments—particularly in offshore wind and utility-scale solar—have pushed renewable capacity to record highs.

Solar is experiencing an extraordinary boom. All market segments—utility-scale, commercial, and residential—continue to expand, resulting in 188 GW of total installed solar capacity nationwide. In 2023 alone, 22.5 GW of new utility-scale solar was added, while nearly 800,000 residential customers installed solar systems on their rooftops. The country plans to add an average of 30 GW of solar annually by 2025, and 60 GW each year from 2025 to 2030. By 2034, cumulative solar capacity is expected to hit 673 GW, enough to power more than 100 million U.S. households.

A landmark example of America’s transition is the Edwards & Sanborn Solar + Energy Storage project, launched by Terra-Gen and Mortenson in 2024. Spanning 4,600 acres, it features:

1.9 million First Solar panels

875 MWdc solar capacity

3.3 GWh energy storage

1.3 GW interconnection capacity—the largest in the United States

These mega-projects illustrate the scale and sophistication of renewable energy deployment in the country.

Key Factors Driving United States Renewable Energy Market Growth

1. Strong Policy Support and Regulatory Incentives

Public policy remains one of the strongest drivers of renewable energy adoption in the U.S. Federal incentives like the ITC, PTC, and extensive tax credits under the IRA reduce upfront costs and improve project viability. State-level support through Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), clean energy mandates, and net-metering programs reinforces momentum at the local level.

In addition to cutting costs, these incentives enhance long-term revenue certainty—critical for attracting large-scale private investment. States including California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey have enacted aggressive clean energy laws tied to emissions targets, further stimulating deployment.

2. Technological Innovation and Cost Declines

The rapid decline in the cost of solar PV systems, wind turbines, and battery storage is speeding up adoption. Improved materials, automated manufacturing, enhanced turbine aerodynamics, bifacial solar modules, and higher-capacity batteries have reduced the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewables to historic lows.

Advanced grid modernization tools—including AI-powered forecasting, virtual power plants (VPPs), real-time monitoring, and energy management software—are strengthening system integration. Economies of scale continue to push renewable energy prices down, making them competitive with natural gas and coal in most regions.

3. Rising Corporate and Consumer Demand for Clean Energy

Corporations are now among the largest purchasers of renewable energy. Major companies are signing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), investing in on-site generation, and pursuing net-zero targets. This corporate demand offers reliable revenue streams for developers, accelerating project financing.

Residential customers are adopting rooftop solar and community solar programs at unprecedented rates. Motivations range from cost savings and energy independence to environmental concerns, strengthened by financial incentives and falling equipment costs.

Challenges Facing the United States Renewable Energy Market

1. Grid Infrastructure Limitations

Despite rapid renewable expansion, America’s aging grid remains one of the biggest bottlenecks. Solar and wind intermittency, transmission congestion, lengthy interconnection queues, and permitting hurdles slow down deployment.

Large-scale renewables require robust transmission systems, yet many proposed lines face delays of 5–10 years due to regulatory, land-use, and stakeholder issues. Without significant upgrades in transmission and storage, renewable growth may outpace grid capacity.

2. Complex and Lengthy Permitting Processes

Permitting complexity—especially for utility-scale solar, offshore wind, and interstate transmission—can significantly delay projects. Environmental reviews, zoning regulations, and overlapping state and federal jurisdictions often lead to unpredictable timelines.

Land-use disputes and community opposition add further complications. Developers frequently cite permitting uncertainty as a top investment risk. Simplifying and standardizing regulations could unlock billions in clean energy investment.

United States Renewable Energy Market Overview by States

The U.S. renewable market is far from uniform. Regional variations in policy, geography, consumer engagement, and resource availability help shape state-level performance. Three major states illustrate the spectrum of clean energy activity:

Final Thoughts

The United States is standing at the threshold of its most transformative clean energy decade yet. With renewable capacity expected to surpass 1,000 GW by 2033, the next few years will redefine the country’s energy, economic, and environmental trajectory. Strong federal and state support, a rapidly maturing technology ecosystem, and surging corporate sustainability commitments are powering the nationwide pivot toward green energy.

Yet the transition is not without obstacles. Grid congestion, slow permitting, and aging infrastructure all present formidable challenges. But with ongoing investments in storage, transmission, and innovation, the fundamentals of the U.S. renewable energy market remain exceptionally strong.

As global competition intensifies and climate pressures escalate, America’s commitment to renewable energy will not only determine its environmental future—but also shape its economic leadership in the decades ahead.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/692e877cce0795001da2071b.png",N,,2025-12-02 07:58:25.454616

Lead poisoning is serious -- there's a reason leaded gasoline is mostly gone from the market.
These companies sometimes buy recycled lead from global trading companies who buy the lead from recyclers all over the globe.
“We do not have extra resources to be involved in the overseas project for recycling lead batteries,” Mr. Tabo wrote.
Japan, for example, has imported recycled lead from Nigeria in the past decade, trade records show.","A couple of weeks ago we brought you this New York Times report about lead poisoning being caused by factories that produce batteries for automotive use.

These factories are/were producing batteries such as the 12-volt units used for starting your car, and not necessarily the large batteries for electric vehicles.

Near the end of the post, I wrote that it wasn't clear how much automakers knew:

The Times reports that automakers often claim to be using clean recycling processes, even marketing their processes as clean and safe. In reality, at least some of the recycled lead is being sourced from factories that are polluting. Perhaps the OEMs are aware of the dirty conditions at these facilities -- and perhaps they are not. After all, the supply chain is complex and as the Times points out in the piece, it's possible, even likely, that automakers and battery producers don't know where the lead is coming from.

Now the NYT reports that automakers definitely knew -- and have known for a long time.

The outlet leads with the story of an Australian lawyer meeting with Ford executives at the Blue Oval's Dearborn HQ in 2005. The lawyer, Philip Toyne, warned those executives that recycled lead from car batteries was poisoning people, because the factories that did the recycling were putting toxic smoke out into the atmosphere.

He even pitched a program in which inspectors would certify factories as clean, and automakers -- and suppliers who manufactured batteries -- could buy recycled lead only from companies that passed certification. That would allow the companies to claim, in their marketing, that they used only lead that was recycled cleanly.

According to the Times, records and interviews show that OEMs have known for 30 years or more that the factories they purchased recycled lead from were polluting the atmosphere. But they did nothing, and even blocked efforts to address the problem. When the big automakers wrote down environmental policies, they didn't address lead.

Meanwhile, factories in Ghana, Nigeria, and Tanzania were poisoning local citizens.

Lead poisoning is serious -- there's a reason leaded gasoline is mostly gone from the market. Even now, the Times says that lead poisoning is estimated to kill more than 1.5 million people each year, most of whom live in developing countries.

The Times says Ford didn't reply to requests for comment, and it also reports that Ford executives were intrigued by Toyne's pitch, since Ford could then appeal to customers who cared about the environment.

And maybe Ford would've gone ahead had 2006 not happened. For those who don't remember, that was when the Blue Oval suffered what was, at the time, its worst financial loss ever and Bill Ford stepped down as CEO. Ford was generally seen as an advocate for the environment and sustainability.

We all know what happened next -- the Great Recession struck and the Detroit automakers needed bailout loans. Other major automakers had their own struggles.

Meanwhile, battery makers sometimes have a layer between them and the factories. These companies sometimes buy recycled lead from global trading companies who buy the lead from recyclers all over the globe.

While Ford didn't talk to the Times, one of the execs who heard Toyne's pitch did. From the NYT:

Addressing lead pollution and other environmental problems proved “financially challenging,” recalled Bernd Gottselig, a retired Ford executive who was involved in talks about Green Lead. “Several ideas would have required setting up completely new and unique supply chains,” he said.

There was another wrinkle, too. Automakers were reluctant to market ""green"" lead since it would imply, correctly, that lead was toxic.

Michael Rae, who was working on a program to certify metals and minerals in the jewelry industry at the time, sat in on a Green Lead meeting. He said it posed a public relations challenge for automakers: By touting their environmental commitment, they’d be calling attention to their reliance on a metal that has been known for centuries to be toxic.

“My recollection is that there was active resistance from the motor vehicle industry to the idea of saying ‘green lead’ because of the implication that there was ‘bad lead,’” Rae said.

Ford wasn't the only OEM that was warned. Motorcycle maker Hero Honda, which in 2007 was co-owned by Honda Motor Company, participated in an Indian pilot program for buying batteries only from battery-makers who had passed certain certifications for reducing emissions from lead.

Most major battery makers in India didn't sign up. Nor did large international automakers like Ford, GM, and what was then DaimlerChrysler.

Japanese OEM Mitsubishi also passed.

Again, from the Times:

“We are aware of lead poisoning, and understand your gist,” Eizo Tabo, the manager of environmental and recycling programs at Mitsubishi, wrote at the time. But the company said its batteries came from Japan, not India. “We do not have extra resources to be involved in the overseas project for recycling lead batteries,” Mr. Tabo wrote.

In the years that followed, lead from polluting factories has seeped further into the global supply chain. Japan, for example, has imported recycled lead from Nigeria in the past decade, trade records show.

A Mitsubishi spokesperson said it is working to eliminate lead in its products and that it has not identified serious risks of human rights violations in any of its supply chains.

Africa hasn't been the only part of the world affected by lead pollution from these factories. The Times reports that in 2011, a Mexican factory started recycling lead from old car batteries, and a ""putrid mist"" began to fall from the sky -- townspeople, including infants, got sick.

That Times piece also highlighted a research paper that suggested that as the United States came up with tighter environmental regulations, there was an increase in exports of batteries for recycling to Mexico.

A U.S. government employee, Bob Holcombe, and a group called ATSM International tried to come up with standards for recycling lead from car batteries. First, the U.S. government would need to set up a committee. A simple majority would be needed to form the committee, and anyone who attended the meeting that would decide whether a committee would be formed could vote.

The Times shows that 98 people voted, and 80 represented battery makers. Fifty came from Johnson Controls, then the world's largest maker of automotive batteries. Unsurprisingly, the vote failed.

Johnson Controls later sold its battery business, which changed brands to become Clarios. Clarios wouldn't comment on the meeting to the Times, and only said it was committed to high standards for manufacturing.

Automakers would occasionally get caught doing something unethical and/or immoral and agree to change. The companies agreed to limit the mercury trade in 2013. When child labor was found being used in the Democratic Republic of Congo to mine ore for electric systems, automakers said they'd only use ethical suppliers going forward.

Now all major OEMs talk about harmful sourcing -- except for when it comes to recycled lead.

All major car companies now identify minerals and metals that are known to harm the environment and human health if they are obtained irresponsibly.

Hyundai, for example, keeps a list of minerals that are important to the “future and environment of mankind.” It requires that suppliers obtain those minerals ethically. General Motors has placed six metals under heightened scrutiny. Neither company addresses lead.

Not all companies ignore lead -- Volvo and Mitsubishi do monitor it, and Nissan claims to be phasing lead out ""where technically feasible"".

Ford said nothing about lead in its most recent sustainability report.

Toyne passed away in 2015. A business partner told the Times that Toyne had more success convincing jewelry retailers to ethically source gemstones.

Founded in 1908, it designs and manufactures cars, SUVs, trucks, and automobile parts under major brands like Chevrolet, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac. GM also provides financing services through GM Financial.

Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as ""large-cap stocks."" General Motors fits right into that category, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, reflecting its substantial size and influence in the automobile industry.

Fresh off a decisive election win, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger is promising a sharp turn in Virginia’s energy policy, vowing energy affordability for regular ratepayers, boosting in-state power generation, and forcing data centers to “pay their fair share.”

House Democrats, with their new majority, are making energy efficiency a key priority for the 2026 legislative session. They have filed bills to create an energy efficiency task force and to mandate that utilities give qualified customers efficiency upgrades. This fits nicely with local nonprofit Renew Rocktown’s launch of an Energy Check program for low-income households.

Abigail Spanberger has appointed her energy policy transition team to head up her start of an energy policy shift. The team members have lots of experience in sustainable energy.

Now that Virginia Democrats have won control of state government, they’re faced with the challenge of figuring out how to meet surging power demand from booming data centers and rural opposition to solar farms without abandoning the state’s clean energy mandate.

As Virginia’s data center boom strains the grid, a new proposal from Rewiring America shows that tech giants could free up power by footing the bill for residential energy upgrades and still come out ahead.

Dominion Energy is seeking regulatory approval of its largest slate of solar and battery storage projects yet, at nearly a dozen facilities totaling $2.9 billion.

The Washington Post, owned by the world’s largest data center operator, Jeff Bezos, recently claimed that data centers actually lower power costs. This is disingenuous! While discounted rates for big commercial power users (including data centers) have remained stable or decreased slightly in Virginia, they have risen significantly for everyone else.

The Virginia State Corporation Commission approved Dominion Energy’s controversial 944-megawatt gas peaker plant in Chesterfield along with higher electricity rates to pay for it.

Our Climate Crisis

Rising global temperatures have made Earth’s atmosphere more waterlogged, providing fuel for wetter and more dangerous storms. Some regions are more susceptible than others. In the past 85 years, the amount of water vapor moving through the atmosphere has increased 12%.

Antarctica’s Hektoria Glacier retreated five miles in two months, 10 times as fast as the previous record. This has implications for the stability of other glaciers and the pace of sea-level rise on a warming planet.

Showing some progress, the UN Paris Agreement has reduced the projected maximum global warming to less than 3°C degrees by the end of the century, which is down from prior projections of about 5°C. Even 2°C of global warming would, however, make many low-lying islands uninhabitable and swamp millions of square miles of coastal regions around the world.

Despite surging renewable energy, global carbon emissions from fossil fuels are projected to rise to an all-time high this year. Increases are expected to accelerate in the U.S. and the EU but slow in China and India. At this rate the world will blow past the UN climate goal of 1.5°C of global warming in four years.

Politics and Policy

Under intense resistance from fossil fuel interests, the COP30 climate summit in Brazil fell short on drawing up a roadmap for a global transition away from oil, gas and coal. It did agree to launch limited initiatives to strengthen emissions-cutting plans, as well as tripling finance to help poor countries cope with worsening climate change impacts.

The Trump administration is arguing that abandoning fossil fuels is just too expensive and betting that the world will buy American oil and gas for decades to come. Meanwhile, China’s worldwide exports of clean energy technology have more than tripled in the last five years.

The founders of the fledgling Texas nuclear energy startup Fermi America have become billionaires because of its connections to Trump even though it has yet to produce an electron, split an atom, and has little more to show than a glossy, aspirational marketing brochure.

Nations were poised to approve the first fee on pollution from ships. The Trump administration then began threats, including tariffs, sanctions and the revocation of diplomats’ U.S. visas, which effectively killed the agreement.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright condemned the UN COP30 climate summit as harmful and misguided, saying, “It’s essentially a hoax. It’s not an honest organization looking to better human lives.”

This November was a very good election for the planet, with climate-friendly initiatives and candidates winning nationwide. Voters backed funding renewables, reining in energy costs, and building out mass transit — and the people promising to deliver those policies.

At this year’s UN COP30 Climate Summit, the U.S. is out and Europe is struggling. Emerging countries are, however, embracing renewable energy thanks to a glut of cheap equipment from China.

More than 1,600 fossil fuel lobbyists were present at the COP30 climate negotiations in Brazil. This is 60% more than the delegates from the 10 most climate vulnerable countries.

The environmental group 350.org will temporarily suspend programming due to funding woes. President Trump’s threats to investigate left-leaning organizations and his rapid-fire dismantling of environmental rules have hamstrung green groups.

Gov. Josh Shapiro is pulling Pennsylvania out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, bowing to fossil fuel industry claims that it is leading to higher utility bills. Environmentalists see the decision as ‘shocking reversal’ on fighting global warming.

Parking lots in South Korea with more than 80 spaces will be required to install solar canopies. This new law doesn’t just apply to new construction — existing lots will have to comply as well.

Energy

Nuclear power is back due to the skyrocketing demand for electricity, driven by big tech’s hundreds of artificial intelligence data centers. The Trump administration aims to quadruple nuclear output over the next 25 years. This does not address the exorbitant upfront costs of building nuclear plants or the old issue of safely storing radioactive waste.

So much solar power is being generated in the middle of the day in Australia that the federal government will mandate power companies to offer free electricity during those three hours. This provides an incentive to install batteries and to switch electricity use to those hours.

Hyundai still plans to invest $6 billion in a low-carbon steel plant in Louisiana despite the Trump administration’s cuts to tax credits for the green hydrogen needed to produce clean iron and a recent immigration raid on a factory the automaker is building in Georgia.

Germany is investing billions on nuclear fusion for its energy future. Critics say it’s a waste of money as the still unproven technology won’t solve near-term climate and energy problems.

Large manufacturers are increasingly participating in a demand response program in which their industrial facilities agree to power down and switch to local backup sources such as batteries during times of high demand on the grid. They, in turn, receive financial compensation from the grid operator.

People can do a lot to reduce energy use and carbon emissions in their own lives, even in the absence of government action. The recent Energy Smart Home Expo, organized by Electrify Central Ohio, demonstrated what people can do in their own households and communities.

The International Energy Agency forecasts that an oversupply of oil could create a glut of 4 million barrels a day next year. It also forecasts that renewable energy is expected to at least double globally over the next five years.

Global demand for power is growing fast, but hydro plants, the oldest source of clean energy, are struggling because of droughts, floods and other extreme weather linked to climate change.

Tapping energy from “superhot rock” could produce cheap, clean, constant geothermal energy almost anywhere — if drills and wells can survive infernal heat and pressure.

The world’s first highway that can wirelessly charge trucks and other electric vehicles as they drive has been switched on in France.

Land, Food, and Agriculture

In spite of bipartisan agreement on eliminating food waste, the U.S. still squanders roughly a third of its food supply. It’s a huge problem. Globally, if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases.

While the world continues losing huge areas of forest in the tropics, they are making a comeback in some countries including India, China, the U.S., Canada, Russia, and much of Europe. Leading in this, China has added forest the whopping size of Texas since 1990.

Climate Justice

The world’s response to the climate crisis risks deepening inequality rather than addressing it. Less than 3% of international aid to cut carbon emissions is supporting a “just transition” away from polluting industries.

What does the just energy transition mean for Africa where around 600 million people lack even basic access to electricity? Investment in the continent’s abundant sources of solar, wind and geothermal power could meet most of the continent’s energy needs.

Student and Indigenous activists clashed with UN security when they tried to force their way into the COP30 climate conference venue to protest oil drilling in the Amazon.

Pacific island countries won a landmark case at the International Court of Justice, ruling that every nation on earth has a legal obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Now they want countries to act.

In a groundbreaking initiative, the Brazilian COP30 leadership included the Global Ethical Stocktake, which elevates the spiritual, ethical and cultural dimensions of the climate crisis. It organized regional dialogues of diverse voices to reflect on deeper values that should guide climate action.

Rising home insurance premiums are eating into home values in disaster-prone areas of the U.S. As insurance costs more than doubled in various areas, home values have fallen and many owners are stuck.

Pete Hoekstra served as a Michigan Congressman from 1993 to 2011. He served as chairman of the Michigan Republican Party during the 2024 elections. In April, he became the 26th U.S. Ambassador to Canada.

By Anna Clark

Time is winding down for Howard Miller, the storied furniture company and clockmaker in western Michigan that said this summer it will close after 99 years. It identified the Trump administration’s tariffs as a main culprit.

Howard Miller’s closure will cost about 195 people their jobs, most in Michigan. “Our hopes for a market recovery early in the year were quickly dashed as tariffs rattled the supply chain, sparked recession fears and pushed mortgage rates higher,” the company’s president and CEO said in a July press release.

In November, the company hosted a factory closeout sale. Locals shuffled through makeshift aisles bounded by curio cabinets, wardrobes and home bars styled with faux cocktails for an imaginary party.

And there were, of course, the signature grandfather clocks that made Howard Miller famous, both traditional designs of fluted hardwood and contemporary deconstructions with visible gears. Some sported a red, white and blue “Made in Michigan” sticker on their glassy faces.

For nearly a century, Howard Miller was an American success story. But it struggled when President Donald Trump unleashed aggressive and fast-changing tariffs this year on both specific countries and business sectors. Some countries responded with retaliatory tariffs. Along the way, there were pauses, escalations and reports of progress toward some 14 trade agreements, falling short of the administration’s prediction of 90 deals in 90 days.

Companies like Howard Miller — a domestic manufacturer that imports certain goods and products — were caught in the middle. Tariffs led to rising costs on essential components that were unavailable domestically, according to the company.

Pete Hoekstra saw it coming. Now the U.S. ambassador to Canada, Hoekstra was a nine-term congressman until 2011, representing the Michigan community where Howard Miller is based. He also was a vice president at the modern furnishings company now known as MillerKnoll that was co-founded by Howard Miller’s father, Herman.

In Congress, Hoekstra said tariffs were bad for business and consumers.

“The market should dictate the price of steel, not the government,” Hoekstra testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in 2003 on President George W. Bush’s temporary steel tariffs.

Tariffs drive up costs for furniture-makers and other manufacturers in his district, Hoekstra said at the time, leading to dramatically higher prices, longer lead times for production and lost jobs. “Once lost, the jobs will not come back,” he testified.

Today, though, as ambassador, Hoekstra has been a top defender of the president’s approach — a shift that’s mirrored in the changing attitudes of other Michigan Republican leaders on trade.

Hoekstra’s social media posts as ambassador applaud Trump’s efforts to achieve “balanced and reciprocal trade relationships.” And in October, after Ontario’s government commissioned an ad that aired during the World Series using former President Ronald Reagan’s words to champion free trade, Hoekstra reportedly chastised the province’s trade representative in an “expletive-laced tirade.”

An older man with a bald head, wearing glasses and a dark blue suit, points while speaking on a stage with an American flag on a pole behind him.

A White House spokesperson said in an email to ProPublica that the Trump administration “has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy.”

Canada is Michigan’s largest international trading partner. In fact, the state sells more goods to Canada than to Michigan’s next four largest foreign markets combined, according to the Canadian consulate general in Detroit.

But Hoekstra seems to have followed Trump’s lead in engaging with Canada. When Trump repeatedly called for it to become “the 51st state,” Hoekstra said the country’s prime minister might see it as a term of endearment.

Meanwhile, other Michigan enterprises are making hard choices. The Michigan Retailers Association, a trade group, found that two-thirds of retailers surveyed in May said they had to raise prices because of tariffs. Agriculture, the state’s second-largest industry, is also taking a hit. Michigan’s agriculture department reported in late August that tariffs, including retaliatory tariffs, led to big drops in exports. Wheat exports fell by 89% compared to last year, fresh cherries by 62% and fresh apples by 58%.

And MillerKnoll, Hoekstra’s former employer, said in a business filing that its first quarter gross margin — a measure of profitability — decreased compared to the same quarter of the prior year, which it attributed primarily to “net tariff-related costs.” MillerKnoll issued a tariff surcharge and increased prices to mitigate costs “based on the current tariff environment,” a company executive said on an earnings call.

At Howard Miller, while demand isn’t what it once was for its clocks, the company had diversified its product line, which helped, said James O’Keefe, vice president of sales and marketing. But a subdued housing market limited sales to the people most likely to buy new furnishings, he said, and tariffs dialed up the cost of certain imported products.

It seemed like the family-owned company was put in a difficult position, said Nelson Vandermeer, a product development engineer. “If the federal government had said, ‘Oh, it’s a 10% tariff, constant, this is what it is,’ they might’ve been able to play the game, adjust margins, set pricing,” he said. “They might’ve worked things out. It might’ve been OK.

“But no. It’s just chaos.”

Vandermeer, who’s been with the company for more than 30 years, is grieving as Howard Miller enters its final days. “I loved my job,” he said. “I love the people I work with. When you love something, it’s tormenting to lose it.”

Intertwined Economies

The tall teal pillars of the Ambassador Bridge linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, mark one of the busiest land borders in North America, symbolizing a profitable and once-dependable partnership. To expand capacity for the two-way flow of trade and traffic, a new span is slated to open next year: the Gordie Howe International Bridge, named for the Canadian hockey legend who spent 25 years with the Detroit Red Wings.

Michigan exports $23.3 billion in goods to Canada annually, according to the Canadian consulate in Detroit. That includes cars and trucks, vehicle parts and furniture, agricultural goods and more. Canada is also the largest source of imports into Michigan.

The standing trade agreement between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico was negotiated in Trump’s first term. The president later described it as “the best agreement we’ve ever made.”

Trump pursued some tariffs in his first term, but in his second, he played hardball, championing them as a way to grow American manufacturing while bringing a windfall of tariff revenue into the U.S.

Gordon Giffin, who served as the U.S. ambassador to Canada under former President Bill Clinton, said Trump has “fallen in love” with tariffs. And if there’s already a trade agreement in place, Trump will argue that “whatever president that put the agreement in place was an idiot.”

In the case of Canada and Mexico, Giffin said: “The agreement that’s in place is the one he put in place. And somebody needs to remind him of that.”

When Hoekstra landed at the Ottawa embassy in April, tensions were already high. In order to justify new tariffs on Canada, Trump had declared a national emergency over fentanyl trafficking, though the northern border is not a major source of the drug. Trump’s authority to use such emergency declarations to impose tariffs is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.

The president also questioned Canada’s sovereignty. “To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state,” he said in March. “We don’t need anything they have. As a state, it would be one of the great states.”

Canada responded with “elbows up,” a reference to a defensive posture hockey players take to ward off opponents. Certain stores emptied their shelves of American alcohol. Hockey fans booed during the American anthem. The national and some provincial governments issued retaliatory trade actions. (Many have since been lifted.) Canadian travel to the U.S. cratered. Data from Canada’s statistics office shows 10 consecutive months of reduced travel to its southern neighbor.

Colin Bird, the consul general of Canada in Detroit, told ProPublica that he’s hearing from companies on both sides of the border that are in “wait-and-see” mode or are pulling back on investment, “certainly from Canadian companies investing into Michigan that are being heavily impacted by tariffs.”

“As soon as we’re back onto a steady state relationship, there’s a huge reservoir of goodwill for the United States in Canada, but it’s having a really significant short-term impact,” Bird said.

Hoekstra, a former ambassador to the Netherlands and head of the Michigan Republican Party, made some friendly overtures. In a May video, he discussed his family connection to Canada, as someone born in the Netherlands to parents liberated by Canadian troops during World War II.

“As a Michigander,” Hoekstra said, “you know, a border state, we recognize the close relationship that we have to bring safety, security and prosperity to both of our nations.”

But Hoekstra was also critical of “anti-American” attitudes in Canada and the delay in hammering out a new trade agreement.

Negotiations stalled after Ontario’s ad that featured Reagan saying in 1987 that, in the long term, tariffs “hurt every American worker and consumer.”

An outburst by Hoekstra targeting Ontario’s trade representative at a “state of the relationship” event hosted by the Canadian American Business Council appears to have been provoked by the ad, according to the CBC, Canada’s public broadcaster. At a press conference, Ontario Premier Doug Ford urged Hoekstra to apologize.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said the ad campaign used “selective audio and video” to misrepresent the former president’s address. But while some remarks aired in a different order than in the original speech, the meaning didn’t change. Reagan often championed free trade, including the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.

Trump called the ad “FAKE” and threatened to raise Canada’s tariff rate from 35% to 45%.

“Canada burnt the bridges with America,” Hoekstra said on a CTV newscast. “Donald Trump did not slam the door. … Canada slammed that door shut all by itself.”

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney apologized to Trump. While Ford defended the ad — “What do they expect me to do? Sit back and roll over like every other person in the world?” he said at the presser — Ontario pulled it from the air.

But trade talks have yet to resume. And Hoekstra has signaled that there is still an abundance of ill will.

“Targeting the president of the United States and his policies 10 days before an election, and a couple weeks before a Supreme Court case is heard before the Supreme Court — I’m sorry, that does not happen in the United States of America,” Hoekstra said of the ad campaign at a recent appearance in Canada.

He added: “I would suggest that you seriously consider whether that is the best way to try to achieve your objectives.”

A New Political Reality

Hoekstra isn’t the only politician who has adjusted his approach to trade. U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, representing the district that’s losing Howard Miller, issued a newsletter in 2018 that pushed back on the first Trump administration’s tariff efforts, particularly tariffs on steel from Canada.

“Any perceived short-term gain from these overly broad tariffs may be quickly blunted by hardworking men and women losing their jobs in West Michigan and communities where manufacturing plays a significant role in the local economy,” he wrote.

This year, Huizenga supported Trump’s tariffs. “Is there going to be some adjustments to that? Absolutely,” he told reporters in March. “Is it going to be easy? Not necessarily. Is it the right thing to do? Absolutely it is.”

In response to ProPublica, a spokesperson for Huizenga said in an email that economic realities before and after the COVID-19 pandemic are dramatically different. The pandemic “exposed the dire need to reshore American manufacturing,” the spokesperson wrote.

“President Trump and Congressman Huizenga are fighting to reshore American jobs, restore affordability, and rebuild Michigan’s economy.”

Some companies and labor organizations have applauded the tariffs or found ways to live with them.

An executive with MillerKnoll said on an earnings call that the company raised prices and that it believes this will offset the impact of tariffs in the second half of the fiscal year. Whirlpool, the appliance manufacturer, recently announced a $300 million investment in U.S. laundry operations. While the company said it’s navigating “the near-term unfavorable effects of tariffs,” it also said that it expects to benefit in the end as it competes against companies that depend more on imports.

The United Auto Workers credited auto tariffs, along with union pressure, for Netherlands-based automaker Stellantis’ October announcement of a massive investment at plants in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. Brands made by Stellantis, one of the world’s largest carmakers, include Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep.

“Wall Street and supposed industry experts said this was impossible,” UAW president Shawn Fain said in a press release. But the “race to the bottom created by free trade is finally coming to an end.”

This move by Stellantis involves shifting production away from Ontario.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer celebrated Stellantis “for betting on Michigan once again.” Her statement didn’t mention Trump’s trade policies.

Whitmer isn’t categorically against tariffs, but she’s said that Trump’s approach hasn’t properly calibrated the costs and consequences. After asking state agencies about the effect of tariffs, she announced that they led to higher grocery prices and housing costs. At a business forum in Canada, Whitmer said: “Swinging the tariff hammer hurts us both, damaging supply chains, slowing production lines, and cutting jobs on both sides of the border.”

Over in western Michigan, Vandermeer, the Howard Miller veteran, is among those who are looking for work. “I got 10 more years,” he said, before he’s ready to retire. “I can work, if I find something.”

Browsers at the Howard Miller factory sale in November came with a lot of questions, said O’Keefe, the vice president of sales and marketing, as he surveyed the improvised sales floor stacked with clocks. Many locals had just learned of the closure of the company, which held a special place in community life. At the public library that’s named for Howard Miller, two majestic grandfather clocks stand watch.

“It is sad,” O’Keefe said. “Especially when you walk through the quiet factory floor. They used to be running three shifts.”

O’Keefe said he doesn’t have his next job lined up yet. But for now, he said, he’s got work to do. There’s the last of the inventory to sell.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_peter_hoekstra_56092.png,N,,2025-12-02 02:58:08.473661

Rising energy costs hinder small business owners in growing and operating their businesses

NFIB stands with small business owners in the pursuit of legislation that will provide options for affordable energy. Several bills under consideration in Congress would help alleviate rising energy costs for small businesses by increasing the production of American energy.

“High energy costs have had a serious impact on my business,” said NFIB member Dee Morgan, Flowers Etc. in Dixon, Illinois. “Costs have significantly increased in recent years, and I have been forced to cut employee raises and reduce earnings. We are no longer hiring and unable to expand our business because of the rising price of electricity. I have sadly resorted to shutting off the lights in my store and only turning them on when a customer enters. In addition, this past summer, I reduced store hours to lower costs.”

Three Congressional Review Acts (CRAs) to lower energy costs recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives to move forward for consideration.

H.J. Res. 124 (Passed 216-209): This resolution would overturn a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rule limiting production in the National Petroleum Reserve restricting the development of 23 million acres of land in Alaska. NFIB sent a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives after it passed the Senate 52-45 in October. Repealing this rule would lower energy costs for Americans and allow the infrastructure necessary for production of domestic energy.

H.J. Res. 130 (Passed 214-212): NFIB submitted a letter to members of Congress in support of this resolution, which would repeal the BLM rule restricting coal exploration and energy production on roughly 500,000 acres of land in the Powder River Basin (PRB) in northeast Wyoming. The Senate version of H.J. Res 130 passed 51-43.

NFIB previously supported H.J. Res. 104, which has passed in both chambers of Congress but not yet been signed into law. It repeals a similar rule restricting access to coal exploration on the Montana side of the PRB.

H.J. Res. 131 (Passed 217-209): This resolution would repeal a BLM rule restricting access to 1.15 million acres of land in northeast Alaska for oil and gas production.

In a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives, NFIB wrote in support of this resolution, allowing for the use of this land to lower energy costs for American citizens and businesses. The Senate version of this bill (SJ Res. 91) is currently under consideration.

The site is known as the Tijuana River Valley Community Garden, which is owned by the County of San Diego and managed by a private contractor.

One of the growers in Ed Whited, a Navy veteran.

“It’s kind of a hidden gem,” he said. “Most people in San Diego County don’t really realize we’re here.”

After 30 years in the Navy, Whited decided to spend his retirement planting cauliflower, broccoli, green peas, potatoes, onions, cabbage and other crops.

He works on a quarter-acre plot of land that costs him $1,600 per year plus the water used.

Others lease smaller tracts and grow everything from avocadoes to blackberries to apples.

The community garden has more than 200 growers who all received eviction notices earlier this year.

“The greater San Diego Resources Conservation District who managed this area for the county for years decided they were no longer going to renew the contract with the County of San Diego.”

However, Whited said another contractor secured the rights and has extended the leases giving everyone a reprieve.

“We were really worried we were going to be evicted, but it looks like we’re going to be here for a while.”

Whited sells his produce to small stores and farmers markets.

One concern is whether the food grown by Whited and the others is safe for consumption, considering the amount of contamination in the area, especially with the heavily-polluted Tijuana River next door.

“Our worst problem here is the flooding,” he said. “The river runs right by here; if a plant is touched by water or potentially touched by water, it’s no longer edible or considered edible and it’s a complete loss.”

Whited says it’s happened to him before, and prior to replanting, soil samples had to be taken and analyzed.

“It’s a lengthy process that took months.”

Still, the Navy Veteran loves spending time growing and planting vegetables.

“Learned everything by listening to others and watching YouTube videos,” he said.

Whited says he’s OK financially as long as he breaks even.

“It’s easier to grow stuff than to sell it.”

Whited, who is 70 years old, says the best part is getting close to nature and being outdoors and that breaking even financially is just fine with him.

“Just getting out here working in the soil is really building your body and mind, and that’s what happens, for me, it keeps me off the couch.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/12/community-garden.png?w=1280,N,,2025-12-02 11:07:32.849108

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Utah state senator Nate Blouin held an event to kick off his campaign for Utah’s first congressional district.

Blouin is the latest candidate in the democratic field for the newly drawn first district. Last week, he joined former Utah state senator Derek Kitchen, state senator Kathleen Riebe, and former Congressman Ben McAdams in the race.

Monday morning, Blouin kicked off his campaign at Sugar House Park, giving him a chance to address constituents within the district. Utah Representative Grant Miller (D-Salt Lake City), Salt Lake County Councilmember Natalie Pinkney, and Canyons School Board Member Jackson Lewis spoke at the event, and the three offered their endorsements for Blouin.

“D-1 is a new opportunity to show off how Democrats can lead the way, and it’s going to take a new generation of leaders to shatter the authoritarian coalition of Trump and the billionaire class that is making life miserable for Americans today,” Blouin said at the event.

This campaign kickoff event came shortly after Sen. Bernie Sanders endorsed Blouin. In a post on X.com, Sanders wrote, “We need fighters in Congress who will take on powerful special interests, pass Medicare for All and demand that the billionaire class start paying their fair share of taxes,” adding that Blouin is that fighter and that he is “proud” to endorse him.

This marked a high-profile endorsement from a national figure who is popular among progressives. It could be seen as an indication that this race for the Democratic nominee will become a competition for which candidate can be the most progressive, though of course we are still very early in the campaign.

Remarks made by Pinkney, Miller, and Jackson at the event expressed the idea that this is a progressive district. “This is a progressive district, and we are committed to making sure that we reflect that, not just in our district, not just in our state, but in this country,” Pinkney said.

Derek Kitchen has also presented himself as a progressive candidate, calling himself a “bold progressive fighter for Utah’s new 1st district” on his campaign website. He also previously said that Utah has “the chance to elect a progressive leader who reflects the values of people who live here.”

McAdams and Riebe do not use the word progressive to describe themselves, but they have shown their support for progressive causes like transgender rights and the environment. This is all a reflection of how strongly Democratic this district is, having voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by over 20 points in the 2024 presidential election.

""I've never felt the need to assert my use of the carpool lane,"" he said.","On Monday, the ability of solo EV drivers in the Bay Area to ride in the carpool came to an end. The State's ""Clean Air Vehicle Decal Program"" ended at the beginning of October, but the CHP gave a 60-day grace period to allow drivers to get used to the idea, and tickets would now be issued to violators.

""This was something that, under federal law, this program did end,"" said CHP officer Adib Zeid. ""So, our role is not to capitalize on that. It's merely just to enforce the existing HOV laws.""

Zeid said the CHP is not planning any targeted enforcement efforts now that the stickers have become invalid. But they say they will be ticketing solo EV drivers in the carpool lane, just like any other vehicle, with a fine of $490. The Trump administration officially ended the program, as well as the federal tax credit for EV buyers, but the State of California was already winding the sticker program down anyway.

But when it first started in 2014, it was considered a huge incentive to jumpstart the fledgling electric car industry.

""If you go back over 10 years ago when it was launched, it got a lot of attention,"" said Loren McDonald, CEO of an industry research group called Chargeonomics. ""And in those days, EVs were sort of this new thing, right? And people needed a reason, lots of reasons, to buy EVs. And as a benefit, the HOV access was kind of a big deal. it helped put a lot of people over the top, especially if they commuted in a bad commute on a daily basis.""

McDonald said early EVs, with a range of less than 100 miles, were considered an expensive luxury. But he said as time passed the range and quality of the vehicles increased, and the price dropped to the point that driving in the carpool lane was no longer a necessary incentive.

""The reasons for buying or not buying an EV today has very little to do with being able to drive in the occupancy lane by yourself,"" he said.

But that's how it all started for John Stringer. The founder of the group Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley said the sticker on the bumper was a huge deal back in 2018.

""It's a huge bummer at the end of the day, right?"" he said, about the program ending. ""One of the biggest reasons for buying an electric vehicle has always been you get access to the carpool lane. Pre-COVID and even post-COVID now, traffic is just horrible. It's actually worse now. And one of the biggest reasons why I bought my first Tesla, about seven years ago, was because of the carpool lane, to be able to literally shave off 20 minutes each way to work.""

Stringer bought his new Cybertruck, his fourth Tesla, in 2024, knowing that its HOV privileges wouldn't last long. But not every EV owner qualified anyway, with the State limiting the number and duration of decals that could be on the road. So, having the sticker became a status symbol for some and an irritant to others.

""I imagine the other drivers get pissed off that they're in traffic and you have somebody, because of their car, they don't have to be in the same situation as them,"" said Armando Diaz as he sat in his vehicle at a San Jose charging station.

Diaz may be a rare breed. He bought his Tesla for the technology, but never applied for a sticker because he didn't feel right about his ability to gain a carpool advantage over others.

""I've never felt the need to assert my use of the carpool lane,"" he said. ""If I have a passenger in my car, I will drive the carpool.

Subject: Request for Extension of the Public Comment Period – Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) Draft Risk Evaluation Docket ID: EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0443

Dear Dr. Beck,

On behalf of National Taxpayers Union (NTU), the nation’s oldest taxpayer advocacy organization, I write to submit the following comments on the EPA’s draft risk evaluation (September 2025) for D4. NTU appreciates the agency’s efforts to assess this chemical under TSCA and to solicit public input. Nonetheless, we must respectfully note our great concern over the preliminary determinations of “unreasonable risk” (or the approach leading to them) on a number of substantive grounds. NTU urges EPA to revise the draft evaluation in multiple respects before moving toward final risk management decisions. Taxpayers have a major stake in ensuring that policies toward D4, as well as the Manufacturer Requested Risk Evaluation (MRRE) process involving D4, are grounded in solid cost-benefit analysis.

As you know, Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) is a building block of silicone products, and is the backbone of America’s important silicone industry. As the key intermediate used to produce silicone fluids, elastomers, and resins, D4 anchors a supply chain that reaches virtually every major sector of the modern economy. In fact, D4 is integral in manufacturing electronics, automotive systems, construction materials, all energy technologies, medical devices, aerospace components, and a wide range of everyday consumer products. There are few substitutes that can match silicone’s performance, durability, and versatility at scale.

Because D4 feeds into such a broad production network, it underpins billions of dollars in economic activity and supports America’s manufacturing renaissance. That’s why it is crucial for final rules impacting D4 be thoroughly studied to avoid disruption or overly restrictive regulation that would send ripple effects through industries dependent on silicone-based products. Either of these undesirable outcomes would raise costs for manufacturers and consumers alike.

An unbalanced public policy approach would also weaken U.S. competitiveness in advanced manufacturing, energy development, and high-performance materials, as many cutting-edge technologies rely on stable access to silicone chemistries derived from D4.

Put simply, D4 is not just a chemical intermediate; it is a foundational input that enables high-value industries, supports domestic manufacturing, and strengthens the broader U.S. economy. It has also been safely produced at a commercial scale for over four and a half decades. Yet, for the first time, the agency has concluded that D4 may pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment under certain circumstances.

Aside from the market and economic impacts, taxpayers deserve a prominent voice in this conversation. Silicone-based materials last longer, require fewer replacements, and reduce maintenance needs for public facilities, transportation systems, water infrastructure, and energy grids. Fewer repairs and longer asset lifespans directly translate into savings for taxpayers who ultimately fund these systems.

This taxpayer perspective is incredibly important within the health care conversation, since D4-derived silicones are also essential in medical devices, emergency equipment, and public health technologies. Their reliability and stability help keep procurement costs lower over time and ensure hospitals, first responders, and public agencies have access to materials that work in extreme conditions. D4 is also a vital element in parts for vehicle fleets, structures, and other products that governments at all levels purchase on a daily basis. At a time when federal and state government spending on health care issues reaches record highs year after year, silcones help keep taxpayers costs down.

It is also important that EPA solicit and consider scientific evidence from all stakeholders, no matter who presents it. The decision to rely only sporadically on the data gathered by the MRRE does not seem to have much substantiation. Because this is an important test of how a public-private partnership can work in developing efficient and effective regulation, EPA should be more transparent and comprehensive about how this decision was reached and whether some prudent modifications could be made to ensure that this and other MRREs respect that partnership more fully. Otherwise, time and financial resources will be wasted as EPA simply regulates in the dark.

Under the first Trump Administration, an MRRE for D4 was granted by EPA in the fall of 2020 after the silicones industry formulated—in collaboration with EPA—a carefully overseen environmental monitoring program for numerous sites. The data generated from this program—at full expense of the industry—provided the basis for the MRRE and afforded EPA the information it said it needed for a sound scientific evaluation. Yet, today, what should have been a smoothly progressing MRRE has become threatened by uncertainty, which is inimical to a process whose very success depends on the confidence of its participants in a firmly grounded design and the agency’s commitment to following through with established plans. In several contexts, ranging from local-level Extended Producer Responsibility legislation to a federal proposal for pilot reimbursement methods in the 340B pharmaceutical discount program, NTU has offered the D4 MRRE as a model of how the government and private sector can collaborate on regulation in the public interest. We are hopeful that, with a change of course in EPA’s initial Draft Risk Evaluation, the integrity of this model can be affirmed and upheld.

NTU has previously weighed in on this ever-shifting regulatory landscape. For example, at a June 22, 2022, TSCA oversight hearing before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, EPA’s Assistant Director Michal Freedhoff told the panel, “It is incumbent on the agency to do better.” A subsequent coalition of five organizations led by NTU voiced agreement with that statement, and wrote in a letter to then-EPA Administrator Regan: “We would contend that doing better at EPA should be demonstrated before Congress considers major funding increases in this area of the agency’s responsibility. Otherwise, taxpayer resources will be spent for no constructive purpose.” Those words are as true today as they were three years ago—and certainly applicable to the need for EPA to reconsider its Draft Risk Evaluation for D4.

We agree that making progress on environmental, energy, health care, and other goals in a fiscally and economically sustainable manner will require major contributions from and advances in chemical science. The public policy instruments for achieving this progress require thoughtful calibration. We stand ready to assist EPA in fulfilling this vital task, and we thank you for your consideration.

Trump on buying oil from Venezuela.
Why has the Venezuelan oil industry focused its extraction efforts on the heavy crude extracted from the Orinoco Belt?
Today, the only Venezuelan oil they have is what Chevron exports, which is currently 120,000 barrels per day.
It’s no longer the country of the 20th century which imported enormous amounts of oil and at one point consumed around two million barrels of Venezuelan oil per day.
If US companies can rebuild the Venezuelan oil industry, as María Corina suggests, how feasible is this reconstruction?","An old cliché is gaining traction amid the relentless barrage of content about the Trump administration’s military pressure on the chavista regime: that the United States wants to seize Venezuelan oil. Like all good myths, it has a grain of truth. It is rooted in Latin America’s history with the US, and it fits into the big story told by leftist classics recently discovered by young North American readers, such as Eduardo Galeano’s Open Veins of Latin America, which reduces everything to an eternal spoil in which innocent, peaceful republics are ravaged by white tyrants thirsty for minerals.

As expected, chavismo, which was already claiming that Venezuela was a US colony in the 1990s, before coming to power, denounced to OPEC that Trump is after the oil reserves and that the offensive will destabilize the energy market. Naturally, he omitted the fact that the only oil company truly active in Venezuela is American, Chevron, and that, according to The New York Times, he offered Trump immensely advantageous conditions to exploit Venezuelan oil in exchange for being allowed to remain in power.

“…it’s the dirtiest, worst oil probably anywhere in the world…”

Donald J. Trump on buying oil from Venezuela.

Yes, Trump seems to incarnate in many ways an anti-imperialist caricature, and yes, Venezuela has the largest crude oil reserves, as many commentaries on the country are careful to remind foreign audiences these days. But that has its nuances, and what matters is how much Venezuela can offer, and how much out of that can really be of interest for the US.

What do those Orinoco Oil Belt reserves mean today for Venezuela and for the US? To what extent would the US want to get its hands on them, and why would it need to remove chavismo to do so? In order to answer these questions, we turned to one of the world’s leading experts on Venezuelan oil, Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program of Baker Institute at Rice University.

Why has the Venezuelan oil industry focused its extraction efforts on the heavy crude extracted from the Orinoco Belt?

Venezuela has abundant extra-heavy resources in the Orinoco Belt and relatively limited reserves of medium and light crude oil in the Lake Maracaibo Basin and northern Monagas. The decline in the Monagas fields has been significant, and to compensate for the loss of production, the Orinoco Belt, or Faja Petrolifera del Orinoco, was developed in Southern Venezuela. It has been active since the state oil industry opened to foreign investment in the 1990s, when technology was developed to make extraction costs reasonable given the much lower oil prices of that era, which became far more attractive after the Belt’s rise. Today, almost 60% of Venezuela’s oil production comes from the Orinoco Belt. The challenge with this crude is that it requires additional processing because it is heavy. Only about 8% of it flows to the surface, compared to the 50% flow rate of conventional crude. Once it’s on the surface, you have to do something to move that heavy crude through a pipeline to the Jose Cryogenic Complex or the ports. When you have upgraders that produce diluents, you can create a closed circuit, making it easier to transport such heavy crude; otherwise, you have to bring in diluents from abroad every time you want to export it. These complications can be solved, and the Orinoco Belt could produce much more crude, more than the smaller, declining fields in the rest of Venezuela, which require much more investment. That’s why the Orinoco Belt is the future of a large part of Venezuela’s oil production.

How true do you think it is that, due to geography and the composition of the available crude, the US should be considered a natural partner and the main destination for Venezuelan oil?

Certainly, the refineries in Texas and Louisiana invested heavily in the capacity to process heavy crudes like Maya from Mexico, Hamaca and Merey 16 from Venezuela, and some from Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. But then Mexican, Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Brazilian output fell, and the supply of heavy crude from Latin America became much more complicated. Canadian extra-heavy crude could fill that gap, but since the Keystone XL pipeline, which could carry 800,000 barrels per day, was never built, it can’t reach Texas and Louisiana from the Alberta sands. So refineries are using more light crude, which is more expensive on the market, and part of their installed capacity remains idle. This also means that if heavy crude production in the Orinoco Belt were to increase, those refineries, which previously imported half a million barrels per day of Venezuelan crude, would have an appetite for importing it. Today, the only Venezuelan oil they have is what Chevron exports, which is currently 120,000 barrels per day. One could even imagine that the Orinoco Belt crude could capture even more market share. Besides, Venezuela won’t be able to export all that heavy crude just to the US. In any scenario, it would need to export a significant amount to India and China, but it’s true that exporting to the US is very attractive for Venezuela, given its proximity and demand, and the US’s interest in Venezuela doing so.

So, the idea that the US needs Venezuelan crude is true, in that respect, although only to a certain extent. Currently, the US is a net exporter of crude oil. It’s no longer the country of the 20th century which imported enormous amounts of oil and at one point consumed around two million barrels of Venezuelan oil per day. Since it started to exploit its fields in Texas in 2006, it no longer needs to import as much. In fact, it views the region’s producers partly as competitors, not as sources it must secure as it was in the past.

But even so, when the US needs to import oil, it needs heavy crude. And it is indeed interested in extracting oil in Venezuela, because of the profits this represents for US companies, and because Venezuela, like Canada, can be a more stable and closer source of supply than the Gulf countries, which concentrate so much production and have so much control over the market, are more remote, and experience regional instability. That’s why the US wants more oil produced in Venezuela, not because they need to import it as before.

If US companies can rebuild the Venezuelan oil industry, as María Corina suggests, how feasible is this reconstruction? How long might this take, and what would be reasonable goals over a five-year period?",https://www.caracaschronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-8.37.51-PM-1024x452.png,N,,2025-12-02 11:08:00.309991

“We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources,” she wrote.
The National Lab of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” Robertson wrote.
“Solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are the cheapest and most cost-effective resources in Colorado, and they have been for years.","The longtime name of Colorado’s federal clean energy lab is, as of immediately, no longer usable or renewable. At least until a new presidential administration in 2029.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced late Monday that Golden’s storied, half-century-old National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, is no longer to be referred to as such. The new name: National Laboratory of the Rockies, with a complete “energy” outage.

“The energy crisis we face today is unlike the crisis that gave rise to NREL,” assistant secretary of Energy Audrey Robertson said, referring to the 1973 oil crisis in a release posted on the website that at least through Monday night still was using the “nrel.gov” web address. “We are no longer picking and choosing energy sources,” she wrote.

Work at the lab is diverse, from advanced manufacturing to perfecting efficiency in solar panels and wind turbines, searching for ways to generate, transmit and store energy more efficiently, and looking for new sources for rare earth metals and better ways to recycle.

The Trump administration’s department changes have severely cut clean energy grants and attempted to reopen markets for coal mining and burning, as well as increased drilling for oil and gas.

“Our highest priority is to invest in the scientific capabilities that will restore American manufacturing, drive down costs, and help this country meet its soaring energy demand. The National Lab of the Rockies will play a vital role in those efforts,” Robertson wrote.

The release says the immediate name change for the lab founded in 1973 “reflects the Trump Administration’s broader vision for the lab’s applied energy research, which historically emphasized alternative and renewable sources of generation, and honors the natural splendor of the lab’s surroundings in Golden, Colorado.”

Clean energy advocates were dismissive of the name change.

“Solar, wind, and other clean energy technologies are the cheapest and most cost-effective resources in Colorado, and they have been for years. Changing NREL’s name will not change that fact,” said Michael Hiatt, deputy managing attorney for Earthjustice in the Rocky Mountains. “The reality is that the Trump administration’s attacks on clean energy and its attempts to prop up uneconomic coal and gas plants are increasing costs and causing unnecessary energy affordability burdens for millions of Americans.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/20211101-Colwell-CoSun-NREL-perovskite-solar-A8C9046.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 21:59:03.323892

The amendments represent the most significant environmental law reforms since the EPBC Act commenced in 2000, heralding “a new era for the environment and productivity in Australia”, according to Prime Minister Albanese.

As summarised in our previous Insight, the reform package to the EPBC Act comprises seven Acts:

Environment Protection Reform Act 2025 (Reform Act);

National Environmental Protection Agency Act 2025 (NEPA Act);

Environment Information Australia Act 2025 (EIA Act);

Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (Restoration Charge Imposition) Act 2025 (Restoration Charge Act); and

three separate acts concerning the imposition of general, customs and excise charges under the EPBC Act.

The Acts passed on 28 November 2025, with some elements, namely the transitional provisions and the provisions enabling establishment of the National Environmental Standards (NES), to commence following Assent. The NEPA Act and EIA Act will commence on 1 July 2026, together with parts of the Reform Act that relate to the NEPA. The balance of the Reform Act’s provisions will commence upon proclamation or within 12 months.

This insight explores how key parts of the EPBC Act have changed. We unpack key amendments resulting from the deal and in response to submissions received from the business community, and consider the new draft NES that are open for public comment until 30 January 2026.

Key reforms to environmental law

Several key changes have been introduced.

National Environment Protection Agency (NEPA)

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, section 515AAA and Part 17 and NEPA Act

The NEPA Act establishes the National Environment Protection Agency. Its core functions are to undertake compliance and enforcement activities, including undertaking audits, issuing environment protection orders (EPOs) and monitoring and auditing the operation of bilateral agreements and bioregional plans.

In response to concerns from the business community, amendments were passed to limit the duration of EPOs to a maximum of 14 days (which the CEO of NEPA can only extend by an additional 14 further days). The Minister for Environment and Water (Minister) may delegate any functions (including the power to assess and approve projects), other than those specified in section 515(1A), to the CEO of NEPA.

The CEO of NEPA’s enforcement powers are set out by way of amendments to Part 17 (Enforcement) of the EPBC Act, including powers relating to environment protection orders under a new Division 13A.

Head of Environment Information Australia (HEIA)

Relevant legislation: EIA Act

The EIA Act establishes the Head of Environment Information Australia, an independent leadership position responsible for improving the national availability and accessibility of high-quality environmental data and information.

The HEIA will also be responsible for producing State of Environment reports every two years, establishing environmental economic accounts and declaring national environmental information assets (such as a public environment data portal). The first report must be prepared no later than 15 December 2028 (schedule 3, part 2, section 4).

National Environmental Standards (NES)

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 19B Draft NES

The Minister has new powers to make National Environmental Standards in the form of legislative instruments.

The NES are subject to ‘no regression principles’ under section 514YG, which prevent future variations or revocations to NES weakening environmental protections. To date, two draft NES have been released for public consultation:

Matters of National Environmental Significance; and

Offsets.

The NES need to be taken into account in exercising several functions under the EPBC Act, including at the approval stage of a controlled action under section 136B (discussed below). Further details on NES are outlined below.

Assessment pathways for controlled actions

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 8, Division 5A and amendments to section 87

A new 30-day ‘streamlined assessment’ pathway is introduced, replacing the following assessment methods for controlled actions: assessment on referral documentation and a public environment report.

‘Fossil fuel actions’ (that involve producing or extracting petroleum or coal) are expressly excluded from streamlined assessment under section 87(5A).

All assessment pathways for a controlled action now require a proponent to disclose estimates for scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions under section 33 and Chapter 4, Divisions 4, 5A, 6 and 7. Further details are outlined below.

Approval tests

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 9, sections 136A, 136B and 136C

The Minister must not approve an action unless satisfied that:

Section 136A – the approval is consistent with any prescribed NES;

Section 136B – the action will not have unacceptable impacts on a protected matter, as defined in section 527F; and

Section 136C – the approval passes the net gain test in section 527K.

The Minister may approve an action that does not meet these tests if the action is a national interest proposal as determined by the Minister under Division 2A of Part 11 or where a national interest exemption applies under Division 3 of Part 11. Fossil fuel actions are expressly excluded from being national interest proposals (section 157A).

The exemption for Regional Forest Agreements will be phased out and will no longer be exempt from application of the EPBC Act. Therefore, it must meet these tests. Further details are outlined below.

Unacceptable impacts

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, section 527F

A new definition of ‘unacceptable impacts’ is introduced that is specific to each matter protected by Part 3. For example, an unacceptable impact is a significant impact that seriously impairs the viability of a listed threatened species.

New definitions of ‘seriously impairs’ and ‘viability’ are also introduced in section 528. A significant impact of an action ‘seriously impairs’ something if, compared to the action not being taken, the impact results in an impairment or alteration of the thing that is of a severe nature or extent.

The Minister is required to consider whether an action will have an ‘unacceptable impact’ in the exercise of several functions under the EPBC Act, notably at the referral stage, under existing section 74B, and at the approval stage under section 136B. Further details are outlined below.

Lapsing of not controlled action decisions

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 7, Division 4

New section 79F of the EPBC Act provides that a decision that an action is not a controlled action (NCA) or not a controlled action if taken in a particular manner (NCA-PM) will lapse after five years if the action has not substantially commenced before that time. This does not apply to actions which have already secured such decisions before the Reform Act commences. New section 79G, introduced via the latest round of amendments, allows proponents to request the Minister to extend the lapsing date for up to 10 years from the original decision.

Regional planning

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 12A

Bioregional plans may now be created in conjunction with State and Territory governments. The plans will map ‘development zones’ in which certain registered ‘priority actions’ will not need to be referred or approved under Part 9, and ‘conservation zones’ in which listed ‘restricted actions’ will be prohibited unless they benefit from a Ministerial exemption. Further details are outlined below.

Transitional provisions

Relevant legislation: EPBC Reform Act, Schedule 1, Part 3

A general rule will apply where actions that have been referred before the Reform Act commences (regardless of whether they are assessed or approved before that time) will not be subject to the new NES, unacceptable impacts, net gain compensation, or greenhouse gas disclosure requirements (Reform Act, sections 688 and 690).

Actions which have had a decision on assessment approach will not be impacted by the replacement of the referral documentation and public environment report assessment pathways with the streamlined assessment pathway (Reform Act, section 683).

New referrals will be dealt with under the new requirements.

New sections 79F and 79G regarding NCA and NCA-PM decisions lapsing will apply to all actions which have not yet been subject to a NCA or NCA-PM decision (regardless of whether the action was referred prior to the Reform Act commencing) (Reform Act, section 682).

Generally, the amendments made to Part 5 of the EPBC Act in relation to bilateral agreements apply to bilateral agreements entered into or varied after the commencement of the Reform Act (Reform Act, section 677(1)).

Penalties

Relevant legislation: EPBC Act, Part 17, Division 15

The EPBC Act now imposes significantly higher penalties for both individuals and corporations.

Section 481A establishes a new civil penalty calculation method. The maximum penalty for corporations will be the higher of:

50,000 penalty units ($16.5m);

three times the total value of benefits derived or detriments avoided from the contravention; or

10% of annual turnover with a maximum of 2.5m penalty units ($825m).

The maximum penalty for individuals will be the higher of:

50,000 penalty units ($1.65m); or

three times the value of benefits or detriments avoided derived from the contravention.

New ‘streamlined assessment’ pathway for controlled actions

A new 30-day ‘streamlined assessment’ pathway in Division 5A of Part 8 and amendments to section 87 of the EPBC Act replaces the following assessment methods for controlled actions: assessment on referral information and a public environment report. This pathway involves the CEO of NEPA or Secretary of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) preparing a report recommending whether the action should be approved, and if so, the conditions of approval. Following negotiations with the Greens, the government determined that ‘fossil fuel actions’ (that involve the production or extraction of petroleum or coal) are excluded from this assessment pathway.

The Minister may only decide to proceed with the streamlined assessment method for an action if satisfied that the approach will allow the Minister to make an informed decision on whether to approve the action. Accordingly, the Minister will need to have all necessary information to decide whether to approve it. This incentivises proponents to provide as much information upfront during the referral stage if seeking the benefits of a quicker streamlined assessment.

After deciding that an action must be assessed by streamlined assessment, the Minister has 30 business days to decide whether to approve the action. Within this 30 day period, the CEO of NEPA or Secretary of DCCEEW must prepare a report to the Minister recommending whether the action should be approved and any conditions of approval. However, requests for further information from the proponent may still ‘stop the clock’ during this period.

All assessment pathways (now comprising accredited assessment, assessment on preliminary documentation, streamlined assessment, environmental impact statement and public inquiry), require proponents to also provide information about their scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, either by disclosing a reasonable estimate of emissions, or stating that their emissions are below a prescribed amount. This information will be publicised on the DCCEEW’s website – whether as part of the action’s referral material, or separately.

New approval tests

Consistency with draft NES

The Minister must not approve an action unless satisfied that, taking into account the conditions to be imposed, the approval is consistent with the new national environmental standards (as applicable) (discussed further below). Amendments were introduced to reverse the test so that the Minister must now be satisfied that an approval is ‘consistent’ rather than ‘not inconsistent’, increasing the standard of the test.

Unacceptable impacts

The Minister must not approve an action unless satisfied that, taking into account the conditions to be imposed, the action will not have unacceptable impacts on protected matters. The Reform Act defines what was previously a discretionary consideration, as to what are ‘unacceptable impacts’.

To respond to concerns from the business community, amendments were introduced in the last round of Bill amendments to clarify the new unacceptable impacts test by removing the reference to ‘likelihood’. In other words, the test no longer considers whether an action is likely to have unacceptable impacts.

The meaning of unacceptable impacts is specific to each particular matter of national environmental significance (MNES) (new section 527F). It includes, for example, a significant impact that seriously impairs the viability of a listed threatened species. The definition of ‘seriously impair’ has also been amended. A significant impact of an action now ‘seriously impairs’ something if, compared to the action not being taken, the impact results in an impairment or alteration of the thing that is of a severe nature or extent. This creates a higher standard (and thus will capture less impacts) than the previously proposed definition, which was where the impact results in the thing being seriously altered for the worse, having regard to the nature, intensity, duration, magnitude, geographic extent and context of the impact.

Part 7, Division 1A of the EPBC Act already empowers the Minister to decide to refuse an action at the referral stage based on the action having clearly unacceptable impacts.

Residual significant impact – net gain test

The Minister must not approve an action that will have or is likely to have a residual significant impact on a MNES unless the Minister is satisfied that, taking into account any conditions to be attached to the approval, the approval passes the net gain test.

New section 527J of the EPBC Act defines ‘residual significant impact’ as a significant impact which cannot be avoided, mitigated or repaired in the course of taking the action or complying with any approval conditions.

The net gain test is defined in new section 527K of the EPBC Act. An approval will pass the net gain test if:

the approval conditions the holder to either compensate for damage to the matter that has been caused by the residual significant impact or pay a restoration contribution charge; and

compliance with the condition(s) results in a net gain for the matter that is at least equivalent to the prescribed net gain for that matter, or that the Minister is satisfied is appropriate.

A draft NES has been released on the topic of offsets which provides a framework for determining the conditions, including to manage residual significant impacts and pass the net gain test (Draft Offsets Standard). Further information about the Draft Offsets Standard is provided below.

The Restoration Charge Imposition Act provides for the imposing of restoration contribution charges on relevant approvals; however, it does not set out the amounts of the charges. Regulations (not yet released) will set out the charge amounts either by prescribing a flat rate or a method to calculate the amount of the charge.

National interest exemption

Pre-reform, the EPBC Act already allowed the Minister to declare that specific actions are exempt from requirements such as assessment or approval if the action is in the national interest (see section 158).

The Reform Act extends the scope of the national interest exemption. The Minister may now:

approve actions that do not meet the new approval criteria regarding inconsistency with NES, unacceptable impacts and the net gain test for actions with residual significant impacts;

require conditions to be attached to an action covered by a national interest exemption and providing for a set period for which such an exemption is granted; and

grant national interest exemptions on its own initiative as well as on application. The aim of this is to allow for quicker responses to national emergencies such as bushfires.

Following concessions, the national interest exemption will not apply to ‘fossil fuel actions’, being actions involving the production or extraction of petroleum or coal.

the Minister must not accredit a framework without being satisfied that it provides for appropriate disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions information (section 46(3)(j)).

the Minister may exclude an action from a bilateral agreement (essentially, having a ‘call-in’ power for actions); and

approval processes for coal seam gas and large coal mining projects that will or are likely to have a significant impact on water resources (known as the ‘water trigger’) will remain with the Commonwealth (sections 29 and 46(1)).

There is a general rule that the amendments made to Part 5 of the EPBC Act in relation to bilateral agreements only apply to bilateral agreements entered into or varied after the commencement of the Reform Act (Reform Act, section 677(1)).

Draft National Environmental Standards

Under the new Part 19B, the Minister has the power to create NES by legislative instrument. Before making an NES, the Minister must be satisfied that the standard will promote the objects of the EPBC Act and align with Australia’s obligations under international agreements specified in the EPBC Act.

DCCEEW has released two draft NES for public consultation until 5pm AEDT on 30 January 2026.

Draft Matters of National Environmental Significance Standard (MNES Standard)

The MNES Standard Policy Position and Legislative Instrument were released for consultation on 5 November 2025. If legislated, the Minister must be satisfied that for actions under Part 9, any decision on whether to approve an action and the conditions to attach to an approval are consistent with the MNES Standard. Principles that apply to the Minister’s decision under the MNES Standards are:

Actions appropriately consider the application of the mitigation hierarchy: a four-step hierarchy to limit the adverse impact of a development on protected matters, being avoidance, mitigation, repair and offsets, in that order;

Actions appropriately consider impacts to protected matters: including direct and indirect impacts to matters of national significance, ‘landscape scale’ impacts and the ‘broader context’ of past, present and reasonably foreseeable events, circumstances or threats affecting a protected matter;

Actions with residual significant impacts to protected matters are compensated: a last resort in the mitigation hierarchy, with requirements further expanded on by the Offsets Standard (see below); and

Actions are supported by evidence.

Draft Environmental Offsets Standard (Offsets Standard)

The Offsets Standard Policy Position and Legislative Instrument were released for consultation on 10 November 2025. The Offsets Standard is intended to be used in determining what conditions to impose on an approval under Part 9 of the EPBC Act where there is a residual significant impact to protected matters.

The Offsets Standard can only be considered by the Minister where the impact to a protected matter is not unacceptable and can be compensated for under the EPBC Act. In this case, the following eight principles would be applied collectively to the Minister’s decision:

Feasibility: the delivery of offset activities should be feasible and based on appropriate and suitable data and information that show the activity will likely contribute to recovery or conservation;

Security: offset activities are securely protected and the site of the offset activity is managed to prevent its loss and degradation (such as by legal mechanisms like covenants on land titles);

Direct and tangible: offset activities should provide a direct, tangible and quantifiable benefit by contribution to the overall recovery and conservation of the affected protected matter;

Measurable improvements: offset activities should deliver measurable improvements relative to a baseline;

Additionality: offset activities should deliver benefits that are additional to any existing conversation activities, investment and regulatory obligations;

Like-for-like: offset activities should provide a like-for-like outcome for the affected protected matter (meaning the offset replaces, restores or protects the same kind of environmental feature or habitat that was impacted);

Relevant area: offset activities should be delivered in an area that is ecologically relevant to the affected protected matter and will enhance the effectiveness of conservation and recovery efforts; and

Offsets commenced prior to impact: offsets should be secured and should commence at the offset site prior to the relevant impact starting at the impact site.

Further draft NES

A draft First Nations Standard is set to be released separately, relating to specific engagement with First Nations people. Minister Murray Watt indicated in Parliament that this standard may be released by the end of the year, or in early 2026. He also stated that he expects to create each of the NES recommended by the Samuel Review, with a Community Consultation Standard and Data and Information Standard currently being drafted.

Bioregional Planning

The EPBC Act contains two regional planning mechanisms that facilitate consideration of cumulative impacts at a landscape scale: bioregional plans and strategic assessment. Following the 2021 Samuel Review’s recommendations, the reforms expand the scope for making bioregional plans and enable environmental management at a landscape scale.

Most of the existing provisions pertaining to bioregional plans have been repealed, and a new Part 12A has been introduced. Section 177AA now allows the Minister to make bioregional plans that apply not only to a Commonwealth area (as was historically the case), but also to a State or Territory area. The plans will apply from the date they commence until they are revoked (new section 177AC), must be consistent with any applicable NES, and will map:

Development Zones, or ‘go zones’ in which priority actions that are registered with the Minister can be undertaken without referral or approval under Part 9, and

Conservation Zones, or ‘no go zones’ in which restricted actions will be prohibited unless proponents have obtained an exemption.

Priority actions in development zones

The bioregional plans will specify, for each development zone, a ‘priority class of actions’ that may have a significant impact on a MNES but will not require approval under Part 9 of the EPBC Act (new sections 37 and 177AC). Bioregional plans may attach conditions to undertaking a priority action in a development zone (new section 177AG). Fossil fuel actions (that involve the production or extraction of petroleum or coal) cannot be a priority class of actions.

Proponents seeking to take a priority action in a development zone must have their priority action registered by the Minister before undertaking it to avoid committing an offence (new sections 177BN and 177CB). They will not be required to make a referral or seek further approval under the EPBC Act. Proponents must, however, take the priority action in accordance with any relevant conditions imposed by the bioregional plan (new sections 37 and 177BB).

A bioregional plan must specify restoration measures for the region that the Minister is satisfied are necessary or convenient to mitigate, repair or compensate for the impact priority actions cause to protected matters (new section 177AH). This could include a measure requiring the payment of a specified amount (a ‘bioregional plan restoration contribution‘). The new Part 12B establishes a Restoration Contributions Holder, a DCCEEW employee that will be charged with delivering restoration actions and investing funds on behalf of the Commonwealth.

Restricted actions in conservation zones

Conservation zones would prohibit restricted actions, creating ‘no-go’ zones of environmental protection unless the proponent obtains an exemption from the Minister (new section 177AK). To grant an exemption, the Minister must be satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist, or that the national interest exemption applies (see new section 177BV). No exemptions can be granted for ‘fossil fuel actions’.

Changes to land clearing arrangements

Changes have also been made to the provisions regulating how land clearing has historically been dealt with under the EPBC Act, specifically:

The Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) exemption will be phased out: RFAs have historically been exempt from the application of Part 3 of the EPBC Act, under section 38. Following negotiations between the government and the Greens, the Reform Act was amended to remove the exemption for high-risk land clearing and RFAs with a sunset period of 12 months beginning on 1 July 2026; and

The ‘continuous use’ exception is removed the day after the Reform Act receives Assent for land clearing located within 50 metres of a watercourse, wetland or drainage lines in a catchment area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and for land that has not been cleared for 15 years (provided the action is not a forestry operation).

The future of environmental protection in Australia

The recent reforms to the EPBC Act represent a comprehensive overhaul of Australia’s environmental regulatory framework, introducing new agencies, higher standards, and more robust mechanisms for assessment, approval, and enforcement. These changes are set to have far-reaching implications for proponents, regulators, and the broader community, particularly in relation to project approvals, environmental offsets, and the management of MNES. As the new regime comes into effect, it is essential for all stakeholders to familiarise themselves with the amended requirements, monitor the development of NES, and actively participate in ongoing consultations. Now is the time for organisations to review their current and proposed activities and assess compliance with the new provisions.",https://www.corrs.com.au/site-uploads/images/banners/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/25_WEBART065_Environment-Protection-and-Biodiversity_1400x450_Web.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 02:58:04.327688

If there were a dictionary entry for Donald Trump’s catchphrase “drill, baby, drill”, it might be accompanied by a photo of Meg O’Neill.

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company’s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana’s history.

The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That’s basically equivalent to Woodside’s combined Australian operations. Trump’s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash “American energy dominance”. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking.

Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is “open for business”, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer.

We are bending the rules of this column: O’Neill and I are meeting for brunch, and the restaurant, Ai Fiori, has no real significance other than its convenient location at the Langham Hotel, where she is staying in New York.

We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O’Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee. Despite seven years in Australia, O’Neill is yet to embrace espresso culture. “I like American-style filtered coffee,” she says. “I brew coffee at home every morning and bring in a thermos.”

O’Neill grew up in the college town of Boulder, Colorado, studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined ExxonMobil. The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh – and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John’s on Newfoundland island.

In 2018, O’Neill joined Woodside as chief operating officer and moved to Perth, becoming its CEO in 2021. She spent most of her career in the closet – “I had a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ approach to who I was at work,” she says – but moving to Australia was the opportunity to come out. She is one of a handful of openly gay people to have led an ASX200 company.

This is O’Neill’s seventh trip back to the US this year. You can see why she might be more comfortable on this side of the Pacific right now. Here, the motto is “drill, baby, drill”, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

That includes an embarrassing 58 per cent of shareholders who voted against the company’s climate report at last year’s annual meeting, and a legal challenge to Environment Minister Murray Watt’s decision to approve an extension of Woodside’s North West Shelf LNG project to 2070. The UN’s special rapporteur on climate has just joined the case as an amicus curiae.

It doesn’t rattle O’Neill. She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels.

She says Trump’s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia.

“It’s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,” O’Neill says.

“It’s opening the conversation up to one that’s not just, ‘We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else’, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.”

O’Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy.

In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O’Neill calls “highly ambitious”. “I don’t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,” she says.

How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. “While there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,” she says.

“The question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input – that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry – has not been addressed. You’re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That’s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.”

O’Neill’s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it “very tasty”. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid.

For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found – from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

In the Australian National University’s recent study on the 2025 election, the proportion of voters who ranked climate change as their most important issue fell to 5 per cent, down from 10 per cent in 2022.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O’Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby’s bidding.

“In Australia, there’s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,” she says.

“So, I don’t know if it’s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it’s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it’s going to end up being poor for the consumers.” She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. “It’s not good for anyone.”

But the hugely controversial North West Shelf extension in Western Australia is expected to be responsible for nearly 90 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent a year – more than the annual emissions of some countries – despite conditions imposed by the federal government as part of its approval. Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country’s largest untapped conventional gas resource.

Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.

New laws that passed the federal parliament last week are a mixed bag for gas producers; coal and gas projects are not eligible for new “streamlined” approval pathways following negotiations with the Greens, but they may benefit from moves to eliminate duplication between state and federal assessments.

Part of this is, again, the Trump effect. Australia’s critical minerals deal with the US, agreed in principle during Anthony Albanese’s recent trip to Washington, means getting rare earth projects off the ground quickly. “Drill, baby, drill” is becoming not just a slogan but a policy the US exports to its allies.

O’Neill lays out a stark reality for a global company such as Woodside, which is eyeing a roughly 50-50 revenue split between Australia and the US early next decade. The US has plenty of gas, favourable taxation rates and a relatively quick process for environmental approvals. In Louisiana, the combined state and federal tax rate will be about 25 per cent, she says, compared with an effective all-in rate in Australia of 46 per cent.

“We have to ask ourselves first and foremost: where is the resource? Australia compares quite favourably to the US [on that],” she says.

“Where do we have confidence we can progress investments at a reasonable pace and generate returns for our shareholders? That’s where we’re fighting some headwinds in Australia.”

There has been speculation Woodside could shift its primary listing to the New York Stock Exchange, but O’Neill says that’s not true. “We intend to maintain our primary listing in Australia.”

Before we leave, I ask O’Neill about life in Perth. She lives in City Beach with her wife, Vicky Hayes, and their teen daughter. Despite its isolation, O’Neill enjoys the relaxed pace and what she calls an “entrepreneurial spirit” that seems to imbue west coast cities.

“I like that feel of a city where people are ready to roll up their sleeves and make a difference,” she says. “It’s got a bit of the wild west to it.”

An NFL fan who backs the Houston Texans, O’Neill has been forcibly acquainted with Australian rules football, courtesy of Woodside’s sponsorship of the Fremantle Dockers. Woodside chairman Richard Goyder is also the outgoing chair of the AFL Commission.

O’Neill says she found the rules “a little fuzzy” and difficult to follow at first, but is now a convert and attends half a dozen matches a year. “I love the game. It’s fast-paced, it’s high scoring, there’s tremendous athleticism. It’s the full package.”

Not that the rules have gotten any easier to understand. “Like, why was this thing a push in the back and that thing was not?”

I could try to explain, but our time is up, and O’Neill is off – more meetings, and more drilling, await.

The initiative is focused on supporting reforestation efforts in areas vulnerable to risk of loss from disaster or environmental change. The agency is accepting funding applications now through Jan. 23.

“Forested and riparian ecosystems across Texas are increasingly threatened by natural disasters and weather extremes,” said Erin Davis, Texas A&M Forest Service program coordinator. “This cost-share initiative will help landowners replant their properties with native woodland species to establish a more resilient and sustainable forest for the future.”

Landowner eligibility and allowances

Non-federal, non-industrial forest landowners, including tribal and local governments, are eligible. Tracts must be 10-150 acres in size and lost trees to a natural disaster, disease or weather extremes in the past 10 years.

Reimbursable practices include:

Site preparation through shredding or mulching at $168.75 per acre or prescribed fire at $27.50 per acre.

Planting trees through bareroot or containerized seedlings at $5.60 per seedling, riparian live cuttings at $375 per acre and/or direct seeding at $337.50 per acre. Landowners must include one type of planting in the planned practices.

Temporary browse protection or barriers to prevent animal damage at $4.90 per seedling.

“Reforestation is an essential part of sustaining the next generation of trees in our forests and woodlands,” Davis said. “We hope to support the restoration of natural landscapes by providing funding to landowners who may have lost trees to natural causes such as fire, flood, disease and drought.”

The program will prioritize projects in areas with gaps in existing funding opportunities for landscape-scale forest restoration and recovery, such as the woodlands in Central and West Texas.

The facility is now producing pipeline-quality RNG and has begun injecting into the interstate natural gas pipeline.

Now one of the largest RNG production plants in the country, South Fork is home to a herd of 16,000 dairy cows and has the capability to produce approximately 2.6 million gallons of low-carbon RNG annually. The facility will process up to 300,000 gallons of dairy manure each day utilizing the four anaerobic digesters on-site, along with manure processing and advanced gas conversion equipment. The RNG produced is injected directly into an on-site gas line. Financed entirely by Clean Energy, the project broke ground in July 2024 and totaled $85 million. Clean Energy will receive 100% of the RNG fuel produced at South Fork Dairy.

“The requirements to reach production and injecting milestones were extremely stringent and we are incredibly proud of the team for getting our seventh RNG facility online, on time and on budget. It’s no small feat,” said Clay Corbus SVP at Clean Energy. “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply to ensure we have the volumes needed to meet the growing fleet demand, but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

“Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us,” said Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy. “We’re processing our manure into useful bedding and producing clean, useful fuel for vehicles – it’s pretty amazing stuff. Being a part of something so circular that allows the dairy to reduce its emissions while providing an additional income stream is an added bonus.”

During construction, the project temporarily paused due to a fire that impacted the dairy. South Fork’s owner, Frank Brand, and his team rebuilt the dairy working closely with Clean Energy to navigate this. Today, both the dairy and the RNG facility are fully restored and operating – an outcome that is testament to the determination of the South Fork and Clean Energy teams.

The RNG produced at South Fork Dairy has received full approval from the U.S. EPA to begin generating renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. Clean Energy also expects to generate California Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits in Q1, 2026. Clean Energy continues to expand its fueling network nationwide with over 600 stations RNG is delivered to.

T Diamond Bar and Montrose Environmental worked closely with the Clean Energy team to complete South Fork facility.

Agriculture accounts for nearly 10% of U.S. GHG emissions and the transportation sector accounts for another 28%, according to the EPA. Capturing methane from farm waste lowers these emissions. RNG, produced by that captured methane and used as a transportation fuel, significantly lowers GHG emissions on a lifecycle basis when compared to diesel. This allows RNG to be one of the only fuels to receive a negative carbon-intensity score based on the reduction of emissions at the source and at the vehicle and costs significantly less than diesel at the pump.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Clean_Energy_Dec2025_a44ddbf887.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 22:59:05.947089

Neighbors of the hazardous waste facility, elected officials, and environmental activists urged the state to address odor and safety concerns and deny US Ecology’s license renewal.
The Wayne County Commission unanimously approved a resolution brought by Commissioner Martha Scott Oct. 2 in opposition to a license renewal for US Ecology.
US Ecology has received dozens of state violations for air quality noncompliance at the Frederick Street facility since 2014, as Planet Detroit reported in September.
The company said the source of the “alleged offsite odors” is a facility slightly downwind of US Ecology.","An environmental coalition is calling for the shutdown of US Ecology Detroit South, a hazardous waste treatment facility on Detroit’s lower east side with a pending license renewal application.

Residents held signs that said “stop odors now,” “we can’t breathe,” and “end the stench, dust, fumes, fires, asthma, waste” at a press conference held Monday by the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments.

Neighbors of the hazardous waste facility, elected officials, and environmental activists urged the state to address odor and safety concerns and deny US Ecology’s license renewal.

No permits should be issued for US Ecology until it shows it has followed the law, said state Rep. Tonya Myers Phillips, whose district is located just north of US Ecology’s location at 1923 Frederick St., southeast of the I-75 and I-94 interchange.

“Every family in this room and in our community has the right to breathe clean air,” Myers Phillips said at the press conference, held at the Hamtramck Public Library. “Simply put, US Ecology has to follow the rules like everybody else.”

Resident KT Morelli said that US Ecology should “shut down, at the very least, until the odor problem is resolved.” If the permit for the facility cannot be denied, the state should put a hold on the process, she said.

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, “has tolerated serial permit violators for too long,” she said.

The Wayne County Commission unanimously approved a resolution brought by Commissioner Martha Scott Oct. 2 in opposition to a license renewal for US Ecology.

“No one should have to endure what people living near this site have had to endure, in terms of odor, dust, and the outdoor storage of hazardous, flammable, and potentially hazardous materials,” Scott said in a statement.

Kinga Osz-Kemp, who moved to her home a half-mile from US Ecology 18 years ago, said she thought for a long time that the problem in the neighborhood was the trash incinerator.

The notorious Detroit Renewable Power incinerator closed in 2019 after 30 years of operation.

After the trash incinerator’s closure, Osz-Kemp said she “was able to smell the isolated smells from US Ecology,” describing the odors as rotten fish, lime, and “weird chemical smells.”

EGLE, which regulates US Ecology, is still evaluating comments it received during the public comment period for the license renewal, spokesperson Josef Greenberg Stephens told Planet Detroit in an email Monday.

The agency is also awaiting resolution of air quality violations issued to US Ecology, Greenberg Stephens said: “A final decision will not occur until these steps are completed.”

The environmental regular appreciates the engagement of the Detroit Hamtramck Coalition for Advancing Healthy Environments and the Wayne County Commission in the licensing progress, Greenberg Stephens said.

“EGLE is aware of the issues and is working with US Ecology South to identify and implement effective, sustainable solutions.”

Melissa Quillard, a Republic Services spokesperson, said in an emailed statement that US Ecology provides a “safe, essential hazardous waste disposal for hundreds of businesses across Michigan and the Midwest.”

Recent upgrades at the facility include a “state-of-the-art tank system, improved storage processes, enhanced waste handling procedures, and a new on-site lab for material testing,” she said in response to a request for comment on the calls for a shutdown.

“To address community concerns about odor, the facility recently updated its odor management plan, added a fourth air monitoring station and is evaluating additional air pollution controls,” Quillard said, adding that US Ecology hosts quarterly public meetings and has a website where residents can sign up for email updates and connect with the company.

US Ecology has received dozens of state violations for air quality noncompliance at the Frederick Street facility since 2014, as Planet Detroit reported in September.

The most recent violation issued by EGLE, dated Oct. 10, followed the investigation of an odor complaint. The state found “persistent and objectionable fishy/oily/gas odors of moderately strong intensity” that it attributed to US Ecology’s Chem-Fix operations, “impacting residential areas downwind of the facility.”

In its response to the state agency, US Ecology said no odor was identified in its Chem-Fix operations. The company said the source of the “alleged offsite odors” is a facility slightly downwind of US Ecology.

In July 2024, the state and US Ecology reached a consent agreement that redresses multiple violations issued to the facility between 2021 and 2023, including improper storage of hazardous waste, a fire, and a leak that posed a contamination threat to groundwater.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Coalition1-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 21:00:33.104652

But the question is whether those costs will reach the residential utility payers on their home electric bills.
Data centers in Port Washington and Mount Pleasant alone will use more energy than the rest of the consumers in the state.
Content explained that it took 120 years for We Energies to grow from 1 kilowatt to a gigawatt to five gigawatts of energy capacity but these two data centers will double that capacity need in a few years with more large-scale data centers coming, like a Meta data center in Beaver Dam.
“We’re in this inflationary environment already and now here come data centers,” Content said.","(The Center Square) – Increased energy use from artificial intelligence data centers in Wisconsin will have a cost.

But the question is whether those costs will reach the residential utility payers on their home electric bills.

“And the tech companies are saying the right things and the utilities are saying the right things,” Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin Executive Director Tom Content said at a recent Wisconsin Technology Council panel on data centers. “All of our commission chairs are saying the right things that the cost causers are meant to pay.”

A big part of the reality is capacity, how much energy data centers need and how much the state’s utilities have to offer.

Alliant Energy’s Becky Valcq explained that utilities have constant infrastructure costs to ensure that the lights turn on when someone flips on a switch at their home or office. Having new large-scale customers like data centers that pay a large portion of infrastructure costs through their payment agreements with utilities can then offset those ongoing costs, which are a large portion of the bill that consumers pay.

“When we talk about growth, from a utility perspective, especially a utility that has a largely rural service territory, growth is good,” said Valcq, Alliant’s assistant vice president of regulatory affairs and data center services. “Why is it good? It’s because of all those fixed costs that we have regardless. The more customers we bring on, the lower those fixed costs are for all of our customers.”

Power capacity, however, is a large issue in the matter. Data centers in Port Washington and Mount Pleasant alone will use more energy than the rest of the consumers in the state.

It’s why Wisconsin leaders are pushing tax breaks for new nuclear plants.

Content explained that it took 120 years for We Energies to grow from 1 kilowatt to a gigawatt to five gigawatts of energy capacity but these two data centers will double that capacity need in a few years with more large-scale data centers coming, like a Meta data center in Beaver Dam.

“We’re in this inflationary environment already and now here come data centers,” Content said. “The utilities do have an obligation to serve and it’s always a question of at what time is the system ready for this project and can the system accommodate it?”

Data centers are expected to lead to the average American’s energy bill increasing from 25% to 70% in the next 10 years without intervention from policymakers, according to Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Jack Kemp Foundation.

The data centers are being brought in and given large-scale tax benefits, such as incentives negating property taxes along with sales taxes on everything from construction to servers to electricity, without the promise of many new employees and question marks on the lifespan of the developments.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/2e/52e491d0-a640-4768-939c-bd8baf7c710a/69025d10eaee7.image.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:55.966258

Dr Shi, Founder of the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry, says: “I am proud to establish the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry and bring commercial-scale renewable manufacturing to Australia.
Round 1B offers $50 million of funding to support solar PV manufacturing studies, including feasibility and engineering studies (remains open).","The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) has today announced up to $151 million in conditional funding under the Australian Government’s $1 billion Solar Sunshot Program (Solar Sunshot) for the establishment of a 500 MW per annum solar module manufacturing facility in the Hunter Valley, NSW.

The funding will support the development of the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry project, an initiative of the Sunman Group (Sunman) founded by solar pioneer and UNSW alumnus Dr Zhengrong Shi. The project will develop a new, advanced manufacturing facility while drawing on Sunman’s pioneering technology and track-record as a lightweight solar innovator.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said the project is a clear demonstration of Solar Sunshot’s mission to advance solar manufacturing in Australia, reduce reliance on imports and expand Australia’s role in global clean energy supply chains.

“Deployment of solar photovoltaics at scale is central to meeting our long-term emissions goals. Building our manufacturing capabilities will help ensure that our supply chains are resilient and Australian innovations are supported as we accelerate the rollout of solar PV,” Mr Miller said.

“Solar Sunshot is about building on Australia’s world-leading solar research to expand manufacturing capacity, strengthen supply-chain resilience and grow local jobs and skills. The Hunter Valley Solar Foundry project reflects these goals, bringing together advanced technology, local workforce development and long-term economic benefits for regional communities.”

The proposed facility aims to produce a range of solar PV modules for use in domestic and international markets, including Sunman’s proprietary enhanced Architecture Ready Composite (eArc) modules, which replace traditional glass with durable polymers, making them up to 70% lighter, easier to transport and faster to install. Beyond manufacturing eArc modules, the facility aims to produce glass modules, develop a solar innovation hub to support the commercialisation of new solar technologies and operate as a solar manufacturing foundry with the ability to provide production capacity to original equipment manufacturers, further strengthening Australia’s domestic solar supply chain.

This project also marks a homecoming for Dr Shi who began his pioneering solar research in Australia before global ambitions took him abroad to scale-up solar manufacturing. With Solar Sunshot backing, this new facility will bring world-leading solar expertise back to Australian shores, reaffirming Australia’s strength in solar innovation and positioning Australian-made technology to contribute to the global energy transition.

Construction of the facility is expected to create up to 200 jobs, with another 100 ongoing roles once operational. To support long-term workforce development, the project will also partner with an accredited training partner to deliver an advanced manufacturing training program, ensuring local workers can build capability in next-generation solar production.

The project further incorporates a First Nations recruitment strategy and a scholarship program to support students pursuing studies in renewable-energy fields, ensuring the benefits of Solar Sunshot extend across the community.

Dr Shi, Founder of the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry, says: “I am proud to establish the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry and bring commercial-scale renewable manufacturing to Australia. Once established, the Hunter Valley Solar Foundry will be the largest manufacturer of solar photovoltaic modules in Australia, and the only one in NSW, delivering world-leading products to residential, commercial and utility customers around the country.

“As a proud Australian and a solar expert trained at the University of NSW, it has been my long-held ambition to establish solar module manufacturing in Australia, and it is my hope that over time the Foundry supports the foundation of a vertically-integrated solar supply chain in Australia. This is an important milestone in Australia’s energy transition.”

The Cadillac Optiq is probably one of the quietest cars we’ve ever driven, even for an EV.","This largish “compact” crossover SUV is luxurious, quiet, and offers substantial range along with premium features, making it a truly competitive luxury EV—and shoppers are noticing.

The conversion of GM’s luxury brand Cadillac to an all-electric product line has been a quietly seismic event over the last decade. The brand is finding (it says) newer, younger and more tech-forward buyers, versus the aging customers who bought its luxury land barges of yore. But while the Lyriq mid-sized crossover SUV went on sale in July 2022, the electric model that may be Cadillac’s most important EV globally didn’t land in showrooms for more than two years after that.

The Optiq, a largish “compact” crossover SUV, could become the luxury brand’s highest-volume vehicle worldwide. At a US starting price of around $50,000, the Optiq is the most affordable Cadillac EV. But it’s also assembled in Mexico, making it subject to tariffs when or if the ever-shifting landscape of trade policy settles down. Still, by the second quarter of this year, it was Cadillac’s second-best selling electric model in the US after the well-established Lyriq.

The Optiqs we’ve driven have been calm and quiet inside, with elegant fabrics and trim to cosset occupants. Overall, the Optiq is perfect for long-distance travel or around-town use—and perhaps the best environment for GM’s excellent Super Cruise hands-free adaptive cruise control, which now includes automatic lane changes.

Cadillac’s small SUV isn’t perfect: the exterior styling is more of a judgment call, and the rear quarters are downright peculiar. It’s missing a front trunk and a rear wiper, and neither Android Auto nor Apple CarPlay can be included (in the US) no matter how loud buyers scream. Acceleration of the standard versions is deliberate, though we’ve not yet driven the Optiq-V performance model. That one received rave reviews from both buff books and general outlets.

Two thirds handsome?

This is the smallest and shortest Cadillac, and the front two-thirds of the Optiq largely echo the other EV models in the lineup. It’s at the rear where things start to go wrong—perhaps from designers trying too hard to be avant-garde in the brand’s shortest vehicle. The combination of a beltline that kicks up, the very short overhang behind the rear wheels, the signature vertical rear lights running up the side of the tailgate, and a strange pattern on the third side windows that superimposes lines that aren’t actually horizontal is just incoherent.

It offers a little too much visual stimulation in too small a space. The rest of Cadillac’s electric SUVs, as well as the Celestiq ultra-luxury sedan, use the same design cues to better and more pleasing effect.

With a high beltline, only the Optiq’s glass roof gives the interior enough light to prevent a slightly claustrophobic feel. Once you get there, though, the interior is splendid. Fabrics feel like real woven cloth, though they’re auto-interior-grade durable, and Cadillac has pulled off the delicate act of using mild bright-blue accent trim just enough—but not too much. US buyers historically haven’t cared about the sustainability of a car’s interior, but the Optiq uses what it calls PaperWood veneer (ingredients include tulip wood and recycled newspaper) and patterned accent fabrics made of yarn from 100% recycled feedstock.

Deliberate acceleration—until the Optiq-V appears

An 85-kilowatt-hour battery pack powers two drive motors with combined output of 224 kilowatts (300 horsepower) and 354 pound-feet (480 newton-meters) of torque. All-wheel drive is standard.

Acceleration of the standard Optiq can best be termed deliberate. It’s fine for standard use, and—if any Cadillac owner ever uses it—the Sport mode adds some punch. The standard Optiq just doesn’t offer the kind of kick-in-the-back acceleration found in Teslas. That’s left to the recently announced Optiq-V performance model, whose power rises to 382 kW (519 hp) with 650 lb-ft (880 N-m) of torque. Cadillac says the Optiq-V will rocket from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds if drivers use its Velocity Max mode. The Optiq-V goes into production this autumn as the priciest model in the Optiq range, starting at $68,795, with a range that GM estimates at 275 miles.

The compact Cadillac holds the road fine and is easy to drive—the weight and suspension are tuned to make potholes less jarring and smooth bad road surfaces. GM has superbly calibrated regenerative braking and one-pedal driving algorithms, and the Optiq’s learning curve overall shouldn’t be as steep as that for a Tesla or other entirely screen-based EVs.

The Optiq hardly leads the pack on charging speed, however. The difference in fast charging times is only a few minutes, but Cadillac is behind in the specs war against 800-volt EVs like the Genesis GV60, which charges at up to 300 kilowatts. On our Optiq road test, the fastest rate we saw was 107 kW (at a station rated for 150 kW) while taking the battery from a 25 percent to a 60 percent charge—after preconditioning before we arrived at the charging site. Cadillac claims the Optiq can gain up to 79 miles of range in only 10 minutes, though that’s the usual manufacturer statistic achieved under ideal circumstances of battery temperature, ambient temperature and low state of charge. As they say, your mileage may vary. The onboard AC charger is capable of up to 11.5 kW.

Optiqs built through most of 2025 use a CCS fast charging port. However, the upcoming Optiq-V will have a native NACS (SAE J3400) connector built in—the first GM electric vehicle so equipped. The company said in June 2023 that it would adopt NACS across its portfolio. Now, more than two years later, it’s starting to happen; the rest of the Optiq line will likely follow suit.

The combined range rating from the EPA presently sits at 302 miles, which likely means around 260 miles at highway speeds using climate control. Crucially for road trips, that’s still beyond the distance many drivers can comfortably go without a rest stop.

Silent, spacious and Super Cruise

Interior space in the Optiq is ample for four. It’s large enough, even as a so-called compact SUV, to accommodate three people in the rear seat without making them elbow or jostle each other. But like all of GM’s current EV lineup except for the huge trucks, the Optiq has no front trunk—a missed opportunity to underscore an EV advantage that cars with combustion engines simply can’t offer. The Optiq also lacks a rear wiper, whereas the Chevrolet Equinox EV that shares its basic understructure has one as standard. The luxury brand claims airflow through the Optiq’s “rear flow-through spoiler” directs air over the glass at a high enough velocity to keep the rear window clean. After several spring deluges en route, we disagree. Cadillac also suggested that we use the video rear-view mirror function (instead of a rear window we could see through).

The Cadillac Optiq is probably one of the quietest cars we’ve ever driven, even for an EV. The experience of driving or riding in an Optiq is calm, smooth, pleasant, and altogether nice inside. That makes it an easy vehicle in which to cover miles—especially with the Super Cruise hands-off adaptive cruise control. Many analysts view Super Cruise as the best of the small number of hands-off adaptive cruise control systems offered in cars.

For the last year or so, the system has included automatic lane changes: it will check to ensure the overtaking lane is clear, signal, change lanes, pass the other car, then return to the slower lane. (That last step will be particularly appreciated by everyone who’s sat behind a driver going far too slow in the fast, or overtaking, lane.) Cadillac and other GM brands alert the driver to both lane departures and upcoming lane changes by vibrating the driver’s seat bolster on the relevant side. That conveys the message to the driver, without alerting other occupants as audible warning tones do. Drivers appreciate that.

Google Maps in the dash routes the Optiq among charging stations en route once drivers enter a destination into the system that exceeds the car’s range. Anyone who’s used Google Maps before will find that the mapping and routing works predictably enough, though it’s still not quite up to Tesla standards of seamlessness. Nor are the various charging stations among which the Optiq routes itself, operated by multiple networks, nearly as reliable as Superchargers. The system notes a charging site is “slow,” “fast,” or “very fast”—and importantly, it preconditions the battery automatically if it knows it’s headed for a DC fast charging site.

No phone mirroring (for US buyers)

One feature most buyers will likely expect—but not find—is phone mirroring into the central touchscreen via Android Auto or Apple CarPlay. Tesla, Rivian and Lucid have never offered mirroring, and GM has chosen to remove it from its latest electric vehicles (in the US—it’s still right there in the dash for buyers in at least some other countries).

So, drivers and family members will have to remember their user names and passwords for the dozen or more apps in the dash they use regularly. (Do you remember your Spotify login info?) The Optiq gives access to those apps via its cellular connection. For three years. Then the hammer comes down: owners who want to continue to use their apps must pay Cadillac to continue to receive “App Access” beyond that. The fee is $15 each month, or it can be bundled into plans for OnStar and other features. Note that the App Access fee is on top of the $25-per-month cost to continue Super Cruise, which has its own 36-month free trial period.

Both luxury cars and EVs have higher leasing rates than other models, so we surmise the first buyer won’t have to worry over the three-year lease—and GM doesn’t sell new cars to those who will buy these models used. Except now it can target them as a source of recurring monthly fees. Why did GM do this? It’s one aspect of the “digital services revenue” that carmakers promised the financial world would earn them billions of dollars a year in new revenue. Buyers are the losers here; they must pay a monthly fee for a feature they used to get for free. Or revert to the distraction of a handheld phone, the reason phone mirroring was invented in the first place.

After spending eight days and 840 miles in an Optiq around New York City and environs, including forays into the rural agricultural regions of the state, we think it shows real promise. It’s quiet, comfortable, and well-suited to highway miles. Our few reservations sit with its software, and that has to be a matter for the paying customers to take up with GM.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-cadillac-optiq.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:31.665480

Entergy Corp., the largest investor-owned utility company in the state, announced it broke ground on its Franklin Farms Power Station project in Richland Parish. The company disseminated a photo from the groundbreaking ceremony showing a group of politicians, regulators and corporate executives digging into a box of sand at the construction site.

The facility will power a massive $27 billion data center Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is building. It will feature two natural gas-powered plants able to generate about 1,500 megawatts of electricity, many times more than what the sparsely populated farming community of Richland Parish consumes.

Proposed less than a year ago, the fast-paced power project received expedited approval from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August. New power plants of similar type typically go through several years of planning and hearings before construction begins.

Construction on Meta’s largest data center brings 600% crash spike, chaos to rural Louisiana

The new power plant complex is being built specifically for the data center, though it will be connected to the larger electric grid and could supply power to other customers.

Construction on the data center itself is also underway, bringing loads of new workers and traffic to the normally sleepy Richland Parish.

The Franklin Farms project, which is expected to come online in late 2028, is not the only power station Entergy is building for the data center. Entergy plans to build a third plant at its Waterford nuclear power plant site in St. Charles Parish, with an expected operational date by the end of 2029.

Together, all three gas plants will be able to generate approximately 2,200 megawatts of electricity, which is more than twice the capacity of the entire city of New Orleans, according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” Entergy Louisiana CEO Phillip May said in a news release. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ETR2643-2048x1152.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 18:04:27.582830

As one of California’s most influential climate think tanks, Berkeley Law’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment (CLEE) is actively engaged in shaping state-level decision-making. Working with nonprofit sponsors and legislative staff, its experts provide objective research, data, technical assistance, and drafting language to support key policy advancements across the environmental landscape.

During California’s recently concluded legislative session, CLEE delivered preliminary research and pivotal guidance for multiple bills revolving around housing, greenhouse gas emissions, and cap-and-trade.

Land use and carbon removal

AB 130, signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom in June, is a broad state housing and climate bill that streamlines housing development and strengthens affordable housing incentives. Among its policies is a measure that allows developers, if they choose, to mitigate transportation impacts by funding transit-oriented affordable housing projects that reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).

The concept builds on work CLEE has developed since the 2013 passage of Senate Bill 743, which created mitigation “banks” to help facilitate VMT reductions when they cannot occur at a project site. The center is now working with the governor’s Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation on providing initial technical guidance for the program.

“It’s not about whether it causes traffic at a specific intersection — it’s also about whether it adds more vehicles to the road, because vehicles create air and noise pollution and affect the climate,” says CLEE Associate Director Ted Lamm. “So, the focus isn’t just congestion — it’s emissions.”

The state’s program, Lamm notes, aims to direct all funds for mitigating those impacts into location-efficient affordable housing in walkable areas less reliant on cars, and more reliant on transit.

“It’s about adding development and housing capacity without adding more vehicles to the road,” Lamm says. “The idea is that investment in location-efficient housing offsets the increased VMT from other projects.’

CLEE’s research also helped build the case for SB 79, signed into law earlier this month, which aims to increase housing density by upzoning areas around transit stops.

SB 643, after passing in the State Assembly and State Senate, was vetoed by the governor due to budget limitations. CLEE assisted in drafting the bill, which would have created a $50 million state grant to develop carbon capture pilot projects that decrease atmospheric emissions in the state. It included innovative requirements to ensure these projects provided community benefits in proportion with their design and impact.

“These projects should actually help the communities they’re in,” Lamm explains. “That’s why community benefits were written directly into eligibility criteria.”

However, CLEE Project Climate Director Ken Alex remains optimistic that the center’s proposals will resurface in later legislative sessions.

“It’s unfortunate,” he says. “It would have advanced high-quality carbon removal projects in California, but there’ll be other opportunities.”

Transmission financing and grid reform

Throughout the legislative session, CLEE leaders engaged in discussions and proposals around transmission financing reforms, providing objective analysis on how California can invest in — and lower — the building cost of clean energy transmission infrastructure.

SB 254, signed by Newsom in September, reforms how the state funds and deploys electricity transmission infrastructure by creating a new public-financing mechanism to support large-scale clean energy projects. CLEE produced various provisions and language for the measure.

Alex and Climate Program Director Ethan Elkind also offered significant expertise that informed the state agency participation provisions, and made suggestions to improve financing mechanisms for grid deployment.

“A number of the recommendations that we made ended up in AB 1207 and SB 840, which extended our cap-and-trade program and allocated specific percentages from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund toward targeted areas like wildfire resilience and clean transportation,” Alex says. “The recommendations — particularly around how prices and costs for transmission can be reduced — were adopted pretty directly.”

Looking ahead

CLEE’s team continues to pursue new, innovative approaches to accelerate electric vehicle adoption and expand charging infrastructure.”We’ve been working on approaches around how “California can promote and extend EV purchasing and infrastructure,” says Lamm. “Those efforts will likely be more focused on the next legislative session.”

Meanwhile, notes from CLEE’s latest report on the state’s economic toll caused by the climate crisis are circulating around state legislators’ desks, covering the financial impact of wildfires, extreme weather, and rising insurance premiums, all affecting Californians in real time.

“Usually, the coverage focuses on the cost of climate response — like renewable energy projects — but not on what climate change itself is already costing people,” Alex says. “That’s an important message for legislators to bring back to their constituents.”

Solar set new records in September

EIA’s latest “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through September 30, 2025), once again confirms that solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity in the US.

In September alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (>1 megawatt (MW)) ballooned by well over 36.1% compared to September 2024, while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 12.7%. Combined, they grew by 29.9% and provided 9.7% of US electrical output during the month, up from 7.6% a year ago.

Moreover, generation from utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic systems expanded by 35.8%, while that from small-scale systems rose by 11.2% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 29.0% and produced a bit over 9.0% (utility-scale: 6.85%; small-scale: 2.16%) of total US electrical generation for January-September, up from 7.2% a year earlier.

And for the third consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than US wind farms: by 4% in July, 15% in August, and 9% in September. Including small-scale systems, solar has outproduced wind for five consecutive months and by over 40% in September.

Wind leads among renewables

Wind turbines across the US produced 9.8% of US electricity in the first nine months of 2025 – an increase of 1.3% compared to the same period a year earlier and 79% more than that produced by US hydropower plants.

During the first nine months of 2025, electrical generation from wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 18.8% of the US total, up from 17.1% during the first three quarters of 2024.

Wind and solar combined provided 15.1% more electricity than did coal during the first nine months of this year, and 9.8% more than the US’s nuclear power plants. In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.1%.

Renewables are now only second to natural gas

The mix of all renewables (wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal) produced 8.7% more electricity in January-September than they did a year ago, providing 25.6% of total US electricity production compared to 24.2% 12 months earlier.

Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas, which saw a 3.8% drop in electrical output during the first nine months of 2025.

Solar + storage have dominated 2025

Between October 1, 2024, and September 30, 2025, utility-scale solar capacity grew by 31,619.5 MW, while an additional 5,923.5 MW was provided by small-scale solar. EIA foresees continued strong solar growth, with an additional 35,210.9 MW of utility–scale solar capacity being added in the next 12 months.

Strong growth was also experienced by battery storage, which grew by 59.4% during the past year, adding 13,808.9 MW of new capacity. EIA also notes that planned battery capacity additions over the next year total 22,052.9 MW.

Wind also made a strong showing during the past 12 months, adding 4,843.2 MW, while planned capacity additions over the next year total 9,630.0 MW (onshore) plus 800.0 MW (offshore).

On the other hand, natural gas capacity increased by only 3,417.1 MW and nuclear power added 46.0 MW. Meanwhile, coal capacity plummeted by 3,926.1 MW and petroleum-based capacity fell by an additional 606.6 MW.

Thus, during the past year, renewable energy capacity, including battery storage, small-scale solar, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass, ballooned by 56,019.7 MW while that of all fossil fuels and nuclear power combined actually declined by 1,095.2 MW.

The EIA expects this trend to continue and accelerate over the next 12 months. Utility-scale renewables plus battery storage are projected to increase by 67,806.1 MW (a forecast for small-scale solar is not provided). Meanwhile, natural gas capacity is expected to increase by only 3,835.8 MW, while coal capacity is projected to decrease by 5,857.0 MW, and oil capacity is anticipated to decrease by 5.8 MW. EIA does not project any new growth for nuclear power in the coming year.

SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director Ken Bossong said:

The Trump Administration’s efforts to jump-start nuclear power and fossil fuels are not succeeding. Capacity additions from solar, wind, and battery storage continue to dramatically outpace those from gas, coal, and nuclear, and by growing margins.

Dave Stenson, who spent nearly three decades at GM, is now betting his startup, ZMD Motors, can succeed where others have retreated by electrifying medium-duty commercial work trucks. His venture aims to deliver a cab-chassis EV for the Class 5 segment, a category that includes trucks like the Chevy Silverado 5500, which remains without a pure-electric counterpart.

Stenson’s plan hinges on collaboration rather than competition. He is actively pitching Detroit automakers on a licensing deal. Under his proposal, ZMD would take an existing chassis architecture, upfit it with an electric powertrain, and bring a commercial EV to market faster than the OEMs could alone. ""I can offer this platform as a toe in the water,"" Stenson told Crain’s Detroit Business. He argues that this gives a manufacturer a hedge play for faster market entry as EV demand across segments continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than analysts expected.

The business case, he insists, is already evident in California. Strict emissions regulations from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) are forcing municipalities and utilities to electrify their fleets, creating urgent demand. ""These people out here in California are dying for product that would actually work in their fleets,"" said Daryl Trueblood, general manager of vehicle upfitter One Stop Truck & Equipment. He confirms receiving several calls weekly for a product exactly like ZMD’s concept, noting, ""It’s a viable product if someone can bring it to market.""

Stenson’s approach contrasts with his previous venture and other failed startups that attempted ground-up designs.

Rather than a posture of strength, Trump’s energy agenda is actually a mark of an administration — and a political party — that’s been sold off to the highest bidder.","When it comes to (non-political) power, Donald Trump’s agenda is “energy dominance.”

October was dubbed “NATIONAL ENERGY DOMINANCE MONTH,” by presidential proclamation. Trump wrote of “achieving American energy dominance” in quasi-religious terms — as “our crusade.” The president insisted that his administration was “proudly” committed to “forging a future defined by three simple words: ‘Drill, baby, drill.’”

As a slogan, “energy dominance” evokes images of the United States towering over the rest of the world, with prodigious production, as what Trump calls “a global energy superpower.” But the truth of energy dominance has nothing to do with empowering folks at home.

The administration has been rigging the game in favor of dirty energy — and giving fossil-fuel producers a license to dominate American consumers. In the process, Trump is boxing U.S. households out of cleaner alternatives and leaving Americans with less choice, higher energy bills, and an overheating climate.

Worse, by hobbling America’s green-energy industries, the administration is destroying jobs, even as it clears a path for China to dominate the next generation of energy production.

“He represents the fossil-fuel industry,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) at a Nov. 20 Capitol press conference, blasting Trump for boycotting international climate talks in Brazil. “He has chosen to represent his crooked billionaire donors.”

A Dirty Deal

Trump campaigned for reelection as a drill-first Republican with a govern-for-the-highest-bidder mentality. During an April 2024 gala at his Mar a Lago estate, Trump nakedly proposed to top oil and gas executives that they spend $1 billion to re-elect him. He promised, in exchange, to reverse president Joe Biden’s green policy agenda boosting renewable power, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles.

It was a preposterously large ask from Trump. And, because dark money floods our political system without names attached to campaign cash, it’s unclear exactly how much these fossil-fuel titans ponied up. (Publicly disclosed donations suggest a minimum of $75 million.) Regardless, Trump has governed like they sealed the deal.

His administration has been on a yearlong blitz, pulling tens of billions of dollars from the clean energy economy. Out of the gates, Trump sought to claw back $20 billion in Biden-era grants for renewables and efficiency. (Despite court challenges, at least $16 billion has been stalled.) More recently, under the cover of the government shutdown, the administration cancelled another $8 billion in funding for green energy projects, targeting blue states for partisan punishment.

Throttling Wind and Solar

Trump’s enmity toward clean energy is infamous. During his first term, he singled out solar panels for his now-signature tariff treatment. The president also harbors a special “hate” for windmills: “They’re ugly. They don’t work. They kill your birds,” he said at a cabinet meeting this summer, adding preposterously: “They’re bad for the environment.”

With the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump axed tax credits that helped Americans afford home solar panels. Similar incentives for utility-scale solar and wind projects are now set to expire next year, instead of the 2030s. By executive order in March, Trump slashed Biden-era federal support for domestic solar manufacturers, blasting it as part of a “Green New Scam.” He has also revoked $7 billion in grants for “community solar,” meant to bring renewable power to disadvantaged communities.

On his first day back in office, Trump blocked all federal waters for offshore wind leasing. His onshore policy is hardly better. In August, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — ex-governor of the petrostate of North Dakota — erected permitting hurdles to block large-scale wind and solar projects on federal lands, alleging they generate insufficient energy “density” per acre. “Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects,” Burgum insisted, “hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance.”

Hobbling Green Industry

America’s renewable energy industries, which had been going gangbusters under Biden, now find themselves staggered. They are still growing, but far more slowly. One forecast of offshore wind capacity expected to come online in the next decade has been slashed by 56 percent — with more than $100 billion in investments reportedly cancelled or delayed. The solar industry is facing a similar 27 percent decline in projected new capacity by 2030.

A study out of Princeton University finds that Trump’s signature “Beautiful Bill” will reduce capital investment in our electrical system and clean fuels by half a trillion dollars over the next decade. It will also slash future solar capacity by about 140 gigawatts and wind capacity by about 160 gigawatts. (The Hoover Dam, by comparison, has a capacity of about 2 gigawatts.)

This Trump offensive is disrupting job markets. In New England alone, Trump’s war on offshore wind has put an estimated 15,000 jobs at risk. Overall, the One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to cost 760,000 jobs by 2030, according to Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank.

“Republicans have taken a sledgehammer to the clean-energy economy,” Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House leader, told reporters at the November Capitol press conference. “That hurts our ability to deal with the climate crisis, and hurts our ability to drive down costs for everyday Americans.”

Full Speed for Fossil

Trump casts “our crusade” against green power as “ending market distorting subsidies.”

But the American energy market has long been distorted in favor of oil, gas, and coal. Even before Trump regained office, federal subsidies for fossil fuels were running about $30 billion a year. In that context, the historic investments in renewable energy championed by the Biden administration were about leveling the playing field — not giving green energy a leg up.

The passage of Trump’s “Beautiful Bill” has increased federal subsidies to the fossil fuel industry by nearly $4 billion a year, according to a report from the environmental nonprofit Oil Change International. The law included a wild list of favors for fossil-fuel producers, ranging from tax breaks for wells and pipelines, to reduced royalty payments from extractors, to opening up the Arctic National Wildlife refuge for drilling. It also cut off tax credits that helped Americans afford electric vehicles.

In late November — in a news cycle dominated by the Epstein Files and Trump’s threats to hang Democratic members of Congress — the administration announced it intends to open the coasts of California and Florida to drilling for the first time in decades. Committing to this retrograde agenda, Trump has even been championing coal power — which has been in steady decline thanks to cheaper, cleaner alternatives.

In October, the administration offered $100 million in federal funds to “modernize and refurbish” existing coal fired power plants. It has also used its authority to force utilities keep coal plants in operation long past their planned decommission dates. Trump even ordered the EPA to exempt many large coal plants from new regulations limiting neurotoxic mercury pollution.

Far from letting the marketplace pick winners and losers, the president himself is becoming the filthy fuel’s biggest booster. “Coal needs a little help, public-relations-wise,” Trump said in a November speech. ‘So we refer to it as ‘clean beautiful coal.’” His Department of Energy has also been giving the dirty rock the rockstar treatment:

Climate Chaos, Consumer Pain

Trump’s agenda — simultaneously slowing clean-energy deployment while providing a new lease on life for fossil fuels — is keeping U.S. climate emissions at dangerous levels.

Upon taking office, Trump immediately withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. And his “Beautiful Bill” ends any pretense of America meeting its emissions targets. The Princeton report finds that Trump’s law locks in large pollution increases of “190 million metric tons per year in 2030” and “470 million tons in 2035” by comparison with the Biden baseline.

Climate denial has become official policy, with the Environmental Protection Agency seeking to abolish the “endangerment finding” that enables the government to regulate carbon pollution under the Clean Air Act.

These abrupt changes will expose Americans to more frequent disasters like superstorms and urban wildfires that have already cost the country trillions this century. They also impose concrete costs on consumers and ratepayers. The Princeton study estimates that the “Beautiful Bill” will increase household energy bills by $285 a year by 2035.

Feeding the AI Beast

These higher energy prices are coming in tandem with administration policies backing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency to the hilt. These industries’ data centers and “mining” operations have an insatiable demand for electricity, and are also driving up costs for household customers.

Under Trump, the watchdog EPA is transforming into an industry lapdog. Administrator Lee Zeldin has made “American Energy Dominance” a key “pillar” of his agenda at the agency, which also vows to “Make the United States the Artificial Intelligence Capital of the World.”

The EPA is now turning a blind eye as the AI industry and its politically wired billionaires run roughshod over human health. No surprise, Elon Musk has been at the forefront of this new wave of dirty energy dominance.

Musk has been building out xAI in Memphis, Tennessee, at a fossil-fueled facility called Colossus. This installation’s massive power needs — rivalling those of a mid-size city — have been met by an array of high-pollution, on-site methane gas generators, which have left residents of south Memphis choking on smog.

In June, local environmental groups threatened to file a federal lawsuit over the data center’s pollution, while challenging Musk’s local air permits. “Our health,” said NAACP president Derrick Johnson at the time, “shouldn’t be threatened at the hands of billionaires who circumvent the law.”

A second, much larger Colossus 2 facility is now under construction nearby. Sidestepping Tennessee regulators, Musk’s company is placing the methane generators for this data center just across state lines in Mississippi, where the company will reportedly be able to generate dirty power for 12 months without an air-emissions permit.

Bad Politics. Worse Geopolitics.

If there’s a silver lining to Trump’s war on clean energy, it is that it’s a stinker, politically.

Renewable power is no longer coded as a partisan issue. Eight of the top ten states ranked by solar installations in the first quarter of 2025 were places Trump won in 2024 — including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Idaho. Red states like Texas, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Kansas also dominate in American wind production.

Recent elections, moreover, demonstrate that voters are sensitive to soaring utility rates. Pricey energy bills loomed large in gubernatorial races won by Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia. Democrats also won big in Georgia, flipping two seats on the state’s public utility commission, which sets electric rates.

The geopolitical ramifications of Trump’s fossil-fuel first agenda are also stark. The administration is having some success boosting the sugar high of America’s oil boom. Fracking has unlocked enormous domestic petroleum reserves, and the U.S. is now the world’s leading oil producer.

But this is not sustainable, by any measure. Oil production is expected to peak as soon as 2027, declining thereafter. And by doubling down on the extraction-based economy while pulling back from renewables, the Trump administration is allowing China to dominate the next generation of clean energy and technology.

A recent cover package by The Economist underscored this dangerous trend: “China now makes a lot more from exporting wind turbines, electric cars, solar cells and the like,” it reported, “than drill-baby-drill America makes selling fossil fuels.”

So much for dominance.

Rather than a posture of strength, Trump’s energy agenda is actually a mark of an administration — and a political party — that’s been sold off to the highest bidder. Take it from Sen. Whitehouse, the ranking member of the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee. “Look at what they are having the Trump administration do,” he said at the Capitol press conference. “The depravity of the corruption… and the disinterest in anybody’s wellbeing other than the big donors. That’s the true face of the fossil-fuel industry.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Zzfi!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67ca3114-8408-4464-9a98-2d262a9b0313_533x800.png",N,,2025-12-01 18:01:37.687838

Sales volume is forecast to reach 1.27 million units, down 1 per cent from October and nearly 8 per cent year over year. Fewer selling days (25 this month) account for part of the decline.

“The new-vehicle sales pace had been expected to slow in the fourth quarter, and that’s what we are seeing,” said Charlie Chesbrough, Senior Economist at Cox Automotive, in a statement. “The headwinds from higher prices and fewer government subsidies for electric vehicles are finally slowing the market after a surprisingly strong previous six months.”

Chesbrough added that sales started to surge in the spring as consumers rushed to market to beat what they anticipated would inevitably be higher prices in the wake of announced tariffs. “Now, with more tariffed products replacing existing non-tariffed inventory, prices are drifting higher, leading to slower sales which may last through the remainder of the year and into next year.”

Cox Automotive said the recent pullback in EV demand is playing a central role. After three strong months, October saw a sharp reversal as the federal EV tax credit expired.

“Sales of EVs and PHEVs accelerated in the wake of the Big Beautiful Bill’s passage in early July as buyers rushed to market before the $7,500 tax credits expired at the end of September,” said Chesbrough. “Q3 was the strongest quarter ever for EVs; however, Q4 is a different story.

The facility currently operates at limited capacity producing vehicle-grade cells, but the performance targets attached to this technology have attracted international automotive industry attention.

Solid-state batteries work by replacing the liquid electrolyte found in conventional lithium-ion cells with solid materials, delivering substantial improvements in thermal stability and safety. The solid components can withstand temperatures reaching 400 degrees Celsius, roughly double the tolerance of liquid-based systems. This thermal advantage proves particularly important for high-capacity batteries powering electric vehicles.

GAC is currently testing battery cells that exceed 60 ampere-hour capacity. Higher ampere-hour ratings enable battery packs to store more energy, directly translating to extended driving range. Research director Qi Hongzhong stated that the new cells deliver energy storage capacity approaching twice the level of traditional battery technology. The areal capacity, measuring energy stored per surface area, reaches 7.7 milliampere-hours per square centimeter compared to under 5 for traditional lithium-ion technology.

Manufacturing these advanced cells requires innovative production techniques. GAC’s dry anode manufacturing approach eliminates traditional wet processing steps, combining what were previously separate operations for material mixing, surface application, and compression into an integrated production sequence. This approach accelerates manufacturing speed while reducing energy consumption during production. Any efficiency gains that lower production costs represent crucial steps toward mainstream electric vehicle adoption.

The company projects that vehicles currently achieving 500-kilometer range on a single charge could exceed 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) with solid-state technology. This performance jump would fundamentally alter electric vehicle user experience by eliminating frequent charging stops. Drivers might only require charging once or twice monthly, making electric vehicles more convenient than gasoline-powered alternatives for typical usage patterns.

However, commercial availability remains years away. GAC will begin prototype vehicle testing in 2026, installing batteries in test vehicles to validate road performance and safety characteristics. Following successful testing, the company expects gradual mass production ramp-up between 2027 and 2030. But transforming laboratory technology into reliable commercial products still presents substantial challenges.

Successful scaling depends on securing adequate investment and establishing dependable supply chains for specialized solid electrolyte materials. The company must validate long-term performance and safety across diverse operating environments and extended usage periods before widespread deployment begins.

In the meantime, GAC’s operational production line positions the company advantageously in this global race to advance solid state battery technology, though ultimate impact on electric vehicle pricing and availability will depend on cost reduction speed for manufacturing these advanced cells.

The production line also represents China’s first industrial-scale capability for large-format solid-state battery manufacturing, a significant technical achievement for a country that already dominates the global electric vehicle segment.

Converting technical capability into market-ready products affordable for mass-market vehicles will be the next major hurdle for China. Supply chain reliability, manufacturing consistency, and long-term durability validation will determine whether this technology reaches widespread commercial adoption or remains confined to premium vehicle segments.

If the technology proves its worth in the field, many auto industry players like Massimo Group (NASDAQ: MAMO) will undoubtedly incorporate this superior technology in their future offerings.

The Alton Park connector would have been a 2.6 mile trail system connecting some south Chattanooga neighborhoods to the Tennessee Riverwalk.

Earlier this year, the EPA said they would not move forward with a $20 million grant for the project.

At the time, Chattanooga Mayor Tim Kelly released a statement that read in part...

""It's extremely disappointing to see the federal government break a commitment and go back on their agreement to fund this project.""

Now, the non-profit says they are working together with the city to move the project forward.

The City of Chattanooga says they will be picking up at least part of the tab to connect the Alton Park community with the rest of the city.

Lavada Carnes, an Alton Park resident, tells us...

""Our community is growing. There are new homes going up all throughout the community, and I think it's very important for us to be connected.""

Dubbed the Alton Park Connect, the City of Chattanooga is set to vote on approving phase one of the project which would start with construction on Broad Street.

Carnes says while she is happy with the project, it should've come sooner.

""It's just a wonderful little community, and I feel like it gets a bad rap because it is a low income community.""

Trust for Public Land's Noel Durant says while the loss of that $20 million grant was disappointing, TPL isn't the only non-profit to experience this.

""There have been so many communities over the last year that have the uncertainty around federal grants and terminations and court proceedings, lots of complications there.""

Residents say regardless of what happens, they are ready for construction to begin on the project to reconnect 3 communities that have been isolated by railroads, highways, and other barriers.

""We need more exposure to what a wonderful place it is to live.""

The Trust for Public Land is also involved in a class action lawsuit to try and make up some of that lost grant money.

Dear Lieutenant General Graham,

We write to respectfully request a 45-day extension of the public comment period for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) regarding operations of the Detroit Dam within Oregon’s Willamette Valley System. The draft SEIS was released on November 14, with the comment period closing on December 29. We urge the Corps to provide a longer and more accessible comment window that will allow meaningful and informed public engagement on this highly impactful document.

The SEIS is both lengthy and technically complex, addressing issues that directly affect drinking water quality, economic stability, and public health across several communities in the Santiam Canyon and Willamette Valley. Recent experience with deep drawdown operations, including those at Green Peter Reservoir, have revealed the potential for extensive turbidity, severe impacts to drinking water systems, and significant economic losses for surrounding communities. These concerns underscore the importance of ensuring that residents, local governments, Tribal governments, utility providers, business owners, and other stakeholders have sufficient time to review and respond to this SEIS.

While a 45-day comment period is already a relatively short timeline for a document like this, the currently scheduled comment window also spans the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Hanukkah, among others. These weeks are among the most challenging of the year for public participation, as reduced staffing, competing obligations, and widespread travel mean most Oregonians are far more concerned about weather delays and family recipes than comment periods. The combined effect of a shortened timeline and a holiday-dominated review period will significantly hinder the ability of Oregonians to provide thoughtful and informed feedback.

Given the anticipated impacts of potential operational changes at Detroit Dam, including those related to drinking water for more than 200,000 downstream residents, the Kokanee fishery, and economic conditions in the Santiam Canyon, it is essential that the review process maximize transparency and accessibility. A reasonable extension of the comment period would help accomplish this goal and ensure that the Corps receives the robust, substantive input needed to support a well-informed decision.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the USACE extend the comment period by an additional 45-days to provide stakeholders with adequate time to fully assess the SEIS and prepare comprehensive comments. We believe this extension is both necessary and in the public Interest.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to continued collaboration to ensure that the management of the Willamette Valley System supports the recovery of endangered fish species while also meeting the needs, safety, and well-being of Oregonians and the communities they call home.",http://bynum.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bynum.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/shutterstock_2346441271_us_capitol_congress-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 18:01:54.021689

If you’re an everyday Texan, you’re not involved directly in the oil industry and you’re hearing about this.
Well, with oil prices around $60, that translates to about $3 a gallon on the national average.","Two stories, in particular, are making notably rounds on the energy beat coming out of Thanksgiving.

One has to do with ongoing pessimism about oil prices, while another said despite warnings of doom and gloom in the oil industry, a buzz of oil field workers fill the gas stations and trailer parks of the Permian Basin – a sign that industry jobs are aplenty out in the oil fields.

Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler, was also seeing some breaking news having to do with one of Texas oil’s biggest energy competitors. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: OPEC met yesterday, I gather, and some big decisions with some implications for Texas. Tell us what they said.

Matt Smith: Well, the the first piece was that it was pausing its production increases for Q1 of next year, which it wasn’t too surprising really, just given that we are seeing a surplus in the market appearing right now.

But what was unexpected was they announced that they’re going to be doing a study basically to determine the maximum oil production capacity of every country there. And so the reason for that is because there’s a lot of opaqueness surrounding that, right? Certain countries will say, “Oh, we have so much spare capacity here” when they may not necessarily have it.

So by doing this measure, that’s going to bring transparency to the market – stability as well, but it also may be bullish as well, because we’ve been expecting or assuming that certain countries have a lot of dry powder on the sidelines that they can bring to market in terms of that production, when in reality this study may show that that isn’t the case.

Just one other piece though: The company that they have picked to do this is actually Dallas-based. It’s a consultant called DeGolyer and MacNaughton Corp. So interestingly, there’s that tie again between OPEC and the U.S. here.

Well let me ask you, what does it mean if you’re gonna pause your production in your OPEC? What does that mean if you’re in Texas’ oil industry? Do you see a connection between what OPEC’s decided to do here and all that activity in the Permian I was referencing earlier?

We could view it as bullish, right? Because if OPEC is going to be hitting pause on their production increases, they’re essentially going to support higher prices. But the reality is that production is strong elsewhere in the world. And so they’re concerned here about an oversupply and that begins with Texas, right?

So on Friday we had a report from the EIA, the Energy Information Administration in the U.S. here. They showed that September’s production in the U.S. of oil was 13.84 million barrels a day. That is a record.

And so you’ve got a lot of supply coming to market outside of OPEC, and so they’re just trying to manage the situation here.

Trying to manage the price situation, I think we should probably underscore, right?

Yes, very true.

Well, what does that mean for prices at the pump? If you’re an everyday Texan, you’re not involved directly in the oil industry and you’re hearing about this. But what does it all add up to?

Well, with oil prices around $60, that translates to about $3 a gallon on the national average. For Texas, it’s just below $2.60 a gallon.

You can obviously get that lower, as well, sort of West Texas there. I had a friend over the weekend send me a picture getting $2.11 for his gas there.

So yeah, there’s always that kind of seesaw, right, of lower prices are bad for production in theory, but it’s great for the consumer.

Seemed like a very busy Thanksgiving weekend on the roads, too. Folks taking advantage of those lower prices.

It really was actually, yeah. So AAA projected that it was at a record. There was like 73 million people traveling by car over the weekend. That’s up 1.3 million people compared to last year.

So lower prices, encouraging people to get on the roads there.

Matt, as we come around the corner at the end of 2025, how are you feeling about the way things have gone this year in the oil industry and what we’re looking at for 2026?

It’s been a very challenging year, but as we’ve seen, the U.S. producer is extremely resilient and that’s reflected through in that record production.

Though we may see a weaker start to next year, which is obviously good for prices at the pump, the reality is that the longer-term picture here is of higher oil prices as we head towards the end of the decade. So that’s positive for U.S. producers.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/gas-pump-at-an-exon-gas-station-in-central-austin-on-march-5-2023-alyssa-olverakutx_52730987335_o-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:18.165434

This problem is not new, but prices have spiked in recent years while many workers’ wages and household incomes have not kept up. New federal policies will raise the prices of essential needs further while cutting programs and services that help Kentuckians get by.

Today, KyPolicy released a report, “Building a Kentucky Workers Can Afford,” containing a range of affordability policies that the state can implement to improve job quality and ease growing kitchen table burdens. Here’s why those priorities are so important.

Household costs are going up

Since 2020, costs have risen substantially for a variety of major household expenses. The Consumer Price Index for all items in the East South Central Region (which includes Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee) shows prices are up 27% since 2020, as shown in the graph below. That includes particularly sharp increases in the cost of transportation, which is up 36%; energy, up 33%; shelter, which consists of housing and related costs including insurance, up 33%; and food, up 28%, including a 37% increase for meat, poultry, fish and eggs.

Inflation in household costs was especially high during the pandemic period from 2021-2023 as supply chain backups, shifts in consumer demand from services to goods, and opportunistic price hikes in monopolized industries resulted in a sudden rise in prices. Since then, the pace of cost growth has slowed, but Kentuckians are left with much higher prices for necessary expenses than five years ago.

Now, across-the-board tariffs threaten to bring new price increases on many goods. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which passed Congress this summer, will end food and healthcare benefits for many and pass higher costs on to others, while its cuts to clean energy investments are expected to further raise the cost of electricity.

Wages are suppressed and incomes are inadequate

For decades , wages for American workers have not kept up with growth in worker productivity. A wide variety of policy decisions have suppressed wages for most workers, including weakened labor laws, inaction to raise the minimum wage, unfair trade policies and a failure to enact fiscal and monetary policies that maintain a consistent economy of full employment.

And in many cases, wages and incomes are not keeping up with the recent growth in costs described above. Median household income is down 4.8% in Kentucky since 2020 after adjusting for inflation, while median wages have fallen 3.3%.

The above chart actually understates the decline in purchasing power Americans have felt over the last few years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government provided a variety of aid programs that are not counted in the Census Bureau’s measure of household income, including an expansion of the child tax credit, stimulus payments and food, health care, utility and housing assistance. These benefits increased household economic security but their expiration after the pandemic worsened well-being. For example, the Kentucky child poverty rate measured using a method that takes public benefits into account was cut in half during COVID-19. But as Congress let that aid go away, hardship redoubled.

Federal and state budget cuts have also reduced the help available to Kentuckians. The cuts in SNAP benefits and in Medicaid in the OBBBA will take food benefits and health coverage from hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians, further squeezing already meager incomes. Layoffs and the defunding of federal programs have caused adversity for many of the 23,000 federal employees who live in the commonwealth, and thousands more whose work was funded through federal grants that have been slashed or cancelled.

At the same time, the state has cut cash assistance for tens of thousands of low-income kids and their families in the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program (KTAP). Other cuts may be on the horizon due to a $305 million state budget shortfall caused by a weakening economy and multiple rounds of individual income tax cuts. Unemployment for young and Black workers is rising, but in 2022 the Kentucky General Assembly eliminated 10 weeks of eligible unemployment benefits for laid-off employees.

Workers and families are struggling

Higher prices on essentials combined with inadequate wages and reduced public support add up to more pain for household budgets. The Economic Policy Institute’s (EPI) Family Budget Calculator estimates the income needed in localities across the country to afford basics like housing, food, health care, childcare and transportation. As shown in the graph below , even median family income is not enough to cover those costs in many cases. For example, the local median is not adequate to pay for a basic family budget for one adult with one child in Knott County, and far less than is needed for two adults and two children. Affordability is a problem that challenges Kentuckians across rural, urban and suburban communities.

Detailed estimates by county and family size can be found in the map below, and full data for every county and metropolitan area is accessible through the calculator: https://www.epi.org/resources/budget/

While even families with median incomes struggle, many Kentucky workers make far less than that. A full 20% of Kentucky workers had wages of $14.95 an hour or less in 2024 according to EPI, the equivalent of $29,900 annually assuming full-time employment (which is not always available). That is less than EPI’s estimate of the cost of a basic family budget for a single adult with no children in every Kentucky county.

These challenges are worsening now due to a weakening economy and federal policy choices. Household debt and delinquencies are rising, while consumer confidence is falling.

Kentuckians need an affordability agenda

Strained living conditions are not inevitable: they are the direct result of public policy. As KyPolicy’s new report outlines, many policy options are available at the state level to directly ease the cost of living and grow good jobs that make life more affordable.

Leaders in the 2026 Kentucky General Assembly can and should prioritize an affordability agenda that meets the moment. Through deliberate action, leaders can help address the job quality and cost of living concerns that strain Kentucky workers and families every day.",https://kypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Affordability-Is-a-Crisis-for-Kentuckians-1024x585.png,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:11.957513
,Louisiana Environment,2025-12-01 21:26:05+00:00,10/12 Industry Report,"Louisiana's energy market is undeniably impactful, but notoriously hard to predict",Sam Barnes,,,,,https://www.1012industryreport.com/energy/louisianas-energy-market-is-undeniably-impactful-but-notoriously-hard-to-predict/,"How a ‘small store in the middle of nowhere’ has ties to the energy industry that take it far behind the southwest Louisiana community it calls home.
Offshore Oil & Natural Gas Save the Day Energy diversification will be a sustaining force in the near and long term.
“Offshore, we continue to go deeper and go further,” says Tommy Faucheux, executive director of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association.
“Oil production in state lands and waters—which are subject to the state severance tax—have been going down due to this decline curve.
“When they talk about deregulating the oil industry, you lower their costs, but that doesn’t change the demand for oil and ultimately the price in the international markets.","The network of businesses that owe their origins, successes and, at times, demises to Louisiana’s upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas market is vast.

For generations, an energy workforce numbering in the hundreds of thousands has risen before the sun to travel to a destination that is one, two or multiple parishes away to earn a living.

Nevertheless, it will always be an unpredictable and at times heartbreaking industry in which to work. The current relaxed regulatory environment notwithstanding, the economics of oil and gas—aka supply and demand—will always be the primary driver.

Louisiana has done a decent job since the oil bust of the early 1980s to separate itself from the rollercoaster effects of the unpredictable market. The state has undergone a transformation since the heady days of oil and gas in the early 1980s, when in FY1982 mineral revenues comprised a whopping 42% share of its overall budget. By FY2024, it comprised just 5.9%.

“It was because of the oil bust that we doubled the corporate franchise tax, then began to bring on gaming revenues in the 1990s. We basically changed our tax structure,” says Greg Albrecht, a former Legislative fiscal officer who continues to develop the state’s revenue forecast.

How a ‘small store in the middle of nowhere’ has ties to the energy industry

that take it far behind the southwest Louisiana community it calls home.

As a result, fluctuations in oil prices don’t have nearly the same impact on state finances as they did 40-plus years ago. “Oil and gas revenues are clearly important,” Albrecht says, “but not nearly as impactful to the budget when you get big fluctuations in price.”

That has become starkly apparent in recent months. In FY2024, the state realized an actual mineral revenue collection of nearly $1 billion, consisting of $828 million in severance taxes and $132 million in royalties. Then, in FY2025, the number dropped precipitously to $445 million, largely due to a significant drop in oil prices.

The revenue drop won’t cripple the state budget, though, as it might have done in the past. That’s fortunate, since Albrecht’s most recent state forecast, released in May (the final numbers won’t be available until October), predicts the current oil price of $65 a barrel will likely be sustained through FY2026 “and could actually be lower depending upon the source,” he says.

Upstream production has also been trending downward for years, although its short-term impact isn’t as severe as a drop in prices. “We’re on a long, long decline path,” he says. “The numbers are what they are. It is just declining and declining and declining. The nonhorizontal natural gas production is doing the same thing.”

For his purposes, though, Albrecht has frozen projected production volumes at a certain minimum level in his long-term forecast models.

Offshore Oil & Natural Gas Save the Day

Energy diversification will be a sustaining force in the near and long term. Even as onshore oil production steadily declines, offshore oil and inshore natural gas (horizontal extraction) are surging; increased investments in LNG, midstream and downstream facilities will play significant roles.

Improving technologies are making much of it possible.

“Offshore, we continue to go deeper and go further,” says Tommy Faucheux, executive director of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association. “And now that we’re clearly headed back to a place of predictable federal offshore leasing, I think the offshore trajectory over the long term is positive.”

Of course, economic factors will play a bigger role in any future production decisions, with international demand being a significant factor in the coming decades. Faucheux is particularly excited about the growth of the LNG market, and natural gas in general, as it will likely be the “go to” low-carbon fuel in the near term.

“That is going to be where Louisiana will benefit,” he says. “To have more production in the Hayesville Shale, as well as capacity increases and exports along the coast … that will clearly mean good things for Louisiana.”

In LMOGA’s recent 2025 Economic Impact Study, economist Stephen Barnes found that Louisiana’s energy industry—upstream, midstream and downstream—contributes directly and indirectly to some 25% of the state’s economy.

Barnes, director of the Kathleen Babineaux Blanco Public Policy Center in Lafayette, asserts that industry accounts for 15% of total state employment, 19% of total earnings and up to 31.3% in local property taxes.

Unlike neighboring Texas, Louisiana’s oil and gas companies don’t benefit from concentrated metro areas such as Houston or Dallas; instead, they’re more regionally focused, Faucheux says.

The LMOGA study identified four energy “super regions” where more than 90% of the industry’s economic impact in Louisiana is concentrated—the River Region (Baton Rouge to New Orleans), Bayou Region (Lafayette to Houma), Southwest Louisiana and Northwest Louisiana.

“Few companies in the industrial sector would be successful if their livelihoods depended upon one community or parish,” Faucheux says. “At a minimum, they need this regional collectivity of parishes and communities to support what they’re doing. Then, in turn, the economic impact goes back to those regions.”

That’s perhaps most evident in the River Region, where industry pays more than $600 million in local property taxes—some 17% of the total received.

“That money supports the school systems, the sheriff’s offices, local emergency services, infrastructure etc.,” Faucheux says. “Imagine what kind of hole that would leave in the community if industry wasn’t there.

“In the Bayou Region, its $119 million in property taxes; then there’s sales taxes too. Those are very reliable, predictable revenue streams for local government.”

That translates into a better quality of life, says Faucheux, a former Dow employ who lives in St. Charles Parish. “It really does lift everything,” he adds. “I see how multiple generations of families are getting stronger because of the opportunities that come from industry. Both my grandfathers were in industry, and my dad retired from industry. I’m the first one to go to college. Hopefully, my kids will get some of the same benefits.”

Supply & Demand Edges Out Regulatory Policy

For inshore Louisiana, at least, it has been a tale of two fossil fuels: Natural gas production has gone up while oil production has gone down.

“And these are long-term trends,” says Greg Upton, executive director of LSU’s Center for Energy Studies and interim director of the LSU Energy Institute. “Oil production in state lands and waters—which are subject to the state severance tax—have been going down due to this decline curve.

“If we talk about total Gulf Coast production, however, which includes federal offshore production, the broader trend is that you have more production.”

But while technology has played an undeniably beneficial role, it’s had an inverse effect on employment.

That’s been somewhat surprising, Upton says. “Just looking at upstream oil and gas, the employment numbers are actually coming in lower than we forecasted them to do,” he adds. “We’ve seen downward revisions in the employment numbers over a year ago.”

Technology, he says, has made it possible to produce more hydrocarbons with fewer workers. “The longer-term trend is for production to increase within the Gulf Coast region as well as the U.S.,” Upton says, “but you need fewer workers to produce that same amount of output. So we’re just not seeing this uptick in employment in those sectors.

“Owners have learned how to perform more detailed geological assessments with 3D seismic capabilities, then drill horizontally into these formations with hydraulic fracturing. Historically, they wouldn’t have been able to efficiently do that.”

That’s led to rapid increases in oil and gas production as companies learn how to extract more for less cost.

“We’re in a longer-term trend right now of efficiency improvements,” he adds. “When offshore companies started learning how to go deeper and deeper, that was a breakthrough technology with significant long-term impacts.”

For the long term, Upton forecasts a rise in international oil and gas demand will buoy the market, with the most significant increases coming from developing countries. “I think we’re going to have oil and gas production for decades and decades to come,” he adds, “and our production forecast reflects that.”

In the near term, however, recent federal efforts to expand offshore oil and gas leasing activity will have little effect. “I’m not saying that those actions don’t matter; they absolutely do,” he says, “but there’s a lengthy lag period between when you go from leasing to drilling those first wells … to building out the infrastructure to bring the products to shore.

“In fact, the production that comes from that is going to lag beyond the timeframe of the current president. Not that policy changes don’t matter, but a new president coming in won’t have an immediate impact. It just doesn’t work that way.”

The Landry administration has been equally supportive of oil and gas, but recent state legislation reducing the severance tax rate from 12.5% to 6.5% on new oil production will have only a measured impact.

Says Upton: “In theory, you’ll get more oil production and more economic activity around that oil production, but I don’t think that the additional amount of activity is going to be large enough to see a true uptick in employment or an uptick in the production numbers. Would it be larger than it would’ve been otherwise? Sure, but I’m not anticipating it to be large enough to see when you look at the data.”

At the end of the day, state economist Albrecht predicts economic factors will have a much larger impact on future production than any new federal or state policy.

“The oil and gas companies drill because of their price projections,” he says. “When they talk about deregulating the oil industry, you lower their costs, but that doesn’t change the demand for oil and ultimately the price in the international markets. That’s what drives production and decisions.

“They don’t produce any more oil when the price is in the mid-$60s, as it is now.”",https://www.1012industryreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Greg-Upton-quote-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:40.587343

Chemical manufacturers and importers should stay apprised of these enforcement trends and proactively manage their TSCA compliance strategies to reduce enforcement and litigation risk.

EPA Enforcement in 2025

While the government has scaled back civil environmental enforcement in federal court, EPA’s administrative enforcement remains robust and appears to be accelerating. In the third quarter of calendar year 2025, EPA resolved 198 administrative enforcement actions across the statutes it administers—up from 179 case conclusions in the second quarter—and has assessed over $9 million in penalties. Although many of these cases likely were initiated during the prior administration, the continued settlement approvals reflect EPA’s focus on “core” enforcement work under the current administration.

EPA’s TSCA enforcement and compliance assurance program includes four key focus areas: new and existing chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, and lead-based paint. From time to time, aspects of the TSCA enforcement program have been included amongst EPA’s national focus areas, as reflected in the National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives that EPA selects on four-year cycles. TSCA enforcement largely is, however, part of “core” enforcement work, which Administrator Zeldin has made a priority for the agency.

Since the beginning of the current administration, EPA has pursued 115 new administrative enforcement actions and assessed approximately $4.3 million in penalties for TSCA violations. The vast majority of these cases (about 80 percent) concern lead-based paint regulation noncompliance, which have generally resulted in lower penalty assessments than chemicals enforcement actions. Of the ten largest TSCA penalties assessed this year to date, five were for chemicals enforcement actions. For example, the agency assessed its single largest TSCA penalty in 2025—$700,000—for violations of the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule, where the respondent allegedly failed to report 334 imported chemicals for the 2024 reporting cycle. EPA assessed six‑figure penalties in three other CDR rule enforcement actions—$415,000, $393,000, and $112,155—as well as a $100,000 penalty for alleged violations of the methylene chloride risk management rule for paint removers.

NGO Lawsuits to Enforce TSCA CDR Violations

TSCA Section 20 also gives private citizens the authority to bring civil actions against companies in federal court for TSCA violations. TSCA allows private citizens to bring such suits so that a court can restrain the identified TSCA violations or compel EPA to enforce the law. Since 2021, NGOs have filed TSCA Section 20 actions against companies for alleged CDR violations and continue to do so with growing frequency. Two of the most recent lawsuits were filed earlier this fall by the NGO Center for Environmental Health (CEH). CEH alleged that certain chemical companies failed to report imported chemicals to EPA for the 2020 CDR reporting cycle.

The complaints in these cases detail how the NGOs identify potential violations by reviewing information on company imports and manufactured chemicals published in EPA’s CDR public database. NGOs have also asked the courts in these cases to 1) declare the companies violated TSCA, 2) order the companies to file corrected CDR reports with EPA, 3) restrain the companies from ongoing CDR violations, 4) order that the companies audit their manufacturing and import activities to identify other potential CDR violations, and 5) pay the NGO’s attorneys’ fees. Even when penalties are not imposed, responding to TSCA Section 20 claims can be costly and require the diversion of resources away from other business functions.

Companies should be aware of these types of civil actions because they can open the door to NGOs or other private citizens to pressure companies, as part of settlements, to agree to allow them to participate in company-led TSCA CDR (or broader) audits, which could potentially reveal additional TSCA violations.

What Companies Should Do

EPA administrative enforcement and citizen-filed lawsuits represent two significant legal risks for chemical manufacturers and importers subject to TSCA CDR rule requirements. Noncompliance can result in not only steep penalties but also business operational disruption. On the front end, manufacturers and importers should routinely review their own TSCA compliance programs and audit their own TSCA reporting compliance, which can also position companies to take advantage of EPA’s Audit Policy[1] where its conditions are met, potentially mitigating penalties for voluntarily disclosed noncompliance. Companies should also proactively prepare for the next CDR reporting cycle in 2028. Companies should also engage counsel early when responding to EPA inquiries or enforcement activity or notice of citizen lawsuits.",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1764629197/206373.png,N,,2025-12-01 19:03:27.692413

Senate Republicans unveiled their fiscal year 2026 funding proposals for the Department of Energy last week. The draft bill seeks to cut the base budget of various energy R&D programs, though it mitigates the impact by repurposing funds originally appropriated through infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021.

For instance, the bill proposes a base budget of $8 billion for the DOE Office of Science, which would represent a 3% cut from last year’s level. However, the bill also would transfer $250 million in unspent infrastructure funds to the office, negating the cut. This dynamic is more pronounced for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, for which the bill proposes a base budget of $2.2 billion and a repurposing of $1 billion in infrastructure funds, amounting to a topline cut of 5% from last year. In any event, the cuts proposed are far less steep than those sought by the Trump administration. For details on the proposals, consult FYI’s Federal Science Budget Tracker.

The bill normally would have been released over the summer but was delayed due to the Senate’s top appropriator for DOE, Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), insisting that it include spending cuts. Kennedy declined to use a higher topline budget given to him by Appropriations Committee leaders “because he believed he could fund these vital programs with more force and efficiency,” according to a press release from his office.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, criticized the bill as partisan but said there are aspects of it that she supports. Among other items, Murray said the bill would provide the DOE Office of Science with “the funding needed to continue their critical, cutting-edge work and prevent devastating layoffs.” She also praised the bill for blocking DOE’s “senseless plan to slash critical research with its indirect cost policy,” through which the department is seeking to cap reimbursement rates at 15%. The bill includes a provision (Sec. 315) that would direct DOE to continue using the same indirect cost rate as it did in fiscal year 2024.

House to examine competition with China in space

One of the key selling points of clean energy, of course, is that it’s renewable. Once the infrastructure is built, nature supplies the fuel for solar and wind energy. The sun shines, the wind blows, and batteries store the surplus. It’s renewable, and it’s basically free. That’s in sharp contrast to fossil fuel power plants, which require constant additions of fuel.

Building that infrastructure for clean energy means most of the cost comes upfront. And that means prevailing interest rates have a big effect on whether new projects get off the ground. Despite strong headwinds, including the shutting down of some projects near completion, recent Federal Reserve rate cuts have been welcome news for renewables.

Storms & Sunshine

Renewables have seen a lot of ups and downs the last half-decade. Solar and wind power generation became cheaper than fossil fuel generation for the first time. The Biden administration supported clean energy and passed policy measures such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act that funded renewable projects.

In March of 2022, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in an effort to tamp down rising inflation. In less than 18 months, rates from close to zero to over 5%, which took a heavy toll on clean energy stocks. The case was the same with central banks worldwide, as post-pandemic inflation soared. The funding from those Biden-era bills didn’t come all at once; it was spread out over several years.

Still, 2024 saw records for clean energy investment. According to the International Energy Agency, $2 trillion went to technology and infrastructure globally over the course of the year. In the U.S., investments in the production and deployment of clean energy hit $265 billion in 2024. There were 49 gigawatts of clean energy deployed in the U.S., accounting for 93% of new energy capacity.

“Private lenders co-led the charge, likely influenced by the more predictable and higher return on investment that renewables offer over traditional S&P 500 stocks. However, public support from clean energy tax credits, government and corporate power-purchase agreements, and low-interest financing from state energy financing institutions and community development financial institutions helped make this clean power and technology more accessible to households and communities,” the Rocky Mountain Institute reported.

The incoming Trump administration made its distaste for clean energy clear with executive orders that defunded and even stopped some projects. Despite the reversal in federal government support, renewables got a jolt in September when the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points after holding steady for the first nine months of the new presidential administration.

Demand Needs Supply

What isn’t stopping, however, is the rise in demand for electricity. With expansion of data center capacity to power AI and EV chargers and utility companies replacing old or damaged grid equipment, demand and electricity bills are going way up. Simply put, grids need more energy, and renewables are the main source of new capacity. NextEra Energy predicts the generation of another 450 GW by 2030, which means it will be demand more than policy that spurs growth in renewables. But lower interest rates will help.

September saw $800 million invested in renewable energy funds, the highest monthly total since April 2022. The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF went up 30% from January-September, signaling renewed optimism about clean energy’s future. Bloom Energy, which in July announced a deal with Oracle to provide hydrogen-enabled fuel cells for the latter’s data centers, saw its stock shoot up 300%.

“Bloom’s advanced fuel cell technology gives us the unique capability to design and construct modern AI factories with a holistic and innovative approach to power needs. As the world’s largest AI infrastructure investor, this partnership adds a powerful new tool to our global growth strategy, especially in a grid-constrained market environment,” Sikander Rashid, global head of AI infrastructure at Bloom investor Brookfield Asset Management said.

Brookfield announced in October it had raised $20 billion to fund clean energy, and JPMorgan Chase is adding $10 billion to a $1.5 trillion initiative for clean energy projects.

“It’s difficult to conceive of a situation in which they won’t need to tap into those sources of energy,” Chuka Umunna, JPMorgan’s global head of sustainable solutions, told Bloomberg Television.

Blackrock and Robeco report that lower interest rates have investors feeling much better about clean energy’s future than they did a year ago.

As Time’s Justin Worland put it, “In general, lower interest rates benefit growth-oriented, long-horizon investments.”

“Continuous” means “continuous,” “indistinguishable” means “indistinguishable,” and regulatory inventions such as the “wet season” have no place in defining federal power.","When the Supreme Court ruled in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency in 2023, which I argued on behalf of Michael and Chantell Sackett, it finally brought clarity and common sense to a part of environmental law that had long baffled courts, agencies and landowners. The Clean Water Act, the court held, regulates “waters of the United States,” or real bodies of water that any ordinary person would recognize as such.

On Monday, the Trump administration proposed a new “Waters of the United States” rule — a welcome effort to restore the law’s focus on real, continuous surface-water connections.

Though the law’s jurisdiction can reach wetlands, Sackett instructs that wetlands are regulated only when they are so physically inseparable from a lake, river or stream that you can’t tell where the water ends and the land begins. Put simply, under the Clean Water Act, the court found a “water” should be obviously water, and if a wetland is to be federally regulated, it must have a continuous surface-water connection to one of those relatively permanent bodies of water.

The 2023 ruling was a long-overdue course correction, but it did not go far enough. For decades, federal agencies had stretched the statute beyond recognition, sweeping in vast areas of private land that bore little resemblance to anything Congress authorized them to regulate. Sackett appeared to bring that era of boundless bureaucratic discretion to a close.

The Trump administration’s new proposal makes genuine progress but risks reintroducing the uncertainty Sackett sought to eliminate.

Under the proposed rule, wetlands would be regulated if they met a two-part test: They must contain surface water during the “wet season,” and they must touch a waterbody that flows during that season. On paper, that might sound consistent with Sackett’s requirement of a continuous surface connection. But Sackett gave only two exceptions to its continuous surface connection requirement: drought and low tides. These exceptions suggest unusual and short interruptions to the normal presence of water. In contrast, the “wet season” concept introduced by the proposed rule implies that surface water might be absent, regularly, for months at a time, and yet the agencies could still regulate it.

If the administration instead tied jurisdiction to truly continuous surface-water connections, regardless of “wet season,” it could align the rule fully with Sackett and give landowners the clarity Congress intended.

Getting the Sackett rule right is not just a question of legal quibbling. Landowners continue to suffer from agencies’ misinterpretation of the decision.

As an example, Rebecca and Caleb Linck, whom I also represent in litigation, own a 4.7-acre parcel in Bonner County, Idaho — the same county where the Sacketts fought their long battle. The Lincks’ land sits about a mile from the nearest perennial stream and two miles from a lake. When they hired a wetlands consultant to ensure they were complying with the Clean Water Act, they assumed they were in the clear.

Yet the Army Corps of Engineers asserted authority anyway, claiming that 1.13 acres of the Lincks’ property were federally regulated wetlands. The Army Corps relied on what it calls a “wetland complex” — a theory that allows regulators to stitch together disconnected parcels of land to create jurisdiction where none exists. In the Lincks’ case, the areas the engineers labeled “wetlands” were separated from the nearest alleged wetland by a 35-foot-wide gravel road with no culverts. But by combining both areas into one imaginary system, the Army Corps then claimed the distant wet area touched a small stream, which eventually fed into a navigable waterway.

This approach is nearly identical to the one used against the Sacketts years earlier, and the Supreme Court rejected it. But bureaucracies resist change. Even as the proposed rule formally recognizes the need for continuous surface water (at least during the “wet season”), agency culture can still undermine the rule’s intended reforming effect.

The Lincks’ case shows how that culture of resistance can nullify even the best-intentioned reforms. Until the Sackett decision is followed in both letter and spirit, landowners will remain trapped in regulatory limbo. The Trump administration’s proposal is a welcome step, and it could bring relief to many landowners now mired in enforcement actions. But the proposal stops short of what the Supreme Court clearly instructed: that wetlands may be regulated only when they are truly indistinguishable from a waterbody itself, regardless of season.

When agencies presume authority beyond what Congress designated, and beyond what the Supreme Court has permitted, they put every landowner at risk. And the Lincks, like the Sacketts before them, should not need a lawyer simply to enjoy their land.

The administration deserves credit for trying to bring the law into line with the Supreme Court’s direction. But it must finish the job and federal agencies must follow the law. “Continuous” means “continuous,” “indistinguishable” means “indistinguishable,” and regulatory inventions such as the “wet season” have no place in defining federal power. Following the Supreme Court’s clear rules would give families such as the Lincks real certainty over their land.",https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/wetlands.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:00.431698

Driving Factors

Government Funding Accelerates Flexible Solar Manufacturing Growth

One major driving factor of the Flexible Solar Cell Market is strong government investment aimed at strengthening domestic solar manufacturing and advanced cell production. When public funding supports manufacturing scale-up, it reduces cost barriers and speeds up commercial adoption of flexible solar technologies.

The U.S. government invested $71 million to boost domestic solar manufacturing, directly supporting production capacity, workforce development, and supply-chain resilience. In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy invested another US$71 million specifically into thin-film and silicon solar manufacturing projects. These investments encourage innovation in lightweight, flexible designs while improving efficiency and durability.

Such funding helps bridge the gap between research and large-scale manufacturing, giving industries more confidence to adopt flexible solar solutions. As funding strengthens production ecosystems, flexible solar cells gain faster acceptance across multiple applications.

Restraining Factors

High Production Costs Slow Flexible Solar Adoption

One major restraining factor in the Flexible Solar Cell Market is the high cost of production and early-stage manufacturing complexity. Flexible solar cells rely on advanced materials and precise fabrication processes, which increase costs compared to conventional rigid panels.

Even though Toledo-area solar companies received $16.1 million in federal funding, such support is often aimed at pilot-scale improvements rather than full cost reduction. This means many producers still face challenges in achieving low-cost, mass production. Higher costs can slow purchasing decisions, especially in price-sensitive applications, and limit wider deployment.

While funding helps improve technology and local manufacturing readiness, scaling flexible solar solutions remains expensive. Until production processes become simpler and more standardized, high costs will continue to restrain faster market expansion.

Growth Opportunity

Advanced Electronics Integration Creates New Solar Opportunities

A major growth opportunity in the Flexible Solar Cell Market lies in integration with advanced electronics and next-generation devices. Flexible solar cells are increasingly suitable for systems that require lightweight, adaptive, and reliable power sources.

A $4.4 million grant to build a prototype of next-generation night vision technology highlights how defense and sensing applications need compact, flexible energy solutions that can operate in dynamic conditions. At the same time, US$850 million in 45X manufacturing credits generated through First Solar sales strengthens domestic production ecosystems and improves material availability for advanced solar technologies.

Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels.
The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown.
“It’s not like ethanol.” In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025.
Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut.","Inside a green metal-clad building in the Port of New Haven, a kind of modern day alchemy is at work, turning used cooking oil into fuel capable of powering trucks and heating homes.

Within a maze of tightly stacked tanks, pipes and collection units, workers take the grease — or other available waste products such as animal fats, tallow and vegetable oils — and add an alcohol catalyst to trigger a chemical reaction that produces biodiesel, which is marketed as a more climate friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

A series of rapid expansions in recent years has made the plant, home of American GreenFuels, the largest producer of biodiesel on the East Coast.

Originally opened in 2011 as Greenleaf Biofuels, the plant was later purchased by the American division of Swiss commodities trader Kolmar Group and renamed American GreenFuels. Since 2016, its output has quadrupled, from 15 million gallons to nearly 60 million gallons a year.

The most recent expansion, completed this summer, added a second story to the production floor.

“It often smells like french fries, as you might expect,” said Paul Teta, the vice president and general counsel for Kolmar Americas, which is based in Shelton.

The company’s growth has been spurred, in part, by government subsidies and laws requiring fuel dealers to blend home heating oil with biodiesel in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Teta declined to say how much the company has invested in its New Haven plant, other than to say it was in the “many millions of dollars.”

According to Kolmar, the biodiesel made at its New Haven facility produces 86% less greenhouse gas emissions, on average, compared with ultralow-sulfur heating oil. The emissions reductions are even more substantial when the fuel is sold and burned in Connecticut, removing the need to transport it long distances on trucks.

New York City passed the nation’s first blended biofuel mandate in 2012 and was followed by a state laws in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Connecticut’s law, Public Act 181 of 2021, required that heating oils contain at least a 5% blend of biodiesel starting in 2022. That amount increased to 10% this year and is set to grow steadily until reaching a minimum 50% blend in 2035. (Roughly 400 million gallons of fuel oil is delivered each year in Connecticut, according to the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association.)

In addition to state incentives, biodiesel fuels were previously eligible for a $1 per gallon federal tax credit. As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, those credits were replaced by other tax incentives based on lowering carbon emissions. Despite what he called an “ambiguity” around the changes to federal policy, Teta said that increasing blended fuel ratios in the Northeast has provided stability to the industry.

“When the law got passed, that gave us enough certainty to be able to make the next level of investment,” Teta said.

“The federal program’s certainly still important, because it incentivizes the price, otherwise biodiesel would be more expensive,” he added. “We want to keep the price low. So all put together, it has been a good mix for us to be able to expand.”

A controversial energy source

Not everyone is happy about the push to adopt biofuels. Environmental advocates, including the Sierra Club, have argued that biodiesel perpetuates a reliance on fossil fuels and that states should instead seek to transition as rapidly as possible to all-electric options such as heat pumps.

“Electrification is really the answer for reducing emissions from vehicles and from home heating,” said Samantha Dynowski, the president of the Connecticut chapter of the Sierra Club. “We just want to make sure that our emphasis is on the long term solution, not kind of a bridge, because the more we invest in this, the less you can get off of it.”

Supporters of biofuels, however, say they offer a path for states like to Connecticut to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next several decades. Earlier this year, Gov. Ned Lamont signed a law setting a statewide net-zero emissions target by 2050.

Chris Herb, the president of the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, said the state’s reliance on natural gas to meet its energy needs, along with the high cost of building out greener technologies such as solar and wind, make the expansion of biofuels essential to meeting to those targets.

“There’s no way to blend [natural gas] down like we can petroleum,” Herb said. “Our industry is the only way we, the state of Connecticut, are going to be able to continue to make gains in carbon dioxide reductions in the fastest, least expensive way.”

But even biodiesel production has faced concerns around environmental pollution. In September, the EPA announced that American GreenFuels will pay $143,000 to settle penalties in the wake of Clean Air Act violations that occurred at the plant between 2020 and 2022. In a press release, the federal agency explained that it “found that the facility failed to control the release of certain air pollutants” during maintenance and system repairs.

When asked to respond to questions about the violations and the settlement, Kolmar Americas did not offer a detailed response.

“American GreenFuels, LLC is in compliance with the Clean Air Act,” Teta said in an email.

When it comes to the carbon-reducing benefits of biofuels, it also depends on the kind of feedstock that goes into the production process.

Oils that are processed directly from crops such as soybeans and corn require land clearing and mechanical harvesting that itself produces more emissions than recycled feedstocks such as used cooking oil. Only 36% of the biofuels produced nationally in 2022 came from waste or recycled feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Teta declined to say what percentage of American GreenFuels’ products is recycled, but he said historically the company has sourced most of its feedstock from waste products.

That could change next year, he said, due to the elimination of tax penalties for biofuels derived directly from crops. The change, which was implemented as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July, is likely to result in American GreenFuels using more bean oils in its production.

“We are mindful that we must remain competitive and diffuse the market’s concern that we will be priced out of the market for waste feedstocks and therefore become uncompetitive,” Teta said in an email.

Currently, Teta said the company sources cooking oil from more than 5,000 locations, including restaurants in New York City where it’s shipped to New Haven on trucks or barges. Middlemen who pick up the oil from the restaurants or food manufacturing facilities are supposed to filter it to remove bits of food and other impurities. Still, workers sometimes have to remove those impurities once the feedstock arrives or rejigger their process based on the types of oil used in frying machines.

“Using all these waste streams, all these different types of oil, it makes it harder on ourselves,” said Sean Hayden, the quality lab manager at American GreenFuels. “Luckily, our formulation is flexible.”

A growing business

The biodiesel industry has expanded considerably in recent years, a shift that has helped expand biodiesel applications beyond transportation to include uses like electric power and heating oil, one of the main uses of biodiesel in Connecticut. Those changes have had broader economic effects: Recent research found the biodiesel industry generated nearly $42.5 billion in economic impact nationally in 2024, along with 107,400 jobs and $5.8 billion in wages.

While American GreenFuels is one of a handful of East Coast operations, much of the growth in biofuels — a broader category that includes ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable hydrocarbon fuels— has been concentrated in the Midwest. The majority of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel production takes place in states like Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska, where crops used for these fuels are grown. That expansion has led to concerns that some crops, like corn, are being diverted to biofuel production rather than the food supply.

The exact impact of corn-based biofuel production on food supplies and prices has been a point of contention between environmental groups and biofuel supporters. Biodiesel industry experts say other production methods, like the use of soybeans and specific operations like American GreenFuels’ use of previously used oils and fats, sidestep those tensions.

“There’s no food-for-fuel issue,” said Stephen Dodge, the director of state regulatory affairs for Clean Fuels Alliance America, the trade organization that represents American GreenFuels and other member organizations. “It’s not like ethanol.”

In its latest biodiesel plant production capacity report, the U.S. Energy Information Administration found there were 48 biodiesel production plants operating in the U.S. as of January 2025. Collectively, those plants are capable of producing nearly 2 billion gallons of biodiesel in a year.

And the industry is expected to grow further. Estimates currently suggest that biodiesel use could top 6 billion gallons by 2030 and reach 15 billion gallons by 2050.

But production has faced headwinds in 2025, with biodiesel output falling earlier this year due to uncertainty around the future of federal tax credits and lower-than-expected profit margins.

Even so, American GreenFuels’ growth has made it a notable example of the manufacturing industry’s efforts to bounce back in Connecticut. The biodiesel industry supports some 1,250 jobs in the region, according to Clean Fuels Alliance America, and brought in some $47 million in revenue, according to Dodge.

Supporters of biofuels argue that the energy source can help serve as a transitional step as the country moves towards electrification.

“It’s really paramount upon private industry and government to do everything they can to start reducing carbon emissions as quickly as they can,” said Dodge. “We think that biomass-based diesel is the way to go.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/greenfuels-771x4341764625406.jpg?h=af608c2c&itok=jxdyMEaO,N,,2025-12-01 17:03:35.524722

The Public News Service Monday afternoon update.

I'm Mike Clifford.

President Donald Trump reportedly gave Nicolas Maduro an ultimatum to relinquish power immediately during their call, but Venezuela's authoritarian leader declined, demanding global amnesty for himself and allies.

That for the Guardian.

The report on Sunday, Trump confirmed the call had taken place, telling reporters, ""I wouldn't say it went well or badly. It was a phone call.""

And from the BBC, Republican-led committees overseeing the Pentagon have vowed to conduct vigorous oversight into the U.S. boat strikes in the Caribbean.

On Friday, The Washington Post reported that a U.S. strike on a boat in September left two survivors, but a second attack was carried out to comply with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's orders to kill everybody on board.

Hegseth denied the report, calling it fake news.

Meantime, unions in Kentucky and New Hampshire say they've made historic gains through coordinating bargaining.

Kayla Collette, the second shift steward for Local 728 in Kentucky, says the union made no concessions during their negotiations.

She says the wage increases in their contract benefit the region as a whole.

The agreements grant workers more freedom in determining work hours and weekly schedules and make other improvements to working conditions.

We've already seen that happen since we first bargained our initial contract in 2020.

It actually caused the wages in the area to have to get more competitive.

The unions represent more than 850 workers who process visa petitions.

This is Nadia Romligon for Kentucky News Connection.

Next, lawmakers in Maryland and clean energy advocates hope to pass legislation in next year's General Assembly session they say would make solar energy more affordable and accessible.

Under state law, utilities must either produce or purchase solar energy credits to prove a certain amount of power is coming from renewable sources or they're subject to a fine.

The proposed bill would also legalize balcony solar panels that can simply be plugged into an outlet.

Supporters of the legislation say those reforms will maximize impact and increase accountability for Maryland's clean energy buildup.

Maryland delegate Lorg Turkutian says the bill could also lower energy costs.

There will be no increase for ratepayers and the increased solar would put downward pressure on energy rates.

The Trump administration takes a hostile position on renewable energy, including solar.

And federal tax credits for making energy saving changes at home are expiring at the end of the year, but some opportunities for Oregonians to save on upgrades remain beyond 2025.

Originally established to last 10 years under the Inflation Reduction Act, these and other climate incentives are ending under the H.R. 1 bill, but Jamie Seymour with Energy Trust of Oregon says it's cash incentives and programs continue regardless of federal changes.

For people who have made these upgrades this year, they can receive both the tax credit and that incentive, really stacking those savings and taking advantage of that opportunity before the end of the year.

The expiring federal energy efficiency credits could save homeowners up to $3,200 on upgrades like heat pumps and insulation.

This is public news service.

New data make it clear the housing market is challenging right now for first-time home buyers, but in South Dakota, an industry group says all hope is not lost.

Last month, the National Association of Realtors announced that the share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21 percent. say the numbers underscore how hard it is for younger generations to build wealth through home ownership.

Chas Olson with the South Dakota Housing Development Authority says there's no doubt affordability is a problem right now.

For a first-time home buyer who's primarily going to be looking at existing homes, factors like high interest rates probably have a greater impact on affordability.

He says market woes place pressure on some SDHDA programs, but he says they're also coming off a year in which they were able to help more than 2,000 first-time home buyers.

Olsen says younger working adults who might think the market is out of reach need to look into assistance options and see if they're eligible.

One of his team's programs helps buyers with maximum family incomes of around $120,000.

I'm Mike Moen.

Next to Maine where officials warn a new federal directive will increase homelessness in the state.

The Trump administration is cutting funding for the Continuum of Care program, which helps move some of the most vulnerable people off the streets and into stable, supportive housing.

Mark Swan with the social service organization Preble Street says some 1,200 Mainers, including seniors, veterans and people with disabilities, are now at risk of losing their homes.

""You know, we don't have shelters that can support that many people and it's just a big step backwards.

I don't get why this is happening.""

Federal officials say the program has encouraged dependence on government handouts and that funding will now be directed toward short-term transitional housing to encourage greater self-sufficiency.

Swan notes the changes come despite a severe housing shortage in the state with emergency shelters already at capacity.

Finally, New Mexico is leaning into its rural roots in providing students with local healthy foods and school cafeterias, and the National Farm to School Network is taking notice.

The advocacy group brings its annual conference to Albuquerque starting today, noting the state's efforts to turn grassroots community-led food justice into policy.

The network's Jian Chan says the conference includes 40 workshops, farm and school field trips, hands-on classes, and presentation of the Golden Chile Awards, celebrating excellence in farm-to-cafeteria work.

I think everyone is familiar with the term farm-to-table and all of the benefits environmentally for the local economy, just the flavor and freshness of the food.

And so we want to bring that same benefits and the same concept to schools.

The Farm to School Network praised the state's universal school meals program adopted in 2023.

This guide offers practical steps to keep businesses operating if an owner or key worker is detained or deported. It includes information on emergency planning, documentation, and legal readiness to safeguard both businesses and families.

“This resource is about preparation and resilience. We want small business owners and employees to have the tools they need to protect their livelihoods and families during times of uncertainty,” said Mayra E. Pineda, President & CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana.

Highlights of the Resource Page

Business Continuity: Guidance on establishing a Power of Attorney (Mandate/Procuration) to authorize a trusted representative.

Legal Compliance: Preparation for I-9 audits, SSA “No Match” letters, and workplace documentation requirements.

Financial Safeguards: Strategies for securing banking access, adding co-signers, and protecting assets.

Workplace Readiness: Employee rights during ICE actions, emergency contact planning, and continuity templates.

Community Resources: Links to consulates, advocacy groups, schools, and nonprofits offering legal aid and immigrant support.

Through these efforts, the HCCL not only aims to assist its members but also address a critical need for comprehensive support in an increasingly uncertain immigration environment. The Chamber says the launch of this resource page is a “timely response to the challenges faced by the community and serves as a vital tool in fostering resilience and preparedness among Louisiana’s small business owners.”

The Hispanic Chamber emphasized that the information provided is for general educational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice and has advised business owners and employees to consult qualified attorneys for guidance specific to their situation.

National Trends in Immigration Enforcement

As HCCL launches this resource, it operates against a backdrop of increased immigration enforcement actions. Recent ICE and U.S. Border Patrol enforcement activities have included extensive worksite raids.

Over the past year, more than 1,100 arrests have been reported nationwide in connection with over 40 worksite enforcement actions, targeting a variety of sectors, from manufacturing to agriculture. One of the largest raids occurred in Sept. at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, where 475 workers were detained.

These enforcement have resulted in a general sense of instability among employers and workers who may be reluctant to attend work or access public spaces.

Research indicates that these types of enforcement measures can significantly impact local economies. A recent study demonstrated that escalated ICE raids resulted in declines in private sector employment and consumer participation, ultimately affecting economic activity.

RAYVILLE, La., Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Entergy Louisiana broke ground in Richland Parish to mark the start of construction on a pair of new combined-cycle combustion turbine generation facilities recently approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The Franklin Farms Power Station represents a significant investment in modern energy infrastructure designed to strengthen reliability, power economic expansion in north Louisiana, and deliver significant economic benefits — including billions in capital investment, thousands of construction and technology jobs, and lasting value for local communities and Entergy customers statewide.

The project underscores Entergy Louisiana's commitment to delivering modern, efficient and dependable energy solutions for the state's communities, industries and digital future. Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 megawatts of highly efficient natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are part of a new expedited interconnection study process to ensure Louisiana can meet the speed to market needed in a power-first world.

The new CCCT facilities will feature modern, highly efficient technology that uses less fuel to produce more power, resulting in lower emissions and improved system reliability. This next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service.

""These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana's long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,"" said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. ""By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we're ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.""

""I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project.""

""Truly a bright day for northeast Louisiana,"" said Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell. ""I am glad to help play a small part in this economic opportunity.""

Powering Louisiana's digital economy

Meta's new, state-of-the-art data center in north Louisiana is one of the largest investments in the region's history and is expected to support over 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs (once completed), and long-term economic opportunities to the state. These new generation facilities will play a critical role in supporting this development, but also ensuring all of Entergy's customers have access to reliable, resilient, and sustainable power.

Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement. By aligning energy infrastructure with digital growth, the partnership strengthens Louisiana's position as a hub for data-driven industries while promoting cleaner, more efficient energy use.

Customer benefits

Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta's operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta's contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta's contributions toward Entergy's system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, helping keep bills lower across Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers. In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana's system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide.

Investing in communities and economic growth

Beyond powering Louisiana's economic growth, these projects will deliver lasting benefits to local communities through job creation, increased tax revenues, and enhanced system reliability. Construction and long-term operation of the new facilities will generate significant economic activity in Richland Parish and surrounding areas, while improved grid performance will reduce outages and support future business expansion.

""Entergy Louisiana's partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,"" said May. ""Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana's energy future—one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.""

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.

,Clean Energy ,2025-12-01 20:15:03+00:00,BoiseDev,Idaho Power scales back plans for conversion to renewable energy - BoiseDev,Margaret Carmel - BoiseDev Sr,,,,,https://boisedev.com/2025/12/01/idaho-power-climate-goal/,"Idaho Power estimates its customer base will grow from 648,000 at the end of December 2024 to 867,000 in 2045.
“We’re seeing eight to nine percent growth every year over the next five years,” Idaho Power Resource Planning Leader Jared Hansen said in an interview.
Data centers, AI change energy plans Artificial intelligence wasn’t on the general public’s radar six years ago, when Idaho Power first set out to meet its energy goals.
Data centers, particularly those built to support the extra computing power needed to power AI, are large users of electricity and water.
Idaho Power is currently in the process of asking the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for a roughly 13% hike in rates.","Idaho Power is still pursuing its goal of being 100% powered by clean energy by 2045, but the utility’s latest plan shows more reliance on carbon-burning energy than before.

The latest Integrated Resource Plan released by Idaho Power shows the company is under pressure to power up to meet demands from a growing number of customers, as well as large users like data centers in the coming decades. The need to expand infrastructure to keep up with the boom in demand is behind both the company’s ask to increase rates and its rollback to needing more natural gas-powered plants in its portfolio long-term. This is a pivot from earlier plans that involved converting these plants to burning hydrogen in the later decades or powering them down completely.

Idaho Power estimates its customer base will grow from 648,000 at the end of December 2024 to 867,000 in 2045.

“We’re seeing eight to nine percent growth every year over the next five years,” Idaho Power Resource Planning Leader Jared Hansen said in an interview. “That’s over 40% of our energy sales. That’s significant for us in every industry, you have lulls and surges and we seem to be in a surge right now. We’re scrambling to meet that.”

In 2019, the utility first announced plans to go coal-free. To meet this goal, Idaho Power said it planned to use 40% of the state’s power coming from hydroelectricity, along with new development of wind, solar, and battery storage to meet demand and take over the 20% of the company’s portfolio powered by coal. Another cornerstone of the company’s strategy to meet this goal is the construction of transmission lines to move power back and forth between Idaho and abundant hydroelectricity in the Pacific Northwest during the summer and the surge of solar power in the American Southwest during the winter.

The Boardman-Hemingway transmission line linking the Treasure Valley with the Pacific Northwest began construction this year and is expected to come online by the end of 2027 after decades of planning.

How have Idaho Power’s plans changed over time?

Idaho Power’s long-range plans, released every two years, show the ebb and flow of how much the company plans to rely on renewable energy as it works to meet the 2045 benchmark.

This latest plan relies more on natural gas than previous plans. In 2021, the company’s integrated resource plan called for converting a 357-megawatt coal-burning power plant to gas in 2024 and closing another 175 megawatts of coal-burning power by 2028. Then, by 2034, the company planned to close the converted gas plant in favor of other renewable sources like wind, battery storage, and solar.

This changed in 2023 when Idaho Power’s plan for that year showed coal plants converted to burn natural gas in 2024, 2026, and 2030. Then, the utility forecasted shutting down 706 megawatts of natural gas-burning power plants in 2038 in favor of burning hydrogen instead.

The 2025 plan once again shakes up the company’s approach with plans to convert two units at Idaho Power’s Bridger power plant in Wyoming from burning coal to natural gas next year. The utility forecasts being done burning coal by 2030. But this plan involves building two new natural gas plants in 2029 and 2030, as well as tentative plans for additional natural gas-burning capacity by 2041 and 2043. There are no plans to scale back natural gas generation in this latest plan or to add hydrogen-powered plants to the mix.

Hansen said Idaho Power needs natural gas, which isn’t subject to the cycles of the weather or the sun, to meet the spike in demand on the state’s power grid. Natural gas is a non-renewable fossil fuel and emits greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, but it does burn less CO2 than coal.

“Going forward, we still need further innovations to get there,” Hansen said, noting Idaho Power could use new technologies like carbon capture or other processes to provide a steady, cleaner power supply than coal. “…To date and where we are today, meeting our loads reliably requires some firm resources that emit carbon dioxide, like natural gas. It’s not a simple answer, and it’s a complex issue, to keep our system affordable and reliable into the future.”

Environmental groups like the Sierra Club say Idaho Power should do more to convert to renewable energy sources. Lisa Young, director of the Idaho chapter of the Sierra Club, called Idaho Power’s plans to build new gas plants “really, really alarming” and said the company can meet its growing needs with renewable energy rather than natural gas. She said this new plan raises questions about Idaho Power’s commitment to its 2045 clean energy goal.

“This is the first time we’re seeing this in their latest plans and should sound alarm bells for a lot of folks,” Young said. “To be investing in these things in the next five years, of course, if they’re going to be building any new infrastructure, any new assets, they’re going to want to use those for as long as they can. It won’t make sense to build a new gas plant and shut it down two years from now. Our concern is they’re going to invest in this new infrastructure, and we’ll be stuck burning gas for another few decades.”

Like its fluctuating plans to burn natural gas, Idaho Power’s plans for how much renewable energy it will add have also changed. Its 2021 plan envisioned adding 3,790 megawatts of wind, solar, and battery storage capacity through 2040. This spiked in 2023’s plan to more than 6,500 megawatts of renewable energy added, including several years of back-to-back investment in solar in the 2040s.

The 2025 plan backs off the amount of renewable energy in the plan down to 3,030 megawatts added through 2045.

Data centers, AI change energy plans

Artificial intelligence wasn’t on the general public’s radar six years ago, when Idaho Power first set out to meet its energy goals.

Data centers, particularly those built to support the extra computing power needed to power AI, are large users of electricity and water. Data centers across the country used 183 terawatt-hours of electricity last year, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency. Around the country, electricity prices are spiking in states like Virginia, where data centers to power the internet are plentiful.

Idaho is relatively new to the data center business. In 2020, the Idaho Legislature passed a tax break aiming to lure data centers to the state. So far, Meta and a 620-acre data center from Diode Ventures have set up shop in Kuna, but have not yet come online. These two projects have since sparked intense debate at the local and state level about their inclusion in urban renewal districts and their strain on the power grid or other resources, with relatively few high-paying jobs in return. Bills limiting the tax exemption for data centers and requiring companies to provide their own electricity were introduced in this year’s legislature session, but failed to get over the finish line.

Idaho Power is currently in the process of asking the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for a roughly 13% hike in rates. The utility also recently earned PUC approval to cut reimbursement rates to solar panel owners.

Hansen said many customers assume rates are going up due to new data centers coming into the state, but what is largely driving the need for the rate increase is the higher costs of steel, copper, transformers, and other materials needed to maintain and expand the power grid. He said that no data centers are currently online in Idaho, and the utility analyzes the needs of large users before they come online.

“We have in place a no-harm analysis and a study where we look and ensure those customers are paying for the resources they will need and other customers are not harmed,” Hansen said. “We want to make sure that all of our customers are not bearing the weight of those customers coming on, and we study those things with and without those customers to determine what the rates would look like and make sure those customers are bearing their own burdens and carrying the costs of services they’re encurring on the system.”",https://boisedev.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/idaho-power-set-clean-energy-goal-its-shifting-its-plans-including-new-natural-gas-plants-IMG-1608-EDIT.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:02:47.666808

The EPA has proposed significant changes to its 2023 PFAS reporting rule, marking a major shift from what had been one of the most expansive information-collection requirements ever imposed on manufacturers and importers.
In its new proposal, the EPA seeks to narrow the rule’s scope by exempting article importers entirely, as well as PFAS present in mixtures or products at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less.
EPA also proposes altering the timing of compliance by delaying and shortening the reporting window, citing delays in developing its electronic reporting system.
Businesses that manufacture PFAS or import PFAS-containing products should consider evaluating how these proposed changes may affect their reporting obligations and whether to submit comments.","On November 10, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a proposal to significantly narrow the scope of its per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule under Section 8(a)(7) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), just two years after finalizing the original rule in October 2023. The 2023 rule requires manufacturers, including importers, of PFAS and PFAS-containing products to submit extensive one-time reports to EPA covering any year of manufacture or import between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2022.

The EPA has proposed significant changes to its 2023 PFAS reporting rule, marking a major shift from what had been one of the most expansive information-collection requirements ever imposed on manufacturers and importers. The EPA now claims that the rule created substantial and often impractical burdens, particularly for small businesses and article importers attempting to reconstruct decade-old supply-chain information with limited records.

In its new proposal, the EPA seeks to narrow the rule’s scope by exempting article importers entirely, as well as PFAS present in mixtures or products at concentrations of 0.1 percent or less. The agency also proposes exemptions for byproducts, impurities, non-isolated intermediates, and certain research and development substances. These changes would remove a large portion of downstream entities from the rule and will allegedly reduce total industry compliance costs by more than $750 million. The EPA describes the revised approach as a practical recalibration that focuses on information most relevant to evaluating PFAS uses and exposures while avoiding what it now characterizes as disproportionate burdens.

Some environmental groups warn that excluding articles and low-concentration PFAS could leave substantial gaps in the national PFAS picture, given the prevalence of PFAS in global supply chains and the toxicity of certain compounds at very low levels. They argue that the exemptions risk obscuring potential PFAS sources at a time when regulators and communities are seeking more visibility into how these chemicals enter commerce.

EPA also proposes altering the timing of compliance by delaying and shortening the reporting window, citing delays in developing its electronic reporting system. Once published in the Federal Register, the proposal will be open for a 45-day comment period, during which regulated entities will have the opportunity to weigh in on whether the narrowed rule appropriately balances EPA’s information needs with practical implementation concerns. Businesses that manufacture PFAS or import PFAS-containing products should consider evaluating how these proposed changes may affect their reporting obligations and whether to submit comments.",https://lgwmlaw.com/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-01 20:00:46.888067

Blue hydrogen also faces some specific headwinds.","Exxon Mobil has pulled the plug on what would have been one of the world’s largest hydrogen plants, the latest setback for the effort to scale production of low-carbon versions of the fuel.

In 2022, the oil giant announced plans to build a facility at its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas, with the capacity to produce 1 billion cubic feet per day of so-called blue hydrogen, which is made using natural gas and carbon-capture equipment. It won a nearly $332 million grant from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy to finance the project.

But the Trump administration yanked that funding this spring. Since blue hydrogen typically costs about one-third more than the ​“gray” version of the fuel made with unmitigated gas, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods said the company could not find enough buyers willing to pay the premium.

“There’s been a continued challenge to establish committed customers who are willing to provide contracts for off-take,” Woods said in an interview with Reuters.

Exxon Mobil Corp. did not return Canary Media’s call Wednesday requesting comment.

The pullback highlights mounting problems for the clean hydrogen industry. Green hydrogen, the zero-carbon version of the fuel made with clean electricity and water, costs even more than the blue or gray types. In October, the Trump administration terminated federal funding for two regional hydrogen hubs on the West Coast that were meant to help bring down the cost of the green fuel. Blue hydrogen, in theory, was seen as less politically vulnerable since its production ensures a market for gas. But that, too, now appears to be running into similar problems.

“Exxon’s decision reflects a broader reality: Large-scale hydrogen projects depend on long-term market signals, stable policy environments, and customers ready to commit,” said Roxana Bekemohammadi, the founder and executive director of the United States Hydrogen Alliance, an industry group. ​“These dynamics take time to mature.”

But it’s not just the Energy Department’s decision to shutter its Industrial Demonstrations Program, which had given Exxon Mobil the grant, and the cuts to the 45V federal tax credits, which support low-carbon hydrogen production, that have put the industry on shaky ground.

Trump administration moves have also undermined demand for low-carbon hydrogen. In October, the U.S. government thwarted an effort at the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization to put a price on carbon emissions from the shipping sector, pressuring foreign delegates to back off a proposal that would have expanded the market for low-carbon hydrogen.

Blue hydrogen also faces some specific headwinds.

Late last month, the European Parliament passed legislation outlining rules for low-carbon hydrogen that require producers to demonstrate not only that carbon capture equipment catches at least 70% of emissions but also ​“pretty rigorous accounting of upstream methane leakage,” according to Pete Budden of the Natural Resources Defense Council. A study published last year in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy found that carbon-capture equipment could reduce emissions by 60%, below the threshold set in the European Union law.

“Based on the work we’ve done tracking emissions from blue hydrogen, it’s going to be really tough for U.S. hydrogen producers to meet that reduction with fossil fuels and [carbon capture and storage],” said Budden, the lead hydrogen advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ​“It’s a really ambitious emissions reduction because you need a really, really high capture rate, and you need to minimize all your upstream leakage.”

In the U.S., California remains the biggest market for the fuel. While state regulators slashed their 2030 forecast for hydrogen-powered vehicles, a giant power plant in Los Angeles just received approval to convert from gas to hydrogen.

“Yes, there have been significant reductions to federal funding for programs. Yes, we took a hit this year. Yes, it caused uncertainty in the markets. And yes, it caused some projects to pause,” said Katrina Fritz, the chief executive of the California Hydrogen Business Council, the nation’s largest and oldest statewide trade group for the fuel. ​“But in California, we still have offtake markets that are moving forward. There’s still demand. And we still have new production projects moving forward.”

Among those projects: a solar-powered green hydrogen facility. Its owner?

“As he went through his two terms, there were allocations over time, particularly in private equity co-investments.
Then, last year, he was brought back as CIO by the new state treasurer, Brad Briner.
The plan has hovered around a 9 percent IRR across private equity investments over the past two fiscal years.
“Our primary goal though is to improve returns and the risk profile of the plan,” Sigrist said.","In a play to bolster performance, leaders of the North Carolina Retirement Systems are redefining the $139 billion plan’s approach to investments in several ways – beginning by eschewing a long-held fee-reduction focus – even accepting to pay for co-investments with select GPs.

Over nearly a decade, the system traded higher fee managers that boasted strong returns for cost-saving investment vehicles. Now, the plan is looking to swing the pendulum back.

As to why that is – the system’s CIO, Kevin Sigrist, points to a maxim he can recall from his time in graduate school studying economics: Prices push people around. People don’t like to get pushed around.

“The market is what it is, and there are costs associated with investments that are quite reasonable,” he said. “We all want to negotiate better fees, better terms. That’s part of our business. The reality is, if we’re really receiving a good investment and we expect to have good GPs … we have to be comfortable paying market fees.”

The plan’s refresh

There’s more than a change in fee philosophy going on at the pension. Among models it’s leaving in the past, the system is also shifting governance away from giving the North Carolina state treasurer sole discretion over the fund to a more typical five-member board.

The change in direction comes as the portfolio has an abundance of cash reserves. The goal, according to Sigrist, is to put that cash to work. And that’s exactly what the system has done over the past year, tallying up $6 billion in commitments.

Sigrist said that cash was built up as the system endeavored to reduce fees paid to investment managers and maintain a lower risk appetite between 2017 and 2024, when Dale Folwell served as the North Carolina state treasurer.

“[Folwell] was focused on bringing down overall cost structure of the investment program,” he said. “So, there weren’t many commitments made into traditional [private asset] funds.

“As he went through his two terms, there were allocations over time, particularly in private equity co-investments. There were some notable real estate transactions as well. But it wasn’t in the usual fashion you’d see with other public pension funds.”

The system didn’t maintain a pacing plan and a deployment target for its asset mix during that time. Opportunities were mostly reflective of what no-fee, no-carry co-investments were available in the market, Sigrist said.

Sigrist has a storied history with the pension, but wasn’t acting as its CIO at that time. Five years into a previous stay in that post, he resigned in 2017. Then, last year, he was brought back as CIO by the new state treasurer, Brad Briner.

“Since Briner came in as treasurer, he has pushed to restart all the plan’s investment programs and redeploy excess cash,” Sigrist said.

Briner also advocated for the state’s pension system to dispense with a sole-fiduciary model that put the treasurer at the helm of investment decisions, and to replace it with a board of trustees, akin to how peer pensions operate.

Enabled by the passage of a law referred to as the 2025 State Investment Modernization Act, the pension is now in the process of transitioning to a five-person authority chaired by the state treasurer.

Sigrist said the goal of that overhaul was to borrow from best practices in the pension space and insulate the pension’s portfolio from the political cycle.

“Over time, as we’ve had state treasurers turn over, they’d start afresh,” Sigrist said. “They’d revisit the mandates to do alternative investments and new asset classes, as well as the risk appetite – all of that.”

Looking ahead

As the system works to infuse its investment strategy with more flexibility, the hope is this new governance structure helps improve future returns.

“It creates the right environment,” Sigrist said. “It’s not a guarantee we’ll get better results, but what we’ve observed globally among our peers is governance really matters a lot in terms of improving the likelihood you’ll get good returns.”

Over a three-year span ending June 2022, North Carolina’s plan underperformed all state retirement systems with an average return of just 4.9 percent, based on a 2023 Yale University survey.

Performance has picked up in more recent financial reports released by the system. The plan has hovered around a 9 percent IRR across private equity investments over the past two fiscal years.

This December, the system’s new board will potentially reset the plan’s risk appetite and set the stage for further rebalancing the portfolio.

“We will recommend adding some risk, but not much – we’ll probably remain a fairly conservative fund overall compared to other state funds,” he said. “But until we finish that study with the board, it’s hard to know what we’re going to do in terms of what asset classes we might emphasize or de-emphasize.”

A lot of the system’s direction is still in flux. The new board is undergoing its first-ever asset liability study, as well as approving budgets that could allow the investment team to travel more than in the past and conduct due diligence with new and existing GPs.

But Sigrist did suggest that the investment team has identified novel opportunities among private assets today, including in the traditional energy continuation vehicle space.

“We have a rough estimate, based on talking to investment managers, that there’s probably about $150 billion of private equity energy funds that could come to market in the form of CVs or LP secondaries,” he said. “That sector has been neglected by a lot of investors due to ESG concerns. But we invest purely on a fiduciary basis by law. So, we’re looking at that as an attractive sector.”

The system will still be on the hunt for private equity managers willing to engage in discussions about co-investments and SMAs that help bring down the cost of the program, even under its new mandate.

“Our primary goal though is to improve returns and the risk profile of the plan,” Sigrist said. “Our cost structure has been too low, to be frank. We’ve had discussions with GPs – and we’re happy paying for co-investments. As I said before, we’re not looking to just get the cheapest deal flow going forward.”",https://media.buyoutsinsider.com/uploads/2017/03/Avison-Young-in-Raleigh.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 18:03:06.524178

Similarly, the U.S. has maintained high tariffs and introduced proposals to prohibit Chinese hardware and software in connected vehicles, citing national security concerns.

Antoine Vagneur-Jones, head of trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF, noted that while global clean energy deployment continues to surge, ""overcapacity will define clean technology supply chains for years to come,"" and that ""emerging markets will rapidly step up imports of energy transition products as prices fall further.""

Ambitious Domestic Targets and Grid Challenge

The export push is underpinned by China's immense domestic climate goals, announced as part of its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). China aims to expand the combined installed capacity of wind and solar power to approximately 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, a goal that is more than six times the 2020 level.

To achieve this goal, China would need to install new wind and solar capacity at a pace of roughly 200 GW per year. While the 3,600 GW target is widely considered ambitious on a global scale—total global capacity was around 1,400 GW at the end of 2024—some analysts argue it is conservative given the country's recent installation pace, which has exceeded 300 GW in some recent years.

The true challenge lies not just in manufacturing the equipment, but in integrating such a massive amount of fluctuating power into the world's largest electricity system. Experts at the University of California San Diego note that this will require major upgrades to grid integration, energy storage, and power market mechanisms to ensure reliability.

China's stated intention is to promote international cooperation in green infrastructure and strategically deploy future-oriented industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), as it seeks to modernize its industrial system and maintain global influence in the clean energy sector.

Leveraging an existing hybrid cooling design, the partnership will adapt the system for West Texas conditions.
Together, the companies will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, assess site and height constraints, and model the water-saving performance that hybrid cooling can deliver at scale.
Construction of the first cooling tower is scheduled to begin in January 2026, with the full cooling system completed by 2034 to match the phased build-out of the gas and nuclear units.

Under the non-binding MOU, Fermi America and MVM EGI will partner on preliminary engineering and feasibility studies for a series of indirect hybrid cooling towers that will support both of Project Matador’s 6 gigawatts of combined-cycle natural gas generation and four AP1000 nuclear units.

Leveraging an existing hybrid cooling design, the partnership will adapt the system for West Texas conditions. Together, the companies will define cooling requirements, evaluate tower configurations, assess site and height constraints, and model the water-saving performance that hybrid cooling can deliver at scale.

This early engineering work lays the foundation for the campus’s long-term cooling strategy. The MOU outlines a sequence of milestones—including requirements definition, concept validation, and feasibility assessment—that will lead to a detailed design. Construction of the first cooling tower is scheduled to begin in January 2026, with the full cooling system completed by 2034 to match the phased build-out of the gas and nuclear units.

These hybrid towers represent a major advancement in responsible energy development. By relying primarily on air cooling and circulating water through closed-loop systems, the design sharply reduces evaporative loss, conserving precious water resources. The collaboration also includes evaluation of recycled and reclaimed water, as well as underground reservoirs and solar-covered retention ponds—technologies that further limit evaporation and protect the Ogallala Aquifer.

“Fermi isn’t some out-of-town operation parachuting in. Our leadership is from West Texas — we grew up on this dirt, and we care about the land and its resources,” stated Fermi America Co-Founder and CEO Toby Neugebauer. “As promised, we’re working with global innovators like MVM to ensure Project Matador complements the long-term water needs of the region, building something big, but doing it the right way.”

“MVM EGI has been on the cutting-edge of power cooling for more than half a century maintaining the heritage of our founders, Professor László Heller and Professor László Forgó whom the high-capacity water-saving dry cooling systems are named after worldwide,” added MVM EGI P.L.C. CEO Péter Kárpáti. “We are pleased to partner with Fermi America, the world’s largest private utility, to ensure efficient and responsible cooling of their gas generation and nuclear power in the panhandle of Texas in line with our motto: Less water, more power.”

The collaboration reflects both companies’ commitment to transparent, community-oriented development. With billions of dollars in investment and a 99-year lease with the Texas Tech University System, Fermi America’s business model is directly tied to the health of the Panhandle and the long-term sustainability of the Ogallala Aquifer. The MOU reinforces that alignment by putting water conservation at the core of the project’s cooling strategy from day one.",https://insidehpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/data-center-generic-compute-hpc-shutterstock-1696920283.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:04:11.915544

As America grows increasingly electric, we will need to find new avenues of energy production and distribution to keep pace with demand. This process is not without challenges, but is necessary to avoid severe consequences.

At first glance, it may seem that energy production in the United States is right where it should be, with production at an all-time high. However, the current pace is still nowhere near enough to match future consumption. In 2050, energy demand is projected to be 50% higher than it is today.

In 2023, power use in the United States was 4,049 terawatt hours (TWh). 37% of the total usage was from transportation, such as cars, buses, aircraft and ships. 35% was from industrial uses, such as manufacturing, agriculture, mining and construction. The rest of the energy use was through residential and commercial avenues. In 2050, we will need at least 5,178 TWh to keep up with demand. To put things into perspective, 1 TWh is enough to power the internet for 15 days, the state of California for 12.5 days or 100 million homes for 1 hour.

For more context on why energy consumption is increasing, it is important to consider new trends in technology. For example, the rise of electric vehicles may add between 100 TWh to 185 TWh to the country’s electricity demand by 2030. AI is another factor, with a single AI server request requiring 8 watt-hours of energy. This is around 23x to 30x the energy used by a normal internet search.

The electrical grid in the United States is not equipped to keep up with such demand. In fact, between 2018 and 2022, 5% of electricity transmitted and distributed in the United States was lost each year. In 2025 numbers, this would be 202.45 TWh, which is enough energy to fully power over 14,000,000 homes.

Transmission lines in the United States are aging, with 70% of these lines measuring in at over 25 years old. This can lead to power outages, higher risk of cyber attacks and the potential for emergencies caused by faulty infrastructure. Power transformers are also in need of an upgrade, with roughly 55% of residential transformers nearing the end of their life.

Additionally, very few substations are staffed in the United States. This leaves important infrastructure more vulnerable to threats. In November 2022 alone, six substations in the Pacific Northwest were attacked. In December 2022, 45,000 homes and businesses lost power after an attack at two substations in North Carolina.

Unfortunately, updating this infrastructure poses challenges of its own. The US electrical grid is massive, stretching across over 470,000 miles. Replacing the entire grid would cost close to $5 trillion. Plus, equipment prices continue to increase; transformers have almost doubled in price since 2019. Another challenge is long interconnection queues. Long queues result in 80% of projects being withdrawn because of delays and costs.

Luckily, there are still viable ways forward. One key strategy will be to explore alternative power sources. This is a main goal of the United States government, which has pledged to quadruple its nuclear energy in the next 25 years.

Improving lead times and quality for equipment is also key. One way to do this is by working with US-based providers, such as ELSCO (Electric Service Company). With ELSCO, there is a 90% item availability and 24-48 hour quick-ship. This increased efficiency can save time and money, which will be important moving forward.

Energy is a vital part of our society. Without it, key services fall apart. As energy demand increases, the United States will need to implement creative solutions, such as tapping into alternative energy and investing in efficient equipment.",http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:04:23.576821

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a policy and research organization dedicated to advancing the principles of free markets and limited government. We have a longstanding interest in bringing to light the deleterious consequences of federal regulations, which are often downplayed or ignored by agencies when adopting a regulatory agenda. CEI recently published “Modernizing The EPA: A Blueprint For Congress,”(Modernizing the EPA) which provides an overview of EPA programs under the Clean Air Act (CAA) and other statutes, and it includes a section on the Regional Haze Program at issue here. In it, we conclude that the Regional Haze Program, like most other decades-old programs administered by EPA, is now in need of significant course corrections if not outright repeal. While Modernizing the EPA was written primarily to provide legislative direction to Congress, its overview of the Regional Haze Program and recommendations for reform are relevant to this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and are relied upon in this comment.

II. A Brief History of the Regional Haze Program

A. The Original Intent in 1977

The Regional Haze Program was added to the Clean Air Act in 1977. Unlike the primarily health-based measures elsewhere in the CAA, regional haze is purely an aesthetic concern. It largely focuses on emissions from coal-fired power plants that could potentially impair visibility in national parks and other scenic vistas, especially in the Western United States, The statute provides states with wide discretion in determining both the objectives and the compliance strategies to address regional haze, with only minimal EPA oversight.

B. The Federal Takeover of the Regional Haze Program

During the Obama administration, however, the EPA devised a strategy to, in CEI’s view, wrest control of the program from states and impose far more stringent and costlier provisions. Specifically, the agency, in conjunction with environmental organization litigants, used “sue and settle” to create a series of consent decrees, and did so with minimal state input. Although the consent decrees on their face merely imposed timing requirements for the EPA to either approve state implementation plans or issue its own, the agency was then able to bootstrap the deadlines established in these consent decrees to declare state compliance efforts inadequate and impose its own set of federal implementation plans on several states.

C. Turning Regional Haze into a War on Coal

The agency has used this newfound control to take the Regional Haze Program well beyond its original intent. No longer is the focus on improving visibility but rather to mandate the installation of costly control technologies on industrial facilities – and especially on coal-fired power plants whose emissions are not, in EPA’s view, adequately limited under all the health-based programs in the CAA. This has been part of the agency’s sweeping climate change agenda to make coal uneconomic by imposing a costly redundancy of requirements, thereby inducing more shutdowns. Here, the Obama administration’s federal requirements were as much as an order of magnitude costlier on impacted coal-fired facilities than the requirements the states considered sufficient to address visibility concerns.

The litigation strategy, though wisely halted under first Trump administration, was quickly revived under the Biden administration. Most significantly, a 2024 consent decree between several environmental groups and the EPA affects 33 states, requiring these states to either produce a regional haze plan acceptable to the agency or submit to a federal implementation plan. The focus is on the dwindling fleet of coal-fired electric generating units still operating in these states, and will result in additional measures on top of the many other CAA provisions already applicable to such facilities.

III. The Questionable Need for Further Measures in Light of Declining Emissions

With or without the Regional Haze Program, the emissions affecting visibility have been going down and will continue to do so. The use of coal for electricity generation has declined dramatically since peaking in the late 2000s and is now below the usage when the Regional Haze Program was authorized by Congress in 1977. Further, coal plant retirements are expected to continue in the years ahead. At the same time, emissions from the remaining coal-fired facilities (as well as other sources that may impact visibility) are far lower today than likely was anticipated back then. It is important to remember that the Regional Haze Program was designed to address the residual emissions after all the health-based standards in the CAA are implemented, but there is considerable doubt whether there remain any such emissions sufficient to appreciably impact visibility.

One recurring theme throughout Modernizing the EPA is that the agency often ignores the emissions reductions that have already occurred over the decades, no matter how substantial and ongoing, and continues to make the requirements more stringent despite questions about the statutory need for doing more. That is certainly the case with regional haze, where there is, at best, limited evidence of any lingering problem justifying additional emissions controls.

IV. Recommendations

We applaud the agency’s reconsideration of the previous administration’s policy on the Regional Haze Program and welcome this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as a first step in what we hope are substantial program reforms. At a minimum, we urge the EPA to jettison the “sue and settle” model and its preference for federal mandates imposed upon the states. Instead, the agency should restore state primacy over the program as envisioned in the statute – up to and including respecting state determinations that no additional control measures are needed to address visibility. We also urge the agency to fully acknowledge the changed circumstances since 1977, and especially the declining emissions trends that undercut the case for further costly constraints under the program.

The final rules (T.D. 10037), released Nov. 21, eliminate the so-called “funding rule,” which could have triggered the tax when a U.S. subsidiary helps its foreign parent finance a buyback. Commenters argued the rule was vague and could apply to routine transactions, making compliance costly and uncertain.

The regulations also tighten other areas. They remove a proposed “no double benefit” item that would have disregarded certain reorganization and distribution transactions for purposes of the netting rule under Sec. 4501(c)(3). They also clarify the treatment of certain preferred stock, such as excluding “plain vanilla” stock described in Sec. 1504(a)(4) from the definition of stock subject to the tax, treating it as more akin to debt.

Background

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, P.L. 117-169, included a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases by publicly traded corporations under Sec. 4501.

The final regulations cover the fair market value (FMV) of a corporation’s stock that certain corporations repurchase during a tax year (the stock repurchase excise tax). The IRS issued the proposed regulations in April 2024. Then, in July 2024, it issued final regulations that provided rules on the procedure and administration applicable to the reporting and payment of the excise tax.

Relief for M&A transactions

The IRS scaled back the tax’s application to mergers and acquisitions, excluding “take-private transactions” and leveraged buyouts and liquidations under Secs. 331 and 332.

Expiring federal energy efficiency credits can save homeowners up to $3,200 on upgrades like heat pumps and insulation. Originally established to last 10 years under the Inflation Reduction Act, these and other climate incentives are ending under the One Bill Beautiful Bill Act passed in July.

Jami Seymore, spokesperson for the Energy Trust of Oregon, said its cash incentives and programs will continue regardless of federal changes.

“For people who have made these upgrades this year, they can receive both the tax credit and that incentive,” Seymore noted. “Really stacking those savings and taking advantage of that opportunity before the end of the year.”

Seymore explained Energy Trust incentives can be received as instant savings at retailers, as an up front deduction through a vetted contractor, or as cash-back after completing an upgrade. She added upgrades like heat pumps, high-efficiency gas furnaces, and solar panels are eligible for both the expiring federal credits and ongoing Energy Trust incentives.

Electric costs in Oregon have increased significantly, with residential rates for Pacific Power and Pacific Gas and Electric rising by about 50% since 2020.

South Carolina’s small businesses are too often burdened by a tangled and ever-expanding web of regulations that often grow without sufficient legislative oversight or accountability. Many of these regulations are outdated or unnecessary, stifling innovation, hindering job creation, and placing a disproportionate burden on the very businesses that drive our communities. Imagine a local bakery struggling to navigate complex labeling requirements that differ from neighboring states, or a local manufacturer delaying expansion because of confusing and inconsistent permitting processes. These real-world examples highlight how excessive regulation can cripple small businesses before they have a chance to grow and thrive.

The Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act restores balance, transparency, and accountability to the rulemaking process by ensuring that major new regulations cannot take effect without legislative approval. This key REINS-style safeguard reaffirms that the authority to make laws rests with elected representatives – not unelected bureaucrats.

In addition, H. 3021 includes several critical reforms that strengthen good governance and protect South Carolinians from regulatory overreach:

Judicial Deference Reform: Clarifies that courts shall not automatically defer to an agency’s interpretation of law, ensuring that judges – not regulators – have the final say on what the law means. This change promotes fairness, predictability, and adherence to legislative intent.

Regulatory Review and Sunset: Establishes a systematic review process to identify outdated, duplicative, or unnecessary regulations and provides for automatic expiration dates to prevent obsolete rules from lingering indefinitely.

Economic Impact Analysis: Requires agencies to provide detailed fiscal and economic assessments for proposed regulations, giving lawmakers and the public a clear understanding of costs and consequences before rules take effect.

Small Business Protection: Directs agencies to consider less burdensome alternatives and to justify any regulatory action that imposes significant costs on small employers.

Together, these reforms create a more accountable and transparent regulatory environment – one that strengthens the separation of powers and promotes economic growth across South Carolina.

We respectfully urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to promptly take up H. 3021 and for the full Senate to pass and enact this vital legislation early in the 2026 legislative session. Swift action will ensure timely implementation and deliver long-overdue relief to small businesses across our state.

The Small Business Regulatory Freedom Act will reduce unnecessary red tape, promote innovation and, and create a level playing field for entrepreneurs in South Carolina – allowing them to focus on what they do best: creating jobs, innovating, and serving their communities. South Carolina’s job creators deserve a government that it is accountable, responsive, and focused on enabling – not obstructing – opportunity.

In Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Tucson, a single adult can live comfortably on less than $87,000 a year.
Hawaii, New York, California, and Massachusetts top the list, with single adults needing over $130,000 per year to live comfortably.","American families are facing a convergence of economic pressures that are redefining what it means to live comfortably. After years of elevated inflation, the cost of essentials — from housing and groceries to transportation and health care — remains persistently high. At the same time, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in the workplace is introducing new uncertainty in traditionally stable white-collar industries, adding to financial strain for many middle- and upper-middle-income earners.

In this environment, understanding how much income is needed not just to get by, but to live comfortably, is top of mind for many Americans. This report from Upgraded Points, a company that provides advice on credit card reward programs and other financial products, applies the 50/30/20 budget rule — a widely used framework for balancing needs, wants, and savings — to estimate the income required to maintain a comfortable standard of living across the largest U.S. metro areas and all 50 states.

How Much Do Americans Need To Live Comfortably?

According to the 50/30/20 rule, a well-balanced budget allocates 50% of income to necessities, 30% to discretionary spending, and 20% to savings or debt repayment. When paired with cost-of-living data from the Economic Policy Institute, this framework provides a benchmark for determining the minimum income required to sustain a financially comfortable lifestyle.

Nationally, a single adult with no children in 2025 would need $106,745 per year in pretax income to stay within this budget structure. For 2 adults with no children, the threshold rises to a combined $138,643. Costs increase significantly with the addition of children: a 2-parent household would need $194,038 with 1 child, $233,158 with 2, and $278,252 with 3.

These figures offer a national baseline, but living costs vary dramatically by region. The next section looks at how much income is needed in the country’s largest metro areas, where expenses like housing and child care are often far above the national average.

The Income It Takes To Live Comfortably in America's Largest Cities

Living comfortably in the United States looks very different depending on where you are. Among the country’s largest metropolitan areas, the income needed varies by more than $75,000 for a single adult — and more than $250,000 for a family of 5 — depending on the local cost of necessities such as housing, child care, and taxes.

At the top of the scale are 3 California metro areas: San Jose, San Francisco, and San Diego. In the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan statistical area (MSA), a single adult needs to earn $163,045 per year to live comfortably, the highest among the nation’s largest metro areas. For a 2-parent household with 3 children, that figure climbs to $478,630 — over $200,000 more than the national average for the same family type. Similarly, the San Francisco and San Diego MSAs require incomes of $148,441 and $146,080, respectively, for a single adult to stay within the 50/30/20 budget. This high-income requirement reflects the outsized cost of living across coastal California, where housing and taxes are particularly expensive. On the East Coast, Boston and New York are not far behind.

At the other end of the spectrum are cities in the Midwest and South, where living costs are significantly lower. In Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Tucson, a single adult can live comfortably on less than $87,000 a year. For a family of 5, the required income ranges from $240,709 in Pittsburgh to $250,997 in Cleveland — roughly half the income needed in the highest-cost metro areas. These regions tend to have more affordable housing markets and lower daily living costs for everything from gas to groceries.

How Much It Takes To Live Comfortably in Every U.S. State

Similar trends hold at the state level, where the nation’s most expensive states are concentrated along the West Coast and Northeast. Hawaii, New York, California, and Massachusetts top the list, with single adults needing over $130,000 per year to live comfortably. For a 2-parent household with 3 children, the income required exceeds $330,000 in all 4 states. Other high-cost, coastal states include Washington, New Jersey, Maryland, and Connecticut.

Meanwhile, the most affordable states are found in the Midwest and South. In North Dakota, a single adult needs just $83,144 — the lowest among all states. Ohio, Iowa, Arkansas, and Indiana also all fall below $88,000 for individuals, with family income needs far lower than in coastal states.

Here is a summary of the data for Indiana:

Salary needed to live comfortably (1 adult, 0 kids): $87,952

Combined salary needed to live comfortably (2 adults, 0 kids): $119,105

Combined salary needed to live comfortably (2 adults, 1 kid): $165,671

The move is intended to accelerate the low-carbon transition of the nation's vast manufacturing sector.

Li Lecheng, minister of industry and information technology, said in a piece for China Daily, that China's determination to pursue a green transition in manufacturing underscores its drive to foster new quality productive forces and pursue high-quality development. He stressed that this commitment persists even as global climate governance encounters setbacks and some nations potentially backtrack on their pledges.

China will ""encourage competitive Chinese enterprises in photovoltaics, wind power, lithium batteries and new energy vehicles to expand globally and to invest in and develop green energy projects in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and beyond,"" Li said.

Global Market Impact and Cost Revolution

China's expanding clean technology manufacturing base, which controls more than 70 percent of global capacity in major clean-tech segments, has reshaped the world's energy transition. The sheer volume of Chinese exports has made renewable energy solutions more affordable and accessible globally, particularly for emerging economies.

Over the past decade, solar panel prices have fallen to record lows, a trend largely attributed to the scale and efficiency of Chinese manufacturing, according to data from energy think tanks. For many developing nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, this has facilitated a faster adoption of wind and solar power, enabling a path toward economic growth and emissions reduction.

In the first seven months of 2025, China's exports of the ""new three"" industries—electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries—surged to over $120 billion, an increase that reflects the rising volume of exports despite falling unit prices, according to data from the UK-based energy think tank Ember. This surge is driving a global shift, where 92.5 percent of all newly installed power capacity worldwide in 2024 came from renewable sources.

Geopolitical Friction Over Subsidies

The aggressive expansion, however, is being met with protectionist measures in Western markets. The European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.) have raised concerns over what they describe as massive state subsidies that allow Chinese companies to export goods at prices that undercut local manufacturers.

Analysis by groups such as Bruegel and BloombergNEF indicates that extensive state backing, including direct funding and cheap credit, has created an unrivalled cost advantage for Chinese manufacturers. This competitive edge has led to acute global overcapacity in sectors like solar and batteries.

In response, the European Commission has imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports following an investigation into unfair subsidies. Similarly, the U.S. has maintained high tariffs and introduced proposals to prohibit Chinese hardware and software in connected vehicles, citing national security concerns.

Antoine Vagneur-Jones, head of trade and supply chains at BloombergNEF, noted that while global clean energy deployment continues to surge, ""overcapacity will define clean technology supply chains for years to come,"" and that ""emerging markets will rapidly step up imports of energy transition products as prices fall further.""

Ambitious Domestic Targets and Grid Challenge

The export push is underpinned by China's immense domestic climate goals, announced as part of its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). China aims to expand the combined installed capacity of wind and solar power to approximately 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035, a goal that is more than six times the 2020 level.

To achieve this goal, China would need to install new wind and solar capacity at a pace of roughly 200 GW per year. While the 3,600 GW target is widely considered ambitious on a global scale—total global capacity was around 1,400 GW at the end of 2024—some analysts argue it is conservative given the country's recent installation pace, which has exceeded 300 GW in some recent years.

The true challenge lies not just in manufacturing the equipment, but in integrating such a massive amount of fluctuating power into the world's largest electricity system. Experts at the University of California San Diego note that this will require major upgrades to grid integration, energy storage, and power market mechanisms to ensure reliability.

China's stated intention is to promote international cooperation in green infrastructure and strategically deploy future-oriented industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), as it seeks to modernize its industrial system and maintain global influence in the clean energy sector.

As the U.S. debates the future of renewable energy, Connecticut stands at a crossroads. Once seen as a key player in the nation’s offshore wind boom, the state now faces uncertainty following the federal government’s recent pullback on wind energy projects. For Connecticut — where state leaders have invested heavily in ports, transmission infrastructure, and clean energy partnerships to drive both economic growth and emissions reductions — the shift raises urgent questions about what comes next.

YSE News spoke with Daniel Esty, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy, and Kenneth Gillingham, the Grinstein Class of 1954 Professor of Environmental and Energy Economics, about how wind power development has evolved in Connecticut, the state’s strategies for advancing renewable energy in a shifting federal landscape, and what will be needed to sustain momentum .

Q. How has wind power development in Connecticut evolved, and what strategies or policies do you see as most effective for maximizing its benefits while minimizing environmental and social impacts?

Esty: Wind power development in Connecticut, and everywhere else, requires a policy framework that creates incentives for investment and an attractive opportunity for wind generation developers. These incentives can be based on federal laws, regulations, and subsidies or on state programs. Some of the critical rules relate to siting and permit requirements, which need to ensure both that (1) potential environmental and social concerns are addressed and (2) these processes move expeditiously. The second critical policy dimension centers on ensuring that public money and incentives are used to leverage private capital at speed and scale.

Gillingham: Connecticut has very limited onshore wind resources, so for many years, there were only a handful of wind turbines in the state. In fact, one of these is right in New Haven Harbor. But the Long Island Sound is blessed with extensive offshore wind resources. As offshore wind prices have declined over the years, there has been increasing interest in tapping this resource. Offshore wind also came along with the promise to provide jobs in some of the working-class shoreline communities in Connecticut. The state of Connecticut has gone to great lengths to encourage the staging of offshore wind development in cities like Bridgeport and New London, and this is a sensible strategy to try to make sure that offshore wind provides economic benefits to the state.

Maximizing the benefits of offshore wind while minimizing environmental and social impacts generally requires both analysis and deep collaboration with stakeholders, and in particular the fishing community.

Q. With pullback at the federal level, how can CT and other states who have invested in wind projects continue to move them forward?

Gillingham: With the pullback at the federal level, there is only so much that Connecticut and other states can do to continue to move wind projects forward. They can expedite state permitting and provide state support. But if offshore wind is not permitted at the federal level, it will certainly hinder development.

Q. What are the main challenges or disadvantages of wind energy, and how do you see it advancing relative to other renewables?

Esty: Wind power faces a number of challenges — notably, the need to be paired with strategies to promote investment in batteries or other approaches for electricity storage to overcome the reality of the intermittency of wind power. Wind power also requires that projects proceed on a basis that results in cost effective power generation. Success in this regard depends on siting and permitting processes that move forward with speed but also care. The key is to make these projects attractive from a perspective of predictability and cost-effectiveness, thus engaging for those deploying capital in the clean energy arena.

Gillingham: Onshore wind energy is quite cost-effective in many locations and is often more economic than using fossil fuels. Offshore wind is more expensive but is valuable due to the consistency and timing of the winds just offshore. Importantly, the winds often very consistently blow in the evening hours, just after the sun goes down when demand for electricity is commonly the highest. This makes wind an ideal resource to complement solar energy, which is now less expensive but without storage cannot generate electricity once the sun goes down.

There are some other disadvantages of wind power. While new wind turbines are designed to minimize bird loss, some birds do fly into the turbines and perish. In addition, the newest wind turbines are extremely large, which makes them more efficient and cost effective. But some people find them unsightly and prefer unspoiled landscapes. For offshore wind in particular, the construction of the wind turbines can disrupt fishing and breeding grounds. Fishers also will have to be more careful around the turbines. But over time, offshore wind turbines can serve as artificial reefs and in some cases can lead to more fish than there would have been otherwise.",https://environment.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_1200x630/public/2025-11/Block-Island-Wind_036.jpg?h=44b879e5&itok=c8_EBmGN,N,,2025-12-01 15:00:37.010340

RAYVILLE, La. –Entergy Louisiana broke ground in Richland Parish to mark the start of construction on a pair of new combined-cycle combustion turbine generation facilities recently approved by the Louisiana Public Service Commission. The Franklin Farms Power Station represents a significant investment in modern energy infrastructure designed to strengthen reliability, power economic expansion in north Louisiana, and deliver significant economic benefits — including billions in capital investment, thousands of construction and technology jobs, and lasting value for local communities and Entergy customers statewide.

The project underscores Entergy Louisiana’s commitment to delivering modern, efficient and dependable energy solutions for the state’s communities, industries and digital future. Together, the two power plants will add approximately 1,500 megawatts of highly efficient natural gas generation capacity. The two plants are part of a new expedited interconnection study process to ensure Louisiana can meet the speed to market needed in a power-first world.

This project reinforces what we are seeing across Louisiana: when we modernize our energy infrastructure, we unlock growth for every region of our state,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Under Governor Landry’s leadership, we are strengthening reliability, powering innovation and creating the conditions for long-term economic opportunity. Entergy’s investment demonstrates the value of partnership and the competitive advantage Louisiana brings to a power-first economy.”

The new CCCT facilities will feature modern, highly efficient technology that uses less fuel to produce more power, resulting in lower emissions and improved system reliability. This next-generation infrastructure will help Entergy Louisiana meet growing energy demands, provide operational flexibility to integrate renewable resources, and ensure customers continue to benefit from low-cost and dependable service.

“These facilities represent the next step in Entergy Louisiana’s long-term strategy to modernize our generation fleet and deliver reliable, cost-effective power to our customers,” said Phillip May, Entergy Louisiana president and CEO. “By investing in efficient technologies and robust infrastructure, we’re ensuring that Louisiana remains a competitive, attractive place to live, work, and do business both today and well into the future.”

“I also want to thank our partners from local and state governments, the Franklin family and our communities for coming together to ensure the success of this historic project.”

“Truly a bright day for northeast Louisiana,” said Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell. “I am glad to help play a small part in this economic opportunity.”

Powering Louisiana’s digital economy

Meta’s new, state-of-the-art data center in north Louisiana is one of the largest investments in the region’s history and is expected to support over 5,000 construction jobs and 500 operational jobs (once completed), and long-term economic opportunities to the state. These new generation facilities will play a critical role in supporting this development, but also ensuring all of Entergy’s customers have access to reliable, resilient, and sustainable power.

Recently recognized at the inaugural Louisiana Energy Awards, this collaboration between Entergy Louisiana and Meta reflects a shared commitment to innovation, sustainability, and community advancement. By aligning energy infrastructure with digital growth, the partnership strengthens Louisiana’s position as a hub for data-driven industries while promoting cleaner, more efficient energy use.

Customer benefits

Entergy Louisiana customers will benefit directly from Meta’s operations in Louisiana, through lower energy costs and enhanced system resilience. Once operational, Meta’s contributions to costs otherwise paid by all customers are expected to reduce customer bills. In particular, Meta is expected to lower customer storm charges by an average of approximately 10% and lower the bill impacts of resilience upgrades for customers by a similar amount. Over the 15-year agreement, Meta’s contributions toward Entergy’s system costs — including storm recovery — are projected to save customers approximately $650 million, helping keep bills lower across Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement, Meta will fund the full cost of the utility infrastructure required to interconnect and serve its Richland Parish data center. This structure, consistent with regulatory measures designed to protect consumers, prevents cost-shifting to other customers. In addition, the new generation resources being added to Entergy Louisiana’s system will be among the most efficient in the state, providing additional fuel savings and long-term reliability benefits for customers statewide.

Investing in communities and economic growth

Beyond powering Louisiana’s economic growth, these projects will deliver lasting benefits to local communities through job creation, increased tax revenues, and enhanced system reliability. Construction and long-term operation of the new facilities will generate significant economic activity in Richland Parish and surrounding areas, while improved grid performance will reduce outages and support future business expansion.

“Entergy Louisiana’s partnership with Meta and our local leaders demonstrates how strategic energy investments can drive economic development and strengthen the communities we serve,” said May. “Together, we are building the foundation for Louisiana’s energy future—one that supports growth, innovation, and opportunity for all.”

Construction on the two Richland Parish facilities will begin immediately following the groundbreaking, with both projects expected to be completed and operational by late 2028.

A new modeling approach that draws data from personal weather stations can more accurately capture air temperatures across U.S. cities, according to researchers in the Division of Translational Toxicology.

Heatwaves have grown more frequent in recent decades and are expected to intensify in the coming years. This trend is especially concerning in cities due to the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon in which urban areas are several degrees warmer than their surrounding rural areas. Exposure to extreme heat can increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney diseases. However, most U.S. cities do not monitor weather patterns in enough detail to generate the data scientists need for epidemiological studies.

To address this limitation, the researchers developed a model that estimates hourly air temperatures to which people are exposed with high spatial resolution — meaning it can detect local phenomena such as overheating neighborhoods and the cooling effect of parks. In doing so, they relied on an extensive network of personal weather stations. This approach resulted in accurate coverage of meteorological events such as heatwaves and snowstorms in Philadelphia, New York City, Phoenix, and the Triangle area in North Carolina.

The method also revealed that densely populated neighborhoods are more likely to experience high temperatures and longer, warmer nights. According to the authors, their model could strengthen future epidemiological studies of heat-related health effects. In addition, the approach could improve heatwave alerts that are tailored to specific regions to protect vulnerable populations. (JW) (See related article.)

Pesticides linked to higher rheumatoid arthritis risk in farm women

Exposure to organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, and other pesticides, may raise the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in farm women, according to NIEHS researchers and collaborators. The study is the largest to examine pesticide exposures in relation to RA in this population, and the first to also consider indirect exposures due to applicators’ use.

Growing evidence shows that farming and pesticide use may contribute to RA. However, few studies have examined the effects of specific pesticides on RA risk among women living on farms, where they may be personally or indirectly exposed to pesticides.

To address this gap, the researchers investigated RA incidence among female spouses of licensed private pesticide applicators/farmers in the Agricultural Health Study. They assessed both personal use of 32 specific pesticides by spouses and indirect exposures based on applicators’ use.

They found that personal use of several insecticides – the organochlorine DDT and lindane, the organophosphates coumaphos and malathion, the carbamate called carbofuran, and permethrin – was associated with higher RA risk. Spouses’ RA risk was also associated with personal use of the use of the herbicide metribuzin, and fungicides captan and metalaxyl. Among women who did not personally apply pesticides, RA risk was also greater in those with indirect exposure to the insecticide carbaryl, the herbicide metribuzin and the fungicides maneb/mancozeb.

These findings suggest that both personal and indirect use of certain pesticides may contribute to RA in women. The authors recommend future studies on the role of contemporary insecticides also widely used for residential and public health purposes. (MD)

How a key protein controls mRNA stability

A protein called tristetraprolin (TTP) promotes the decay of specific mRNAs by interacting with multiple molecular partners, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators at the National Cancer Institute.

TTP is an RNA-binding protein that controls the stability of mRNA in cells. Specifically, TTP promotes the decay of a subset of mRNAs that contain particular target motifs. Many of these mRNAs encode cytokines involved in the inflammatory and innate immune responses. Deficiency of TTP in mice leads to a severe systemic inflammatory syndrome with arthritis, osteopenia, and autoimmunity. TTP expression is frequently down-regulated in human cancers, and this is often correlated with poor patient prognosis and tumor progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which TTP controls mRNA stability and influences disease development have remained unclear.

The researchers show that TTP regulates mRNA stability by interacting directly with the CCR4–NOT complex, a large multiprotein complex that degrades mRNA by promoting the stepwise loss of the polyA tail. TTP also promotes mRNA decay by binding to PABPC1, a protein that typically enhances mRNA stability by binding to the polyA tail. The results highlight the ability of TTP to simultaneously interact with different protein molecules to effectively destabilize mRNA, and thus rapidly affect gene expression in response to environmental cues or stress signals.

Future studies will be needed to determine the structural basis of these interactions, and whether altering these interactions could affect the wide range of diseases linked to disrupted mRNA stability. (JW)

A sugar called hyaluronan can help treat viral infections

Treatment with a natural lung-repairing molecule called hyaluronan improves outcomes in mice and humans infected with viruses, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Viral lung infections such as influenza and COVID-19 are a major cause of illness and deaths worldwide. Many existing treatments do not prevent adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-threatening condition characterized by severe lung inflammation, tissue damage, and fluid buildup. There is also a critical need for treatments that could be rapidly deployed against a wide range of emerging viral infections.

To address this problem, the researchers examined the potential therapeutic properties of high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMWHA), a sugar found in healthy tissue that reduces inflammation and promotes lung repair. Mice were infected with influenza or SARS-Cov2, which causes COVID-19, and treated with either HMWHA or saline control. HMWHA increased survival rates in mice infected with either virus by reducing inflammation and limiting viral movement through mucus.

In humans, inhaled HMWHA improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, shortening ventilator use and hospital stays among older patients with acute respiratory failure. According to the authors, the study lays the foundation for future clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of HMWHA as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. (JW)

Simplifying single-cell datasets

A powerful computational tool called GIBOOST enhances the visualization and interpretability of single-cell datasets to provide critical biological insights, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

High-dimensional, single-cell data consists of complex measurements of many features from individual cells, such as gene expression, protein levels, and signaling activity. These datasets are important for characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying various diseases. However, these datasets are often challenging to visualize and interpret, limiting insights into disease progression or drug responses.

To address this challenge, the researchers developed a computational framework called GIBOOST, which is driven by artificial intelligence (AI). GIBOOST offers a holistic view of the data by combining the strengths of existing tools while minimizing their limitations. The tool reduces the complexity of the data while preserving essential features, enabling effective visualization and interpretation.

The researchers showed that GIBOOST provides superior visualization of cell-cell communication and cellular transitions during processes such as sperm cell production and placenta development compared with standard methods. This approach could enable researchers to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of complicated, dynamic biological processes across different tissues and disease states. Ultimately, this information could support the development of effective treatments and the promotion of optimal health. (JW)

Chemical health hazards following train derailment identified

A new literature review by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators highlights the potential health consequences of chemical releases following disasters such as train derailments.

In 2023, a Norfolk Southern Railway train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, exposing nearby residents to toxic chemicals released into the air, water, and soil. To prevent an explosion, emergency responders conducted a vent and burn of five rail cars containing a carcinogenic gas called vinyl chloride.

To better understand the disaster’s potential health hazards, the researchers conducted a literature review of studies on 22 chemicals that may have been released after the derailment. Their analysis revealed that eight of these chemicals can irritate the skin, eyes, or respiratory tract, findings consistent with symptoms reported by community members and first responders.

The team also found that five of the chemicals are known to cause cancer, two may damage the immune or nervous system, and one could harm reproductive organs or fetal development. In addition, the researchers identified knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future studies. According to the authors, these insights could inform communication and health-monitoring strategies related to toxic chemical releases during derailments and other disasters.

Improving immunotherapies for allergic asthma

A new study has revealed a specific type of lung immune cell that reduces allergic reactions to inhaled allergens, according to NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Allergic asthma is a common disease triggered by immune reactions to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander. Symptoms can include coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Currently, there remains an urgent need for immunotherapies that work quickly and improve patient adherence.

Toward this goal, the researchers investigated lung conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which help promote tolerance to allergens. The results revealed that type 2 cDCs (cDC2s) express high levels of a protein called CD301b. These cells strongly activated T-regulatory (Treg) cells, which are known to suppress allergic responses. When transferred to mice, these cDC2s induced immunological tolerance to inhaled allergens.

The findings shed light on how cDCs and Treg cells develop and function in the lung, broadening the understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of asthma. According to the authors, future studies focusing on the newly characterized cDC2s may pave the way for improved strategies to prevent or treat allergic asthma. (JW)

Hair straightener/relaxer use may be linked to pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer

Women who use hair straighteners may face a higher risk of developing various types of cancer, according to a new study by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators.

Hair products such as straighteners and chemical relaxers are widely used, despite previous findings linking them to increased risks of reproductive cancers (breast, ovarian, and uterine). Whether these products are associated with other types of cancer has been less clear. To help address this knowledge gap, the researchers analyzed data from 46, 287 women aged 35-74 years, tracking cancer diagnoses over an average follow up period of 13 years.

The results showed that use of hair straighteners and chemical relaxers at the time of enrollment was linked to higher rates of thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer. The study participants were 84% non-Hispanic White women; thus, the authors emphasized the need for future research in more racially and ethnically diverse populations — particularly with more representation of Black and Hispanic women, who tend to use these products more frequently.

According to the authors, the findings broaden the understanding of potential health risks associated with chemical hair products. More research is needed to identify which ingredients contribute to cancer development and to clarify the biological mechanisms that may be involved in this process. (JW)

Airborne phthalates linked with high blood pressure

Exposure to phthalates emitted from industrial sources may increase the risk of high blood pressure, according to an NIEHS researcher and collaborator.

Phthalates are widely used chemicals found in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. As endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can be released into the air, they interfere with hormones and have been linked to a range of health problems. Although other EDCs have been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, the potential relationship between phthalate exposure and high blood pressure, or hypertension, remains unclear.

To investigate this question, the researchers analyzed interview responses and blood pressure measurements from 47,465 women participating in the Sister Study. They estimated exposure to phthalates based on a national air toxin database linked to participants’ home addresses. The results showed that higher levels of airborne phthalates were associated with an increased risk of hypertension, especially among women who were not non-Hispanic White.

Given the widespread presence of phthalates and the growing prevalence of hypertension, the findings have important public health implications. The authors noted that air quality regulations and environmental policies may be needed to reduce phthalate emissions. They also highlighted the importance of future studies to clarify how these chemicals may alter biological pathways that lead to hypertension or related health conditions. (JW)

How air pollution affects breast cancer in the U.S.

A large analysis, U.S.-based study led by NIEHS researchers and their collaborators shows that several air pollutants are linked to a higher risk of breast cancer.

Breast cancer incidence has steadily increased in the U.S. in recent decades. Previous research suggests that exposure to environmental chemicals and pollutants may contribute to this trend. For example, air pollution contains molecules that can act as carcinogens and can disrupt hormones, potentially contributing to the development of breast cancer. Yet limited evidence exists on how these associations may vary by breast tumor subtype or geographically, due to differing sources of pollutants.

The researchers analyzed data from five large U.S. cohorts, including more than 28,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer. The results revealed a positive association between residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide and breast cancer risk, consistent with previous studies. In addition, outdoor levels of fine particulate matter were associated with a higher breast cancer risk among participants living in the Midwest. Exposure to both fine particulate matter and ozone were associated with a higher risk of hormone receptor-negative tumors, which tend to grow more aggressively and respond to fewer treatment options.

According to the authors, air pollution may contribute to a larger number of breast cancer cases than previously recognized, given widespread environmental exposures and high rates of the disease. (JW)

Renewable and low-carbon systems will be at the core as it eyes global leadership in sustainable and inclusive growth, powered by clean energy, sustainable industries, climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forests and green urban systems, as per the Telangana Rising 2047 Vision document that is set for launch next week.

Near-zero emissions are to be achieved on the back of large-scale deployment of renewables, retrofitting of existing coal-based capacity with advanced SOₓ and NOₓ emission control systems, fully integrated with storage, smart grids and green hydrogen, providing 24×7 clean, reliable and affordable rates for all citizens, the government said.

The State will formulate robust policies for renewable energy development, grid modernisation and market reforms to ensure affordable, reliable power. Clean and Green Energy Policy 2.0 will facilitate renewable integration, storage, open access, time-of-day pricing and PPP-driven distribution reforms. A State Net Zero Power Council will be set up to coordinate innovation and progress; and industries can directly procure renewables via power exchanges or group captive models.

Estimating power demand to rise from 100 TWh in 2026 to 780 TWh 2047, with peak demand soaring from 19 GW to 139 GW, the government said 90% of capacity by 2047 will be renewables and storage systems. Cleaner and efficient thermal will account for balance 10%.

More than 60% of energy generated by 2047 will be battery and pumped-hydro storage, supported by smart grids and green hydrogen integration. A total of 765 kV green transmission corridors will connect solar and wind generating areas, along with being enabled by IoT and AI-based grid control.

No ICE vehicle sales after 2039

On integrated smart mobility, the government said that a seamless, smart and sustainable transport network is to be developed. Almost 80% of existing and all new urban routes will have aspects of non-motorised transport, ensuring a people-first, low-carbon mobility network State-wide.

Elaborating on the pathways to 100% clean mobility, it said Hyderabad will have the largest electric bus fleet by 2030. By 2047, all passenger transport, from metro, MMTS and buses will be ZEV and 80% of private 2W/3W/4W will be ZEV. Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles will not be sold after 2039.

Setting up 6,000 public charging stations by 2030 and establishing fast-charging corridors every 20 km by 2047 besides hydrogen refuelling stations connecting highways and industrial routes form part of the proposals. Telangana Mobility Valley (TMV) will be promoted as a global centre for manufacturing as well as research and development related to EV and energy storage, battery recycling, and hydrogen and fuel-cells.

The State is keen on developing metro rail networks in all cities with populations exceeding 5 lakh and deploy AI-based traffic management and integrated real-time multimodal transport platforms. It will promote walking and cycling infrastructure, implement transit-oriented development (TOD); green tax and vehicle scrappage policy for high EMF (high-emission fossil) vehicle retirements, besides developing elevated corridor to initially operate high-capacity buses, with provisions to convert it into a rail-based transit track as passenger demand grows.

The government also plans to have renewable energy corridors and strategies such as Mahbubnagar — Wanaparthy, Jogulamba-Gadwal, and Nagarkurnool, Narayanpet for solar projects; floating solar in major lakes across the State; rooftop solar-powered metro and e-mobility for Greater Hyderabad, Warangal, and Karimnagar; and harnessing wind power in Narayanpet, Vikarabad and Sangareddy.

For the capital required to drive clean energy growth, the government plans to tap green bonds and blended-finance instrument, while optimising carbon credit trading system and engaging with national and global markets to generate recurring climate finance.

Actions taken by EPA in 2025 to date demonstrate sustained TSCA enforcement, including with respect to chemical regulations and particularly chemical data reporting requirements. Environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also utilizing TSCA’s Section 20 citizen suit authority to bring lawsuits against companies over alleged reporting noncompliance as well. Chemical manufacturers and importers should stay apprised of these enforcement trends and proactively manage their TSCA compliance strategies to reduce enforcement and litigation risk.

EPA Enforcement in 2025

While the government has scaled back civil environmental enforcement in federal court, EPA’s administrative enforcement remains robust and appears to be accelerating. In the third quarter of calendar year 2025, EPA resolved 198 administrative enforcement actions across the statutes it administers—up from 179 case conclusions in the second quarter—and has assessed over $9 million in penalties. Although many of these cases likely were initiated during the prior administration, the continued settlement approvals reflect EPA’s focus on “core” enforcement work under the current administration.

EPA’s TSCA enforcement and compliance assurance program includes four key focus areas: new and existing chemicals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), asbestos, and lead-based paint. From time to time, aspects of the TSCA enforcement program have been included amongst EPA’s national focus areas, as reflected in the National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives that EPA selects on four-year cycles. TSCA enforcement largely is, however, part of “core” enforcement work, which Administrator Zeldin has made a priority for the agency.

Since the beginning of the current administration, EPA has pursued 115 new administrative enforcement actions and assessed approximately $4.3 million in penalties for TSCA violations. The vast majority of these cases (about 80 percent) concern lead-based paint regulation noncompliance, which have generally resulted in lower penalty assessments than chemicals enforcement actions. Of the ten largest TSCA penalties assessed this year to date, five were for chemicals enforcement actions. For example, the agency assessed its single largest TSCA penalty in 2025—$700,000—for violations of the TSCA Chemical Data Reporting (CDR) rule, where the respondent allegedly failed to report 334 imported chemicals for the 2024 reporting cycle. EPA assessed six‑figure penalties in three other CDR rule enforcement actions—$415,000, $393,000, and $112,155—as well as a $100,000 penalty for alleged violations of the methylene chloride risk management rule for paint removers.

NGO Lawsuits to Enforce TSCA CDR Violations

TSCA Section 20 also gives private citizens the authority to bring civil actions against companies in federal court for TSCA violations. TSCA allows private citizens to bring such suits so that a court can restrain the identified TSCA violations or compel EPA to enforce the law. Since 2021, NGOs have filed TSCA Section 20 actions against companies for alleged CDR violations and continue to do so with growing frequency. Two of the most recent lawsuits were filed earlier this fall by the NGO Center for Environmental Health (CEH). CEH alleged that certain chemical companies failed to report imported chemicals to EPA for the 2020 CDR reporting cycle.

The complaints in these cases detail how the NGOs identify potential violations by reviewing information on company imports and manufactured chemicals published in EPA’s CDR public database. NGOs have also asked the courts in these cases to 1) declare the companies violated TSCA, 2) order the companies to file corrected CDR reports with EPA, 3) restrain the companies from ongoing CDR violations, 4) order that the companies audit their manufacturing and import activities to identify other potential CDR violations, and 5) pay the NGO’s attorneys’ fees. Even when penalties are not imposed, responding to TSCA Section 20 claims can be costly and require the diversion of resources away from other business functions.

Companies should be aware of these types of civil actions because they can open the door to NGOs or other private citizens to pressure companies, as part of settlements, to agree to allow them to participate in company-led TSCA CDR (or broader) audits, which could potentially reveal additional TSCA violations.

What Companies Should Do

EPA administrative enforcement and citizen-filed lawsuits represent two significant legal risks for chemical manufacturers and importers subject to TSCA CDR rule requirements. Noncompliance can result in not only steep penalties but also business operational disruption. On the front end, manufacturers and importers should routinely review their own TSCA compliance programs and audit their own TSCA reporting compliance, which can also position companies to take advantage of EPA’s Audit Policy[1] where its conditions are met, potentially mitigating penalties for voluntarily disclosed noncompliance. Companies should also proactively prepare for the next CDR reporting cycle in 2028. Companies should also engage counsel early when responding to EPA inquiries or enforcement activity or notice of citizen lawsuits.

The recall covers Qin PLUS DM-i models manufactured between January 2021 and September 2023, according to a notice filed with the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).

The filing states that the problem stems from a “manufacturing consistency issue” in the power-battery packs.

This defect may lower the battery’s output and “potentially” cause the vehicle’s electric-drive mode to shut down in certain situations.

BYD plans to resolve the issue through over-the-air software updates to the affected vehicles’ diagnostic systems.

After the update, if an anomaly is detected in the battery, a warning will appear on the instrument panel instructing drivers to visit authorised service centres.

Under the recall programme, dealers will replace faulty battery packs at no cost to owners.

The action follows a defect probe opened by SAMR, which concluded that consistency problems in battery production could limit power output and, in rare cases, stop the cars from operating in pure electric mode.

The regulator’s move points to increased attention on the uniformity and quality of power-battery manufacturing among major electric vehicle producers in China.

This latest recall comes shortly after BYD initiated another large-scale action involving more than 115,000 vehicles in mid-October, including BYD Tang and BYD Yuan Pro models, over design flaws and battery-related safety concerns.

One would hope that the Trump Administration would have learned that by now.","Last month, Jeffrey Clark, the Acting Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, issued yet another memorandum (M-25-36) describing how the Trump Administration intends to “streamlin[e] the review of deregulatory actions.” If you’re experiencing déjà vu, you’re not alone: M-25-36 follows at least two executive orders, an April presidential memorandum, and two other “M” memos addressing the same subject. Clearly, the administration believes that individual agencies have failed to pursue deregulation with sufficient vigor, and so M-25-36 directs agencies to “redouble their efforts in this area.”

Like many of the administration’s other attempts to run roughshod over the APA’s requirements, however, the approaches that M-25-36 recommends suffer from significant legal vulnerabilities—and are unlikely to achieve the results that the administration wants. Two vulnerabilities merit particular attention. First, the memo reiterates a flawed theory of the APA’s good cause exception that would allow agencies to sidestep notice and comment whenever they believe that a previous rule was unlawful. And second, the memo encourages agencies to consider certain so-called deregulatory “benefits” that will often be insufficient to justify deregulation.

The Administration’s Flimsy Good Cause Theory

M-25-36’s primary focus is to encourage agencies to “fully maximiz[e] their energy” in repealing “facially unlawful regulations ‘without notice and comment’ under the Administrative Procedure Act’s ‘good cause’ exception.” The memo largely reiterates the theory espoused in the April presidential memorandum: that providing notice and comment before rescinding regulations that the administration believes are facially unlawful would be “superfluous” (and therefore “unnecessary”) and serve no purpose other than delay (which would be “contrary to the public interest”). This time, it cites as support two inapposite, decades-old circuit cases recognizing that agencies may invoke the good cause exception where a “stringent” or “tight” congressionally imposed deadline has left insufficient time for notice and comment.

The theory espoused in M-25-36 and the April presidential memorandum might expose an agency to at least three distinct legal challenges, as we at Governing for Impact have repeatedly explained. First, to the extent the agency relies upon an erroneous or overbroad interpretation of Supreme Court precedent as justification for rescission, its action may be set aside; “[a]n order may not stand if the agency has misconceived the law.” Second, even if an existing rule is unlawful in some respects, an agency’s decision to rescind it immediately and in full may be arbitrary and capricious if the agency failed to consider reliance interests or available alternatives to rescission. And third, neither the APA’s plain text, case law interpreting it, nor the Attorney General’s interpretation of the law when it was enacted supports the administration’s good cause theory. To the contrary, the D.C. Circuit has squarely rejected the argument that “notice and comment requirements do not apply to ‘defectively promulgated regulations.’”

But don’t take our word for it. Just a month before OIRA issued M-25-36, Judge Reed O’Connor of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas declined to excuse an agency’s failure to comply with notice-and-comment requirements even though the agency asserted that its regulation was compelled by the statutory text. In his words, the agency “ask[ed] the Court to find that an agency need not comply with the APA’s stringent requirements, as long as the agency’s interpretation of a statute is the best reading.” But the agency did not “cite to a single case” endorsing that proposition, and “the Court c[ould not] find any in which a court considered this argument[,] much less made such a holding.” He therefore “decline[d] to be the first.” By the same token, an agency cannot skip notice and comment simply because it believes that a rule is inconsistent with a statute’s best reading, or with some other legal requirement.

The flimsiness of the Trump Administration’s good cause theory is perhaps why agencies appear to have been reticent to invoke it at scale. But if they have a change of heart, parties who will be harmed by the administration’s deregulatory efforts should not be afraid to hold them accountable.

Flawed Benefit-Cost Analysis

To the extent an agency chooses to make a policy case for rescinding a given rule, which M-25-36 acknowledges would “typically” require the agency to “afford notice and an opportunity to comment,” the memo offers a distorted account of the benefits and costs that the agency should consider. Among other things, the memo omits any discussion of the benefits of regulation, or of the reliance interests that may be jeopardized by rescinding regulations that have been on the books for years or even decades. An agency that fails to consider these “important aspect[s] of the problem” practically invites a finding that its action is arbitrary and capricious.

M-25-36 does break some new ground in its description of the “important, unique impacts” of deregulation—but that ground is littered with pitfalls. There are a few worth emphasizing, in addition to those identified by others in this forum.

First, the memo emphasizes what it describes as “private-conduct liberty benefits,” which it admits can generally “only be assessed qualitatively.” But by directing an agency to regulate in the first place, Congress has necessarily accepted that certain tangible benefits, like environmental protection or safeguards against predatory businesses, are worth the cost of imposing some restrictions on liberty. And if qualitative liberty impacts merit consideration, then so do other qualitative impacts, including interests like dignity, equity, and fairness. It will be difficult for agencies to justify excluding these considerations on the grounds that they are unquantifiable or otherwise irrelevant if they have already predicated a rulemaking on similarly intangible benefits. After all, an agency’s reasoning “cannot be internally inconsistent.”

Second, the memo describes the “aggregated impacts” of deregulation, meaning the downstream effects of deregulation on other aspects of the national economy. Those impacts, however, may well be difficult to discern or measure. To use the memo’s example of the sort of reasoning it envisions, how will agencies identify the remote and attenuated benefits of “deregulating the energy sector” on “increasing AI innovation and improving the development of new cryptocurrency assets,” as well as how those benefits are likely to “further profit consumers in a virtuous cycle”? The APA does not permit agency actions that are “based on speculation,” or on “a factual premise that is unsupported by substantial evidence.”

Third, the memo notes that “[r]egulations are almost always implemented under uncertain conditions,” and that new evidence may demonstrate that “the predictions of costs and benefits it made when it once stood at the door … have not been borne out by experience.” That may be the case, but the APA requires an agency to provide a “more detailed justification” when its decision rests on “factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy.” An agency will need to contend with the evidence or factual findings it cited in promulgating the rule it now wishes to rescind, rather than simply stating that its assessment has changed.

Finally, the memo attempts to analogize deregulation to the codification of a non-enforcement policy, suggesting that deregulatory action should be subject to a more “deferential” standard of review. In that respect, the memo echoes a theory advanced by the former general counsel for the U.S. DOGE Service that “[a] lower standard of judicial review should apply” when an agency rescinds regulatory requirements. But State Farm itself applied the arbitrary-and-capricious standard to deregulatory action, and there is nothing in the APA’s text or precedent to indicate that a different standard should apply outside the motor vehicle safety context. The memo also suggests that a regulation may have been unnecessary if enforcement history shows “few (if any) violations,” but that reasoning is, to use the late Justice Ginsburg’s description, “like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.”

Conclusion

There’s no “one weird trick” to rush deregulation. One would hope that the Trump Administration would have learned that by now. Perhaps the next deregulatory gambit will involve the use of artificial intelligence to accelerate the notice-and-comment process, an approach that may also encounter serious legal and practical difficulties. But rather than concocting increasingly elaborate theories of how to sidestep regulatory requirements, the administration might be better served by simply buckling down and doing the work.

Conducted for Duke Energy, an independent evaluation of the state’s three offshore wind energy areas found they all compared unfavorably against a reference price based on solar plus batteries.
So, Duke announced that it will not be pursuing offshore wind energy generation here.
Policymakers should amend the Carbon Plan law to make carbon neutrality a goal instead of a mandate.
The most important thing for power provision in North Carolina is meeting consumers’ need for reliable and least-cost electricity.","North Carolina energy policy saw big changes in 2025. Many are good for upholding reliability while avoiding unnecessary costs. Others, however, give some cause for concern.

North Carolina is now three years into a Carbon Plan law that seeks to eliminate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from electricity generation in the state by 2050. When the year opened, it included an interim goal of 70% reduction in CO2 emissions (from 2005 levels) by 2030. Incidentally, without a Carbon Plan, state emissions had fallen by more than half by 2023.

Developments concerning intermittent, unreliable generation

President Joe Biden had made “aggressive action” for offshore wind his Day-One priority. His signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), contained open-ended grants and tax credits “on the order of trillions of dollars” for renewable energy sources, while his administration hamstrung natural gas.

President Donald Trump, however, made it a Day-One priority to halt new offshore wind projects and review existing wind projects. His signature legislation, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” limited IRA tax credit eligibility for wind and solar facilities.

Conducted for Duke Energy, an independent evaluation of the state’s three offshore wind energy areas found they all compared unfavorably against a reference price based on solar plus batteries. So, Duke announced that it will not be pursuing offshore wind energy generation here.

In March, a meeting of the state Senate Committee on Agriculture, Energy, and the Environment revealed that the Carbon Plan’s interim goal was having an exaggerated effect on resource modeling by the North Carolina Utility Commission (NCUC). Legislators learned that removing the interim goal would save electricity consumers $13 billion by 2050.

Developments concerning reliable, thermal generation

In July, the General Assembly enacted Senate Bill (SB) 266 over Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, eliminating the Carbon Plan’s interim goal. It also expanded state law allowing utilities to charge ratepayers for construction work in progress while adding key guardrails on its use.

When a summer heat wave threatened to overload the grid, Duke Energy Carolinas obtained an emergency order from the US Department of Energy (DOE) to exceed environmental emissions levels if needed to maintain power provision. With nuclear already at peak production, Duke was able to avoid blackouts primarily by increasing coal generation by 30%, showing its importance to reliability.

In October, Duke filed an updated resource plan proposal with the NCUC as required by the Carbon Plan law. This filing reflected the developments described above. Compared with the previous plan, the new plan would double the planned amount of new natural gas combined-cycle capacity, increase new natural gas combustion-turbine capacity by well over a third, and up new nuclear capacity by about 40%. It would also increase new solar capacity by only about 3%, boost new battery storage by about 58%, and eliminate new wind resources (onshore and off). Finally, Duke would delay retirement of some coal capacity.

The plan represented a significant boost in reliable, thermal generation over the previous plan, a result anticipated by SB 266.

Caution ahead

In July, the DOE published a Resource Adequacy Report warning the nation of high blackout risks by 2030 from closing reliable power plants and replacing them insufficiently (mostly with intermittent renewables). The DOE report estimated the blackout risk in North Carolina to be 27 times worse by 2030 under the planned status quo. Unfortunately, the main changes in Duke’s latest resource plan would take place after 2030, not before.

The sort of problem the DOE report warned of occurred in Spain in April. Days after achieving the “first weekday of 100% renewable power,” the Spanish grid unexpectedly collapsed, causing billions of euros in economic losses. The culprit? Spain’s overreliance on renewables, especially solar generation, leaving very little inertia on the system from the heavy, spinning traditional generators that would allow it to withstand a sudden disturbance.

The Carbon Plan law placed North Carolina on that path. Even though SB 266 forestalls the problem, it still requires “carbon neutrality” by 2050. The new Duke proposal doesn’t add much more new solar than the previous one, but it plans for solar capacity nearly to quadruple. Comparably, it would increase nuclear and natural gas capacity by just 59%. Duke’s filing shows that new solar capacity would be only half as productive as new natural gas capacity and only about a fourth as productive as new nuclear capacity.

Policymakers should amend the Carbon Plan law to make carbon neutrality a goal instead of a mandate. The most important thing for power provision in North Carolina is meeting consumers’ need for reliable and least-cost electricity. Allowing Duke to showcase more natural gas and nuclear capacity in future resource plans would serve North Carolinians’ interests significantly better.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DSC_4231-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:03:00.758381

AUTHORITY: Issuance of public notices regarding proposed compensatory mitigation sites is required pursuant to Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources; Final Rule as published April 10, 2008, in the Federal Register, Vol. 73, No. 70, pages 19,594-19,705 (33 CFR 325 and 332 and 40 CFR 230). This is not an application for work in federally regulated waters; however, authorization under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) may be required for implementation of the proposed work, if approved. No decision has been made as to whether this proposed mitigation bank will be approved.

FEDERAL EVALUATION OF PROSPECTUS: The Corps is soliciting comments from the public; federal, state, and local agencies and officials; Indian Tribes; and other interested parties to consider and evaluate this proposed project. To make this decision, comments are used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, conservation, economics, aesthetics, general environmental concerns, wetlands, fish and wildlife values, flood hazards, flood plain values, land use classification, navigation, shoreline erosion and accretion, recreation, water supply and conservation, water quality, energy needs, safety, food and fiber production, mineral needs, and consideration of property ownership. If the Sponsor is advised and/or chooses to submit a draft mitigation banking instrument, the Corps will use the comments received on this public notice to inform an Environmental Assessment and/or an Environmental Impact Statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.

CULTURAL RESOURCES: The Corps is evaluating the undertaking for effects to historic properties as required under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. This public notice serves to inform the public of the proposed undertaking and invites comments including those from local, State, and Federal government Agencies with respect to historic resources. Our final determination relative to historic resource impacts may be subject to additional coordination with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), federally recognized tribes, and other interested parties.

The District Engineer’s final eligibility and effect determination will be based upon coordination with the SHPO and/or Tribal Historic Preservation Office, as appropriate and required, and with full consideration given to the proposed undertaking’s potential direct and indirect effects on historic properties within the Corps-identified permit area.

But it comes at a time of deep uncertainty for the emerging carbon capture industry.
It also wants to sell the complex's proposed ammonia plant and carbon capture pieces — and potentially the company's rights to state-owned underground storage areas.
""Our intention is to operate the facility with carbon capture operational to the maximum extent possible, capturing 95 percent of our emissions.""
Six projects were fast-tracked under the order, but Air Products' permit wasn't one of them.","A controversial plan to store CO2 deep under Lake Maurepas was intended to greatly limit greenhouse gas emissions from a nearby industrial plant, but a new proposal raises the possibility that significantly less will be sequestered.

The company's revised proposal to state regulators has the potential to allow the hydrogen and ammonia plant in Ascension Parish to become one of the largest industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in Louisiana during its first years of operation.

Air Products, the company behind the project, has battled nearly four years of community opposition over plans to inject and permanently store CO2 and other greenhouse gases from the complex under Lake Maurepas. It says the injection would prevent 95% of those greenhouse gases from reaching the atmosphere, where they would otherwise add to climate change.

But, just months after receiving the state's blessing for air emissions based on that low-carbon vision, Air Products has asked for a do-over.

The proposed change could allow the Louisiana Clean Energy Complex to become among the top 25 industrial emitters of greenhouse gases in the state, based on LSU and federal annual emissions tallies since 2012.

The company says the new proposal would merely give the plant the flexibility it needs to operate, adding that its carbon capture goals remain the same.

But it comes at a time of deep uncertainty for the emerging carbon capture industry. Louisiana has paused new permit applications in the face of residents' opposition and criticism has grown louder over lucrative federal tax credits for the projects.

Some environmental groups, which have opposed carbon capture projects because they claim they won't live up to the storage rates being promised, speculated the air permit changes indicate the company is trying to hedge its bets.

The company has already delayed the complex's startup by two years to 2028 or 2029 for financial reasons, according to a report from RBN Energy, an industry consulting and analytics firm.

Air Products has said it is trying to ""derisk"" the $4.5 billion complex by finding buyers for its low-carbon products before new spending commitments. It also wants to sell the complex's proposed ammonia plant and carbon capture pieces — and potentially the company's rights to state-owned underground storage areas.

""It's all about making it a more valuable property for them to sell off,"" said Darryl Malek-Wiley, a senior organizer for the Sierra Club's environmental justice program in Louisiana.

Storage three-quarters of the time

In the new permit request filed in late September, Air Products wants permission to emit up to 2.16 million tons of greenhouse gases per year along with increases in some toxic chemicals. The maximum estimate is nearly half of the total that Air Products had planned to inject under Lake Maurepas annually, or more than 5.5 million tons per year.

Depending on the year, the projected maximum greenhouse gas emissions in the air would be on par with the ExxonMobil refinery and chemical complex power plant in Baton Rouge, Entergy's power plant in St. Charles Parish, and Dow Chemical in Plaquemine, the LSU and federal emissions tallies show.

Air Products told the state Department of Environmental Quality that when the company is commissioning the plant, it won't be able to inject CO2 underground for up to 25% of the time and that this inability could last in the first few years. For the other 75% of the time, the company says it will be able to inject under Lake Maurepas, as promised.

In a statement, an Air Products spokeswoman said the permit alterations don't reflect a change in the complex's design. It's an effort to create ""additional operational flexibility for the facility, ensuring a more reliable supply of low-carbon ammonia and low-carbon hydrogen products,"" even in the event ""the offsite carbon capture operation is unavailable.""

""The 25 percent would be the maximum downtime allowed under the new permit for the carbon sequestration operation,"" said Christina Stephens, the company spokeswoman. ""Our intention is to operate the facility with carbon capture operational to the maximum extent possible, capturing 95 percent of our emissions.""

She added the changes would ""also account for the possibility that various aspects of the facility may start up on slightly different schedules.""

Greg Upton, executive director of the LSU Center for Energy Studies, said he could not comment directly on Air Products, but said such companies often see economic value in ensuring options remain available.

""These large capital investments are made spanning decades, and so because there's uncertainty over lots of factors, companies think of what's called a 'real option.' And a 'real option' is simply the following: I'm going to build into my capital plans the ability to do things in the future, even if I might or might not exercise that option,"" he said.

Air Products juggles options

Despite industry enthusiasm for carbon capture and scientific backing of its safety, the concept has faced resistance from landowners, residents and local leaders.

For Air Products' plans, a mix of environmentalists, Lake Maurepas fishermen and crabbers, residents, legislators and some parish council members have opposed the project for safety, aesthetic and environmental reasons. Those include the visual impact of platforms and well sites on the lake's surface, lake-bottom dredging, wetlands destruction and what they see as groundwater threats.

The company and industry advocates say they are the victims of misinformation, defending carbon capture as safe and effective, with minimal disruption to Lake Maurepas and no real threat to drinking water sources because of the depth of the wells.

In a recent hearing for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state coastal permits, local legislators called for an extensive environmental analysis that would include not only Air Products' plans but also the cumulative impact of other carbon capture projects in the region. The work could take two years.

These officials also pointed to recent Southeastern Louisiana University research showing that lake waters have heavy metal contamination that's likely also in lake sediments. They said that could be stirred up by dredging for the underwater pipeline network.

On land, the lines would also destroy a few hundred acres of high-value cypress and tupelo swamps in the Maurepas Wildlife Management Area.

The company says it has taken steps to minimize the impact of the well and pipeline network through the use of the same right of way for multiple lines and with a curtain to limit the spread of dredged sediments.

Gov. Jeff Landry has also instituted a temporary moratorium on new underground carbon injection permit applications to prioritize a review of existing applications. Six projects were fast-tracked under the order, but Air Products' permit wasn't one of them.

Earthjustice senior attorney Lauren Godshall noted that Air Products is having to ""passionately defend the project"" amid these headwinds, while also looking to sell off pieces of the complex. She added that ""it feels like cheating, in a way, to promise blue/clean energy"" and then pursue an air permit that would allow options for so much CO2 emission.

In a Nov. 6 earnings call, Air Products CEO Eduardo Menezes said a permit with the ability to emit CO2 is a key to negotiations to find partners for the carbon capture and ammonia pieces of the complex.

The company's ""potential counterparts asked us to have the flexibility of running the plant on a gray mode if something happens with the CO2 sequestration that we did not expect to do or still do not expect to do because the CO2 is a big contributor for the project,"" Menezes said.

""Gray mode"" means emitting waste carbon dioxide into the air.

Public storage on the block too?

In a October 2021 deal with the state, Air Products gained exclusive rights to nearly 122,500 acres of underground storage beneath Lake Maurepas, the nearby Maurepas Swamp Wildlife Management Area in St. James Parish and Lake Sabine in Cameron Parish.

Patrick Courreges, a spokesman for the state Department of Conservation and Energy, said no company has approached the department or the Mineral Board about such a transfer. A key concern for the state will be who pays what's owed under the deal and who will be responsible if a problem occurs.

""Such transfers have been relatively routine for decades,"" he said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/2b/42baac65-830a-50ad-82ae-952fefb515f7/691ca9d701a1e.image.jpg?crop=1143%2C601%2C0%2C79,N,,2025-12-01 14:03:30.454458

Battery production presents the largest economic boost — but also demands the most significant expansion of local training capacity, apprenticeship programs, and industry-education partnerships.
The authors lay out a comprehensive strategy to ensure the lithium boom benefits Imperial County residents.
The Stakes for Imperial County’s Future Despite the report’s warnings, regional leaders say Lithium Valley’s promise is real and achievable if the right choices are made early.
CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo said the path forward must be guided by the people who call Imperial County home.","BRAWLEY — The future of Lithium Valley could either lift Imperial County into a new era of prosperity or repeat decades of broken promises, according to a sweeping new 129-page workforce analysis released this week by Comité Cívico del Valle (CCV) and the University of California San Diego Labor Center.

Imperial County, home to the highest poverty and unemployment rates in California, sits atop one of North America’s largest lithium brine deposits. With global demand for domestically sourced lithium surging, researchers argue that the region is standing at a defining crossroads: embrace “high-road development” that delivers family-supporting wages, safe working conditions, and real career pathways for local residents, or slide into “low-road development” dominated by external interests, low wages, and minimal community benefit.

The report frames Lithium Valley as a once-in-a-generation chance to reverse historic economic inequities. Despite a young and growing bilingual workforce, most Imperial County residents lack access to the kind of education, transportation, childcare, and job information systems necessary to compete for high-quality careers in the clean-energy sector. Many interviewees, 214 adults surveyed across the county, reported deep skepticism, citing decades of outside industries bypassing local workers in favor of non-local hires.

Researchers emphasize that the stakes are unusually high for Imperial County because the region is projected to experience a rare workforce boom over the next several decades, even as the working-age population across the rest of California declines. According to demographic modeling included in the report, thousands of young residents will be entering the labor market just as lithium extraction, geothermal power expansion, and battery manufacturing could scale up. This convergence of workforce growth and industrial investment presents an opening that many rural counties lack, making the timing of policy choices especially urgent.

At the same time, the report points out that Imperial County’s current industrial structure remains heavily concentrated in low-wage, high-risk sectors such as agriculture, retail, fast food, and personal care. These jobs, while essential to the region’s economy, do not provide the family-supporting wages or long-term career ladders needed to stabilize households. By contrast, the projected occupations tied to Lithium Valley — particularly in battery manufacturing — offer substantially higher median wages and far more stability. The question, researchers note, is whether local workers will have the training and support systems necessary to actually access these roles when they arrive.

At the same time, researchers emphasize the scale of potential opportunity. Depending on how fully the lithium battery supply chain takes root in the region, Lithium Valley could create anywhere from several hundred to more than 4,000 high-road jobs, most of them in manufacturing rather than extraction. Battery production presents the largest economic boost — but also demands the most significant expansion of local training capacity, apprenticeship programs, and industry-education partnerships.

To meet future workforce needs, CCV and UCSD highlight the urgency of building a coordinated training ecosystem. Nearly 75 to 85 percent of the projected high-road occupations require apprenticeships or specialized certificates, yet Imperial County’s existing workforce system is too small to meet that level of demand. Without long-term collaborations among employers, unions, community groups, and training providers, the county risks watching high-wage jobs pass local residents by.

A Region Positioned for Opportunity, But Only If Barriers Are Removed

The report stresses that the county’s demographic strengths — its young workforce, bilingual population, and steady supply of upcoming high school graduates — position Imperial County to play a central role in California’s clean-energy future. But deep structural barriers continue to limit access to high-road employment.

Interviewees described consistent challenges with finding job-relevant training close to home, securing adequate English-language instruction, accessing reliable transportation, and affording childcare. Many also voiced longstanding mistrust toward incoming industries after years of low-wage, unstable work that historically favored non-local workers.

These obstacles, researchers argue, are systemic, not personal, and must be addressed through policy changes, investments, and enforceable commitments from companies entering the region.

High-Road vs. Low-Road Development: A Clear Fork in the Road

According to the report, Imperial County’s future hinges on which development path regional partners choose.

High-road development centers on accessible career pathways, family-supporting wages, and meaningful worker voice. Low-road development, by contrast, mirrors global patterns of exploitation, in which companies extract resources while providing minimal benefits to workers or the surrounding communities. Examples in lithium mining regions abroad and at domestic battery plants illustrate what happens when industries prioritize cost-cutting over community benefit.

The authors lay out a comprehensive strategy to ensure the lithium boom benefits Imperial County residents.

They call for expanding training and apprenticeships, improving transportation between cities and the geothermal resource area, and increasing childcare access so workers with caregiving responsibilities can enter and stay in the workforce. They also stress the importance of establishing Community Benefits Agreements to enforce transparency in local hiring and to guarantee that residents participate fully in lithium-related careers.

Finally, they argue that employers, training providers, unions, and community organizations must form long-term partnerships capable of sustaining these commitments through decades of economic growth and industry change.

The Stakes for Imperial County’s Future

Despite the report’s warnings, regional leaders say Lithium Valley’s promise is real and achievable if the right choices are made early. CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo said the path forward must be guided by the people who call Imperial County home.

These efforts will reduce America’s dependence on foreign sources, strengthen national security, and promote American energy independence.

“For too long, the United States has relied on foreign nations for the minerals and materials that power our economy,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “We have these resources here at home, but years of complacency ceded America’s mining and industrial base to other nations. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing that trend, rebuilding America’s ability to mine, process, and manufacture the materials essential to our energy and economic security.”

This funding opportunity stems from DOE’s Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation’s Rare Earth Demonstration Facility program, which is designed to demonstrate full-scale integrated rare earth extraction and separation facilities within the United States. This NOFO follows the Department’s Notice of Intent released in August.

REEs, such as Praseodymium, Neodymium, Terbium and Dysprosium, are vital components in advanced manufacturing, defense systems, and high-performance magnets used in power generation and electric motors.

An injunction, they said, would prevent EPA from “holding hostage certain reimbursements — which EPA has already committed to paying — unless Plaintiffs close out their grants and risk the government arguing their claims are moot.”","EPA is pressing grant recipients of a Biden-era environmental justice program to take steps that would make the termination of their awards irrevocable — even as some of them are suing the agency to recover the funds.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration told all 105 recipients of the Community Change Grant Program that their grants had been canceled because it was a “diversity, equity and inclusion” measure that contradicted the priorities of President Donald Trump.

The program, one of several environmental justice initiatives enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, offered $1.6 billion in grants to help communities cope with risks related to pollution and climate change.

Other IRA programs, such as the $3 billion Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants and clean energy initiatives like Solar for All, were also canceled over the course of the year. A slew of challenges filed by nonprofits and state and local governments are now winding their way through the courts.

Now EPA has told recipients of Community Change grants that they missed a deadline to formally “close out” their awards and are directing them to do so expeditiously.

“These emails went out to everybody, [saying] that we are already delayed on the closing and that we need to proceed with it as soon as possible. Kind of ignoring the fact that you can’t be late on closing if you are not planning to close,” said Dominika Parry, founding president and CEO of 2C Mississippi, a Jackson nonprofit that received a grant amounting to nearly $20 million last year to offer emergency services, which is challenging the termination.

EPA did not respond to questions. “In keeping with a longstanding practice, EPA does not comment on pending litigation,” a spokesperson said in an email.

Closing out a grant would require the awardee to provide EPA with a final financial statement and program reports. That would entitle them to be reimbursed for costs that were incurred before EPA canceled their awards, and for the cost of some closeout activities after that, as long as EPA agrees to it.

But grantees who take those steps would also forfeit their right to challenge the termination in court, or to reopen their programs if challenges by other awardees were ultimately successful.

Parry said her group got the email pushing it to close out the grant soon after the government shutdown ended on Nov. 12. Other grantees received the notice at different times.

“EPA seems to be renewing its request that our clients close out their grants,” said Ben Grillot, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is representing some Community Change Grant Program clients challenging EPA’s cancellations.

Those groups are planning to tell EPA that the deadline doesn’t apply to them because their cancellations are still being litigated.

“Whenever they send us anything, we are saying, ‘No, we are not going to be doing it. We are suing you,’” said Parry.

Grantees were dealt a blow in August when a district court judge sided with EPA in deciding that it had the right to cancel environmental justice grants. The decision means the cases would be heard in federal claims court, a special tribunal that could provide monetary damages to grantees but not restore their grants. Many Community Change Grant Program awardees are appealing that decision, and their attorneys expect a hearing sometime next year.

Recipients who don’t plan to challenge the agency’s grant terminations say EPA is not cooperating with them. They expected to be able to access the government’s grant management portal to file for reimbursement of expenses they incurred during the program. But that isn’t happening.

Keith Matsumoto, program manager for Pacific International Center for High Technology Research, which received $13.8 million to help underserved parts of Oahu, Hawaii, build resilience to wildfires and hurricanes, said he was weighing whether to join the legal challenge.

“We may just close it out, only because we can’t keep paying the kind of attention to this project that we have been,” he said.

But Matsumoto said he’s had trouble accessing funds from the grant to cover expenditures that EPA indicated would be eligible. EPA’s termination letters stated that grantees would be able to seek repayment through a federal portal known as ASAP for “allowable costs incurred up to the date of this memo provided that such costs were contained in the approved workplan.”

“I basically said, ‘Hey, you know, we haven’t gotten paid. You want us to close out? You guys got to pay us.’ And the response was, ‘Well, all the money is gone, so you’re going to have to close out and then we’ll pay you,” he said.

Matsumoto said his organization has only six employees, and the tiny partners it works with couldn’t absorb a loss of tens of thousands of dollars while litigation winds its way through the courts. So, his group paid its partners out of its own coffers.

“So again, it’s a ‘You pay us back, and then we’ll move on,’ kind of thing,” he said. “But they can’t even pay us back. Why should we move on? And the fact that it’s an illegal termination. I would prefer to have to have this whole thing restored, because our partners are hurting.”

Attorneys representing grant recipients who are challenging EPA’s terminations filed a brief in federal court last week arguing that the agency appeared to be withholding close-out funds in order to gain leverage over grantees.

They asked the court to issue an injunction until the grantees’ appeal is decided. An injunction, they said, would prevent EPA from “holding hostage certain reimbursements — which EPA has already committed to paying — unless Plaintiffs close out their grants and risk the government arguing their claims are moot.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/15/bc/3f1846664a9d867d74c8ffdf87fa/hawaii-wildfire-72441.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:03:39.945756

But according to some investors, it’s also a symptom of a sector maturing out of its exuberant teenage years, and learning to pivot and compromise.

“A lot of investors look at venture capital as being really hard in the climate sector,” he said.","It’s been a confusing year for those investing in the energy transition.

On the one hand, the policy shifts that followed President Donald Trump’s election have limited growth in the sector — especially in the wake of cuts to Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. Investments in clean manufacturing have been slowing, venture capital funding for climate tech is at its lowest level in years, and investor sentiment has weakened. Just 23% of North American investors now describe climate change as significant to their investment strategy, down from 61% in 2023 and 35% last year, according to a Robeco survey released this summer.

On the other, though, major climate- and energy transition-focused funds have held prominent closes. Brookfield and Blackstone each raised $20 billion and $5.6 billion for their latest transition vehicles, respectively. The artificial intelligence boom — and the resulting load growth — have flooded certain parts of the sector with money, especially in the U.S. And globally, clean energy stocks have been doing particularly well.

The turbulence, for many in the sector, is uncomfortable. But according to some investors, it’s also a symptom of a sector maturing out of its exuberant teenage years, and learning to pivot and compromise. Tariq Nanji, a climate investing partner at Boston Consulting Group, describes this shift as moving past the early “climate euphoria” to focus on longer-term market developments over trends. “This is no longer thought of as a niche momentum play, but a structural demand tailwind that is underwritable,” Nanji told Latitude Media.

‘Shock to the system’

This shift, perhaps inevitably, is coming with growing pains.

According to Matthew Nordan, co-founder of climate investor Azolla Ventures, some clean energy subsectors that were heavily reliant on policy and subsidies support, like alternative fuels and direct air capture, and others subject to the administration’s overt hostility, like pure play wind, “are clearly in danger.”

“The bigger backlash we’re going to see is against things that have any major measure of regulatory or policy dependence,” Nordan said. Recent data by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and MIT’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, for instance, found that industrial decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen, clean fuels, and green cement have been undermined by project cancellations and the termination of hundreds of DOE federal awards.

“It’s a lesson that the finance community — all the way up to the alpha predators of finance and the LPs at the top of the pyramid — relearns every ten to 20 years,” Nordan added. “They get seduced when there is a seemingly unstoppable head of steam around a theme, and then they kick themselves.”

The backlash and uncertainty created by the policy changes, which Nanji describes as a “shock to the system,” is creating some frustration among the investors who have raised money under a friendlier climate environment, and are now being forced to reconsider their strategies.

“Investors who deploy capital in sectors that were heavily linked to many of the policies that were in place via the IRA are now trying to figure out how to safe harbor assets and how to get things moving in the next two years, and get stuff out the door in a way that doesn’t hurt them in the long run,” Nanji said. (In the short term, at least, those efforts have mostly succeeded. A recent report found that 76% of solar projects and 86% of wind projects slated to come online by the end of 2028, accounting for 33 gigawatts of capacity eligible for tax credits, were already safe-harbored as of November.)

The frustration is especially being felt by impact investors who have made their LPs promises that the policy reshuffle is now making difficult to fulfill.

“What do you do if you’re a growth stage investor with a thematic and a private placement memorandum, and one of the things you said you were going to invest in is hydrogen or the transition in fuels?” Nordan said. “That’s a little tough… They might throw their hands up and say, ‘What to do now?’”

The pivot

For investors with dry powder, however, there are still many opportunities to invest.

As Sophie Purdom, founder of VC fund Planeteer Capital and co-founder of market intelligence platform Sightline Climate, put it, there are headwinds pushing investors away from green-premium assets, but there are also new tailwinds. “The climate tech space is lucky that demand growth showed up at a time when demand for green-premium assets fell off,” she said.

The unanticipated AI-related load growth has come with an urgent need for more generation and supporting energy infrastructure — as well as new investors with deep pockets and a willingness to spend. One recent projection found that U.S. peak load growth is now estimated at 166 GW over the next five years, quadruple what was expected just two years ago.

And as a result, sectors providing baseload power, like nuclear and geothermal, — and, to some extent, energy storage — are now Trump administration priorities. That offers an in for investors.

“Renewables may be structurally challenged right now,” Naji added. “But there is a massive opportunity for private capital sponsors to look at the connective tissue that makes the clean economy work.”

This also includes the adaptation and resilience space, which is becoming an increasingly important part of the climate investment landscape, and a crucial area for capital deployment.

The co-existence of both thriving and structurally challenged subsectors within the same climate investment category rewards investors with the ability and willingness to pivot. “Those with broader mandates are rewarded in an environment like this,” Nordan said. “But then comes a question of whether you have the skillset and network to invest in things that are a little different.”

Additionally, investors willing to accept some risk and wait longer for returns might find the market particularly appealing. According to Nanji, if you “have a 10-year view on the market, not a three-year view on the market, maybe you can buy low, and sell high in 10 years.”

Sanjeev Krishnan, managing partner at climate-focused investor S2G, agrees. “A lot of investors look at venture capital as being really hard in the climate sector,” he said. “But if you have long-duration capital and different internal rate of return expectations, you can accrete ownership when others are fearful and finance businesses to become cash flow positive. Then you can do really well.”

Few companies made it through the first internet boom of the early 2000s, but the ones that did — Amazon, Google, and PayPal, to name a few — went on to perform extraordinarily well, he added.

Long term view

This need to pivot reflects the general broadening of what it means to invest in climate and the energy transition. Some “investors are convincing themselves that the opportunity is shifting outside of the core thesis… [of] decarbonization,” Purdom noted.

Superficially, this can mean companies skirting around climate or green language in their branding to appease those who perceive the rhetoric as politically risky — without necessarily changing their strategy. Nordan, for example, knows of at least one company that was asked to drop some climate-friendly language from its name while renewing a federal contract.

But the shift may also signal a real change in perception. Climate investment is increasingly not a specific set of sectors dedicated to the mitigation of the consequences of climate change, but rather a much broader category encompassing the energy, infrastructure, and adaptation solutions needed for society to advance and thrive.

“Our view is that the climate transition is a 10,000 year economic megatrend,” Krishnan said. “It’s taking useful energy and turning it into useful materials — we did it with fire, photosynthesis, fossil fuels, and then whatever comes next. It’s an all-of-the-above approach to whatever comes next, given the current political reality and the current economic reality.”

As we’re already witnessing, this uncertain and at times frustrating evolution is likely going to result in less capital allocated to the U.S. climate sector, at least in the short term.

“We’re going to lose two-thirds of the firms, we’re going to have massive turnover in the LP base, and at least half of the startups are going to disappear from operations in the next two or three years,” Nordan said, adding that it’s a healthy outcome, given that the field had gotten overgrown with “me-too propositions” too dependent on tax credit and the green premium. One example: This fall, Danish manufacturer Topsoe decided to pause work on its $400 million electrolyzer factory in Virginia, partly as a consequence of the sunsetting of a federal tax credit that promised to jumpstart the green hydrogen sector.

But this short-term pessimism may give way to a rosier long-term outlook.

“In areas that are administration priorities, like clean firm power or critical materials, we’re going to have a bunch of billion-dollar companies with long-term contracted offtake… that will mint a new generation of public market leaders and will create the track record for the next cycle of this field,” Nordan said. “Long term, man, this is a good thing.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-12-01T123029.366.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:03:13.119810

Leila Banijamali is the CEO of permitting software company Symbium and Zachary Millimet is a senior policy advisor to the company.

With federal climate incentives and renewable energy programs facing unprecedented rollbacks, state legislatures have become the last line of defense for clean energy deployment. Surging load growth and the cost of electricity is rising faster than the rate of inflation, and state policy must be laser focused on reducing barriers to deployment and driving down permitting costs.

Right now, several states are considering automated permitting bills that could either accelerate the clean energy transition or lock in years of bureaucratic gridlock and stifled innovation. These bills need to pass, but only if they’re designed correctly. The difference between success and failure hinges on a single critical design choice: whether states mandate specific technology platforms or establish technology-agnostic standards that foster competition and innovation.

The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the lessons from past mistakes are unambiguous. Consider this cautionary tale: California’s SB379 governing residential solar energy system permitting was signed into law in September 2022. The landmark law requires jurisdictions to adopt a permitting platform that accelerates the approvals of certain residential solar permits.

But rather than codifying transparent, objective standards, SB379 mandated the use of a rather limited privately run program called SolarAPP+ or any alternative platform that is capable of issuing permits for certain solar and energy storage systems “that SolarAPP+ is capable of processing,” effectively blessing one solution. This would be equivalent to the government requiring consumers to purchase a particular brand of electric vehicle, EV1, or another car that is defined by EV1’s obscure feature set. By obscuring choice, we stifle innovation and limit the ability of these programs to scale in a meaningful way.

At the time SB379 was passed into law, SolarAPP+ was inapplicable for use in about 60% of all residential solar projects in California. Consequently, it has failed to gain traction in many jurisdictions, with building departments struggling to make it work. What’s worse, this legislation set a precedent for enshrining one technology that was repeated in other states like Maryland, Minnesota, Illinois and New Jersey. Fortunately, states like Texas and Florida have rejected that approach and have opted for technology-agnostic automated permitting laws instead.

The urgent need for technology-neutral state action

In an era marked by the dismantling of federal clean energy incentives and programs, state-level policy has become the critical battlefield for climate progress. Without federal action to streamline permitting or support renewable deployment, states must move quickly — and smartly — to advance automated permitting legislation that can accelerate the clean energy transition. The urgency is unprecedented, and the window for effective state intervention is small.

The imperative is clear: States need to pass technology-agnostic automated permitting bills immediately. Unlike California and Maryland’s approach of mandating specific platforms like SolarAPP+, the new generation of legislation must establish clear, objective standards that any qualified technology provider or building department can meet. This approach doesn’t just avoid picking winners; it creates the competitive environment necessary for rapid innovation and cost reduction at precisely the moment when federal support has evaporated.

So, what can we learn from legislators in Texas and Florida? Rather than bless a specific solution enshrined in state legislation, it is abundantly clear that, if we are to spur innovation and market competition in the absence of federal leadership, states should establish clear goals (i.e., instant permitting) and disclose a circumscribed set of the codes and standards that must be processed to inject more competition into the development and deployment of instant permitting solutions that are directly responsive to the nuanced needs of local jurisdictions and large- or small-scale installers. The goals are to foster innovation, lower costs and produce superior outcomes for governments and the public alike, not to enshrine one player’s set of features.

The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated. With federal programs in retreat, state legislatures have a narrow window to establish the regulatory infrastructure that will either enable or constrain clean energy deployment for the next decade. Technology-agnostic automated permitting bills represent one of the most impactful policy levers available to states right now — streamlining the process for solar, storage, heat pumps, EV chargers and other electrification technologies without the massive price tag of direct subsidies.

The choice is clear: We can either deploy systems that are revolutionizing the permitting experience and serving the public interest through open competition and innovation, or we can hand over the resolution of critical government functions and regulatory bottlenecks — effectively, the hardest problems to solve — to favored private actors. The latter stifles progress, inflates costs and erodes the essential trust between private entities and local governments that real progress demands. The next generation of clean energy and housing development depends on getting this right, and there are precious few opportunities to fix a rigged system once it’s locked in place.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JDmLgpHppJdMWE2ZQ7AGjXjICiGYgMO5FqkObCuskEs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9yb29mdG9wX3NvbGFyX0NhbGlmb3JuaWEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:31.634146

Since 2020, the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in the US has soared from $0.133 to $0.188, a 30% increase in just the past 5 years. In the next few years, many experts fear that the United States will face an electricity crisis (although one can argue it’s already in the early stages of one).

Image Source: FRED

Below are four factors driving higher energy prices:

· An Aging Electrical Grid: The US’s electrical grid is aging. With an already massive fiscal deficit, major grid upgrades are unlikely any time soon. Grid issues have become more prevalent recently and are likely to persist.

· Extreme Weather Events: Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events over the past few years. For instance, a 2021 Texas winter storm left 2 million Texans without electricity.

· Persistent Inflation: Although the inflation rate has slowed since its 2022 peak, inflation is still driving up the costs of the equipment and materials needed to generate electricity.

· EVs & the AI Buildout: As electric vehicle adoption continues to grow, the need for charging infrastructure is also increasing. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence buildout is the most significant driver of higher electricity prices. Currently, data centers comprise ~5% of total electricity use in the United States. However, McKinsey & Company expects that data center electricity use will triple by 2030, accounting for 11.7% of total consumption.

Is Nuclear the Solution to the US Electricity Crisis?

Chris Wright, the US Secretary of Energy, had a nuclear energy background prior to joining the Trump Administration, having previously served on the board of directors of Oklo (OKLO). With that in mind, it should be little surprise that the Trump Administration is pro-nuclear. Thursday, news broke that the US plans to buy and own as many as 10 nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration also announced a $1 billion federal loan to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant that is managed by Constellation Energy (CEG).

But can nuclear energy solve US energy issues? Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most reliable, and cheapest forms of energy. However, nuclear energy is unlikely to be the solution to the US power woes in the short-to-intermediate-term because building a plant typically takes a decade. Additionally, nuclear energy companies face regulatory red tape, public opinion issues, and environmental concerns that are unlikely to be remedied any time soon.

Nuclear Stock to Buy: Constellation Energy (CEG)

Although the above-mentioned nuclear challenges hold for most nuclear projects in the United States, Constellation Energy is an exception. Constellation Energy is unique in the nuclear industry because it has already received regulatory approval and funding and has provided an estimate of when its massive nuclear project will launch. CEG’s restoration of the “Three Mile Island” nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, renamed the “Crane Energy Center,” will be online in 2027. Additionally, CEG has landed 20-year power agreements to supply electricity to two big tech juggernauts – Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

Natural Gas & Coal: Fueling the Early Innings of the AI Revolution

Although it’s reasonable for investors to believe that nuclear power will be a long-term power solution for the AI revolution, doing so now is unrealistic. Since the AI buildout is unlikely to slow down any time soon, traditional energy sources such as natural gas are the answer in the short-term due to their practicality and low cost.

Natural Gas Stock to Buy: Bloom Energy (BE)

Bloom Energy has differentiated itself from other energy providers through its solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. BE’s technology takes natural gas (and other gases), mixes it with air, and creates electricity. However, unlike other natural gas providers, Bloom’s technology produces electricity without combustion, making its energy “cleaner”. Additionally, Bloom’s technology is self-sufficient and produced on-site, meaning that data center owners are not susceptible to grid outages.

Solar Energy: Another Solution for the AI Energy Glut

Now that solar energy is cheaper than ever, it is poised to be a major winner in the AI-driven energy demand boom. Solar is relatively cheap, clean, renewable, and can scale rapidly.

Solar Stocks to Buy: First Solar (FSLR) & Nextpower (NXT)

First Solar is a leading domestic solar provider. FSLR benefits from increasing solar demand. Additionally, the company benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides generous tax credits and shields it from Chinese competition. Wall Street analysts expect FSLR EPS to more than double next quarter.

Meanwhile, Nextpower is another company that will benefit from the electricity super-cycle. Nextpower’s software and services help solar projects run more efficiently.

Bottom Line

Electricity demand in the US is accelerating rapidly, and the early signs of a long-term power crisis are already visible. While nuclear offers a powerful long-term, solution, the urgency of the AI buildout means that natural gas, advanced fuel cell technology, and solar will drive the first wave of investment opportunities.

(P&GJ) — Louisiana’s Office of Coastal Management (OCM) has formally reissued the coastal use permit for the Commonwealth LNG export facility in Cameron Parish, clearing the project to move forward following an extensive reassessment of its environmental and community impacts.

The updated decision—issued Nov. 18, 2025, as part of OCM’s Revised Basis of Decision—follows a state court order vacating the previous permit over insufficient review of climate and cumulative impacts. The new analysis concluded that “the project’s social and economic benefits outweigh environmental costs” and that the permitting process satisfied federal environmental justice standards.

According to the report, regulators reviewed environmental justice (EJ) impacts as outlined in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS), which identified potential effects on wetlands, social patterns, fishing industries, and storm-surge protection in nearby communities.

The decision states that “the public’s contribution has influenced the permitting authority’s decision” and that community concerns were incorporated into the review process. OCM wrote that it sought to ensure no group “bears a disproportionate share of negative environmental consequences resulting from the permitted activities due to race, color, national origin, or income.”

The updated permit includes specific conditions for managing stormwater discharge, protecting wetlands, and monitoring endangered species. OCM confirmed it accepted FERC’s assessment that the project would “likely adversely affect” the Eastern Black Rail, but that impacts were not expected to jeopardize the species’ survival. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Biological Opinion supported that conclusion.

The permit also mandates that Commonwealth operate a Water Control Structure (WCS) under a state-monitored adaptive management plan. The company must report marsh hydrology data—including salinity, tidal range, and water elevation—every six months for the first two years of operation. If monitoring indicates damage to local wetlands, OCM can require remediation.

The decision found the project provides “direct benefits to communities in Cameron and Calcasieu parishes,” citing construction employment, long-term operations jobs, and tax revenue. Commonwealth LNG estimates 800 workers per month during construction, peaking at 2,000, with an additional 3,689 secondary jobs supported in the region. The company expects to distribute $234 million in payroll over the 36–38 month construction period, with Louisiana collecting more than $2 million in state sales tax.

The permit requires compliance with air, water, and waste regulations, coordination with cultural and wildlife agencies, and stipulates that all project structures must be removed within 120 days of abandonment. Pipelines must maintain at least three feet of cover below water crossings, and any maintenance that affects that depth will require a new permit.

With the revised permit reinstated, Commonwealth LNG may proceed toward construction pending final regulatory clearances. The project represents one of several LNG export facilities planned along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, underscoring the region’s growing role in global natural gas supply and carbon management.",https://pgjonline.com/media/5071/courthouse-social.jpg?v=1dc1b245f8b2780,N,,2025-12-01 13:02:42.258657

Maine Conservation Voters Action Fund announced its support for the Democrat at a news conference Monday in Portland. The political action committee picked Pingree for the June 9 primary from a crowded field of big name Democrats because of her work related to climate change and transitioning to clean energy.

Though the organization works to elect “climate and environmental champions” to serve as state legislators and governor, this is the first time it has made an endorsement in a gubernatorial primary.

“Maine needs a governor who has the courage to stand up to President Trump, and the savvy to win when she does. We need a governor who can build lasting coalitions and bring people together, but who will never compromise on her values and will fight for Maine’s people and communities,” said Maureen Drouin, executive director of Maine Conservation Voters.

So far in the president’s second term, the Trump administration has enacted a sweeping agenda to roll back environmental regulations, including on coal-fired power plants, water pollution, vehicle emissions and more. The administration has also sought to downplay the impact of global warming, such as with an executive order to remove signs throughout the nation’s national parks that explained how climate change was contributing to changing landscapes and what steps visitors could take to reduce their carbon emissions.

In light of that federal posture, the group highlighted Pingree’s current and former work in Maine to protect natural resources and public health. The speakers at the news conference Monday specifically mentioned legislation she sponsored as a state representative in 2008 to reduce children’s exposure to concerning chemicals, as well as a 2007 bill she led to ban toxic chemical flame retardants.

Pingree’s more recent work as part of the administration of Gov. Janet Mills also helped win her the favor of Maine Conservation Voters. As co-chair of the Maine Climate Council, she helped develop the state’s climate action plan. Through that work, the state created a storm recovery fund and programs to protect working waterfronts and other critical infrastructure from climate catastrophes.

Pingree, who said she was honored to earn this endorsement, said that she would continue to fight on behalf of Maine’s people and environment if elected governor. She noted that she’s spent most of her life living in the island town of North Haven, including the time she served in the Maine House “representing my neighbors who make a living on the ocean where a clean environment is tied to livelihoods and the future of our communities.”

From 2019 to earlier this year, Pingree served as director of Maine’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, where she worked to make the state more resilient against extreme weather and led initiatives to help people lower their energy costs and transition their homes from fossil fuels to heat pumps.

The energy industry is undergoing a profound transformation — driven by innovation, sustainability goals, and the global shift toward cleaner power sources. As the global energy capital, Houston is leading this transformation, and at the forefront of the energy industry are two women executives whose leadership, vision, and resilience are redefining what’s possible.

ExxonMobil Product Solutions Ventures Vice President Jennifer Chan and Archaea Energy at bp CEO Starlee Sykes will explore their career journeys, leadership philosophies, and the opportunities and challenges facing women in a traditionally male-dominated field. Joined in conversation by Baker Institute Center for Energy Studies nonresident fellow Deborah Byers, the two executives will share insights on navigating corporate culture, fostering inclusive leadership, and accelerating progress toward a more equitable and sustainable energy future.

Join Asia Society Texas for an engaging conversation about the women who are leading the energy industry to create a cleaner and more sustainable future.

Husk has already raised over $125 million and currently serves more than 2.2 million people in India and Nigeria.
The DER platform is structured around three user groups: entire communities, commercial and industrial clients, and households.
Global research identifies community solar minigrids as the most capital-efficient option to deliver first-time power to around 380 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Husk’s model also aligns with India’s national goal of installing 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel energy capacity by 2030.","Husk has announced an ambitious new roadmap centered on an artificial-intelligence-enabled distributed energy resources (DER) platform designed to deliver dependable, modern electricity to tens of millions of homes, enterprises and community institutions in the Global South by 2030. Introduced as the “Powering Prosperity” platform, the announcement was made at the Africa Investment Forum (AIF), where Husk formally opened its Series E fundraising round. The company is targeting $400 million in combined equity and debt to develop at least 2 gigawatts of distributed solar and battery storage systems across South Asia, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa before the end of the decade. Husk has already raised over $125 million and currently serves more than 2.2 million people in India and Nigeria.

The DER platform is structured around three user groups: entire communities, commercial and industrial clients, and households. Minigrids — both isolated and grid-tied — will continue to power villages and towns, while standalone rooftop or ground-mounted systems will support C&I users and residential customers, delivered either as turnkey EPC projects or under long-term power purchase agreements. Health centers and schools are also prioritized.

“Husk pioneered the community solar minigrid model, and today we’ve evolved into an AI-powered DER provider supporting towns, families and businesses,” said Husk CEO and Co-Founder Manoj Sinha. “This new positioning reflects exactly what we’re scaling across India and Nigeria. Deploying 2 GW by 2030 opens enormous new opportunities, giving us the ability to tailor DER offerings to every market we enter.”

At the core of the platform is a sophisticated digital architecture driven by predictive and agentic AI — the company’s operational “brain.” Husk’s AI capabilities forecast demand at each minigrid with high precision, while agentic models optimize generation assets every 30 minutes to minimize cost, maximize renewable energy use and deliver more reliable customer service. The algorithms are engineered to reduce energy costs, increase clean-energy penetration and improve power availability.

The company’s scale-up strategy supports the World Bank and African Development Bank’s Mission 300 initiative to electrify 300 million people by 2030. Global research identifies community solar minigrids as the most capital-efficient option to deliver first-time power to around 380 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. Husk’s model also aligns with India’s national goal of installing 500 GW of non-fossil-fuel energy capacity by 2030.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/save-energy-7382276_1280-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:03:24.213644

Forbes reviewed thousands of companies and ranked 25 North Carolina firms on a new list.

Charlotte and the Triangle are home to 16 of the state’s 25 best firms.

Many firms are also on Forbes’ best employers and best companies for tech workers lists.

Forbes recently made its first-ever best-in-state list to rank top companies, and 25 firms based in North Carolina are included.

The popular business publication considered “millions of data points” to find companies that are excelling at satisfying customers, keeping their employees and growing.

Thousands of companies were evaluated on factors including size, financial strength and employee and customer satisfaction, Forbes says, but 750 companies made the final list.

Government entities and nonprofits such as colleges and hospitals were not considered for this list. Many North Carolina universities, health systems and municipal governments are included in and rank highly on Forbes’ other business rankings.

Also, companies were only assigned to the states in which they are headquartered. Walmart, for example, could only be included in the list of the best companies in Arkansas.

Here are the top 25 firms in North Carolina.

McDonald, Robby Phillips",,,,,https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/12/senate-appropriators-release-fiscal-year-2026-energy-funding-bill,"Note: In September, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed its own FY 2026 Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies (HEWD) bill without any Democratic support.
The SEWD text and report contain several notable provisions regarding DOE funding programs and propose less aggressive cuts to clean energy programming than both the HEWD FY 2026 bill and the president's FY 2026 Budget Request.
The SEWD bill also requires DOE to ""apply the indirect cost rate to the same extent and in the same manner as was applied in fiscal year 2024.""
The administration requested $750 million in additional credit subsidy through its FY 2026 budget request to support financing of small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors.
Despite the office's statutory authorization, an identical recommendation across SEWD, HEWD and the White House budget request is to provide zero funding to OCED for FY 2026.","Overview

The U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development Appropriations (SEWD) released a bill and corresponding report on Nov. 24, 2025, to fund the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation for fiscal year (FY) 2026. The bill was posted by the majority, as the committee was unable to come to a bipartisan agreement allowing it to move forward with a markup. SEWD Chair John Kennedy (R-LA) released a statement noting that his bill ""would result in a 1.1% reduction in spending for the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, making it the only FY 2026 Senate appropriations bill so far that cuts spending.""

Note: In September, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed its own FY 2026 Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies (HEWD) bill without any Democratic support.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA), Ranking Member of both SEWD and the full Senate Appropriations Committee, expressed some concerns with the bill, especially its cuts to energy programs. However, she also acknowledged its inclusion of ""important priorities [she] strongly advocated for,"" including 11 earmarks for Washington state, and committed to engaging in negotiations to bring the bill closer to passage. Some Democratic support will be needed as 60 votes are required to advance appropriations bills in the Senate.

The SEWD text and report contain several notable provisions regarding DOE funding programs and propose less aggressive cuts to clean energy programming than both the HEWD FY 2026 bill and the president's FY 2026 Budget Request. Also of note, both chambers' appropriations bills align with the previous DOE organization and leadership structure and do not yet reflect the newly released organization structure. More information about the reorganization is available in a previous Holland & Knight blog post.

Highlights and Notable Language

Grant Termination Guardrails and Indirect Cost Rates

SEWD's bill requires DOE to notify both HEWD and SEWD at least 120 days prior to the effective date of any grant termination. Of those 120 days, no fewer than 90 days shall be provided to work with grantees to restructure or rescope the award to better effectuate program goals or agency priorities. While restructuring or rescoping, recipients shall continue to be reimbursed for work done under the award. If there is no ability to restructure or rescope and, thus, the award is terminated, the bill states that DOE should prioritize those recipients if they apply to a future funding opportunity for the relevant program.

These policies would apply to projects funded by previous appropriations bills and appropriations provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). They exclude Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding and awards announced after Nov. 1, 2024.

The SEWD bill also requires DOE to ""apply the indirect cost rate to the same extent and in the same manner as was applied in fiscal year 2024."" This provision follows DOE initiatives earlier this year to cap the indirect cost rate for FY 2025 awards to institutions of higher education and in certain state government programs, including the State Energy Program (SEP) and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).

Reprogramming of Previous Funding

The bill text reprograms unobligated funds from several IIJA provisions to other DOE initiatives or program budgets for FY 2026, including:

$1.059 billion of unobligated funds from the Regional Direct Air Capture (DAC) Hub Program to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), now under the new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI)

$1.5 billion in unobligated funds from the Carbon Dioxide Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Program (CIFIA), plus $900 million in unobligated Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) funds, to be reallocated to NE for the Advanced Nuclear Reactor Demonstrations Program (ARDP)

$92.35 million of unobligated funds from the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs Program (H2Hubs) to NE

$92.35 million of unobligated funds from H2Hubs to Fossil Energy (FE), under the new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office (HGEO)

$75 million of unobligated funds from H2Hubs to Grid Deployment, now primarily under the Office of Electricity (OE), for programming to enhance the domestic supply chain for grid components

Loan Programs

The Loan Programs Office (LPO), now under the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), has significant loan authority under the Title 17 loan guarantee program from the IRA and $1 billion in credit subsidy in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The administration requested $750 million in additional credit subsidy through its FY 2026 budget request to support financing of small modular reactors and advanced nuclear reactors. SEWD's bill does not provide that credit subsidy, and in its report language, the committee calls on DOE to use Title 17 authority ""to support critical minerals development, processing and recycling projects.""

Also within EDF's purview, SEWD's bill does not include the administration's request to rescind unobligated credit subsidy for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (AVTM) Loan Program, while continuing to support the Tribal Energy Financing (TEFP) Program as well.

Additional Highlights

For the first time, the SEWD bill recommends establishing the Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains Office (MESC) and proposes a funding level of $19 million, primarily for workforce capacity and competitiveness.

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) was also dissolved during DOE's realignment. Despite the office's statutory authorization, an identical recommendation across SEWD, HEWD and the White House budget request is to provide zero funding to OCED for FY 2026. As outlined above, SEWD recommends reprogramming some of OCED's unobligated balances.

SEWD makes clear its support for the CarbonSAFE program. In its report, the committee directs DOE to issue funding opportunities with remaining IIJA funds for CarbonSAFE projects and continue advancing projects through the program's four phases.

The more than $100 million in congressionally directed spending (also known as earmarks) in the report funds a broadly bipartisan set of projects, indicating further potential for Democratic support of the package.

A major solar panel manufacturer is transferring the assets of its Chinese unit to Canadian ownership, to safeguard sales into the U.S. as Washington steps up scrutiny of imports from the Asian nation.

CSI Solar Co., based in Suzhou, will sell 75.1 per cent of three overseas factories that serve the U.S. market to its parent company, Canadian Solar Inc., the Chinese company said in an exchange filing in Shanghai.

Canadian Solar, which is listed on the Nasdaq, was the world’s seventh-biggest producer of solar panels last year, according to BloombergNEF data, and was an early entrant into the booming energy storage business. It owns 62 per cent of CSI’s shares, and Shawn Qu is chairman of both companies.

CSI Solar shares closed down 6.9 per cent in Shanghai, while Canadian Solar rallied 18 per cent in U.S. premarket trading on Monday.

China’s dominance of the clean energy supply chain has prompted various forms of restrictions from the U.S. These include direct tariffs on Chinese solar panels and batteries, as well as restrictions on tax incentives for Chinese companies investing in the manufacturing of renewable power equipment in the U.S.

The Chinese company didn’t specify in the filing where the three factories whose ownership is being transferred are located. However, it said they comprise a 3 gigawatt-hour energy storage system plant, a 2.9 gigawatt battery factory and an 8 gigawatt solar wafer slicing operation. The three facilities have a combined value of 469 million yuan (US$66 million) and primarily supply the U.S., it said.

The factories will be used to help start two joint ventures focused on solar power and energy storage in the U.S., according to the filing. Canadian Solar will own 75.1 per cent of the JVs, with CSI holding the remaining 24.9 per cent.

CSI is aiming “to address changes in U.S. market laws and regulations, ensure normal business operations, reduce operational risks, and achieve long-term participation in the U.S. market,” it said in the filing.

This move will enable CSI “to remain compliant with potential U.S. foreign entity of concern requirements” for solar and energy-storage systems exports to the U.S., Dennis Ip, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets, said in a note.

Utility use of innovations to manage challenges like load growth and affordability can be streamlined with smarter pilot project designs, new U.S. Department of Energy research found.

Today’s pilots are often redundant, inconclusive and lack clear pathways to scale, a June Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report on pilot project designs concluded.

“With safety as a top utility priority, utilities are hesitant” about new technologies or methods, but “it is critical that utilities are able to quickly test good ideas,” the LBNL report said.

Some utilities have started to move quickly, faced with the pressure of rising demand, especially from data centers, which threatens to outpace new generation and storage additions.

Salt River Project’s May 3 demonstration of data center load flexibility using Emerald AI software has already led to an announced scale deployment in the PJM Interconnection system. Many utilities are pursuing ways to achieve this type of speed-to-innovation.

“It is more imperative now to take innovative projects and pilots to scale quickly because customer adoption, expectations, and technology are evolving at an exponential pace,” said Chanel Parson, Southern California Edison’s director of clean energy and demand response.

The faster utilities scale solutions, “the faster they can keep up,” she added.

Utilities are working with their regulators to find pilot project designs that speed innovation, the LBNL study found.

To meet its quickly growing electric vehicle penetration, Pacific Gas and Electric’s managed charging program for 1,000 customers, launched in January, is already nearing its next phase, said Marina Donovan, vice president of global marketing for smart meter provider Itron.

“That shows the speed the utility wants to move at,” she said.

Streamlined pilot design frameworks, often called “regulatory sandboxes,” can support speed-to-innovation, LBNL’s study reported. They have validated new value propositions and implementation, operational, planning and investment approaches.

Barriers include financial, regulatory disincentives

Pilots are key to innovation, but utilities tend to under-invest in new technologies and methods compared to more innovative industries, according to a different LBNL analysis from 2022.

Some utilities have seen success with scaling pilots gradually.

Green Mountain Power pilots “laid the foundation to where we are now,” said Kristin Carlson, a spokesperson for the Vermont-based investor-owned utility.

During a June 2025 peak, Green Mountain Power’s distributed energy storage virtual power plant program saved customers “about $3 million in one hour,” she added.

But, like most traditional pilots, the utility’s VPP program grew slowly. It began with 20 customers in 2017 and now has 5,035 participants providing over 75 MW of dispatchable peaking resources, Carlson said.

Southern California Edison has also nurtured its VPP innovation over time, according to utility spokesperson Jeff Monford. Its 5-MW Power Flex solar-plus-storage VPP pilot, launched with Sunrun in 2020, now has multiple vendors and a capacity of 25 MW, with plans to continue growing beyond 2027, Monford said.

The utility financial disincentive is a key barrier to accelerating innovative utility pilot programs, the LBNL analysis found.

To obtain approval for recovery of investment costs, utilities must show regulators their proposed technologies will benefit customers, LBNL’s analysts said. That discourages utility investments in pilots of unproven tools and methods, and favors “the status quo that has historically offered them a stable business environment,” they added.

Also, traditional pilot frameworks often do not clarify specific pilot parameters, the analysts said. That leads to misleading metrics, biased or inconclusive results, redundancies, disputes between participants, delays in approval and implementation and, critically, pilots without clear pathways to scaling, they added.

But these challenges can be overcome with better policy, said Anne Hoskins, a Generac Power Systems executive and former commissioner with the Maryland Public Service Commission.

For example, she said, a pilot framework could include cost limits, timelines, requirements for sharing lessons learned and clear next steps for completed projects.

“Regulators can create frameworks for a ‘sandbox’ to fast-track approval of innovative pilot programs that stay within guidelines,” she said. This can be a low-cost way to test new technologies, tools, or methods, she added.

Piloting large load flexibility

One key innovation to come out of recent pilots is data center flexibility. While the concept is still fairly new, it has already been taken up by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who called on federal regulators to streamline approval of interconnections for flexible data centers.

One key public demonstration of data center flexibility potential came in the May collaboration of Salt River Project with participants in the Electric Power Research Institute’s DCFlex initiative.

The first of a planned series, it showed data center flexibility is achievable without compromising the value proposition of data centers willing to participate, said EPRI Emerging Technologies Executive Anuja Ratnayake.

Unlike the rigorous and repeatable pilot processes described by LBNL, the Arizona demonstration with Emerald AI software was “one specific controlled test,” Ratnayake said. It had predetermined conditions in a planned four-step process that will, by mid-2026, test the software in real-time operations, she added.

Emerald AI’s fourth demonstration, scheduled for mid-2026 at the 96-MW Aurora AI Factory on the PJM system in Virginia, will be under full-scale, real time, real world conditions, Ratnayake said. It will show how much flexibility the software can deliver at scale.

AI companies’ are impatient because the speed of data center interconnections will determine how soon artificial general intelligence is developed, said Emerald AI CEO Varun Sivaram.

Read More in Generation

But certainty of data center flexibility must be demonstrated before system operators will accept it as the solution for more rapid interconnection of large loads, according to a November PJM market monitor report that questioned flexibility as a feasible solution for the country’s largest grid operator.

Emerald AI’s streamlined four-demonstration process, with escalating challenges, is intended to give utilities the confidence to connect flexible data centers faster, Sivaram said.

He expressed confidence that once flexibility can be successfully demonstrated at scale, “the floodgates will open for this understandably cautious, careful industry to move faster.”

‘I want to see utilities use our sandbox’

State regulators and regulated utilities are also working, with mixed success, on ways to make speed-to-innovation through pilots a reality. Innovation can come faster if policymakers set clear goals and remove regulatory barriers to smarter pilot designs, researchers and stakeholders said.

Policy directives and vision statements can identify a goal “that stakeholders can rally around and drive towards,” LBNL said in its report.

It pointed to examples set by New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan, Hawaii’s 2014 Inclinations on the Future of Hawaii’s Electric Utilities and its 2024 follow-up, and the District of Columbia’s PowerPath DC, all of which drove “ambitious energy objectives.”

To further advance the pace of innovation, the Hawaii commission’s 2020 Innovative Pilot Framework streamlined pilot implementation, LBNL said. Specifically, it limited regulatory review to 45 days and reduced cost recovery uncertainty, it added.

In 2019, with Green Mountain Power’s distributed energy storage program growing, the Vermont Public Utility Commission ordered a multi-year regulation plan with an innovative pilot program framework that has allowed the utility to scale multiple pilots.

VPUC Commissioner Riley Allen said two important features of that plan were that it required early notice to stakeholders and guardrails limiting cost increases to 2%.

“Utilities are reluctant to move off known frameworks, but the industry needs to be responsive to emerging factors like growing electricity demand,” Allen said. The sandbox concept “creates the space to do good things within the regulatory process.”

Michigan’s 2019 Power Grid initiative included an expedited 90-day pilot approval process and incentives for utility-stakeholder collaborations, LBNL said. But under its guidelines, according to Michigan’s pilot database, pilots “have not progressed to full-scale programs,” the researchers added.

Progress continues to come through slower general rate cases, said Michigan Public Service Commissioner Katherine Peretick.

“I want to see utilities use our sandbox,” she said, adding that “the growing electricity demand may create more utility interest in taking advantage of its expedited pilot framework.”

Two other models — New York’s Reforming the Energy Vision and Oregon’s Smart Grid Testbed programs — also represent important efforts at sandbox frameworks, LBNL said.

Randomized Control Trials, or RCTs, are an outside-the-sandbox speed-to-innovation approach championed by customer-owned device aggregator Renew Home. Data from RCTs can approximate the value customers’ smart devices deliver, by-passing the pilot process completely, Renew Home CEO Ben Brown said.

The Connecticut model

Connecticut’s Innovative Energy Solutions, or IES, sandbox framework is attracting attention as a potential model to follow as it prepares to evaluate its completed first cycle of pilots.

In 2023, the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, launched the first cycle of pilots, with new cycles to follow annually, LBNL said. The framework requires four phases, with proposals followed by selection, then deployment, and, finally, evaluation, the researchers added.

To reduce deployment barriers and facilitate collaboration, the IES allows pilots led by vendors, utilities or utility-vendor collaborations, LBNL’s paper said.

The IES was designed to get over the regulatory barriers and provide regulatory certainty that the pilot process would “lead to something,” said former PURA Chair Marissa Paslick Gillett, who oversaw that design. It also provides “a regulatory environment for innovation,” she added.

“A fail-fast mentality was built into the process with milestones that must be met to obtain continued funding,” Gillett said.

Scalability is not yet clearly defined, but Connecticut has legislation allowing PURA to compel a utility to scale a pilot project that has produced evidence of viability in a regulated process, she added.

“Regulatory sandboxes accelerate innovation within the existing regulatory framework and the IES program is one of the best examples,” said Matt McDonnell, a co-founding partner of regulatory consultant Current Energy Group and an independent administrator of Connecticut’s program.

IES reduces the typical pilot’s timeline from at least four years to two years, McDonnell said. And its three participation pathways all contain ratepayer protections, he added

Piclo’s grid flexibility marketplace recently completed the first IES cycle in collaboration with Eversource Energy and United Illuminating.

In their final reports, both utilities and Piclo agreed the market launched faster and attracted more flexibility providers than expected.

“But the most important part of building a marketplace is continuity,” said Piclo CEO James Johnston. “If there is a second year and a line of sight for five years of revenue opportunities, participants will grow.”

Connecticut utilities were not convinced, however. The Piclo pilot fell short on provider participation, location specificity, cost efficiencies and operations, Eversource Energy reported.

And because system infrastructure to visualize and control customer-owned resources is lacking, Piclo’s market is premature for Connecticut, both Eversource and United Illuminating concluded. PicIo’s solution might be workable “as market conditions and grid requirements evolve,” United Illuminating said.

But concerns with load growth, reliability and affordability make it important to get more out of the grid, former PURA Chair Gillett said.

“The IES framework gives PURA commissioners the final word on the pilots in its sandbox in only two years,” McDonnell said.

Its ruling on Piclo, and the other projects in each cycle, “will provide guidance for how this type of division between utility and vendor participants should be resolved,” he added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/LMD7E6cgmBiHxDZZHW2SteGAiQgfprZFsDfZJmIiSRM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TQ0UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-12-01 15:00:49.540019

For the generation and energy storage side, this new entity will oversee both solar module and cell production, as well as the manufacturing and sales of its energy storage systems (ESS), branded as e-STORAGE.

Canadian Solar will hold a controlling 75.1% stake in CS PowerTech, along with acquiring “specific overseas facilities that support US operations,” effectively moving these critical assets out from under the purview of its majority-owned, China-listed subsidiary, CSI Solar, which is based in Suzhou. The transaction is valued at approximately $50 million, determined by “fair market value based on third-party appraisal”, said the release.

CSI will continue to own 24.9% of the CS PowerTech venture. In the press release and associated filings to the Nasdaq stock exchange, the “overseas facilities” were not specified.

Storage

On the battery front, the operational shift supports a sizeable storage portfolio of both product and development. Through its e-STORAGE subsidiary, Canadian Solar reported a $3.1 billion contracted backlog and an 81 GWh global development pipeline as of late 2025. The consolidation allows the company to integrate its manufacturing capabilities directly with its project development arm, Recurrent Energy.

“Launching CS PowerTech and resuming manufacturing directly under the publicly traded parent company reflects Canadian Solar’s commitment to its North American homebase and to building a resilient, transparent and diversified domestic supply chain,” said the company in its press release announcing the moves.

The transaction is subject to board and shareholder approvals. Canadian Solar also said “the company [is] eyeing further joint ventures with American partners to expand its solar and power footprint.”

FEOC/IRA Compliance

The restructuring appears calculated to address Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) guidelines. By transferring control to the Canadian-headquartered parent company and U.S. shareholders, the company positions its battery products to better align with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

It also avoids some scrutiny

Similar moves have been undertaken by Trina Solar, which sold its solar manufacturing assets in Dallas, Texas to T1 Energy (which was named Freyr Battery at the time).

Corning acquired JA Solar’s Phoenix solar facility as well, and, closing the circle, T1 Energy and Corning announced an at-scale supply deal within a month.

A slide from Canadian Solar’s most recent financial reporting presentation showed the company’s operations as follows, while noting its 6 GWh ESS facility in Shelbyville, Kentucky, in the US, is under construction.

What’s driving the oil surplus?

Oil demand growth is faltering. The trade policies of US President Donald Trump are weighing on the outlook for the global economy, and China, the second-largest crude consumer, is struggling with a property market downturn and weak consumer spending.

On the supply side, OPEC+, the coalition of producers led by Saudi Arabia, has been unwinding past output cuts. Countries outside this group, in particular those in the Americas, are churning out more barrels, too.

Supply from Russia, the world’s third-biggest producer, remains a wild card. On the one hand, the country faces new US sanctions that threaten to disrupt its exports. But the Trump administration’s renewed effort to secure a deal to end the war in Ukraine has raised the prospect of some international sanctions being unwound, which could ease the flow of Russian barrels into the market.

Who are the winners in a world with an oversupply of oil?

– Oil-importing nations

A low-oil price environment is good for buyers, especially large net importers such as China, which has been filling up its strategic reserves, and India, which has faced US pressure to stop buying Russian crude.

India is the world’s third-biggest consumer of oil. It ramped up its purchases from Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, as Russian exporters offered big discounts to offset the loss of traditional European buyers. A drop in global prices could make it less painful for India to avoid sanctioned Russian barrels and switch to suppliers in the Middle East, whose medium and heavy crude grades are similar to Russia’s Urals export blend.

– Trump

Cheaper oil can translate into lower fuel prices. Trump likes to use the price of gasoline as an economic barometer and during last year’s election pledged to bring it below $2 a gallon.

Just over 10 months into his second term, the national average price of gasoline had dropped by about 12 cents, although had yet to fall beneath $3 a gallon, a level last seen in 2021. Further reductions in fuel prices could be limited by outages at key oil refineries in Asia and Africa, as well as permanent closures across Europe and the US.

Source: American Automobile Association

Note: Data as of Nov. 29, 2025

Lower oil prices come with a catch for Trump. If they decline too much, crude extraction could become uneconomical in the US, undermining the president’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda and squeezing his political supporters that rely on the oil industry.

– Oil refiners

Cheaper crude can boost the margins that refiners make from turning oil into products such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In mid-November, US refiners’ margins hit their highest seasonal level since 2022.

As global refining capacity is relatively constrained, this limits how much extra oil can be processed and means refined product prices are likely to fall less steeply than for crude. Lower oil prices are therefore more beneficial for countries that import and refine crude themselves, rather than relying on inflows of refined products.

In the run-up to the oil surplus, the “put skew” for the US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate — a measure of how much more traders are willing to pay for bearish put options over bullish calls — reached its highest level in a month. That’s a sign speculators are geared up for a price drop.

Meanwhile, just before the US blacklisted Russian oil giants Rosneft PJSC and Lukoil PJSC in October, money managers were the least bullish on US crude on record, according to the most up-to-date investor positioning data, which was delayed by the government shutdown.

As futures prices finally reflect the somber outlook for the market, many investors see this as vindication of their longstanding bearish view. They point to two things as proof they’ve been on the right side of the trade all along: total US crude stockpiles (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) climbed to their highest level in five months in November, while the volume of crude aboard tankers at sea continues to hit fresh records, suggesting supply is outstripping demand.

– US strategic oil reserve

Low oil prices offer an opportunity for the US to replenish its store of emergency crude, which was only around 60% full as of mid-November. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve remains diminished after the Biden administration released supply into the market to try to tame the gasoline price spike that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Trump vowed during his inaugural address to fill the SPR “right to the top.” Taking advantage of low oil prices, the Energy Department awarded contracts worth almost $56 million in November to procure 900,000 barrels for this stockpile.

However, as part of Trump’s sweeping tax-and-spending law passed over the summer, Congress only appropriated $171 million for oil purchases for the SPR between 2025 and 2029 — a limit the government could hit very quickly. That sum equates to less than 3 million barrels at current prices, which is a far cry from the roughly 300 million barrels needed to bring the SPR to full capacity.

Who are the losers when there’s a global excess of oil?

– Petrostates

For fossil-fuel exporters whose economies are heavily dependent on the oil industry, subdued prices could weigh on their revenue and put pressure on their fiscal budgets.

Saudi Arabia, the world’s second-largest oil producer after the US, is seeking to diversify its economy through the Vision 2030 program. However, the massive investments being made in mega construction projects, such as the flagship Neom development, as well as other initiatives to build Red Sea tourism resorts, electric-vehicle factories and data centers, have arguably left it even more dependent on oil revenue.

While the kingdom has been rejigging its mega-project spending — delaying and scaling back some developments and accelerating others — it’s still expecting a national budget shortfall for the next few years. Bloomberg Economics estimated in November that the Saudi government needs an oil price of $98 a barrel to balance its budget and $115 when including domestic spending by its sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. That’s well above this year’s average of $69 a barrel for Brent, the global benchmark, through the start of December.

– Russia

Western sanctions have made Russian oil exporters heavily dependent on buyers in China and India, who have demanded discounts to keep importing this seaborne crude. In the absence of a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, the new US sanctions and an oversupplied global market could force Russian producers to cut their prices even further.

As the US ban on dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil started to come into force in November, Russia’s flagship Urals blend was more than $20 a barrel cheaper than Brent, according to data from Argus Media. While that gap is significantly smaller than in the earlier years of the war in Ukraine, it’s still markedly wider than the historical discount of $2 to $4.

Note: Data is through Nov. 21, 2025

Taxes from Russia’s oil and gas industry account for about a quarter of the federal budget. Even before the new sanctions were announced, the government expected tax revenue from the sector this year to drop to the lowest level since 2020 due to the global crude price slump and a stronger ruble.

Russian authorities have downplayed the potential economic impact of the fresh US restrictions, saying the country will adapt quickly and find workarounds, allowing discounts on its oil to narrow within a couple of months. In the meantime, the volume of Russian oil aboard tankers has increased, suggesting that buyers are, at least in the short term, less willing to take delivery of these cargoes.

– US shale industry

The US shale industry has been the world’s engine for oil-production growth in recent years but the momentum is now slowing. Many producers need an oil price of around $65 a barrel to turn a profit and have been looking to increase their output at less than 5% annually as crude prices hover near the break-even threshold.

A global oil surplus that knocks prices down to about $50 a barrel would prompt US shale producers to idle their drilling rigs and park their frack fleets as operations become economically unviable.

Their output is holding up for now, but more than 10% of oil-focused rigs have been taken offline since the start of the year, according to data from Baker Hughes Co. The decline will likely accelerate in the coming months if oil prices stay low, which could put pressure on oilfield services companies.

Sustained lower oil prices could prompt more consolidation in the US shale patch. Mid-sized producers could scoop up struggling smaller players to add scale as some of the best drilling spots have already been tapped.

– Big Oil

Low oil prices are bad for producers, although integrated oil majors with refining and trading businesses are less vulnerable than pure upstream companies that focus only on extraction.

The profits of the five Western oil supermajors — Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell Plc, TotalEnergies SE and BP Plc — have more than halved from three years ago and are poised to decline further. Still, the current oil price downturn isn’t as bad as in 2014 or 2020. Big Oil executives saw this decline coming and announced plans to cut share buybacks and costs earlier this year.

Some executives are even talking up possible opportunities. Exxon, for example, is on the lookout for potential acquisitions. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said in mid-October that low prices today will deter the investments needed for the future and tighten supply, making her “very bullish” on a price rebound from 2027.

– The energy transition

Road transport is the biggest source of oil demand. Consumers are used to a certain amount of volatility in fuel prices, but a prolonged reduction could make them less inclined to switch to an electric vehicle. That said, in areas where there are high taxes on diesel and gasoline, such as Europe and California, there could be limited relief at the pump from lower oil prices.

The buildout of clean power sources is less likely to be impacted by a crude surplus. In most regions, other than places such as the Middle East, renewables are usually competing against coal and natural gas for utility-scale electricity generation rather than oil.

“I was just a freshman taking Dr. Ben Wu’s Fundamentals of Ecology course, and I needed a small honors project.
Over the next three years, Reisdorf’s project grew into an international effort that has drawn more than 900 volunteers and produced over 70,000 classifications of bird sounds since launching publicly in June.
Students pitch in during spare moments, retirees have taken part from home and bird enthusiasts from around the world are contributing data to the Texas study.","When Texas A&M University freshman Carmen Reisdorf ’27 walked into her Fundamentals of Ecology class, she expected to learn about ecosystems — not launch a research project connecting hundreds of people around the world.

Reisdorf, a student in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology in the Texas A&M College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, built an online citizen science project hosted through Zooniverse, a global citizen science platform where anyone can help scientists analyze data. Her project asks volunteers to identify bird calls from the Edwards Plateau, helping researchers understand how land management practices affect wildlife.

What makes the project remarkable isn’t just its scope, but that Reisdorf created it as an undergraduate from concept to launch.

“It started as a class project,” she said. “I was just a freshman taking Dr. Ben Wu’s Fundamentals of Ecology course, and I needed a small honors project. I walked into his office on a Thursday afternoon and asked if there was something I could do to help with his research. He said, ‘Let’s see what happens.’”

What resulted from that conversation was more than expected. Over the next three years, Reisdorf’s project grew into an international effort that has drawn more than 900 volunteers and produced over 70,000 classifications of bird sounds since launching publicly in June.

“Even though our project features a specialized task, we’ve measured high volunteer accuracy rates so far,” Reisdorf said. “Because they work together to build consensus in our repeated-classifications approach, our volunteers don’t have to be bird experts to be a powerful voice in bird research.”

Turning sound into science

The idea stems from a larger United States Department of Agriculture-funded collaborative effort known as the Prairie Project, which studies rangeland restoration and sustainability across Texas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. Wu, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Ecology and Conservation Biology, serves as a co-primary investigator for the project and leads both the ranch-scale studies and its education component.

“Carmen’s work stands out as both excellent and innovative,” Wu said. “By combining AI and crowdsourcing through citizen science, she’s helping us explore how prescribed fire and grazing shape bird communities across savannah landscapes — something that wouldn’t be possible with traditional methods. Her project also enhances our teaching by giving undergraduates a hands-on way to practice scientific inquiry and critical thinking.”

At Texas A&M AgriLife Research’s Martin Ranch in the Edwards Plateau, researchers use 23 audio recorders to monitor bird activity at sunrise and sunset. Those recorders have produced more than 20,000 hours of audio since 2022, far too much for one student to review manually.

“I realized it wasn’t realistic to listen to every minute of every recording,” Reisdorf said. “I looked for ways to combine technology with community involvement.”

She used BirdNET, an open-source artificial intelligence, AI, model created by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Chemnitz University of Technology, to generate initial predictions of which bird species were present. The AI is powerful but imperfect as it can sometimes misidentify sounds, so Reisdorf designed a way for human volunteers to verify its results.

Through her Zooniverse project, titled “Savanna Spy: Sound,” users listen to short clips and confirm or reject the AI predictions. Each sound is reviewed by 15 people, allowing researchers to build consensus and refine the model’s accuracy.

“People are helping us separate true positives from false positives,” she said. “It’s a way to improve the data while teaching volunteers about birds, ecosystems and how sound can tell us what’s happening in the environment.”

Leading as a learner

For Reisdorf, the project has been as much about growth as research. A self-taught coder, she learned Python, R and HTML to manage and visualize her data. She also developed the communication skills to recruit volunteers and share her findings with academic and community audiences.

Since starting the project, she has presented her research at conferences, spoken to the local Audubon Society chapter and earned the College’s Dean’s Outstanding Award for Undergraduate Research.

“This project has pushed me to learn things I never thought I’d touch as an undergraduate,” she said. “It’s taught me that I should never be afraid to teach myself something new.”

She credits her success to the support of her mentors, especially Wu, who guided her through the process of turning a class idea into a full-scale study.

“Dr. Wu has been incredibly supportive,” she said. “He trusted me to take the lead and figure things out. I could not have brought it this far without his encouragement and his team’s help.”

Wu said Reisdorf’s independence and creativity stand out among undergraduate researchers.

“Carmen approached this work with the curiosity and drive of a graduate student,” he said. “She took an idea from concept to execution and built something that is making a real contribution to both science and education.”

Listening to the land

Reisdorf’s work helps scientists evaluate how birds respond to pyric herbivory, a land management practice that combines prescribed fire and grazing to restore savanna habitats. The approach aims to maintain open grasslands that support biodiversity and ranching alike.

“Birds are indicators of ecosystem health,” Reisdorf said. “By monitoring their sounds, we can learn how these habitats are changing and whether our management strategies are working.”

For Reisdorf, who grew up in Sharpstown in southwest Houston, the connection between people and nature has always been important to her.

“I grew up seeing this disconnect between people and the natural world,” she said. “That’s part of why I want to make science accessible. Projects like this help close that gap.”

She has already inspired others to join in. Students pitch in during spare moments, retirees have taken part from home and bird enthusiasts from around the world are contributing data to the Texas study.

“It’s humbling,” she said. “I see people worldwide helping us understand Texas ecosystems, and it reminds me that conservation is a shared responsibility.”

As she prepares to graduate early next year, Reisdorf plans to stay at Texas A&M to pursue a master’s degree and continue developing her research. She hopes to continue growing the project while keeping community participation at its heart.

“Technology can make research faster, but people keep it meaningful,” she said. “Every person who listens to a recording learns something about the environment, and that connection is what makes conservation a shared endeavor. When I go into the field and hear those same birds in person, I think about all the people who helped identify them in the Zooniverse project. It feels like we’re all listening together.”",https://media.agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2025/11/20251114_Carmen_Reisdorf_HH-6.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:01:56.493575

*IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT*

The American Action Forum (AAF) is proud to announce a revamped version of our Regulation Rodeo (or, RegRodeo) project. For those unfamiliar with it, AAF’s RegRodeo database houses information on federal regulations going back to 2005. Launched in 2015, RegRodeo tracks every proposed and final rule published in the Federal Register that includes a quantified economic impact or paperwork burden estimate. This version makes the following improvements to the site:

Clearer graphics and layout;

An updated, more intuitive user interface;

Enhanced ability to share findings across social media platforms;

The opportunity to export selected sets of regulatory cost/savings data; and

Direct links to additional AAF material on regulatory policy matters such as the Congressional Review Act (CRA).

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most consequential rulemaking of the week was the HHS final rule regarding “Medicare Program: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems; Quality Reporting Programs; Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating; Hospital Price Transparency; and Notice of Closure of a Teaching Hospital and Opportunity To Apply for Available Slots.” As is typical with Medicare payment rules, the main impact comes in the rule’s adjustment to transfer payments. For RegRodeo purposes, however, the more interesting aspect is the changes made to various relevant paperwork requirements. Assessing the new paperwork burden estimates of the dozens of affected forms against the currently available estimates yields roughly 5.1 million hours and $83.1 million in annual paperwork and associated cost reductions, respectively.

The runner-up of the week was the EPA proposed rule regarding “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; Extension of an Alternative Closure Requirement Deadline.” As the title suggests, the agency:

Is proposing to extend, by three years, one compliance deadline applicable to certain coal combustion residuals (CCR) surface impoundments operating pursuant to the alternative closure requirements. Specifically, EPA is extending the deadline for owners and operators to complete closure of their unlined CCR surface impoundments larger than 40 acres from October 17, 2028, to October 17, 2031.

In the accompanying Regulatory Impact Analysis, EPA estimates that this extension will afford affected entities between $89.3 million and $146 million in total cost savings (with a mid-point estimate of approximately $117.6 million).

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

Given the holiday week, there were no new major announcements or developments from either the White House or Congress on regulatory policy matters.

The AAF CRA tracker provides a full survey of activity under the law thus far in 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 69 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

Coal is Old According to the US Energy Information Administration, coal production peaked in the United States in 2008 and has declined in output ever since.
These new projects could add significant capacity to coal production, potentially extending the timeline of coal availability beyond current estimates.
Coal miners face even higher risks, both black lung disease and silicosis are commonly diagnosed in miners after years of inhaling coal dust.
It has been estimated that at least 16% of coal miners are affected, and in 2018, 1 in 5 coal miners in the central Appalachian region of the United States showed evidence of black lung.","In 2024, global demand for coal, often called “the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel”, reached a record high, consumption hitting approximately 8.8 billion tons.

Despite the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, a legally binding international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2°C, and ideally 1.5°C, coal emissions continue to rise as part of the world’s stubborn reliance on fossil fuels. To have any chance of meeting the 1.5°C target, global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak before 2025 at the latest, and then decline by 43% by 2030. The catch? We are already in 2025. The clock is ticking.

One of the governments still pursuing coal, despite its environmental impacts, is the United States. On September 29th, 2025, the U.S. government revealed a plan to revive the mining of coal in the United States.

The U.S. Department of the Interior said it would open up 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal mining and lower royalty rates for companies needed to pay to extract coal. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy said it would invest $625 million to upgrade and expand the American coal industry.

These coordinated actions reflect a significant federal push to reinvigorate coal, despite environmental concerns and the ongoing global shift toward cleaner energy sources. The pursuit of coal is a giant step backwards in the fight against climate change, but there is still time to switch to clean energy alternatives.

Coal is Old

According to the US Energy Information Administration, coal production peaked in the United States in 2008 and has declined in output ever since. Output of coal is estimated to decline even further globally in 2026.

According to Global Energy Monitor, there are currently 2,457 coal-fired power plants worldwide, including both operating and mothballed units. To keep global warming below 1.5°C, as targeted by the Paris Climate Agreement, all these plants need to be retired by 2030 in wealthy countries and to meet the Paris Climate Agreement, the equivalent of about two coal plants must be retired per week by 2040.

Coal alone was responsible for approximately 15.4 billion tons of CO2 emissions in 2023, consistently producing more CO2 than any other fossil fuel annually. Despite this, only 12% of coal-fired power plants have been shut down, 11% require accelerated closure plans, and a staggering 77% have no scheduled phaseout or retirement commitment.

Coal is a finite resource with an estimated 134 years left until existing coal mines are considered depleted and when current consumption rates are factored in. Known oil reserves have approximately 51 years left to pump oil on present consumption levels.

But recent reports indicate that globally, there are over 850 new coal mine plans, expansions, and extensions in various stages of development, particularly concentrated in Asia-Pacific regions like China, India, and Australia. These new projects could add significant capacity to coal production, potentially extending the timeline of coal availability beyond current estimates.

So while coal is finite, exploration and new discoveries coupled with expanding mining capacity suggest more coal could still be accessible than previously counted.

Coal is Dirty

During the industrial revolution, coal soot filled the skies of industrial cities, lowering the life expectancy of workers and citizens alike. According to a 2023 joint study from Harvard University, George Mason University, and University of Texas at Austin, exposure to fine particulate matter from coal-fired power plants (coal PM2.5) is associated with a risk of mortality more than double that of exposure to PM2.5 from other sources.

Coal miners face even higher risks, both black lung disease and silicosis are commonly diagnosed in miners after years of inhaling coal dust. It has been estimated that at least 16% of coal miners are affected, and in 2018, 1 in 5 coal miners in the central Appalachian region of the United States showed evidence of black lung.

Particularly vulnerable are “young miners”, with an increase in lung diseases affecting miners in their 40s. There is no cure. Additionally, many coal miners suffer from mental health issues such as depression and suicidal thoughts, linked to poor working conditions and the physical toll of mining work. The combination of these health crises highlights ongoing occupational hazards faced by coal miners today.

Citizens around the world who use coal as a primary source of fuel also face health risks. Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, is a prime example of this, where frigid winters require people to constantly heat their homes. For many citizens, coal is the only source of affordable fuel available to them.

On top of using coal in their home stoves, locally coal-fired power plants generate the overwhelming majority of the city’s electricity, about 93%. All of this reliance on coal creates smoky skies and rampant health issues. Lung diseases in the capital are common across all ages, while it has been found that Ulaanbaatar’s children have 40% lower lung function than children living in rural Mongolia.

Coal is Killing Wildlife

Coal poses significant environmental risks beyond its impact on human health. It contains toxic unburnable materials such as heavy metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, as well as radioactive elements like uranium, which remain concentrated in coal ash after combustion. This coal ash can contaminate ground and surface water.

Furthermore, coal mining often displaces local populations, destroys terrestrial habitats, and harms wildlife. Surface mining, in particular, causes large-scale land disturbance that alter topography, damage groundwater supplies, promote soil erosion, and reduce biodiversity.

Dump Coal

Globally, the highest demand for coal is concentrated in China, India, and Indonesia. With China alone accounting for more than half of the world’s coal production. Despite coal’s dominance, the energy transition is underway — with renewable energy surpassing coal for the first time to become the largest source of electricity generation worldwide. This shift demonstrates that while coal currently fuels much of the world, a cleaner, more sustainable energy future is achievable.

The United Kingdom, once defined by coal in the era of the industrial revolution, shuttered its last coal-fired power plant in 2024, making itself a coal-free nation for the first time in 142 years. 35 other countries have made similar moves, including Germany and South Korea.

Retired coal plants can be converted into renewable energy plants, as 3D models demonstrate. People power around the world has led a movement to end coal — activists like Jerry Curran, who through relentless activism, and with major public support, helped to close the Merrimack coal-fired power station in New Hampshire. The station was one of the most polluting power stations in the state and a single-point mercury polluter.

However, he is not the only one. In the last 14 years, communities across the United States have mobilized to retire 381 coal plants which has saved over 54,000 lives. It may take many, but when we unite, we have the power to make real change.

Investing In Our Futures

To maintain a green planet for future generations, it is crucial that we divest from fossil fuels and make the switch to renewable energies — it’s healthier for the planet, will create new clean jobs and it will save lives. Write to your local leaders encouraging them to back investment in renewable energies, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.

Alaska Beacon

Developers’ efforts to overturn the cancellation of a vast gold and copper mine planned for southwest Alaska are getting a boost from national mining and pro-business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

On Nov. 24 and Nov. 25, the Chamber and the National Mining Association filed separate friend-of-the-court briefs in the lawsuit brought by the developers of the proposed Pebble Mine against the Environmental Protection Agency, which vetoed the mine.

Neither group has intervened in the case against the EPA, but the briefs represent the groups’ support for the proposed mine and offer legal arguments that Judge Sharon Gleason could consider as she debates whether to move the project forward.

In 2023, the EPA invoked a rarely used “veto” clause of the Clean Water Act to say that there was no way that the proposed Pebble Mine could be developed without significant harm to the environment. The large mineral deposit is located at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, the most abundant sockeye salmon fishery in the world.

The administration of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which supports the project, and the proposed mine’s developers, filed separate lawsuits in federal court to overturn the rejection, as did two Native corporations that work as contractors for the developers. Those cases have since been combined.

The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case directly, which has left the issue in front of Judge Sharon Gleason in the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.

Another lawsuit filed by the state claims that if the veto is upheld, the federal government will owe Alaska $700 billion, the state’s estimate for the value of the mine if built as planned. That case has been put on hold until the District Court rules.

In July, the administration of President Donald Trump indicated that it might try to settle the suit and withdraw the veto. If that occurs, it could come before Jan. 2, when the EPA is slated to file a written response to the plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment.

If the EPA continues to fight the case, the last written arguments are scheduled to be finished by the end of February. Any oral argument would take place afterward.

If the federal government drops the case, it doesn’t mean a free path for Pebble: Several environmental organizations, fishing groups, tribal organizations and Bristol Bay locals have also intervened in the case and intend to fight in court.

The Alaska Legislature is also expected to consider a bill that would block both Pebble and any successor projects that might emerge.

In its brief, the National Mining Association — joined by the American Exploration and Mining Association and the Alaska Miners Association — call the EPA’s veto “overly broad” and say that if it is upheld, the act “will almost certainly chill investment in domestic mining activities” because other proposed mines could also be subject to a veto.

The Chamber of Commerce, which has backed the Pebble Mine project since at least 2022, said that if the veto is upheld, it has the potential of encouraging other vetoes, which would “disrupt important industries in which many of the Chamber’s members participate.”

Energy production should be a kitchen-table issue, but with a longer lead time than the current election cycle.","A not-so-glowing attribute of American democracy is the ability of voters to act shocked and blame whoever is in charge when things don’t go well. So, it makes twisted sense that, as 2026 approaches, the Trump administration should pay the political price for bad energy policies inherited from the Biden administration and Democratic governors.

Years of flat energy demand and relatively stable electricity prices dulled Americans’ understanding of energy economics. Now, new data center demand, the end of cheap natural gas, and President Biden’s policy of replacing baseload nuclear and coal power with wind and solar have screwed up electricity price signals enough to shred household budgets and stun homeowners — just in time for a colder-than-average winter.

The numbers are as stark as a slate-grey November sky. Household spending on electricity for heating is expected to rise 10% this winter to more than $1,200. Utilities requested a $29 billion rate increase in the first half of 2025, double last year’s rate rise. Residential electricity rates rose 6.6% year-on-year as of June 2025, according to Utility Dive, after already rising nearly 30% between 2021 and 2024.

The causes of these electricity increases are multifaceted, yet, as a policy brief from the National Center for Energy Analytics reveals, subsidies to wind and solar are major culprits. Subsidies like the federal Production Tax Credit (PTC) distort electricity markets by artificially lowering prices, sometimes into negative territory, forcing otherwise competitive but unsubsidized generation out of the market.

Interestingly, the study found that the argument that increasing demand from the data center buildout is causing increases in average rates is not supported by the facts. The state of Virginia has built the large majority of data centers in the past 2 years, yet Virginia’s ratepayers have experienced below-average price gains and still pay below-average electricity rates.

The Big Beautiful Bill, passed by Congress in July, partially solved some of these market-signal problems by accelerating the phase-out of wind and solar projects to the end of 2027, but that fact can’t heat the homes of families making hard choices every day during the winter of 2025-26.

An extra hundred dollars a month over winter means no sports or academic camps in summer for teenagers. Fifty dollars a month can be the difference between seeking mental health counseling or fighting clinical depression alone. Energy prices don’t play games.

In places like Massachusetts and California where green-energy policy has gone too far, the pain is both real and self-inflicted, raising the question of why voters continue to elect Democrats who prefer self-actualization to public service.

Residential electricity prices in California rose 125% in the last 15 years as subsidies for renewables pushed out existing nuclear and natural gas, all with the support of their ravishing Governor, Gavin Newsom.

In Massachusetts, politicians like Governor Maura Healey show us that grown-ups can still be childish. She and other (nearly all Democrat) politicians in New England don’t want any new pipelines to ship natural gas from the super-cheap Marcellus Shale Formation in Pennsylvania, lest they offend climate-change sensibilities.

Instead, they imported LNG from 3,000 miles away in Norway, which averaged more than $12 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) between January and March 2024. Meanwhile, average realized sales prices for Marcellus shale gas, less than 150 miles away during the same period, were between $2.10 and $2.20 per Mcf, only one-sixth the price. Not very smart.

As a result, both states, perhaps taking their cues from the grade-inflating Harvard and Stanford Universities within their borders, now have the highest electricity rates in the country, over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. Nice job, Einsteins.

Leaving the energy policy equivalent of a flaming paper bag of poo on the front porch for the Trump administration to stomp out may be good politics for Democrat governors. Still, if the United States is going to win the future, we have to get away from the energy hunger games and put in place permanent policies that a subsequent White House occupant won’t overturned.

And some states do their energy policies better, and not just carbon rich states like Texas or Kentucky that have some geologic largesse. States like Indiana, which imports energy from other states, have slowed coalretirements through legislative action, passing laws requiring utilities to demonstrate grid reliability before replacing coal with renewables.

Even Democrat-run states like Illinois have resisted closing base load nuclear plants despite political pressure from net-zero and anti-nuclear groups.

And some states are doing even more. Republican governor Jeff Landry of Louisiana has signed sweeping legislation aimed at reducing energy costs and unleashing energy affordability to its rate payers across the states and countries that it feeds.

And on the federal level, Congressman Troy Balderson is trying to make Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security the federal standard. If you want to set into law energy sanity that will survive, states need to follow leaders like Governor Landry. And if we as a country have any brains left in our screen-addled heads, we have to put Balderson’s ARC ES bill on the president's desk to sign.

Energy production should be a kitchen-table issue, but with a longer lead time than the current election cycle. We should be able to pay less to get more. The Trump administration is doing more in that regard than any administration in history. Opening Alaska, easing leasing restrictions on federal land, and cutting subsidies for EVs and renewables are nice. In the meantime, states and the federal government must step up.

In the end, we’re all worm food, but until then, people — especially Americans facing the winter season — have things to do, dreams to achieve, and go places where futures can thrive.

Here’s to a more affordable 2026.

You’re not alone, according to the latest Ocean State Poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which found roughly 78% of Rhode Islanders feel the same way about their upcoming winter heating bills.

Unease over heating prices has risen since last November, when UNH researchers found 70% of residents were worried about their winter energy bills. Among the anxious, 40% said they were “very worried,” while 37% were “worried.”

And that worry was expressed across each of the three voter affiliations used in the survey released Nov. 25 — Democrat, Republican and independent — expressed being “worried” or “very worried.” That included 88% of independents, 83% of Democrats, and 61% of Republicans.

Independents, or unaffiliated voters, comprised the overall survey’s largest share at about 51% of the total of 711 residents surveyed. The survey was conducted online between Nov. 13 and 17.

The worries are not abstract, as evidenced by Federal Energy Information Administration data which shows Rhode Island home heating oil prices at about $3.88 a gallon in the last week of November 2025. That’s up from the same time last year, when a gallon of oil cost about $3.52. It’s also significantly above pandemic-era November 2020, when heating oil cost about $2.31 a gallon in Rhode Island.

Heating oil is, however, still below the heights achieved in the fall of 2022, when October and November oil prices regularly soared above $5 a gallon, almost reaching $5.89 in the last week of October 2022.

Propane has been similarly expensive in recent years, with federal data showing residential propane averages about $3.56 a gallon on Nov. 24, 2025, comparable to the $3.61 per gallon recorded in the same time period in November 2024, but still above the high-$2.80s of late 2020. Like oil, propane prices spiked in fall 2022, regularly reaching the $3.80s in October and November of that year.

The day after the poll was released, Rhode Island Energy submitted a request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in an application submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. If approved, the proposed new distribution rates which would take effect in September 2026 would increase the average residential electric bill by about $7.78 a month, while a typical gas customer would pay $343.53 more annually, a 20.6% jump.

Gloomy on the economy

Rhode Islanders’ concerns about heating bills are embedded in a larger pessimism about the economy at large, with only 13% of the 711 respondents surveyed saying their household is financially better off than it was a year ago.

“Rhode Islanders are generally downbeat on the state and national economies, as a majority feel that the economy is getting worse,” the survey’s introduction states.

Another 40% of respondents said their household was financially worse off than a year ago, while 47% did not discern any substantial change in their household finances over the previous 12 months. Half of respondents who identified as Democrats felt their households were worse off, while only 24% of Republicans did.

“The fact that they were so close together, was surprising to me,” Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, said after she looked over the poll results. ”Normally I would say, ‘Oh, it’s a partisan thing,’ but clearly this is something that is impacting all people.”

Tanzi, known as a strong advocate for energy affordability, noted that in Washington County, which includes the district she represents, just under half of people were “very worried” about energy costs, higher than any other county in the state.

“I certainly hear it from my neighbors,” Tanzi said.

The poll found about 40% of households making under $75,000 a year and 54% of households making under $45,000 annually said they were worse off financially than last year.

The sample’s largest of six income demographics — households making over $150,000 annually, which accounted for 135 respondents — said they had stayed the same since last year at 56%, although equal amounts of 22% thought they were better or worse off from last year.

The survey does show that broader pessimism about the macroeconomic picture has shrunk somewhat in the past six months, slightly more so when looking toward the future. When the survey center asked the same questions of Rhode Islanders back in May, 45% of respondents expected to be financially worse off a year from now. In the new survey, that number has fallen to 35%, and an additional 21% of respondents think they will be better off in a year. The other 45% expect to be in roughly the same place financially.

Affordability concerns are more than a seasonal trend, said Camilo Viveiros, executive director of the George Wiley Center in Pawtucket, a nonprofit which advocates for low-income Rhode Islanders.

Viveiros pointed to percentage of income payment plans (PIPP), which would cap bills according to a fixed percentage of a customer’s income. A bill to institute PIPP in Rhode Island was submitted by Democratic Rep. Scott Slater of Providence early in the 2025 legislative session, but it failed to move out of committee.

“The George Wiley Center urges public officials to listen to our calls to restructure rates for long term affordability,” Viveiros said in an email Friday, adding that “it is time” for state officials “who profess to care about affordability to lend their support for the PIPP proposal.”

He also pointed to a policy brief recently published Nov. 20 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which pointed to PIPP as a means to “restructure rates for long term affordability.”

The brief noted that a broader Federal Poverty Line benchmark would apply to PIPP eligibility and could be optimized if paired with the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which is a federal program.

In fiscal year 2025, Rhode Island received nearly $27 million in LIHEAP funding, which helps low-income families with a one-time seasonal payment they can put toward heating bills. The minimum benefit was $64 and the maximum was $1,148, with higher allowances up to $1,500 during a winter crisis.

In fiscal year 2024, 28,234 Rhode Island households got help from the LIHEAP program.

Tanzi said she’s worried about the program in 2026 due to changes in federal policy. A shutdown-induced delay concluded Friday when $3.6 billion in LIHEAP funding nationally was finally released to states. If LIHEAP suffers any cuts, Tanzi said, “we’re really in a crisis for people.” She pointed to lower-income survey respondents who answered the question, “Do you worry about winter energy costs?”

Such respondents might be “basing their assumptions and their response to this on the availability of LIHEAP money,” Tanzi said. “If we did this poll again in two months, or three months, I have a feeling that things would be incredibly different in the responses.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80416/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dsc02165-1024x6831764585361.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=H9QSdHfH,N,,2025-12-01 15:01:55.109669

OCOchem CEO Todd Brix likes to say that green chemistry runs in his family. His father, Terry Brix, was a green chemistry “serial entrepreneur” long before the phrase was common. Terry started 18 companies in Washington, all focused on creating sustainable chemicals from waste biomass. After earning a chemical engineering degree from the University of Washington, Todd went to work at Chevron Research and Technology Company, where he worked in oil refineries and dealt with early forms of green hydrogen.

Growing up in that environment, Todd recognized hydrogen’s potential as an awesome chemical with a variety of uses. But he also understood its biggest challenge: storing and transporting it safely, since it’s a highly explosive gas. That problem sparked his curiosity, and eventually his own research and development.

Todd spent six months digging through global research at the UW library, tracking down innovative processes, licensing intellectual property, assembling a team, and developing a business model in his Woodinville garage. The core invention was small-scale CO₂ electrolyzers — machines that convert carbon dioxide into a valuable chemical called formate.

In 2020, after completing their planning and prototype work, Todd and his father launched OCOchem. From there, Todd opened a full-scale lab, securing early funding, and expanded the vision that started in a garage.

The domino effect of early funding

That’s when the Department of Commerce stepped in. Early funding from Commerce’s Clean Energy Fund, a $1.5 million award that matched the U.S. Department of Energy’s Hydrogen EarthShot initiative, was pivotal. This initial boost drew additional support from U.S. Department of Energy and the Centralia Coal Transition Fund, as well as private investors from around the world.

Todd Brix stressed that without strong investment in research and development, true innovation just can’t happen. “I’m grateful to be in Washington state and have my state support me,” said Brix. “It certainly helped to advance this technology.”

From a lab to a large scale

By January 2024, OCOchem had built the world’s largest CO₂ electrolyzer cell, a 1.5-square-meter unit about the size of a dinner table. It works by using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen on one side of the cell, then mixing the hydrogen with CO₂ on the other side to create formate, a process known as CO₂ electrolysis. The system started small in 2020 and was scaled up three times to reach its current size.

“Think of an electrolyzer like a kitchen appliance that works in reverse of a battery,” Brix explained. “A battery stores electricity and gives it back when you need it. A CO₂ electrolyzer uses electricity to take water apart into hydrogen and oxygen and then uses that hydrogen to combine with CO₂ to make formate in a single step.”

Doing this in one step means OCOchem doesn’t have to produce and store hydrogen gas separately or run it through high-temperature, high-pressure systems. That makes the process safer and less expensive. And because the formate is made from CO₂, releasing hydrogen from it later is carbon-neutral.

Impact on communities

OCOchem’s innovation could transform how we power vehicles, produce chemicals, and manage carbon emissions. Instead of releasing CO₂ into the air, OCOchem’s process makes it valuable to capture that resource, helping industries decarbonize, displacing products made from and by fossil fuels, while creating jobs and building new markets.

OCOchem is scaling up its technology to show how carbon emissions can be turned into solutions. Its principal research and development laboratories are in Richland, and in August 2025 the company announced a partnership with ADM to build a demonstration plant in Decatur, Illinois. The plant will turn 10,000 tons of CO₂ from ethanol production into formate each year, cutting emissions equal to taking about 16,000 cars off the road.

At the same time, OCOchem is developing portable “green” generators, which are quiet, nonpolluting alternatives to diesel engines that run on formate fuel and could power events, construction sites, and even food trucks.

Building the hydrogen economy

Since 2020, the average electricity price per kilowatt-hour in the US has soared from $0.133 to $0.188, a 30% increase in just the past 5 years. In the next few years, many experts fear that the United States will face an electricity crisis (although one can argue it’s already in the early stages of one).

Image Source: FRED

Below are four factors driving higher energy prices:

· An Aging Electrical Grid: The US’s electrical grid is aging. With an already massive fiscal deficit, major grid upgrades are unlikely any time soon. Grid issues have become more prevalent recently and are likely to persist.

· Extreme Weather Events: Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events over the past few years. For instance, a 2021 Texas winter storm left 2 million Texans without electricity.

· Persistent Inflation: Although the inflation rate has slowed since its 2022 peak, inflation is still driving up the costs of the equipment and materials needed to generate electricity.

· EVs & the AI Buildout: As electric vehicle adoption continues to grow, the need for charging infrastructure is also increasing. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence buildout is the most significant driver of higher electricity prices. Currently, data centers comprise ~5% of total electricity use in the United States. However, McKinsey & Company expects that data center electricity use will triple by 2030, accounting for 11.7% of total consumption.

Is Nuclear the Solution to the US Electricity Crisis?

Chris Wright, the US Secretary of Energy, had a nuclear energy background prior to joining the Trump Administration, having previously served on the board of directors of Oklo (OKLO). With that in mind, it should be little surprise that the Trump Administration is pro-nuclear. Thursday, news broke that the US plans to buy and own as many as 10 nuclear reactors. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration also announced a $1 billion federal loan to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant that is managed by Constellation Energy (CEG).

But can nuclear energy solve US energy issues? Nuclear energy is one of the cleanest, most reliable, and cheapest forms of energy. However, nuclear energy is unlikely to be the solution to the US power woes in the short-to-intermediate-term because building a plant typically takes a decade. Additionally, nuclear energy companies face regulatory red tape, public opinion issues, and environmental concerns that are unlikely to be remedied any time soon.

Nuclear Stock to Buy: Constellation Energy (CEG)

Although the above-mentioned nuclear challenges hold for most nuclear projects in the United States, Constellation Energy is an exception. Constellation Energy is unique in the nuclear industry because it has already received regulatory approval and funding and has provided an estimate of when its massive nuclear project will launch. CEG’s restoration of the “Three Mile Island” nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, renamed the “Crane Energy Center,” will be online in 2027. Additionally, CEG has landed 20-year power agreements to supply electricity to two big tech juggernauts – Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META).

Natural Gas & Coal: Fueling the Early Innings of the AI Revolution

Although it’s reasonable for investors to believe that nuclear power will be a long-term power solution for the AI revolution, doing so now is unrealistic. Since the AI buildout is unlikely to slow down any time soon, traditional energy sources such as natural gas are the answer in the short-term due to their practicality and low cost.

Natural Gas Stock to Buy: Bloom Energy (BE)

Bloom Energy has differentiated itself from other energy providers through its solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. BE’s technology takes natural gas (and other gases), mixes it with air, and creates electricity. However, unlike other natural gas providers, Bloom’s technology produces electricity without combustion, making its energy “cleaner”. Additionally, Bloom’s technology is self-sufficient and produced on-site, meaning that data center owners are not susceptible to grid outages.

Solar Energy: Another Solution for the AI Energy Glut

Now that solar energy is cheaper than ever, it is poised to be a major winner in the AI-driven energy demand boom. Solar is relatively cheap, clean, renewable, and can scale rapidly.

Solar Stocks to Buy: First Solar (FSLR) & Nextpower (NXT)

First Solar is a leading domestic solar provider. FSLR benefits from increasing solar demand. Additionally, the company benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which provides generous tax credits and shields it from Chinese competition. Wall Street analysts expect FSLR EPS to more than double next quarter.

Meanwhile, Nextpower is another company that will benefit from the electricity super-cycle. Nextpower’s software and services help solar projects run more efficiently.

Bottom Line

Electricity demand in the US is accelerating rapidly, and the early signs of a long-term power crisis are already visible. While nuclear offers a powerful long-term, solution, the urgency of the AI buildout means that natural gas, advanced fuel cell technology, and solar will drive the first wave of investment opportunities.

are not jurisdictional.” If you have additional questions on the new WOTUS rule, reach out to the NFIB Legal Center at info@nfib.org.","A newly proposed rule from the Trump Administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers aims to give landowners a more predictable definition of “waters of the United States” (WOTUS).

The definition of WOTUS has long been a point of contention for landowners. In past administrations, farmers, ranchers, home builders, and other small businesses with water on their property have faced overreach from the federal government, as it used WOTUS to claim jurisdiction over private lands.

Background

The Clean Water Act (CWA) gives the federal government authority over certain “navigable waters,” which the Act defines as “waters of the United States” or WOTUS. The CWA charges EPA and the Army Corps with enforcement, and these agencies have issued regulations defining which waters or wetlands are subject to federal jurisdiction. If a water or wetland is a WOTUS, then a landowner must obtain a permit before improving and altering the area, even though he or she owns the land.

After longstanding confusion and conflicting interpretations about what waters are WOTUS, the Supreme Court decided Sackett v. EPA in 2023. In Sackett, the Court struck down a vague test that the agencies had long used to claim jurisdiction. Thus, the Court restricted when the agencies could do so going forward. NFIB urged the Court to reach this outcome and applauded the decision benefiting landowners.

But the Biden Administration pushed forward. It responded to the Sackett decision by issuing a new WOTUS rule that further expanded federal government jurisdiction, leaving small businesses with extreme uncertainty. NFIB expressed disappointment that the federal government failed to head the Supreme Court’s mandate and continued to complicate WOTUS.

Newly Proposed Rule

On November 20, 2025, EPA and the Army Corps proposed a new WOTUS rule. Small businesses reacted to the new rule with appreciation and optimism for a better WOTUS future.

Among the changes in the new rule, a few will have a significant impact on small businesses and landowners.

Clearer Definitions

Relatively Permanent

In Sackett, the Supreme Court said that “waters” in WOTUS included “only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water forming geographical features’ that are described in ordinary parlance as streams, oceans, rivers, and lakes.”

The proposed rule defines relatively permanent waters as those that are “standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season.”

Continuous Surface Connection

In Sackett, the Supreme Court said that wetlands are subject to the CWA and federal authority only if they are “adjacent” to a WOTUS, and the wetland has a “continuous surface connection” with that WOTUS, “making it difficult to determine where the ‘water’ ends and the ‘wetland’ begins.”

Under the proposed rule, a water with a “continuous surface connection” to a WOTUS means: 1) the water in question is abutting (touching) an already jurisdictional WOTUS, and 2) the water in question has surface water at least during the wet season.

“At least during the wet season” is a temporal requirement that will make it easier for a landowner or consultant to determine what areas satisfy the continuous surface connection test.

Restrictions of Wetland Jurisdiction

The proposed rule’s definition of “continuous surface connection” reduces the number of wetlands that will be jurisdictional and subject to federal authority.

Combined with the instructions of the Supreme Court in Sackett, the proposed rule’s definition of “continuous surface connection” will mean that a wetland is not jurisdictional unless it meets all three of these requirements:

The area in question meets the definition of a wetland; and

A “wetland” is defined as an area that is “inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation.” Examples are swamps, marshes, bogs, etc.

It is abutting (touching) that WOTUS; and

It has surface water at least during the wet season.

Unlike previous WOTUS rules, the proposed rule makes clear that only the portion of a wetland that satisfies the two-part continuous surface connection test will be a jurisdictional WOTUS. For example, if only one part of the wetland has surface water throughout the wet season, but other portions of the wetland do not, then EPA will split up the wetland for determining jurisdiction. This is a stark contrast to previous agency practices, which would include the entire wetland as jurisdictional if any portion of it was.

Exclusion of Most Ditches

Although ditches are generally excluded from the definition of WOTUS, previous administrations have treated the ditch exclusion differently so that many ditches would be jurisdictional.

To address and clarify this confusion, the proposed rule excludes all ditches “that are constructed or excavated entirely in dry land.”

The clarity of the proposed rule means that the jurisdictional reach of ditches will depend solely on where the specific ditch was constructed. Ditches constructed in wetlands or tributaries will still be jurisdictional, and in rare cases, a ditch constructed in dry land may meet an independent basis for federal jurisdiction, such as a ditch being navigable (like a canal) or qualifying as a “point source” for pollutant discharge. All other ditches should be excluded from WOTUS under the proposed rule.

Absolute Certainty on Ephemeral Waters

Ephemeral waters are those that are normally dry but may have surface or standing water flow temporarily only due to precipitation events like rain or snow fall.

The proposed rule makes clear that “ephemeral waters . . . are not jurisdictional.”

Last week, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation’s Board of Directors approved a contract amendment that allows up to an additional $16 million in performance-based tax incentives for Foxconn’s planned expansion in Racine County. The global electronics manufacturer’s initial $10 billion investment in the region succumbed to the challenges of a changing marketplace, which ironically is the exact driver behind the company’s new $569 million investment. The expansion will allow Foxconn to produce artificial intelligence infrastructure at its Mount Pleasant operations, targeting rising customer demands in the U.S. while strengthening the nation’s supply chain. “As the demand for more data infrastructure continues to rise, Foxconn will keep responding to our customers’ needs with flexibility and at scale in the United States,” said Foxconn Chief Product Officer Jerry Hsiao. “Wisconsin accounts for close to a fourth of our workforce in America, and this second- stage project will double that presence in the state by the end of this decade.” More than 1,370 jobs will be created in the region over the next four years.

A LIFE-SAVING REDEVELOPMENT

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals previously announced a $7 billion investment into its U.S. operations in North Carolina and New York, and one planned project is now taking off. Last week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the company would be investing $2 billion in Saratoga Springs, having acquired the site of Quad Graphics’ former magazine printing factory in April 2025. The over 1-million-sq.-ft. site will be reconstructed into a facility that will manufacture drugs for infectious diseases and cancer. “As Regeneron continues to drive forward our mission of using the power of science to bring forward life-changing medicines, we can improve the lives of those in New York and around the world,” said Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer. “In this pursuit, we look forward to continuing to fuel economic development and create meaningful, well-paying jobs that strengthen communities across the state.” The new facility, located just under three hours north of the company’s HQ in Tarrytown, is set to create 1,000 new jobs once operational. Empire State Development will support Regeneron’s project with up to $35 million in performance-based Excelsior Jobs Program tax credits.

MODERNIZED FOR THE FUTURE

In support of General Motors’ growing production operations in Michigan, Tennessee and Kansas, following a $4 billion project sweep announced earlier this year, the automotive giant has announced a new investment in Ohio. Heading to the company’s Parma Metal Center, a $250 million expansion investment will enable increased production capacity and support a robust domestic supply chain. Sheet metal stamping and assemblies production at Parma Metal Center will directly support General Motors’ regional manufacturing locations, which are leading the production of future internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV vehicles. Currently, the Parma plant produces more than 100 million parts each year, processing 400 tons of steel each day. “Our commitment to Parma Metal Center isn’t just about upgrading equipment — it’s about investing in the people who make it all happen,” said General Motors SVP of Global Manufacturing Mike Trevorrow. “Our manufacturing teams are the driving force behind GM’s success, and we’re committed to giving them the tools and training they need to excel in today’s advanced manufacturing world.”

One would have allowed power plants that retired no more than five years ago to use the priority process to add capacity at those sites.
SPP also failed to adequately support its “queue priority” proposal, according to FERC.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

In a three-part decision, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week approved the Southwest Power Pool’s proposal allowing power plant owners to expand their generating facilities by up to 20% under a temporary priority review process.

However, FERC on Nov. 28 rejected SPP’s proposal to allow the owners of retired power plants to use the fast-track review process, as well as a proposal to give “priority projects” an advantage in an upcoming interconnection study process.

SPP’s proposals are part of a push by U.S. grid operators to create pathways for bringing power supplies online more quickly to meet rising demand for electricity. SPP contends it is onthe brink of a resource adequacy crisis, with its demand forecasts rising and power plant retirements accelerating, according to its “priority process” application at FERC.

Under the proposal, filed in late September, eligible shovel-ready expansion projects would receive an accelerated study process.

SPP says that its “priority process” to add capacity at existing generating facilities will complement its FERC-approved Expedited Resource Adequacy Study process for new power plants to help meet near-term capacity needs.

Under the priority process, a power plant owner can seek to add up to 20% of a generating facility’s capacity at its existing interconnection point. A power plant owner can use the process once per facility.

Priority project developers must meet eligibility requirements, including showing the project can be online within five years, that they have ordered all major equipment for their expansion project and that the manufacturer has indicated it can deliver the equipment by the planned commercial operation date. Also, all financing for the project must be secured.

Priority projects must also make heightened financial commitments compared to SPP’s standard financial requirements for interconnection requests.

The owners of priority projects must pay all of the cost of the Priority System Impact Study and all the cost of substation network upgrades and system network upgrades needed for their projects.

The American Clean Power Association and the Advanced Power Alliance — clean energy trade groups — supported the priority process proposal, saying it was narrowly tailored and non-discriminatory.

“The Priority Process will improve the efficient interconnection of new generating facility capacity by allowing incremental additions to existing generating facilities to come online in an expedited manner without impacting existing interconnection customers,” FERC said in its decision.

The priority process will be effective from Dec. 1, 2025, to March 1, when SPP’s recently proposed Consolidated Planning Process will take effect, if approved.

However, FERC rejected two related proposals that SPP filed separately. One would have allowed power plants that retired no more than five years ago to use the priority process to add capacity at those sites. Another would allow priority projects to be queued ahead of other interconnection requests in a Definitive Interconnection System Impact Study cluster if the review’s first phase hasn’t started.

FERC ruled that SPP’s proposal for allowing retired power plants to take advantage of the priority process lacked key details, including whether the new project could be 120% the size of the old one or just 20% of its size.

SPP also failed to adequately support its “queue priority” proposal, according to FERC.

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle charging network operator Ionna plans to invest $250 million to expand public electric vehicle charging infrastructure in California over the next three years, the company announced in a Nov. 20 press release.

Ionna, the joint venture of eight major automakers, is currently building out an extensive EV charging network in the U.S. that customers of each OEM can use as a way to promote EV adoption, address the lack of convenient access to public chargers and facilitate long-distance, coast-to-coast travel, it says.

The company recently held kickoff ceremonies in California for its newly opened public chargers in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster, which Ionna says is only “a fraction” of the 1,000 charging bays it’s contracted to install across the state. Nationwide, Ionna plans to install up to 30,000 EV chargers by 2030.

Dive Insight:

Ionna was established in July 2023 as a joint venture between automakers BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. In February, the company announced it was transitioning from its public beta phase to full-scale national rollout of its charging network.

Despite the Dept. of Transportation’s revised guidance for the distribution of federal funding to construct public EV charging infrastructure in the U.S., Ionna continues to expand its network. The company is not reliant on federal funds to construct its charging sites. Instead, its funding comes from private capital.

To promote the newly opened charging sites in California, Ionna launched an “EV Education Program” to teach new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility. Following the opening of each new location, Ionna ambassadors partner with local dealerships and EV groups to host an event at the site to demonstrate how easy it is to charge an EV at a Ionna-branded charger.

“This week’s expansion into California is a snapshot of the national momentum IONNA has built in under a year’s time,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, in a statement. “‘IONNA Speed’ isn’t just about how quickly we grow, but also how we deliver, and the IONNA team consistently operates with a driver-first mentality to elevate the charging experience.”

Some flagship Ionna charging sites are referred to as “Rechargeries” and offer amenities such as food and drinks, restrooms and driver lounges to relax in.

Ionna is also rolling out “plug-in and charge” capabilities at its Rechargeries, allowing EV drivers to simply plug in and charge without needing a credit card for payment. Its chargers currently support plug-in and charge functionality for BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and more recently, Rivian and Ford EVs. Ionna’s plug-in and charge technology will roll out to Honda, Stellantis, Toyota EVs in 2026, per the release.

Last December, Ioanna announced a partnership with c-store operator Sheetz to install chargers at more than 50 of the retailer’s locations by the end of 2026, beginning with Florida.

In July, Ionna announced a new partnership with Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which increased its contracted EV charging hubs to over 3,000 at the time.

The event showcased the latest green technologies across various industries such as new energy, artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence and low-altitude economy, as well as green food products from around the world.
In recent years, China has actively advanced green energy transition through concrete actions, establishing the world's largest clean energy supply system.
Seah Shoo Chin, Malaysian State Executive Councillor for Malacca, welcomed Chinese enterprises to explore green industry cooperation in Malaysia.
""We look forward to further deepening cooperation in areas such as green food and clean energy in the future.""","NANCHANG, Dec. 1 (Xinhua) -- A robot named ""Pasini"" drew crowds at the 2025 World Green Development Investment and Trade Expo & China Green Food Expo, as it moved its mechanical arms, which are fitted with nearly 2,000 tactile sensors.

Indian blogger Amit Kumar raised his phone to livestream the scene to his followers overseas, enthusiastically explaining the advanced technology on display.

""This expo is amazing! It showcases cutting-edge green technologies while offering a chance to sample eco-friendly cuisine from around the world,"" Kumar said.

The event, held from Nov. 27 to 30 in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province, brought together more than 2,500 exhibitors from over 60 countries and regions.

The event showcased the latest green technologies across various industries such as new energy, artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence and low-altitude economy, as well as green food products from around the world. According to organizers, more than 60 projects worth 45 billion yuan (about 6.36 billion U.S. dollars) were signed.

In recent years, China has actively advanced green energy transition through concrete actions, establishing the world's largest clean energy supply system.

According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China has helped reduce global wind and photovoltaic power generation costs by over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, and accounts for 46 percent of the world's renewable energy jobs.

By 2024, China's exports of wind and solar products had helped other countries cumulatively reduce carbon emissions by over 1 billion tonnes.

""China is actively seeking deeper cooperation in the global green industry and working toward its carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals,"" said Jia Kang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences.

Seah Shoo Chin, Malaysian State Executive Councillor for Malacca, welcomed Chinese enterprises to explore green industry cooperation in Malaysia.

Malacca is advancing green projects such as waste-to-energy initiatives while offering industrial parks for investment and high-quality halal food certification. ""We hope to deepen China-Malaysia cooperation in green manufacturing, clean energy, and the circular economy, creating both inclusive and replicable projects,"" Seah said.

The exhibition also attracted buyers from across the globe, many of whom were impressed with the innovative products on display. Souley Flhadji Adamou from the Republic of Niger, who has been engaged in China-Africa trade for a decade, was seen testing a rideable electric suitcase.

""This suitcase can run up to 13 kilometers on a single charge. It's smooth and convenient to ride, and it holds significant market potential,"" he said.

At the Jiangxi Godfrey Technology Co., Ltd. booth, Immaculée Agbaka showcased the company's chargers, speakers and other products to international buyers.

""We've already had over 60 buyers proactively reach out to us, seeking to discuss cooperation details in depth,"" Agbaka said, noting that visitors from various regions brought diverse needs and suggestions, offering valuable insights for future product upgrades.

Mutale Nalumango, vice president of Zambia, stated at the opening ceremony of the expo that Zambia aspires to build a sustainable and resilient green economy, as climate change has led to prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall patterns, placing pressure on key sectors such as hydropower and agriculture.

""We are deeply grateful to Chinese enterprises and people for coming to Africa, especially for investing and establishing businesses in Zambia, including the development of industrial parks,"" Nalumango said. ""We look forward to further deepening cooperation in areas such as green food and clean energy in the future."" ■",,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:57.473543

The entire nation of Germany, and now issues with getting rare earth metals and magnets are hitting European companies hard.
Powers, said the best days this year to buy a new car will be Dec. 26 through New Year’s Eve.
“Dealers will lose money to sell cars at the end of the year,” Frehsee told the Detroit Free Press.
The Big Question What’s the best new car deal in your area?","The so-called ‘Magic Week’ is the time of the year when dealers are so desperate to get rid of cars that they’ll sell them for a loss. Is this a real thing? It can be, although there are all sorts of variables at play this year. Inventory is up, and sales are down, which is usually the perfect recipe for scoring a great deal.

There’s always a catch, right? The Internet loves a catch-y headline, and this time, for this Morning Dump, I’m going to go through all the catches. There’s the obvious one, which is that the best way to get a good deal is to have a lot of money in the first place. There’s more to it, though, as I’ll explore today.

You know who is super-reliant on China? The entire nation of Germany, and now issues with getting rare earth metals and magnets are hitting European companies hard. Germany has a plan, though, and it’s to walk back the 2035 EV mandate, which seems to play into the hands of Chinese automakers that want to sell EVs there.

It’s not just Europe that’s looking askance at Chinese automakers, as BYD just launched a much cheaper alternative to the popular plug-in hybrids in Japan.

The Good Deals And Not-So-Good Deals Will Depend A Lot On Where And What You Shop

While no rational person should expect to suddenly get a great deal everywhere on a super popular car like a Toyota Sienna or Honda CR-V, there’s some logic behind the idea that from December 26th to January 1st, you might be able to get your lowest price/best incentives on a new car.

Some of this is the market overall, as the year is expected to end with a thud, as Cox Automotive points out:

“The new-vehicle sales pace had been expected to slow in the fourth quarter, and that’s what we are seeing,” said Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlie Chesbrough. “The headwinds from higher prices and fewer government subsidies for electric vehicles are finally slowing the market after a surprisingly strong previous six months. Sales began surging in the spring as buyers rushed to market to beat expected higher prices in the wake of announced tariffs. Now, with more tariffed products replacing existing non-tariffed inventory, prices are drifting higher, leading to slower sales which may last through the remainder of the year and into next year.”

As the Detroit Free Press reports, there is logic behind ‘magic week’ as well:

Overall, most car shopping experts and car dealers expect automakers to offer sizable incentives to move metal in December. General Motors has already started offering big discounts on Chevrolet Silverado pickups.

Likewise, many car dealers will negotiate more aggressively to get sales over the finish line to hit year-end targets. In fact, Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics at J.D. Powers, said the best days this year to buy a new car will be Dec. 26 through New Year’s Eve. He calls it the “magic week” for car buying. Eric Frehsee, president of Tamaroff Auto Group, confirmed Jominy’s prediction.

“Dealers will lose money to sell cars at the end of the year,” Frehsee told the Detroit Free Press. “There’s all kinds of goals and targets to hit and no one wants to fall short.”

You probably can’t just call up your local dealer and ask them how close they are to their yearly target, so you’ll have to look a little closer at what you want. As referenced above, Chevy is putting a lot of might behind Silverado this year, and for good reason. Not only is it a high-margin, profitable vehicle, but Ford is in trouble.

Specifically, it may not be the best time to get an F-150 because the plant that processes the aluminum for F-150 production keeps catching on fire for some reason. This means deals for the Ford truck might be harder to come by, whereas Chevy wants the killshot of outselling the F-Series for a quarter, or at least the company wants to make Ford sweat a little.

As mentioned, the ongoing affordability catch is also there. While lending is loosening up a little bit, your best way to get a deal is to have great credit in order to negotiate lower financing on shorter terms. If you can afford a 48-month repayment and can put a lot of money down, you’ll ultimately pay less over the course of the loan than someone who has a higher interest rate and can only afford a much longer term.

Is there any upside here for buyers? Sure, if you’re a Costco member and have been for a while, there are a bunch of $1,250 incentives on GM or Polestar products.

As you can see in the chart above, there are also deals to be had in certain segments. Do you want a mid-size sedan? Sales are down, so maybe a deal on a Camry or Accord isn’t so far out there as a concept. Do you want a Nissan Altima? No. No one wants a Nissan Altima. However, the deals for those are probably going to be excellent depending on where you live.

The other place to look is for vehicles and automakers impacted by tariffs. This is probably a bad time to score a good deal on a European-built car, as European brands are looking to protect profitability.

So, yeah, deals are out there, but it’s going to depend more than usual on the brand, the vehicle, and the geography.

European Automakers And Suppliers Looking At Supply Chain Disruptions

The un-flattening of the world is starting to continue apace, especially with China’s Ministry of Commerce putting stricter export controls on its rare earth minerals and magnets. These materials are key to making all sorts of advanced goods, and the Chinese government is fully aware of this dependence. After a year of governments questioning their reliance on China and implementing trade barriers, China is responding by increasing bureaucratic hurdles.

A new survey by the European Chamber of Commerce points out just how tough this is:

Delivery times for impacted goods have been disrupted, with 40% of respondents indicating that export control approval processes have added upwards of two months to delivery times. A similar proportion (38%) expect ‘significant’ disruptions to their supply chains, or production stoppages or slowdowns, if all of China’s announced export controls are fully implemented.

[…]

“China’s export controls have increased the uncertainty felt by European businesses operating in the country, with companies facing risks of production slowdowns or even stoppages,” said Jens Eskelund, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. “They have also prompted strong responses from China’s trading partners, which has added more pressure to a global trade system that was already under a great deal of stress.”

The EU recently passed high tariffs on Chinese-built EVs, over the protest of the German government.

Germany: Let’s Maybe Chill On Those EV-Only Mandates

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz would very much like it if the European Union didn’t keep its 2035 EV-only mandate, reports Bloomberg:

“Our goal should be a technology-neutral, flexible, and realistic CO2 regulation that meets the EU’s climate protection targets without jeopardizing innovation and industrial value creation,” Merz wrote in the letter, which reached von der Leyen’s office on Friday and was seen by Bloomberg.

Merz’s letter demands far-reaching changes to von der Leyen’s original plan to ban combustion engine vehicles by 2035. “We must consider the emissions of the entire passenger car fleet — that is, new registrations and existing vehicles,” Merz, the leader of Germany’s conservative CDU party, wrote.

The European Union is adoping EVs at a way faster rate than the United States, and even there the idea of getting rid of all combustion-powered cars without some sort of huge advancement seems difficult. I mean, one way could be lowering tariffs on Chinese cars and allowing that country’s automakers to sell a bunch of cheap EVs in Europe, but that’s even worse for German automakers.

Merz himself got elected partially on a promise to kick the economy back into gear which, in Germany, requires selling and building more cars.

BYD’s Sealion 6 Is Going To Challenge Japan’s Best

The BYD Sealion 6 is, visually, one of the least interesting vehicles for sale right now. From a technological and geopolitical standpoint, however, it’s fascinating. The BYD plan, besides selling EVs outside of China, seems to hinge on selling plug-in hybrids.

While tame, visually, the Sealion 6 is competitive on range and features with both the Toyota RAV4 Prime and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV in Japan. On price? It’s not even close. The Sealion 6 will sell in Japan for about $25,600 for the FWD model, compared to $36,500 for a RAV4 and $34,100 for the Outlander. Even the AWD Sealion 6 is just $28,900 or so.

Will Japanese buyers go for it? There’s a reason why they may not, as Nikkei Asia reports:

The debut takes place with relations between Japan and China worsening. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in parliament that an armed attack on Taiwan could become “a survival-threatening situation” for Japan. In response, Beijing has taken a series of measures, including urging its citizens to avoid traveling to Japan.

In a group interview on Monday, Tofukuji said there has been no significant increase in canceled orders. “We have not received requests to cancel from customers awaiting delivery. Customers are observing the situation calmly.”

He also said the company has not received any requests to cancel Monday’s news conference from either the Japanese or Chinese governments.

“We cannot predict how bilateral relations will develop, going forward, and there is no major impact at this time,” he said. “But if such a relationship persists into the future, it is natural that concerns will arise.”

If the People’s Republic of China invades the Republic of China (Taiwan) it’s a scary moment for Japan, but the quesiton is how much Japanese buyers are influenced by geopolitics.

The changes Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available.
In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.
The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added.
Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.","Ohio lawmakers introduced tweaks last month to a bill effectively prohibiting many immigrants from owning land in the state. Those changes include carveouts for green card holders and those who have served in the armed forces. But opponents don’t see the changes as much of an improvement.

The restrictions apply to people from countries designated as foreign adversaries. That list, compiled by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, includes China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

As part of Ohio’s 2023 state operating budget, Gov. DeWine allowed restrictions on foreign farmland ownership but refused to apply the same prohibitions to land within 25 miles of military installations. Ohio House Bill 1 revives those vetoed provisions and expands them to include critical infrastructure.

The sponsors’ stated concern is that allowing foreign governments, businesses, and agents to buy land nearby leaves the U.S. vulnerable to spying or sabotage.

“As legislators,” state Rep. Angie King, R-Celina, said when she introduced the bill, “we have a responsibility to protect Ohio from those who seek to undermine and destroy our American values and way of life.”

But critics, including civil rights groups and scores of immigrants from targeted countries, contend the bill is exceptionally harsh. The measure relies on a definition of critical infrastructure that includes large, discrete facilities like power plants, dams, and refineries, but it also extends to vast power and communication networks. For instance, every telephone and utility pole, the lines that run between them, and every cell tower fit squarely within that definition.

The changes

Barring ownership within 25 miles, as the original bill did, leaves little if any land in Ohio available. The amendment in the Ohio House reduced that limitation to 10 miles. But opponents say, with such an expansive list, even a one-mile ban “would render significant portions of Ohio inaccessible for families and businesses.”

In addition to reducing the radius of the bill’s exclusion zone, the amendment provides exemptions for legal permanent residents and people who have served or are serving in the military.

The changes also provide protection for property willed to someone, as well as property used to retire outstanding debts.

County prosecutors raised concerns early on about taking on potentially complex cases. “Without additional resources these cases will take time away from the core responsibilities of county prosecutors,” Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association Executive Director Lou Tobin said. The amendment includes a provision giving county prosecutors the ability to hand cases off to the state attorney general if they don’t have the resources to pursue them.

The bill grandfathers land already owned by individuals who would otherwise be prohibiting from ownership, but bars them from acquiring any other property. Should the measure take effect, anyone who becomes subject to the bill in the future would have to sell their property within two years.

In a joint statement, The Asian American Coalition of Ohio, Ohio Chinese American Association, and Justice for Ohio, acknowledged that narrowing the bill’s scope shows lawmakers are hearing them, but they insisted the changes don’t go nearly far enough.

The bill continues to discriminate against people in the U.S. lawfully, the groups said, based solely on their national origin — one of the seven protected characteristics laid out in the federal Fair Housing Act.

The bill also “conflicts directly with established U.S. and Ohio laws governing property ownership, due process and equal protection,” the groups added. Not only does the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution require equal protection, but Article 1 Section 1 of the Ohio Constitution includes “acquiring, possessing, and protecting property” among all individuals’ inalienable rights.

The groups noted as well that the prohibitions would discourage legitimate investment in the state.

“At a moment when Ohio is striving to attract advanced manufacturing, strengthen its workforce, and deepen international partnerships, H.B. 1 sends a damaging and counterproductive message,” they wrote.

As for the newly proposed 10-mile exclusion radius, the groups said, “no evidence has been presented that these sweeping geographic bans improve national security or public safety.”

After the amendment was introduced, state Rep. Juanita Brent, D-Cleveland, pressed supporters to provide a map of the state showing what property is and isn’t excluded. The chair, state Rep. Cindy Abrams, R-Harrison, made no promises, but said she’d ask the sponsors if they have one.

Just before the committee adopted the amendment, state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, objected.

“Obviously, it’s discriminatory, in my opinion, on its face,” he said of the bill.

“In my opinion, this particular bill will weaken Ohio’s economy and competitiveness, basically creating an environment that certain individuals or businesses from certain origins of the world are not welcome,” he said. “This bill would clearly create a potential for racial profiling and create a question of equal protection under the law.”

While the share of electricity from renewable energy has increased to more than 40% after years of growth, experts have warned that the construction of solar and wind farms needs to accelerate substantially if the Albanese government is to meet a target of 82% of electricity coming from clean sources by 2030.

The regulator said there was “real potential” that much more could win financial backing next year, in part due to its expanded capacity investment scheme, an underwriting program for the solar, wind and batteries needed to replace ageing and dirty coal-fired power stations.

But the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group, Richie Merzian, said the lower financial investment decisions were a “symptom of deep structural issues, not just a blip”.

“The structural issues include state planning delays, grid connection uncertainty, transmission constraints, rising project costs and lack of long-term revenue certainty,” he said.

Merzian said the underwriting program had helped to develop a large pipeline of potential projects, but that they would not deliver the new energy capacity needed unless companies made final investments.

“The contrast between the large pipeline and the limited number reaching [financial investment decision] indicates a system that is not functioning as intended,” he said.

Renewable energy that has previously had private financial signoff continues to be added to the grid. The Clean Energy Regulator said it anticipated nearly 7GW of large-scale generation and rooftop solar systems could be connected this year.

But the Climate Change Authority last week warned more would be needed if the government was to meet its targets. It said the pace of growth in large-scale renewable energy generation would need to more than double over the next five years.

Frankie Muskovic, executive director of policy for the Investment Group on Climate Change, said the reduced investment decisions this year were “a concerning trend” and needed to accelerate to meet renewable energy and climate targets. The latter includes a 43% cut in emissions by 2030 and at least a 62% cut by 2035, compared with 2005 levels.

She said some state planning changes and an ongoing review of the National Electricity Market could be causing uncertainty, but that large-scale renewable energy developments were often marginal investments and the underwriting program needed to offer more support for each project that received a contract.

Muskovic said the scheme should also run past its scheduled closure date of 2027. This would give investors greater confidence to back renewables projects, she said.

“Maybe we need more data to confirm if this is a blip, but everything we are hearing suggests this is not. We need to be ready and able to put more support into bolstering the [scheme],” she said. “We need to be shoulder to the wheel on this, and state governments need to be along for the ride.”

Giving an annual climate statement to parliament last week, the climate change minister Chris Bowen said the government had more than 16GW of renewable energy projects under contract or in negotiations through the capacity investment scheme so far, with up to 10 tender rounds remaining.

He said he expected about 11GW of capacity to have reached financial close by the end of 2026.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fb353b80336d5be2f8d66ca112a27cf0a1d6b95/516_0_1213_971/master/1213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=384a3a480b2b3818baacd104e05e6324",N,,2025-12-01 12:02:45.773890

WASHINGTON, Dec. 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Experts in energy, fuels, and emissions policy believe that unleashing American energy and pursuing decarbonization are not mutually exclusive objectives. These and related topics were the subject of a recent webinar by the Engine Technology Forum, ""Seeking Solutions for Sustainable Energy and Technology to Power a Resilient Economy"" which is now available to watch here.

After four years focused on decarbonization, there is now a realization that the aspirations of some past policy goals were out of sync with market realities and the desire to achieve greater energy security, both for the transportation and industrial sectors. At the same time, experts emphasized it is important that we make continued progress in achieving goals of cleaner air and greater energy security, along with access to affordable energy.

""Realizing the goals of both unleashing American energy and reducing emissions demands more advanced engines and renewable fuels, along with more electricity to power key sectors of the economy,"" said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Engine Technology Forum, the organizer of this session.

In his keynote presentation, Dr. Graham Conway, director at Pickering Energy Partners, outlined the framework of current U.S. policy and explained how the growing demand for electric power for artificial intelligence now dominates energy policy. He also compared global policies on electricity production and demand, highlighting the variable mix of power generation sources from coal to renewables across the globe, with a focus on the U.S.

As for transportation, progress toward achieving previously established national goals for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions was compared among the U.S., the European Union, and China. Over the next five years, there will likely be a continued need for policy measures that promote greener technologies, provide incentives for their adoption, and create carve-outs for sectors or circumstances that fall short of meeting these goals. The significance of life-cycle analysis as a true accounting of emissions was reviewed, and it was recognized that it should have a more central role in policymaking. Some analyses show that, over the life of a passenger vehicle, a hybrid vehicle using renewable fuels could achieve the same reduction in GHG emissions as a battery-electric vehicle, depending on the composition of electricity generating fuels from the grid.

Tammy Klein, founder and CEO of Transport Energy Strategies, reflected on the policy issues impacting fuel and technology choices in 2025. She expressed optimism about the EPA proposal for expanded renewable fuels volumes, while noting the challenges presented by other trade and tariff policies that affect fuel producers. She emphasized that consumers and energy prices are driving the national agenda today – a shift from the last four years. Overall, the U.S. is adding energy resources to meet increasing demand, decarbonizing where possible, and emphasizing true sustainability – a consideration of the social, environmental, and economic aspects of technology and fuels decisions. The ""all-of-the-above"" market-based approach best meets the demands of multiple use cases for various fuels and is preferred over a command-and-control approach, which in the past has established unachievable goals.

Dr. Ameya Joshi, founder of Mobility Notes, recognized the need for strong policies to drive technology development but also stressed the importance of incentives to encourage their adoption. He emphasized that reducing urban air pollution remains an equally important goal, one that is sometimes overshadowed by GHG policy. Dr. Joshi also noted that other countries are watching shifts in U.S. policy and considering how those changes will influence global emissions standards and overall decision-making.

""In one way or another, advanced engines and fuels are at the forefront of achieving the goals of economic prosperity, energy dominance, and lower emissions,"" noted Schaeffer. The panel concurred about the key role of internal combustion engines in the future and the need for continued progress in lowering emissions and improving efficiency.

The memorandum exempted these mining projects from the requirement of public consultation under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006.
The Minister said the communication from Tamil Nadu was examined in detail.
According to the reply, the Ministry clarified that the exemption was linked to the strategic importance of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals for India's energy transition, defence preparedness, space research and nuclear power programme.
The Minister also said that no amendment to the EIA Notification was required because the exemption was already provided for in the 2006 notification.","The Centre on Monday (December 1, 2025) said it has received a letter from the Tamil Nadu Government opposing the exemption granted to projects involving mining of critical, strategic and atomic minerals from public consultation.

It also said, “The exemption will not compromise environmental, social, health, and livelihood concerns.” In a written reply in Lok Sabha, Union Minister of State for Environment, Kirti Vardhan Singh, said the letter dated September 12 requested the withdrawal of the office memorandum issued on September 8.

The memorandum exempted these mining projects from the requirement of public consultation under the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006.

The Minister said the communication from Tamil Nadu was examined in detail. The Environment Ministry informed the State Government that the exemption was issued under an already existing provision of the EIA Notification, Clause 7(III)(i)(f), which allows projects relating to national defence, security or other strategic considerations to be exempted from public consultation.

According to the reply, the Ministry clarified that the exemption was linked to the strategic importance of critical, strategic, and atomic minerals for India's energy transition, defence preparedness, space research and nuclear power programme.

It also stated that the exemption will not compromise environmental, social, health, and livelihood concerns, which would continue to be addressed through the existing EIA mechanism, including an environment management plan, appraisal by an expert committee, and post-environmental clearance monitoring.

Solar Support Redfield began operating its 11.5-MWh direct current solar field in December of 2024.
“Ethanol producers are a good candidate for solar energy because anyone who pays a retail utility electric bill can potentially be a good candidate,” he says.
“It makes the energy project more successful because now they need less energy and so a larger proportion of their energy is green than if they just went for the green energy project on its own.","As its 65-acre solar field hums along providing half of its power needs, Redfield Energy operates business as usual. The system, situated next to the plant, is seamless, with no flickers or interruptions.

“The solar power ramps up and down with the sunlight,” says Josh Underberg, plant manager at Redfield Energy in Redfield, South Dakota. “Nothing changes here, we don’t have any power flickers, we don’t have any issues whatsoever.”

The solar field, designed, installed, operated and maintained by All Energy Solar Inc., has been in service for about one year and is not the only upgrade Redfield implemented in the past two years. Installation of a Whitefox ICE Plus system has improved efficiency and is poised to boost production from 65 MMgy to at least 72 MMgy, says Eric Baukol, Redfield Energy CEO.

“From a company standpoint, we’re growing, and we certainly want to grow, but right now our focus is making our gallons that we have better from a CI standpoint more so than just expanding to expand,” Baukol says.

Solar Support

Redfield began operating its 11.5-MWh direct current solar field in December of 2024. The capital investment amounted to about $20 million and installation took about one year, Baukol says.

The first six months showed some standard startup hiccups, but the second have shown the expected results. “So far, we have seen what we expected to see, which is a couple point reduction in our CI score by producing approximately half of our electricity,” Baukol says. “The investment was based off a model of a 2.2-point reduction in our CI score, and what we’re seeing in the second half of the year lines up with that expectation.”

“I’ve learned from others in the solar industry that you typically see some hiccups right away and then they run really well, and so far, that’s what we’ve seen,” Underberg says.

When Redfield committed to the investment, the 45Z Production Tax Credit had not yet been announced, but the benefits in cost savings and access to West Coast markets still incentivized the project.

“It was still a great option for our gallons that are heading west, California, Oregon, Washington,” Baukol says. “So if your gallons are spread that way, it’s a good investment.”

The solar array at Redfield operates on a pivoting system, east to west as the sun travels across the sky each day, according to Michael Thalhimer, director of business development for All Energy Solar, adding that not all solar fields have panels that pivot, but the option does “get more juice out of the lemon.”

All Energy Solar is focused on being an end-to-end solution provider, working in collaboration with customers for optimal success, Thalhimer says. “That’s what sets us up to be successful in this space—we are really collaborative. We tend to codevelop the project with the client instead of saying, ‘We’ll let you know when we need to come install this system on your acreage.’

“We support development, which is a big part of the timeline for these projects, typically much longer than the construction phase.”

While the process to get the project developed, up and running can be measured in years not months, the systems are designed to operate long-term, Thalhimer notes. “These are 30- to 40-year systems, so our capabilities don’t stop after the install.”

The project runway is several years, he says, so conversations need to start early. “It’s a thorough and long process to get these developed from initial discussions. It’s not plug and play. It requires design and engineering.”

All Energy handles operations and maintenance as well as warranty management and other elements of its clients’ projects, ideally without out-sourcing. “We are just now in the first year of supporting the Redfield project with operations and maintenance support, and we aim to stay connected with that project as long as they’ll have us,” he says.

“Ethanol producers are a good candidate for solar energy because anyone who pays a retail utility electric bill can potentially be a good candidate,” he says.

Year-over-year energy price increases are now resembling a hockey stick, Thalhimer adds. “It is not a steady uptick anymore.” The ethanol industry is laden with high energy consumers, he says, with adjacent land available for solar fields.

“So we provide an alternative solution to providing power for the facility, big or small, and if all the stars align, you end up with the type of project we have with Redfield, where they are producing 10 megawatts of electricity for their facility every day.”

The long-term benefit of a solar field helps curtail those ever-increasing costs, he says. “The energy avoidance of delivered power from the grid is a really long tail benefit. That’s the part of this we’re really proud of—we’re not just giving a system that gets ripped up and replaced when there’s something different in the next four or five years. These are really tested and built to last and to be really multi-decade operating systems for the customers.

“That’s why we’re really suited for these projects, because we’re in it for the long haul.”

Solar Incentives

Thalhimer outlines two main financial incentives for investments in renewable energy such as solar fields. The first is the federal 48E Clean Electricity Investment tax credit. It’s measured as a percentage of the total project cost that the investor can receive back within the first year of the project being in service. For most industrial and commercial-scale renewable power projects as of late, this is 30% of the project cost, Thalhimer says.

“That is set up to be able to come directly back to the owner/investor of the project, based on the tax year the project is put in service,” he says.

Second is the depreciation of the asset. Right now, investments like this qualify for 100% bonus depreciation, which means they can get the full benefit of that particular incentive in the first year. In most cases, the depreciation value is quite similar to the investment tax credit—30%. “That means, together, 60-plus percent of the project cost can be returned within a year of that investment being made in full through two levers,” Thalhimer emphasizes.

“They really accelerate return on investment when almost two-thirds of that project investment comes back within that first year, before you’re even talking about the energy sales.”

Thalhimer notes that for ethanol producers, 45Z is the “extra icing on the cake,” potentially to the tune of a seven-figure credit.

“Solar is absolutely a qualifying investment to earn that credit, as long as you eclipse the necessary CI point improvements to qualify,” he says. “That is another huge potential credit to leverage in addition to the federal tax credit and the depreciation.”

But the policy landscape is changing, with new standards for 48E coming this year. A new set of restrictions prohibits materials from certain foreign entities. “That does affect our industry and supply chain globally because a lot of solar electric equipment has been manufactured for decades in the far east and that is one of the main areas coming under more scrutiny for imports,” Thalhimer says.

For those who have commenced their project close to or at construction phase, the prior set of rules and policy still fully applies. For those starting efforts in the shorter term, an investment by July 4, 2026 can safe harbor the tax credit.

“While we still have some time to leverage, the rules are changing and starting those conversations sooner will give you the most amount of time to fully develop a concept and see if we can execute it,” Thalhimer says.

Distillation Efficiency

In tandem with sourcing half of its power needs from an on-site solar field, Redfield is also reducing the energy required for operations, according to Gillian Harrison, CEO of Whitefox. The plant started up its new Whitefox ICE Plus membrane-based dehydration system in October 2025.

“So it’s that combination,” Harrison explains. “They’re shrinking their demand to start with in the production process by doing ICE Plus, and then they’re greening their energy source for the energy that they need.”

ICE Plus was developed as a stepping stone from ICE—adding Whitefox’s proprietary membrane dehydration solution to operate complementary to molecular sieves by taking regen and other streams from distillation—to ICE XL—a full replacement of all molecular sieves with membrane technology. ICE Plus leaves the molecular sieve infrastructure in place but operating at reduced capacity while the membranes work alongside them to debottleneck.

“So we’re effectively extending the lifetime by taking load off the sieves, but enabling them in the future to think about replacing those molecular sieves with membranes in a staged approach,” Harrison says. “You can add more membranes in a modular way rather than doing it all in one.”

The ICE systems are designed to increase efficiency and throughput with a CI score reduction. Baukol says the setup at Redfield aims to knock 3.5 points off of the plant’s CI score.

“They are getting used to a different way of running their plant quite quickly, which is brilliant, really,” Harrison says. “They have found the membrane piece relatively straight forward to run. I think they’re finding that easier than the molecular sieve. That’s a testament to their team and ours, and how our respective teams have worked together to do the training and get familiar with a different way of running their facility.”

Decarbonizing energy sources and reducing energy demand go hand-in-hand, she adds. “It makes the energy project more successful because now they need less energy and so a larger proportion of their energy is green than if they just went for the green energy project on its own. The combination works very well.”

Large projects like solar installations require a core of advocates in an organization to champion the changes, Thalhimer says. “This took a village,” he says of Redfield’s solar field. “This was not a quick yes.

“Redfield’s board really got behind this project as a smart, long-term initiative for them. This wasn’t a box-checker. This adds a lot of value to their organization.”

While acknowledging that reforms are needed, Barrow added that the regulatory environment must remain investor-friendly to ensure the state’s neglected water systems can attract buyers.","Corporate mergers are nothing new; neither is the privatization of public utilities. But thanks to last month’s $40 billion merger announcement of American Water and Essential Utilities (also known as Aqua), the two largest municipal water and wastewater management companies in the U.S., Pennsylvanians are being confronted with what it means to be on the front lines of both trends – at the same time.

Municipalities across the commonwealth, already treading water financially while overseeing aging water and sewer systems, are now fertile ground for private-sector utility companies to acquire local systems in exchange for cash up front.

And while the details of the merger have yet to be determined, according to the press release, the move will allow both companies to “maintain an average customer water bill that is affordable (and support) the economic prosperity of the more than 2,000 communities in which the combined company will operate.”

Consumer advocates, on the other hand, worry what the merger will mean for ratepayers.

“We just don’t know the impact that this acquisition is going to have on utility rates yet, but I would say it doesn’t particularly bode well for consumers to have one mega-utility serving most of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,” Patrick Cicero, of counsel to the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project and a former state consumer advocate, told City & State.

Private eyes

Pennsylvania – one of 15 states to have enacted “fair market value” laws to boost the sale price of water systems, according to the National Association of Water Companies – was already known among water companies and their shareholders as being industry-friendly. Since the passage of Act 12 of 2016, a statewide framework for utility sales, the state has seen even more local water systems acquired by private companies.

According to the Public Utility Commission, 31 privatization cases have been filed since Act 12 took effect, with 25 acquisitions getting approval, three still pending, and three others either withdrawn, rejected or denied. Prior to Act 12’s passage, acquisitions of municipal utilities were relatively infrequent because systems were only allowed to be sold for their depreciated book value, which was not financially attractive to the utility companies and municipalities.

Act 12 mandates that the seller and prospective buyer each select an independent consultant from a group vetted by the state Public Utility Commission – the entity responsible for overseeing more than 150 water utilities statewide, most of which are privately owned.

Consultants for each side have six months to calculate an estimated value of the water system based on its infrastructure, anticipated revenue, and costs for maintenance and improvements necessary to maintain compliance with health and safety regulations.

The acquisition price is then determined by averaging the two estimates, unless the parties agree to a lower price, creating a pathway for higher figures than in deals prior to the passage of Act 12.

With Act 12, the standard deduction for grants and other subsidies used on the systems over the years has been eliminated. At the same time, the system assessments can include income, which wasn’t the case before.

Kimberly Barrow, vice chair of the PUC, said that prior to Act 12, the commission’s review of a potential acquisition was “pretty straightforward,” relying on depreciated original cost – the original cost of the assets minus the total accumulated depreciation – which, she said, is a “tenet of rate-making, historically.”

“Now, instead of looking at the original cost, we’re looking at two figures,” Barrow told City & State. “It’s going to be the negotiated purchase price or it’s going to be the fair market value – the lesser of those two things … That can be completely divorced from the original cost minus depreciation.”

The end result is higher numbers for acquisitions, meaning more cash for municipalities seeking to sell off their assets and address long-term budget and debt obligations. But with higher agreements of sale comes the need for increasing usage rates, which are ultimately paid by residents who rely on the utility.

“By allowing these kinds of valuations to be above original depreciated costs, it’s like (dangling) a carrot,” Barrow said. “It’s a way of getting the investor-owned utilities to actually want to buy them and put the money in.”

While acknowledging the importance of incentivizing prospective buyers to acquire failing or stressed municipal systems, Barrow said Act 12’s unintended consequences could result in rate spikes for low-income communities.

Industry advocates argue that the statute benefits both the municipalities and potential buyers by presenting a more accurate picture of the utility’s value. They say that the previous framework’s valuations resulted in a lower probability that potential buyers would achieve an adequate return on investment.

“For someone to suggest that purchase prices of acquisitions are the main driver of the costs associated with water and wastewater in Pennsylvania is not true,” Thom Chiomento, vice president of business development, government and external affairs at Pennsylvania American Water, told City & State.

Pennsylvania American Water filed a rate adjustment request with the PUC on Nov. 14, saying it will help fund over $1.2 billion in critical infrastructure upgrades through June 2027. The planned upgrades, according to the press release, include eliminating lead service lines by 2037 and replacing 117 miles of aging water mains and 32 miles of aging wastewater mains.

The proposed statewide rate increases would cost around $10 more per month for sewer, $14 more per month for water and $20 per month more for customers of both. If approved, it would be the second increase for the utility’s residential customers this year.

Chiomento added that the large-scale customer service, material procurement and capital a private company can provide are necessary in many municipalities whose water systems are running out of capital.

“It’s not cheap to run these systems and to invest in them and to get them to where they need to be from a compliance and an operational reliability perspective,” Chiomento told City & State. “So in order to do that, we have to invest dollars – and that is reflected in rates.”

Cicero, who pushed back against some water system acquisitions during his time as consumer advocate, argues that the statute “ties the hands” of the Public Utility Commission and leaves little wiggle room for debate over what he calls the “affirmative public benefit” that a sale is supposed to entail.

“We made a mistake with Act 12,” Cicero said. “All that it’s done is inflate the value of systems for these private companies.

“Even if (utility companies) are being magnanimous about going in and trying to make a system better, the rates are going to go up. And although they have modest rate assistance programs, they’re fundamentally inadequate to ensure affordability,” Cicero added, noting that since 2016, water bills – which have risen as much as 166% – have cost commonwealth ratepayers an additional $100 million a year.

Flood gates

Years of pushing infrastructure improvements and repairs down the line has led to many municipal or family-owned water systems developing regulatory and environmental problems, from leaks to chemical exposures that lead to boil-water advisories.

Pennsylvania received a “C-” grade on the 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers report card, with its wastewater management score at the bottom with a “D-.” According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2023 Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey, Pennsylvania is projected to require a $24.3 billion investment over the next two decades to modernize and maintain its drinking water systems.

In some cases, private utility companies needed to step in via receivership to ensure that services continued in local systems, even before an acquisition process began. Companies like American Water or Essential can utilize their existing resources to support the system by providing necessary infrastructure investments.

“Their local governments didn’t have the resources to properly invest in those systems. There was mismanagement on top of that, and those people suffered,” Chiomento told City & State. “People in poor communities tend to suffer when their governments don’t have the ability to invest in them.”

And for many municipally operated systems, the years of neglect coincide with artificially depressed rates because politically unpopular rate increases were also put off.

The combination of these crumbling systems and the regulatory environment created by Act 12 has led to more privatization and, in turn, private investment in struggling systems. For example, Pennsylvania American Water has plans to acquire six different systems in 2025 alone.

“What we bring to the table is, no matter who our customers are or what communities they live in, they get the benefit of our ability to invest,” Chiomento said. “We’re investing in those communities because we’re not bound by their local government’s budget.”

A municipality “may want to simply not (hold on to) the water and wastewater business. They may have municipal debt that they want to retire. They have other needs they want to pursue – all of that makes abundant sense for municipalities,” Cicero said. “The question is whether or not it makes sense at all for the ratepayers of the acquiring utility to pay an excessive cost.”

Chiomento argued that the rate increases are just a sign of the times, pointing out the dire situations many systems are in and the artificially depressed rates municipalities have been charging utility customers over the years.

“When people talk about these big rate increases because of acquisitions, what they’re talking about is the price they were paying before,” he said.

“When we’re acquiring (a municipality’s) customers, rates typically are going up. Why are they in that situation to begin with? Because they’re not charging the cost of service.”

Glass half-full

Harrisburg lawmakers have sought to reform Act 12, but to no avail. Some legislative proposals, including ones to put guardrails on private acquisitions and to cap the acquisition amount at 125% of the depreciated original cost, have been considered in the Capitol and have support from those who say consumers shouldn’t bear the brunt of the infrastructure investments.

State Rep. Robert Matzie, who in 2023 introduced a legislative package during the previous legislative session aimed at reforming Act 12, said the results of the statute have “run far afield of that original intent.”

“(In) almost every instance to date, the municipalities or municipal authorities have exercised the provisions of the Act to sell healthy systems at amounts much greater than their current value,” Matzie said at the time in the co-sponsorship memo. “This has resulted in taxpayers and ratepayers being hit with exorbitant rate increases, with no discernible difference or improvement of service.”

Chiomento said industry stakeholders are “open to any modifications” to the statute, “as long as they improve the process, have a fair evaluation of these systems and they promote public input, transparency, and allow sufficient time for regulatory review.”

He also argued that the PUC – tasked with overseeing these deals and rate cases – exists to ensure that acquisitions like those by Pennsylvania American Water are prudent and reasonable.

Barrow agreed, stating that she’s not worried about “utilities consolidating,” as long as the PUC “is doing its job” and ensuring that customer service remains affordable.

Cicero argues that the PUC needs to do more to ensure rates are equitable across communities and that ratepayers aren’t taking on more of the financial burden than necessary post-acquisition.

“One of the main criticisms I have of the Public Utility Commission is they do not particularly hold utilities accountable on things like returns on equity, which seems problematic to me,” Cicero said, adding that “there has to be an affirmative public benefit” for an acquisition to be approved.

The future of both public and private utilities in the commonwealth will continue to revolve around how water systems can be maintained and invested in while keeping rates reasonable for those using the water services. And now, as they revisit Act 12, lawmakers are expected to wade into the debate over repealing or reforming the statute.

While acknowledging that reforms are needed, Barrow added that the regulatory environment must remain investor-friendly to ensure the state’s neglected water systems can attract buyers.

“There’s a need for something like Act 12, but there’s also a need for some control on it as well,” she said, adding that a cap on the acquisition amount is a possibility. “Some form of a cap (may be necessary) because at the end of the day, it’s ratepayer-supported funds that are being used to buy these systems.”

“It really is a balancing act, and Act 12 has the potential to help a lot of customers, like tens of thousands of customers throughout this commonwealth – it really does,” she told City & State. “We’re trying to do what we can (as the PUC), but we can’t change the act on our own.”",https://cdn.cityandstatepa.com/media/img/cd/2025/12/01/GettyImages_1216844681_Cwieders_headline/open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 12:03:05.782632

The rules, issued just as Americans gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving, expand the loopholes that the EPA announced when it first suspended deadlines without any prior public notice or chance to comment.

Methane is a greenhouse gas 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide over 20 years. These standards are a critical part of cutting the pollution causing climate change, as well as the volatile organic compounds that lead to smog and local air pollution.

The following is a comment from David Doniger, senior strategist at NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council):

“The EPA is giving the worst actors a free pass to pollute.

“Methane leaks are the dumbest kind of pollution because the industry is losing the very product it wants to sell. That’s what made the standards so cost effective: Checking for leaks means the industry has more gas to sell, which is why established companies started plugging their leaks before the EPA mandated it.

“But a few rogue actors refused to get on board, and the Trump administration is catering to them. Those companies get some short-term profits, but neighboring communities will see more smog, more cancer-causing pollutants, and more climate risks.

“Nuclear energy-related expenditures” were added to the latest revision of the government’s framework, published last week, which defines “green projects” eligible for financing. This means funds raised by issuing green gilts or green saving bonds from November 27 this year can be allocated to the development of the controversial technology, which enjoys mixed support among banks.

The move is likely to prove “controversial among environmentalists”, investment bank Jefferies said in a research note.

Historically, most multilateral development banks and other lenders have not included nuclear power generation in the energy projects they finance due to concerns regarding nuclear waste management, inexperience in financing such projects, or high investment costs.

However, the World Nuclear Association maintains that nuclear energy offers a “proven, reliable and low-carbon” solution that complements renewables and strengthens energy security.

At COP28 in 2023, several countries from Europe, the Middle East, the US and Asia endorsed the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy. Last year at the Climate Week NYC conference held in New York, 14 financial institutions, including Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, expressed support for calls to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050, according to the World Nuclear Association.

However, in a research note published in June, Washington DC think-tank the Atlantic Council argued that prolonged construction timelines and high capital costs for nuclear energy projects “may eventually deter” commercial banks from maintaining their support for the technology.

Attitudes towards the controversial technology also appear to be shifting in Europe. In November, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development told The Banker it is open to financing small modular nuclear projects if there is sufficient demand from countries.

Historically the EBRD only focused on nuclear safety and the decommissioning of former Soviet nuclear power plants. However, Odile Renaud-Basso said it is “actively monitoring” private sector demand for small nuclear or modular reactors, which are viewed as a safer and more cost-effective way of generating nuclear energy.

Earlier this year, the World Bank’s board reversed a 60-year-old ban on financing nuclear power, opting instead for an “all of the above” approach to energy projects in poorer countries, including lending for natural gas, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, wind and nuclear power. The change in policy is said to have come after the US political administration applied pressure on the MDB to review its policies.

Announcing its re-entry into the nuclear energy financing space back in June, World Bank president Ajay Banga said “we must help countries deliver reliable, affordable power. That’s why we’re embracing nuclear energy as part of the solution — and re-embracing it as part of the mix the World Bank Group can offer developing countries to achieve their ambitions.”

While some EU countries have opposed the inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU’s flagship green taxonomy, which defines activities considered to be environmentally sustainable, the economic bloc’s General Court recently dismissed a challenge by Austria against the inclusion of nuclear energy and natural gas in the taxonomy.

The court action followed action taken by the European Commission in 2022 to include “certain activities” in the nuclear energy and gas sectors as contributing substantially to reducing the effects of climate change.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/9bd9e905-8850-4d4e-87ca-7ee0455d11d8.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:02:03.769150

Dive Brief:

Electric vehicle charging network operator Ionna plans to invest $250 million to expand public EV charging infrastructure in California over the next three years, the company announced in a Nov. 20 press release.

Ionna, the joint venture of eight major automakers, is currently building out an extensive EV charging network in the U.S. that customers of each OEM can use as a way to promote EV adoption, address the lack of convenient access to public chargers and facilitate long-distance, coast-to-coast travel.

The company recently held kickoff ceremonies in California for its newly opened public chargers in San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose and Westminster, which Ionna says is only “a fraction” of the 1,000 charging bays it’s contracted to install across the state. Nationwide, Ionna plans to install up to 30,000 EV chargers by 2030.

Dive Insight:

Ionna was established in July 2023 as a joint venture between automakers BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis and Toyota. In February, the company announced it was transitioning from its public beta phase to full-scale national rollout of its charging network.

Despite the Dept. of Transportation’s revised guidance for the distribution of federal funding to construct public EV charging infrastructure in the U.S., Ionna continues to expand its network. The company is not reliant on federal funds to construct its charging sites. Instead, its funding comes from private capital.

To promote the newly opened charging sites in California, Ionna launched an “EV Education Program” to teach new EV drivers about the benefits of electric mobility. Following the opening of each new location, Ionna ambassadors partner with local dealerships and EV groups to host an event at the site to demonstrate how easy it is to charge an EV at a Ionna-branded charger.

“This week’s expansion into California is a snapshot of the national momentum IONNA has built in under a year’s time,” said Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, in a statement. “‘IONNA Speed’ isn’t just about how quickly we grow, but also how we deliver, and the IONNA team consistently operates with a driver-first mentality to elevate the charging experience.”

Some flagship Ionna charging sites are referred to as “Rechargeries” and offer amenities such as food and drinks, restrooms and driver lounges to relax in.

Ionna is also rolling out “plug-in and charge” capabilities at its Rechargeries, allowing EV drivers to simply plug in and charge without needing a credit card for payment. Its chargers currently support plug-in and charge functionality for BMW, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz and more recently, Rivian and Ford EVs. Ionna’s plug-in and charge technology will roll out to Honda, Stellantis, Toyota EVs in 2026, per the release.

Last December, Ioanna announced a partnership with c-store operator Sheetz to install chargers at more than 50 of the retailer’s locations by the end of 2026, beginning with Florida.

In July, Ionna announced a new partnership with Pennsylvania-based convenience store chain Wawa, which increased its contracted EV charging hubs to over 3,000 at the time.

(P&GJ) — Clean Energy Fuels Corp. has begun injecting renewable natural gas (RNG) into the interstate pipeline from its newly completed South Fork Dairy facility in Dimmitt, Texas—one of the largest RNG projects in the country.

The $85 million facility, financed entirely by Clean Energy, processes manure from a herd of 17,500 dairy cows to produce about 2.6 million gallons of RNG annually. It uses four anaerobic digesters and advanced gas conversion systems to process up to 300,000 gallons of manure per day, generating pipeline-quality gas for direct injection.

“The requirements to reach production and injecting milestones were extremely stringent and we are incredibly proud of the team for getting our seventh RNG facility online, on time and on budget,” said Clay Corbus, senior vice president at Clean Energy. “The completion of the project at South Fork is particularly special because not only is it a major step forward in building our low-carbon RNG supply to ensure we have the volumes needed to meet the growing fleet demand, but we were able to work side-by-side with such a remarkable dairyman in Frank Brand.”

“Partnering with Clean Energy to build an RNG facility on the dairy has been a success for us,” said Frank Brand, owner of South Fork Dairy. “We’re processing our manure into useful bedding and producing clean, useful fuel for vehicles – it’s pretty amazing stuff.”

Construction of the facility was briefly interrupted by a fire at the dairy, but both the farm and RNG operations have since been rebuilt and are fully operational.

Introduction and Summary

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments for consideration by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) for the Request for Comments on the Section 301 Investigation of China’s Implementation of Commitments under the Phase One Agreement. ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy.

China has failed to meet its commitments under the U.S.-China Phase One Agreement (POA).[1] This agreement sought to address long-standing U.S. concerns about China’s predatory practices by pairing existing tariffs with commitments from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on intellectual property (IP) and technology transfer, foreign investment, and currency practices. It also included a two-year, $200 billion purchase pledge.[2] This filing shows that China failed to meet its commitments across all of these aspects.

China is not a reliable trade partner, as potential commitments to reverse its predatory practices are antithetical to its long-term techno-economic project. This filing first provides evidence of ITIF’s work on Chinese non-market practices by detailing a 2021 ITIF report on China’s failure to meet its commitments under its World Trade Organization (WTO) accession. Then, it succinctly shows ITIF’s work assessing China’s global power project and its playbook of predatory, non-market practices to achieve it. This section concludes with examples of how this project gets translated into building critical sectors and boosting Chinese companies and industries.

The following section details how China failed to meet its purchasing commitments and summarizes ITIF’s recent work on China’s economic espionage and its role in facilitating the entry of counterfeits into the U.S. market.

Finally, the document concludes with recommendations to USTR. First, the current Section 301 investigation will allow the U.S. government to impose tariffs on Chinese manufacturers that continue to benefit from innovation mercantilist practices. Second, ITIF proposes using Section 301 authorities to impose import controls on goods from Entity List companies, exclude IP-infringing companies from the U.S. market, and impose “immediate reciprocity” in sectors where mercantilist practices forcefully limit the U.S. presence in the Chinese market.

Overview: China Is Not a Reliable Partner and It Does Not Intend to Change Its Nonmarket Approach

The Chinese government has a long record of broken promises, promoting nominally fair policies while aggressively imposing nonmarket interventions to support its local industries. The list of deceptive promises and statements is long. For example, in September 2015, in Seattle, Washington, Xi Jinping stated that “the Chinese government will not, in whatever form, engage in commercial theft or encourage or support such attempts by anyone.”[3] In July 2018, the PRC’s State Council released a statement indicating that “China has never had a policy of forcing technology transfers from foreign companies.”[4] Most recently, in April 2025, the Ministry of Commerce stated that China would protect the “legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises in accordance with the law, and actively promote the resolution of foreign-funded enterprises.”[5] These promises are misleading because they commit to doing things (i.e., implementing market-based policies) that are antithetical to the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) project. Indeed, China has clearly failed to fulfill the commitments it made to peer nations as a condition for joining the WTO, especially the promise to manage its trade and economic activities in line with the core WTO principles of national treatment, non-discrimination, and reciprocity.

China’s State-Led Economic Model Stands at Odds With Market Economy Principles

China’s economic success represents a tale of mercantilism and state-driven non-market interventions (including subsidizing overproduction, stealing IP, and forcing technology transfer or foreign direct investment from companies) on the one hand, and complacency and naivety from Western policymakers on the other hand. ITIF’s 2021 report “False Promises II: The Continuing Gap Between China’s WTO Commitments and Its Practices” enumerated 12 high-level examples of how China has systematically and consistently failed to meet its WTO commitments:[6]

▪ Rejecting the WTO’s market orientation. China has never truly embraced the WTO’s core premise of open, market-oriented policies guided by commercial, rather than political, considerations. Instead, Beijing operates a “China Inc.” system in which the party-state routinely intervenes to steer outcomes, undercutting the basic assumption that market forces drive competition.

▪ Defying WTO norms through state-led industrial planning. China’s industrial strategies—exemplified by “Made in China 2025” and a lattice of sectoral plans—explicitly seek absolute advantage in advanced industries by displacing foreign firms at home and expanding Chinese firms’ global market share abroad. These state-directed schemes violate the spirit of WTO rules, which presume that governments will not use industrial planning to rig competitive outcomes in favor of domestic champions.

▪ Continuing prevalence of and preferences for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Contrary to its commitments, China has not reduced the role of state-owned enterprises or ensured that they operate on a purely commercial basis. SOEs continue to receive privileged financing, regulatory forbearance, and preferential access to public procurement and key inputs, distorting competition in both China’s domestic market and global markets.

▪ Massively subsidizing its industries, often leading to overcapacity. Beijing deploys extensive, often opaque subsidies—grants, tax breaks, cheap land, and below-market finance—to accelerate capacity growth in targeted sectors such as steel, aluminum, solar, shipbuilding, autos, semiconductors, and many other sectors. The result is chronic overcapacity that depresses global prices, displaces more efficient producers in market economies, and undermines the WTO’s goal of fair, rules-based competition.

▪ Failing to make timely and transparent notifications of subsidies. China has systematically failed to provide full, timely, and accurate notifications of its subsidy programs, despite clear obligations to do so under WTO rules. This lack of transparency makes it exceedingly difficult for other members to assess the scale and impact of China’s support measures or to challenge them effectively through WTO processes.

▪ Forcing technology transfer and joint venture requirements. Beijing continues to use a mix of formal and informal tools—joint-venture requirements, equity caps, licensing demands, administrative reviews, and regulatory approvals—to coerce foreign firms into transferring technology as the price of market access. These practices violate both the letter and spirit of China’s WTO commitments to refrain from conditioning investment or trade on technology transfer requirements.

▪ Failing to respect foreign IP rights. While China has improved its IP laws on paper, enforcement remains weak, selective, and often politicized, leaving foreign firms exposed to theft and misappropriation of trade secrets, patents, and copyrights. Persistent large-scale IP infringement and limited effective remedies demonstrate that China has not delivered on its obligation to provide robust, non-discriminatory protection for foreign IP.

▪ Abusing antitrust rules. Chinese competition authorities have frequently wielded antitrust law as an industrial-policy tool, targeting foreign firms for investigations, remedies, and fines that appear designed to force technology transfer, lower royalty rates, or advantage domestic rivals. Rather than applying competition rules on a neutral basis, China often uses them to pursue strategic industrial goals inconsistent with WTO expectations.

▪ Imposing discriminatory technology standards. China’s standards system remains heavily state-managed and is frequently used to advance domestic technologies and firms at the expense of foreign competitors. Standards are often developed in closed processes, embed design choices that favor Chinese products, and can be tied to mandatory certification schemes, contravening WTO principles of transparency, non-discrimination, and open participation.

▪ Closing its government procurement to foreign actors. Despite longstanding commitments, China has neither acceded to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement nor provided equivalent market access to foreign competitors. Chinese authorities continue to favor domestic firms—especially SOEs��in procurement decisions, using public purchasing as another lever to bolster national champions and restrict reciprocal opportunities for foreign companies.

▪ Continuing use of service-market access restrictions. China maintains extensive barriers to foreign participation in key service sectors—including finance, telecommunications, cloud computing, audiovisual services, and digital platforms—through equity caps, licensing hurdles, and other entry restrictions. These measures fall far short of the openness implied by China’s WTO commitments and deny foreign providers meaningful, non-discriminatory access.

▪ Using retaliatory trade remedies. Beijing has repeatedly used antidumping, countervailing duty, and other trade-remedy investigations in ways that appear retaliatory rather than grounded in objective economic analysis. Such actions are aimed at pressuring trading partners and deterring legitimate complaints about Chinese practices, further eroding confidence in the WTO’s rules-based system.

China’s Development Playbook Is at Odds With What It Committed to Under the Phase One Agreement

ITIF’s November 2025 report “Marshaling National Power Industries to Preserve America’s Strength and Thwart China’s Bid for Global Dominance,” among other topics, outlines China’s strategy for techno-economic dominance.[7] The PRC is executing a coordinated, state-directed campaign across “national power industries”—advanced, traded sectors that underpin military strength and geostrategic leverage—to attempt to attain hegemony over Western democracies. This scheme is inseparable from a durable, non-market playbook built around heavy subsidization and systematic distortion of competition. China follows a predictable strategy across industries: attract foreign investment, coerce tech transfer and steal foreign IP, provide massive subsidies, close domestic markets, and then capture global market share.[8]

The report succinctly outlines the Chinese Communist Party’s playbook:

The first step is to attract foreign investment. (...) China is still trying to do that today with emerging industries, seeking, for example, to attract global biopharmaceutical companies to build facilities in China. China’s second step is to attempt to learn from foreign companies, in part by having them train Chinese executives, scientists, and engineers, and also by forced technology transfer, including through joint ventures. (...) The third step is to support Chinese companies in their efforts to copy and incorporate foreign technology while building up domestic capabilities. (...) The fourth step is to enable Chinese firms to become independent innovators. (...) The Chinese market essentially becomes dominated by Chinese-owned firms. We have seen this an array of industries, including chemicals, telecom equipment, heavy construction equipment, high-speed rail, and renewable energy.[9]

In addition, the CCP integrates technological security into the PRC’s broader national security framework, blurring the line between economic and military statecraft. ITIF’s February 2025 report, “A Policymaker’s Guide to China’s Technology Security Strategy,” describes China’s three-tiered approach to achieve technology security.[10] First, China aims to preserve and fortify its existing competitive advantages, using industrial upgrading, its dense supply chains, and non-market interventions to lock-in global leadership in advanced manufacturing sectors such as electronics, solar, and electric vehicle (EV) batteries Secondly, the PRC is focused on rapidly closing critical technology gaps, especially in chokepoint inputs such as semiconductors, by pouring state resources into import substitution and self-reliance. Third, the Chinese government uses unrestricted access to large pools of data from its population to achieve dominance in emerging technologies, such as AI and other frontier technologies, to shape global standards and outpace competitors over the long term.[11]

How the PRC Uses Non-Market Policies to Gain an Advantage in Strategic Sectors

ITIF’s work since 2020, the year of the POA’s signing, has accumulated substantial evidence of China’s non-market approach to gain an advantage in strategic industries—at the detriment of U.S. and Western companies.

China Supports Its EV Producers to Underprice Competitors in Global Markets

ITIF’s September 2025 report, “Don’t Let Chinese EV Makers Manufacture in the United States,” shows China’s aggressive use of a range of mercantilist practices to advance in the EV market.[12] These non-market interventions include:

▪ Subsidies, totaling over $230 billion between 2009 and 2023, with an estimated $120 billion across 2021–2023 alone.

▪ Forced technology transfer and IP theft. For example, GM’s Volt model could qualify for subsidies only if the company was willing to “transfer the engineering secrets for one of the Volt’s three main technologies to a joint venture in China with a Chinese automaker.”[13] Other examples include forcing the hiring of Chinese engineers to establish a Ford research and development (R&D) facility in China, and Tesla suing a Chinese chip designer for infringing on its IP and stealing its trade secrets, both related to the integrated circuits it uses in its vehicles.[14]

▪ Favoring domestic companies. For example, Made in China 2025 included a local market share target for local producers, and most recently, local authorities have instructed Chinese automakers to avoid foreign semiconductors if at all possible.[15]

China Is Supporting the Overproduction of Polysilicon to Secure Global Dominance

ITIF’s September 2025 report, “China Plans to Dominate a Key Semiconductor Material,” describes the mechanisms by which the PRC’s government incentives, support, and massive overcapacity are flooding the global polysilicon market—a critical chipmaking material.[16] China’s interventions include financial subsidies and incentives, infrastructure and land support, and strategic national plans. China supports polysilicon overproduction and simultaneously helps producers offset the low prices it drives.[17]

The artificial decline in global prices created by the Chinese government’s intervention undermines the viability of U.S. polysilicon producers. While some estimates set the fair market price for polysilicon at $24/kg, Chinese firms are selling at approximately $5/kg, about $1 below their production cost.[18] This dumping cost Chinese producers $40 billion in 2024. This directly impacts U.S. producers. For example, Wolfspeed—a silicon carbide producer headquartered in North Carolina—closed two facilities in the United States in 2024 and postponed an expansion in Germany.

China Helped Huawei to Subsist Despite U.S. Sanctions

ITIF’s October 2025 report, “Backfire: Export Controls Helped Huawei and Hurt U.S. Firms,” describes how Huawei received support from the Chinese government to offset the export controls the United States imposed on the company since 2019.[19] Before these restrictions, Huawei had already received $75 billion in state support since its establishment. After the export controls, the Chinese government’s support for the company was manifested in three main ways:

▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls, such as the $15 billion acquisition of Honor, a budget-brand maker and former Huawei subsidiary, by a consortium of private and state-backed investors. This sale provided liquidity to Huawei and helped Honor avoid U.S. export controls.

▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies, for example, the 2021 announcement that the Chinese state-owned China Mobile would acquire 60 percent of 5G network station contracts from Huawei.

▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives, such as receiving an R&D tax incentive for semiconductors, which acts as a de facto subsidy by allowing a 220 percent deduction from the company’s taxable income. (Tax incentives are appropriate tools to facilitate semiconductor-industry competitiveness, but they should be made available equally to any foreign company competing in a country’s marketplace; yet, the subsidies extended to Huawei and other Chinese national champions were unique and exclusive.)

China Confers an Unfair Advantage to Its E-commerce Platforms

China has expanded globally through its international-facing e-commerce platforms, especially Temu, SHEIN, AliExpress, and TikTok Shop. As documented in ITIF’s April 2025 report “How China’s State-Backed E-Commerce Platforms Threaten American Consumers and U.S. Technology Leadership,” China’s government uses a coordinated industrial policy architecture to benefit these platforms through subsidized logistics, tax exemptions, talent recruitment programs, and state-directed financing through cross-border e-commerce pilot zones.[20] These industrial policies are not widely available to foreign competitors and sharply reduce Chinese platforms’ marginal costs of shipping, warehousing, marketing, and customer acquisition. China also deploys regulatory shields that suppress compliance obligations at home, enabling its national champions to achieve lower operating costs than any U.S. or allied-market platform could legally achieve.

These state-backed cost advantages translate into aggressive, predatory penetration of the U.S. market at prices that no market-based firm can realistically match. China’s industrial policy, which aims (as in many other industries) to gain global market share in e-commerce, also pushes its platforms to exploit gaps in U.S. regulations to reduce costs relative to domestic competitors. This raises consumer protection concerns by externalizing product-safety, data-security, and compliance risks onto American consumers, as seen with Temu’s September 2025 penalty for violating the INFORM Consumers Act.[21]

China Failed to Meet Its Commitments Under the Phase One Agreement

The POA included essential commitments by the PRC, as well as provisions related to IP, technology transfer, foreign investment and acquisitions, and currency.[22] The Chinese government has failed to fulfill any of these commitments. This section will outline how China failed to meet its purchasing commitments to reduce the trade imbalance with the United States and present further evidence of the PRC’s tolerance for IP infringement. While the previous section explained how the PRC permits technology transfer and manipulates foreign investments to benefit its EV companies, this section will provide further examples of forced technology transfer. Finally, regarding China’s currency commitments, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has consistently reported that “China provides very limited transparency regarding key features of its exchange rate mechanism, including the policy objectives of its exchange rate management regime and its activities in the offshore RMB market.”[23]

China Failed to Meet Its Purchasing Commitments

China agreed to purchase at least $200 billion worth of goods above a 2017 sectoral baseline across 2020 and 2021, but it only procured a fraction of that amount.[24] The purchasing commitments implied that China should have purchased $32 billion more in agricultural products, $52.4 billion in energy, $77.7 billion in manufactured goods, and $37.9 billion more in services.[25] However, China failed to meet its own purchasing commitments. By 2020, it had already fallen short of this commitment by 40 percent, and by 2021, it had met only 58 percent of the overall target.[26]

Figure 1 shows U.S. exports to China based on the POA purchasing commitments by sector. China focused on expanding its purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, but reached only 83 percent of the agreed amount. Additionally, U.S. exports to China declined by 6 percent during 2020–2021 for goods not covered under the POA.

China Continues to Infringe Upon American Intellectual Property

The PRC’s commitments regarding improving IP protection mechanisms include reforming internal mechanisms to address the U.S. government’s concerns regarding trade secrets, pharmaceutical-related IP, geographical indications, trademarks, and enforcement against pirated and counterfeit goods.[28] However, the PRC’s attempts to steal U.S. technologies persist unabated. In addition to the cases of IP infringement in EV markets described in the previous section, USTR has consistently reported China’s lack of IP enforcement, including Chinese companies and markets in the Notorious Markets List report, classifying China as part of the Priority Watch List in its 2025 Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement, and describing China’s predatory, non-market practices in its annual Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance.[29]

China’s IP protection system still lacks transparency and fair treatment for foreign actors in courts. It is inherently difficult to quantify potential bias against foreign-owned firms in China’s IP system due to limited transparency and weak accountability—in many cases, the quality and performance of China’s IP-related institutions cannot be independently verified.[30] China’s refusal to publish a complete record of relevant cases appears intended to impede independent analysis and monitoring of its implementation of IP-related commitments, including those under the POA and other bilateral and multilateral accords.[31]

China treats IP protection as a tool to advance its techno-economic objectives. For example, global anti-suit injunctions (ASIs) in China—which uniquely target foreign companies—help local companies to reduce the cost of foreign technology and patents in support of its industrial policy goals.[32] These ASIs aim to bar foreign courts from hearing disputes that could affect a Chinese court’s ability to set a global licensing rate for patented technologies. In many instances, they have been issued without notice to the affected party and without a subsequent publication, exacerbating already serious transparency concerns—and the Chinese law provides no effective mechanisms to challenge the courts’ assertion of jurisdiction.[33]

In addition, there exists a long history of inequitable patent-granting practices between domestic and foreign filers in China, and allegations that official data is biased because it omits unpublished cases.[34] While, on the surface, Chinese and foreign patent litigants in China have, on average, a similar win rate in court, there are clear differences in win rates regarding strategic technologies. For instance, between 2015 and 2019, foreign pharmaceutical patentees prevailed in only 36 percent of China Patent Reexamination Board (PRB) validity challenges, compared with 59 percent for Chinese applicants.[35] Similar gaps appear across other technology fields, including biotechnology (21 percent for foreign versus 48 percent for Chinese applicants) and environmental technologies (25 percent versus 40 percent, respectively).[36]

In addition to outlining existing evidence, this sub-section presents ITIF’s work on China’s economic espionage and on how Chinese digital platforms facilitate the entry of counterfeits into the U.S. market.

China Deploys Economic Espionage Campaigns Against the United States

In November 2025, ITIF’s report “From Outside Assaults to Insider Threats: Chinese Economic Espionage” outlined China’s campaign of economic espionage against the United States and American companies.[37] The report describes how China’s espionage ecosystem—from state intelligence agencies to nominally private firms—coordinated to steal U.S. industrial and defense technologies. This study highlights how Chinese companies (and academic researchers) operating in the United States serve as knowledge-collection platforms and how China turns engineers and researchers within U.S. firms into conduits for trade secrets.

Chinese actors have used a variety of methods to steal information from American companies.[38] As the report explains, “several Chinese economic espionage cases have involved the persistent penetrations of U.S. companies, rather than individuals’ illegally facilitated changes in career, which are uniquely damaging. They provide opportunities for PRC entities to remain current on developments within the U.S. industry rather than simply acquire increasingly stale stolen material.”[39] Another mechanism used by Chinese actors includes “breaking and entering” techniques, such as China’s use of academic institutions as cover for intelligence activities; active campaigns to hire individuals working for U.S. companies to transfer information from their private sector employers to Chinese entities; and using U.S.-based organizations to recruit expertise from which it then siphons trade secrets and other protected information.[40]

China Facilitates the Flow of Counterfeits Into the United States

As detailed in ITIF’s August 2025 report “How Chinese Online Marketplaces Fuel Counterfeits,” Chinese e-commerce platforms are a primary vector for counterfeit, unsafe, and IP-infringing goods entering the United States.[41] These platforms’ business models—and the industrial policy environment they operate in—fail to effectively enforce counterfeit sales by not adequately identifying and suspending probable counterfeits, allowing them to remain listed and accumulate significant sales. Coupled with China’s reluctance to pursue enforcement against counterfeiters serving foreign markets, this has created a pipeline through which counterfeit cosmetics, apparel, pharmaceuticals, and children’s products enter the United States at scale.[42]

This means that U.S. and other rights holders face widespread infringement with almost no recourse, while U.S. consumers are exposed to serious product safety hazards.[43] China’s government has failed to implement the Phase One IP commitments it made on enforcement against counterfeit goods, namely to “take effective action against e-commerce platforms that fail to take necessary measures against infringement” and to “significantly increase actions to stop the manufacture and distribution of counterfeits with significant health or safety risks.”[44]

China Continues to Force Technology Transfer on Foreign Investors

The POA did not change the direction or intention of the Chinese government’s treatment of foreign investors, as forced technology transfer remains a common practice in advanced industries investing in the Chinese market. USTR’s report “Four-Year Review of China Tech Transfer Section 301” already provides exhaustive evidence that Chinese forced technology transfer and pressures to force joint ventures with local companies persist after signing the POA.[45] This has also been reported by ITIF—in addition with the cases of technology transfer in the EV sector aforementioned.

For example, a 2022 ITIF testimony to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission documented how China requires cloud-computing operations to be locally controlled.[46] As a result, providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft must operate through Chinese partners, sell services under the Chinese partner’s brand, and share technology and operational know-how as part of these arrangements.[47] By contrast, Chinese cloud providers such as Aliyun—the cloud-services arm of Alibaba—are free to establish data centers in the United States without facing comparable ownership or technology-transfer requirements.

Policy Recommendations

ITIF will soon be releasing a major report that details a comprehensive policy response to China’s ongoing innovation mercantilisma and efforts to expand its global presenence in national power industries. Here, ITIF offers several policy recommendations pertinent to addresing China’s non-compliance with the POA.

The U.S. government should expand its authority to impose Section 301-related tariffs on Chinese goods that continue to benefit from the use of innovation mercantilist practices. USTR already has broad authority, under the ongoing Section 301 action on China’s technology-transfer and IP practices, to maintain and modify tariffs in response to China’s continued non-market behavior.[48] The current Section 301 investigation into China’s commitments under the POA would allow the U.S. government to impose a broader set of tariffs, including all the manufacturing products that are detailed in the agreement’s purchasing commitments. The scope of the current investigation should allow expanding the authority to impose tariffs on all Chinese imports beneffiting from unfair trade practices—which would be critical to improving the U.S. government’s negotiating position for future revisions to the trade deal with China.

Regarding controls on imports of Chinese goods benefitting from unfair trade practices, the U.S. government should seek to expand its authority through executive and Congressional action to:

▪ Ban importing goods from Chinese companies on the Entity List. Today, it is possible to purchase goods from the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei via resellers, including telecommunication equipment for private use, despite the company being listed in the Entity List since 2019. The presence of a company on the Entity List reflects the U.S. government’s view that it has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States, and exporting goods or technologies to the company is restricted. USTR should close this loophole and fully ban these companies from the U.S. market.

▪ Ban all imports and U.S. presence of companies that have been involved in systematic or deliberate theft of American IP. While legislative action is needed to strengthen Section 337 of the Tariff Act—so the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) can more systematically exclude imports from China that benefit from unfair practices, including IP theft and other innovation mercantilist tools—the U.S. government already has other levers it can use against offending firms, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases that raise tariffs on unfairly traded goods and, in appropriate circumstances, financial sanctions administered by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control that can cut off access to U.S. dollar transactions. Where warranted, he U.S. government should explore using Section 301 authorities to impose broader import restrictions.

▪ Collaborate with like-minded allied nations to craft “a bill of particulars” that comprehensively enumerates China’s unfair trade practices impacting especially allied countries’ advanced industry sectors.[49]

▪ Expand efforts to forge a “Seven Eyes”-like alliance among key allies to exchange information about China’s industrial espionage activities impacting allied countries’ advanced industry sectors.

▪ Work with allied countries to have them implement Section 337-like legislation that would likewise permit them to wholesale block imports from Chinese companies that consistently use unfair trade practices.

▪ Use Section 301 authorities to enforce “immediate reciprocity.” USTR should consider using the 301 import control powers to address Chinese sectors that restrict or limit access for foreign competitors. A clear example of this is digital platforms for social media, where U.S. companies are barred from entering the Chinese market. If there are clear instances where U.S. firms are being wholesale blocked from competing in China’s market, then the United States should impose the same conditions on Chinese firms that would compete in the U.S. market.

▪ Utilize existing Treasury Department authorities to sanction Chinese companies benefitting from stolen IP or coerced technology transfer. Chinese firms that are stealing IP should be banned from accessing the U.S. banking and financial system.[50]

Additional policy measures for consideration.

▪ Ramp up efforts to limit Chinese cyber-IP theft and espionage. More needs to be done to limit Chinese IP theft. The next administration should work with Congress to pass legislation increasing criminal penalties for such actions. Its next budget should include a sizeable increase for the FBI’s Office of Commercial Counterintelligence.[51]

▪ Increase federal efforts to disrupt the global flow of counterfeits. Chinese counterfeit goods jeopardize U.S. consumer safety, erode public confidence, reduce U.S. jobs, and unfairly support Chinese economic growth. The government unfortunately struggles to stop many counterfeit shipments. To address this problem, the next administration should increase the Customs and Border Protection budget and appoint a director who will collaborate with private-sector stakeholders, including brand sellers, online marketplaces, and shippers, to establish real-time information sharing and analytics about potential counterfeit shipments that would allow them to better detect and seize more imported counterfeits.

▪ Increase criminal penalties for techno-economic espionage committed against U.S. firms. For too long, economic espionage has been treated as simply a commercial crime as opposed to a national security crime. With China laser focused on stealing as much core advanced technology information and knowledge as possible from the United States in order to gain global leadership and use in its civil-military fusion, it’s time for that to end.[52]

▪ Better prosecute trade crime, especially transshipment and misclassification. Chinese companies are masters at getting around trade rules, including exporting products to a country for transshipment to the United States as a way to circumvent U.S. tariffs. Often the amount of value added contributed in the third country is de minimis. Yet, this is seldom prosecuted. Congress should pass and fully fund the Protecting American Industry and International Trade Crimes Act that, among other elements, expands DOJ resources to prosecute trade crime.[53]

▪ Assess the impact of foreign unfair trade practices, especially China’s, on the long-term health of the U.S. industrial base. China’s mercantilist trade practices have contributed substantially to a hollowing out of the U.S. manufacturing base, including the U.S. defense industrial base. For this reason, ITIF supports the “America First Trade Policy’s” call for the secretaries of Commerce and Defense to “conduct a full economic and security review of the United States’ industrial and manufacturing base to assess whether it is necessary to initiate investigations to adjust imports that threaten the national security of the United States.”[54]

In a marketplace where range is one of the most significant factors influencing consumers, battery health is a major concern.

The battery is the single most valuable component in the vehicle, often representing 30-40% of the total manufacturing cost. That makes its long-term health an important part of the ownership equation. Where internal-combustion components tend to degrade gradually and predictably, lithium-ion cells follow chemical aging pathways that are heavily influenced by a myriad of variables. Considerations like charging habits, thermal exposure, cell chemistry, and vehicle-level energy management all influence cell capacity retention, and, therefore, car value.

High-voltage fast charging, for example, exposes cells to elevated temperatures and higher current densities, which can cause wear in some chemistries. Conversely, vehicles with conservative charging algorithms and liquid cooling tend to preserve capacity far more effectively over time.

User behavior and environment also impact cell life. That’s why two vehicles with the same odometer reading can have dramatically different states of health. A pack that has spent years in a mild climate, routinely charged between 20% and 80%, will age very differently from one that is repeatedly fast-charged to 100% in extreme heat or cold.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt85bc1d52d5beda31/674fc18c351f9a3c9ba42086/22478_2025_Niro_EV.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:11.134787

Americans bought 438,500 electric cars and trucks in the third quarter, as drivers raced to grab federal incentives before they expired Sept. 30.

Those transactions, the highest number in a single quarter, comprised 11% of all new car sales, eclipsing the previous high point of 8.7%, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company.

A crowd of more affordable cars next year could help maintain the momentum, but analysts expect EV transactions to dip in the months ahead without federal tax credits.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Director of Industry Insights, said in a report EVs could account for one quarter of all new US car sales by 2030. That’s “well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the ‘niche’ category.”

The sales tally underscores a tricky dynamic for auto executives and clean-air advocates: Millions of Americans want electric vehicles, but relatively high prices remain a speed bump to adoption.

Tesla Inc. still dominates the US market for EVs and managed a small sales gain in the recent quarter after months of skidding results. However, a crowd of rivals is closing the gap quickly, shrinking Tesla’s share of the EV pie to 41% from 80% four years ago.

General Motors Co., in particular, is gaining electric speed. The company captured 15% of EV sales in the quarter, led by its new Chevrolet Equinox, the third best-selling battery-powered machine. That’s up from 10% in the year-earlier period.

Nearly half of US EV purchases in the first half of the year were made without any federal incentive, according to BloombergNEF. And there are now at least 11 EVs in the US with starting prices below that of the average car purchase. Chevrolet’s Equinox can be had for about $35,000, for example, and the brand just released a new version of its Bolt with a price tag of $29,000.

Emily Almaer, a mother of three in Boulder, Colo, is paying $250 a month for the Volkswagen ID.4 she picked up in August. At least three of her friends also recently ponied up for EVs: another Volkswagen, a Nissan Leaf and a Hyundai Ioniq 9.

“You look at some of these [monthly payments],” her husband, Dion Almaer, said, “and it’s like ‘Wait, this is like one family meal out.’”

The road ahead for EVs, however, looks rocky, at least for a little while. Without federal credits, BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago. In the current quarter, S&P Global expects EVs to comprise less than 7% of new car sales.

“The affordability issue is going to be exacerbated,” said Peter Nagle, an associate director at S&P. “It’s really going to be a sink or swim moment.”

Meanwhile, the market for used EVs is booming and more affordable EV models are heading to production. BloombergNEF expects at least nine new electric cars and trucks priced below $40,000 in the next three years.

Volvo Car AB Chief Executive Officer and President Hakan Samuelsson said his company will take a “huge step” next year in offering EVs with longer driving ranges and lower prices.

“The industry will be electric — there’s no turning back,” he told Bloomberg recently. “It may take a bit longer in some regions, but the direction is clear.”

The genesis of early farming is even thought to have resulted from a shift in seasonal conditions that favored regular planting and harvesting intervals after the last ice age.

In the modern era, the necessity to adapt has led to expansive land use, fertilization, irrigation, and other agricultural routines—powered primarily by combusted carbon and freshwater extractions—to suit local environmental conditions and meet demands of growing populations. These practices have been a boon to food supplies, but they have also contributed to many of today’s climatic and environmental challenges.

Recognition of global crises with respect to climate change and biodiversity has motivated landmark international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework. The Paris Agreement legally binds participating nations to implement land use methods that mitigate emissions and actively remove carbon from the atmosphere.

One such set of modified land management practices, known collectively as climate-smart agriculture [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025], is lauded as a pragmatic, low-barrier pathway to manage climate change through nature-based atmospheric carbon removal and avoided emissions (related to both land use and livestock). However, these practices have primarily been studied in small, controlled experiments, not at the extent needed to verify their effectiveness—and help motivate their adoption—on a large scale.

Recently, soil carbon experts explored the utility of applying causal approaches to quantify soil carbon accrual and avoided emissions from large-scale land management interventions and to address concerns and uncertainties that are slowing their uptake [Bradford et al., 2025a]. Such approaches have long been applied in other contexts to measure and verify treatment efficacy. In particular, methods in medical science for studying vaccine efficacy broadly offer important insights for assessing climate-smart applications.

Accounting for Carbon

Climate-smart agriculture includes a variety of management practices such as cover cropping (planting noncash crops on otherwise fallow land), reducing or eliminating soil tilling, and diversifying crops. These applications can offer various cobenefits, including increased yields; greater soil water holding capacity; improved soil microbiomes; reduced erosion and runoff; enhanced control of pests, disease, and weeds; and greater soil nutrient availability that reduces the need for chemical fertilizers [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025].

Such benefits are linked to the idea that the applications either avoid losses or improve gains in soil organic matter. But can we measure how much they really help?

To account for carbon lost, gained, or stored in agricultural land, soil organic matter is typically measured by elemental analysis of soil samples in a laboratory. Amounts of carbon stored are determined by tracking changes in soil carbon stocks over time. Comparing results following the application of climate-smart agriculture approaches with those following business-as-usual practices provides a measure of the approaches’ effectiveness for carbon management.

Assuming this carbon accounting reveals increased soil carbon stocks, agricultural projects implementing these approaches can be considered natural climate solutions, which are valued in the voluntary carbon market for their carbon offset and removal power. For example, one project developer selling carbon credits since 2022 recently reported that their efforts have so far stored nearly 1 million tons of soil carbon in U.S. farmlands. Further, across farms in four U.S. states, the combined use of three climate-smart agriculture techniques—no tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation of corn and soybeans—is claimed to have resulted in a shift to carbon gains from soil carbon loss using conventional practices [U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2025].

Limited Evidence, Low Adoption

Despite claims about the successes of climate-smart agricultural practices, adoption remains low. Although no-till and reduced-till methods have been implemented on more than half of all U.S. soybean, corn, and sorghum fields, cover cropping is used across less than 5% of the country’s agricultural lands.

A multitude of social, cultural, and economic factors—along with questions about the viability for meaningful climate change mitigation—contribute to the limited adoption of some climate-smart practices [Prokopy et al., 2019; Eagle et al., 2022]. However, if robust data showing that they lead to widespread yield increases, cost reductions, and climate benefits were available, they might be more widely adopted by growers.

Presently, most evidence supporting the benefits of climate-smart agriculture for carbon management relies on a limited set of small-plot experimental trials and projected outcomes derived from applying process-based biogeochemical models. Public and private investment in studies aimed at quantifying the practices’ efficacy through measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) at scales of real-world commercial agriculture has been inhibited by the assumption that soils vary too much to measure treatment effects feasibly [Poeplau et al., 2022].

This assumption is driven by the fact that regional and national soil carbon inventories reveal substantial variation in soil carbon contents at scales within individual fields (meters to tens of meters) and between fields (kilometers to tens of kilometers)—variation that is thought to preclude detections of how agricultural practices affect carbon stocks [Bradford et al., 2023]. Yet this variability can be overcome by scaling up field-level data to multifield scales focused on understanding the average effect of interventions.

What could this scaling look like, and what cues from other fields can we use to make progress?

Adapting Methods from Medical Research

Causal approaches are used regularly in health sciences, including in vaccine trials. In later-stage trials, vaccine efficacy is quantified under conditions approximating real-world delivery by measuring the differences in the health responses of people who receive the vaccine and those who do not.

Importantly, such real-world trials occur only after there is enough experimental evidence—typically from controlled laboratory experiments and small-scale clinical trials—of underlying mechanisms indicating the likelihood of broad, meaningful positive effects and minimal negative effects of the vaccine. Public health scientists use these large-scale clinical intervention-style experiments (or observational studies) to account for factors such as varied exposure risks and preexisting conditions that can modify real-world vaccine efficacy compared with efficacy under controlled conditions.

Earth scientists can take direction from such trials. Adapting this experiment structure for soil science research would allow project developers, scientists, land managers, and policymakers to assess the ability of climate-smart agricultural practices to store carbon and reduce emissions across real fields and farms. It would also better inform meaningful climate action policy initiatives.

A base of highly controlled small-scale experiments—typically conducted in plots operated by researchers—already exists that suggests the carbon benefits of improved agricultural practices under highly controlled conditions. What is missing are the large-scale intervention studies sampling soil carbon in fields that receive a climate-smart treatment (e.g., no till or reduced till, crop rotation, cover cropping) versus those that are conventionally managed [Bradford et al., 2025b].

Such studies must be undertaken with appropriate design principles to confirm whether treatment interventions cause measured carbon gains and to focus on the external validity of the experiments. In the case of climate-smart agriculture, “external validity” refers to the extent to which a study’s results are applicable to other fields receiving similar management interventions. Achieving external validity necessitates sustained observation of realistic intervention behaviors on working commercial farms and on well-defined and preserved control fields, repetition of experiments at a variety of sites, and quantification of average outcomes from interventions across fields rather than for individual fields.

New research suggests that empirical measure-and-remeasure projects are scientifically feasible at regional agricultural scales using current best practices for soil sampling and carbon analysis [Potash et al., 2025; Bradford et al., 2023]. Potash et al. [2025], for example, simulated a randomized-controlled trial for intervention projects across hundreds to thousands of fields, incorporating known variations in soil carbon stocks and measurement errors. The results showed that such projects can reliably estimate the effects of the treatments applied.

Using causal empirical approaches can complement, rather than compete with, the development of other approaches for MMRV of carbon storage and emissions. Approaches using satellite and airborne remote sensing may, for example, enable more efficient scaling of climate mitigation projects, albeit only if they are first validated against causal empirical data.

Empirical causal studies at the regional scales of commercial agricultural practices should thus be the gold standard of evidence for evaluating the effectiveness of climate-smart approaches. Data from these experiments will provide a rigorous basis for independent validation of established and emerging digital- and model-based approaches for soil carbon MMRV. They will also build confidence that adopting climate-smart practices really does result in mitigation of carbon emissions and climate change under real-world conditions.

Morgan chimes in Texas Roadhouse collected back-to-back softball titles, including an undefeated season, over the past four years.","Texas Roadhouse founder Kent Taylor had a flair for testing those he believed in. He was a factfinder. He’d share books, poll employees on their contemporaries, and drop hints about what he might be considering. But what Taylor concluded was often a mystery.

Before his passing in March 2021, when Taylor took his own life following a battle with post-COVID-19 symptoms, including severe tinnitus, he had started to read books on founders and their leadership transitions. Namely, three in particular—the stories behind Home Depot, Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, and “My Father’s Business,” which gets into the change at Dollar General.

Travis Doster, Texas Roadhouse’s chief communications officer, recalls Taylor one day asking him to send these books to a rising executive in Jerry Morgan, who was named president in mid-December 2020. He didn’t want Morgan to know why he was receiving them or be tipped off his boss might be paying attention. “Because when I come to town,” Doster says of Taylor’s instructions, “I’m going to switch books with him.”

“I immediately called Jerry and told him to buy a highlighter and write in the book,” Doster adds with a laugh.

Taylor loved to jot notes in pencil and blue erasable pen on graph paper. If you’re wondering if those relic pens are still easily found, his longtime assistant, Shelly McGowen, purchased “like 10,000 of them” years ago, Doster says. Employees often bantered of Taylor’s preference, “nothing says permanent decisions like an erasable pen.”

What Taylor was hoping to uncover, though, was how Morgan would process information and how much he’d study. He had inclinations the company’s 2001 Managing Partner of the Year, who rose to regional market partner in 2015, overseeing more than 120 Texas Roadhouses in 14 states, was the right person for a weighty job—his successor.

It’ll soon be coming on five years since Morgan became just that. Like others, he had a feeling Taylor was trying to telegraph the plan without fully saying it. The conversation was going on, in one respect or another, Morgan says, for a few years. He knew the store side. There was little doubt there, and Taylor understood operators were comfortable with that kind of hands-on resume.

Morgan was one of Taylor’s famed “crazies,” or store leaders who broke convention at times to make sales happen. Taylor boasted a rebellious spirit himself, going back to Bennigan’s in the 1980s and even KFC, where he used to tell stories of tweaking recipes and selling bottled water when his bosses asked him not to.

Morgan worked at Texas Roadhouse for 25 years and was known to spend hours weighing his store’s steaks and tasting each menu item.

He landed in Louisville, Kentucky, on December 17, 2020, and was announced publicly as president, donning a baseball cap and a three-quarter Texas Roadhouse zip-up.

Taylor didn’t offer Morgan any timeline or assurances. He was there to learn how corporate connected with unit-level performance; to host one-on-ones, and get to know leaders through various functions.

“I knew how to make a restaurant open, operate, and close quality shifts, and to hire great people and partners,” Morgan says. “But how did the other side work? I had made numerous trips over the years, but I didn’t know how it all came together.”

The learning period lasted four months. When Taylor passed, there was a memorial service, a Founder’s Day to ideate, museum to plan, statue to erect, and other theater-of-grief tasks that have a way of pausing time. Taylor had led Texas Roadhouse for 28-and-a-half years. Morgan says many folks, himself included, saw Taylor as the Norman Brinker of our time. “The one guy who could really get a chain to be highly successful and was still leading it,” he says. “And so, we just saw Kent and revered him in that manner.”

Naturally, there was a stretch of days and weeks trying to digest events and, for Morgan, accept responsibility. On this end, Taylor made his instructions clearer than usual.

He tore out a legal sheet piece of paper and wrote, in blue ink, Jerry Morgan (CEO). Taylor, 65 years old at the time, signed and dated it 3-18-2021—the day he died.

McGowen had the sheet framed and, to this day, Morgan keeps it in his office as a reminder of his stewardship.

He recalls sitting in meetings during emotionally charged days and leaders asking, “is a decision made?”

“OK, well, now who’s going to present it to Kent?”

Morgan realized everyone needed time. The process at Texas Roadhouse was so ingrained that habits had to unwind. So Morgan asked Doster to help him draft a “promise letter.”

The company-wide communication was, Morgan says, him “really accepting the job” and assuming the task of leading one of the world’s most successful casual-dining chains.

“When I looked at that whole piece of it, he gave me the job, but the day I wrote the letter and made a promise to the company was when I accepted the responsibility to be their leader,” he says. “And from that moment, I just moved forward.”

A leader in the making, and learning on the job

Growing up in Sarasota, Florida, Morgan was a 6-foot, 145-pound tight end/defensive lineman who learned a couple of early lessons before he reached his 20s: One, he was more interested in football than anything else, and, secondly, he also needed half a foot and another 50 pounds to compete. So, he was realistic.

One thing Morgan didn’t want to do, however, was get into restaurants or grocery stores. He felt the sectors didn’t garner the respect they deserved, and he wouldn’t, either, if he made it a career. Morgan received his first taste of retail and customer service in the garden center of now-defunct discount department store Woolco. After, he moved to Houston, Texas, to join his dad and uncle. He worked for Telesphere, a company installing long-distance dialers in hotels across America. Morgan did so for a couple of years until his uncle, a local lawyer, told him a story. He was doing legal work for an operator who owned 10 McDonald’s and “couldn’t believe how much money this guy was making.” He went and got a franchise partnership and bought two Burger Kings in Waco, Texas, and asked Morgan to come along. Morgan cleared the idea with his dad.

What he found was restaurants didn’t feel all that different from sports. He enjoyed the frenetic shifts, teamwork, and reality silver spoons aren’t handed out for free in this business. The ladder to success is accessible to anybody willing to work hard enough and grab it.

Restaurants fit the way Morgan viewed success and how he’d eventually frame his plans for Texas Roadhouse.

He talks today about “running one store, one market, one region, one company.” The philosophies don’t change all that much stop-to-stop. You gather information. You make a decision. And you try to get buy-in along the way.

It’s “been a heck of a journey” honing that mindset at Texas Roadhouse.

“Our sales have been incredible. The respect that we’ve received as an organization has just been unbelievable,” Morgan says. “When people say to me Kent Taylor would be very proud of not only what I’ve done, but what this company has done in the last five years, it does make it worth it to me.”

How Morgan kept Texas Roadhouse rolling and built on Taylor’s legacy unfolded quite differently in approach. That, too, is something Taylor appeared to recognize as a strength in Morgan and knew operators would respect beyond his sales record.

Morgan refers to himself not as a CEO, but as a “head coach.” He sees his job as ensuring the layers of Texas Roadhouse function at a high level through collaboration and communication.

Taylor, in his way, never specifically told Morgan why he thought he had the makeup to be his successor. He did share with Morgan he was a likeable leader and someone who worked well with others. Taylor, on the other hand, was an enigmatic, introverted CEO who kept colleagues on their toes. He was brilliant and steadfast, and always consumer and operator centric. Taylor would wait in line to eat at Texas Roadhouse and drove Chevy Suburbans stuffed with clutter, from architectural plans to a Santa suit.

But he admittedly had to develop a persona, “Bubba,” to play a certain character when it came to front-facing duties. He’d wear costumes, wigs, cowboy hats—all to put on a mask and do the things he was least comfortable doing.

Morgan says pundits and fans liked to say, “Kent Taylor is Texas Roadhouse.” Yet if you asked Taylor, he’d tell you it was about partners and “the Roadie nation,” a term the company uses to describe fanatics.

Morgan himself was a “Roadie” and somebody who could bridge the external and operational corners of running the company. He was respected because he got results, but also outward and more of a people-person than Taylor, who enjoyed yearly three-month skiing trips and was often on the road, growing the company and making deals.

Morgan managed the first Texas Roadhouse in Texas—Grand Prairie—that opened in 1997 and historically was one of the chain’s top performers. Morgan was recruited by Steve Ortiz, who knew Taylor from Bennigan’s and later rose to COO. Morgan asked Ortiz if Taylor was, indeed, someone you wanted to get into business with. Ortiz didn’t hesitate, and this path began.

“At each level, the results that you get create respect,” Morgan says. “And then, what do you do with that respect? Do you get arrogant, or do you get humble and go back to work?”

Taylor had begun to observe a sturdiness in Morgan and, sort of, trickled out hints. The day Ortiz retired, Taylor called Morgan and informed him there was a name and envelope in his desk. He told him, “The name changed that day.” Taylor didn’t say it was now “Jerry Morgan;” he just let him know it could be. About eight years later when then-president Scott Colosi retired, Morgan received another call.

“And he said, ‘the name in that desk is different.’ So, he was telling me that maybe he saw me as that kind of leader,” Morgan says. “And I responded, ‘that’s really cool. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. And I’m going to go back to work.’”

In the months ahead, Taylor rang “every single person in the company” and asked them what it was like working for Morgan. He’d pose another question—“give me three names who should replace me.” Once more, Taylor never shared with anybody what he heard back. “At one point, he did say, it was a pretty obvious choice,” Morgan says.

For the reticent Taylor, it was a resounding endorsement.

Texas Roadhouse’s next era

Morgan has adjusted over the years from accepting Taylor’s torch to carrying it to understanding how he might do so in his own style.

It comes back to Morgan’s “coaching mentality.” He made sure he understood people’s jobs, whether it was training, marketing, or legal. Morgan says his position has always been about trusting and inspiring people and holding them accountable. The latter is a place, he notes, where high-leadership executives often struggle. It’s the difference between executing in the trenches and holding others to that standard.

Firstly, though, not a morning arrives where Morgan doesn’t consider the mission, values, and purpose of Texas Roadhouse. Everything the company does today builds on what Taylor worked to nurture. Morgan seeks out leaders who are in it for Texas Roadhouse.

His first assessment came with certified counselor G. Dan Lumpkin. The coaching expert provided a predictive index with a 17-page report. Morgan had to answer 2,000 questions and Lumpkin evaluated his results against other CEOs.

It claimed Morgan was “bold, aggressive, and decisive.”

“I said, I’m good with that,” Morgan says.

“The bottom line is, Kent always told me, you’re never going to make everybody happy. Make the decision and move forward. And if it’s wrong, change it,” Morgan adds.

Texas Roadhouse lives through a “MVP” lens: “Mission. Values. Purpose.”

Morgan, illustrating how the operator gene never quite leaves you, says the company owes its employees a quality shift, every day. It owes guests top-end experience and value they can trust. And it owes shareholders the ability to run a solid business.

On that final point, Morgan took over a chain that took its pandemic lumps and came out firing.

In the week ending March 3, Texas Roadhouse units averaged weekly sales of $118,512. Of that, only $9,115 came outside the four walls. By March 24, those numbers were $29,432 and $25,938, respectively. And then, Texas Roadhouse figured things out, leveraging ideas of managing partners and serving a grateful customer.

Within a week, Texas Roadhouse jolted to-go sales to $41,892, a number that would rise into the high $50,000, low $60,000 range by late April.

In Q2 of 2025, as things have settled and continued to widen, Texas Roadhouse posted same-store sales of 5.8 percent for a two-year stack of 15.1 percent during a time when many restaurant peers are scratching to stay above the line. Average weekly sales were $167,350, of which $22,243 stemmed from to-go sales.

Morgan in October 2024 rang the closing bell to mark the brand’s 20th anniversary as a publicly traded company. It was a reflective moment remembering when Taylor and the chain’s mascot, Andy the Armadillo, opened the Nasdaq Stock Exchange on October 5, 2004. Texas Roadhouse had roughly 174 stores and 10,000 employees.

When Morgan got up there, the company had swelled to nearly 775 stores (there were 797 this past quarter) and 100,000 workers spread across three concepts—fast casual Jaggers and burger and pizza brand Bubba’s 33 included. It generated more than $5.373 billion in revenue in 2024, up 16 percent, year-over-year.

And regarding its stock, Texas Roadhouse traded for $11.50 on October 8 of that opening run. More recently, it was at $173 in mid-October 2025.

The company was a $2 billion enterprise in 2017, doubled to $4.014 billion over the next five years, and is well on its way to $8 billion over the next decade, as Morgan outlined last year.

All that success, he adds, has led to a lot of back-patting for Texas Roadhouse. Among his duties, he considers ensuring the brand never gets comfortable a key one.

Morgan believes Texas Roadhouse will avoid complacency as long as it remains committed to a larger vision. He’s regularly faced with decisions that affect 100,000 employees or 250 million guests. “When you look at it, you ask, are you making a decision that’s great for your employees? Are you making a decision that’s great for your guests? Or are you making a decision that’s great for the organization? If you can get all three of those boxes checked, then you’re in great shape,” Morgan says.

Embracing the “rowdy” and staying ahead

It’s likely Taylor saw in Morgan somebody who would never let the brand drift. One thing about Texas Roadhouse is it hasn’t suffered for identity, no matter what’s going on macro-wise. Taylor liked to rail against norms on earnings calls and answer complicated investor questions with short and direct quips. Why is the brand winning? Perhaps it has something to do with having fully staffed restaurants. Why aren’t you getting into delivery? Let other chains serve guests cold steaks.

Morgan, of course, lived this mantra each shift as an operator. The music is loud. There’s energy in restaurants. Morgan says the No. 1 thing guests tell Texas Roadhouse is to turn the volume down. But those who intimately know the brand also understand it’s a non-negotiable and a reason the whole thing works. Being able to separate the vocal minority from what matters is something that takes a Texas Roadhouse lifer to grasp.

Or, in Morgan’s words, “we have to believe that’s something that’s really important to our business.”

The same is true of free peanuts and the basket of bread and cinnamon butter. Morgan remarks, even before steak, customers talk about those two traits. Everywhere he goes, he says, on a plane, for instance, if Morgan is wearing a Texas Roadhouse logo somebody will tell him to bring the rolls before he gets onboard.

“We love that,” Morgan says.

The secret to Texas Roadhouse, so to speak, has never been difficult to place. It stays true to its principles—“Legendary Food and Legendary Service” —and compounds those hallmarks with running great restaurants. The managing partner model was one Taylor implemented because he thought operators would compete for success and hold to his ideals (he also needed the financial uplift). Operators spend $25,000—the first forked up $30,000—sign a multi-year contract, and get 10 percent of the store’s bottom line in addition to their salary.

These partners provide the foundation for Texas Roadhouse. Morgan and management conduct a fall tour to tap their ingenuity and check in. They help with pricing decisions, market observations, and, as Morgan proved, help build the pipeline from the inside out, with leaders who breathe Texas Roadhouse’s ethos. Doster says Morgan has a superpower for “listening to learn, not listening to respond.”

Operators have an hour to ask any question they want. “I just don’t think you can underestimate the power of that partnership with our operators,” Doster says.

Morgan says he’s proud of how the company and organization came together following Taylor’s passing and what’s unfurled since. “When you go through a tragic loss, you can either heal as a company or you can break apart,” he says. “You can start pointing fingers at each other. For us to all come together and heal and continue to focus on providing Legendary Food and Legendary Service, running great restaurants, and living our mission and our values and our purpose, and growing as a company, it’s meant everything.”

Staying the course and charting a new one

The first thing Texas Roadhouse did when it started to climb out of the pandemic was get staffed. It spent time investing in headcount, store wise and management, and Morgan feels it’s paid dividends as sales slope upward.

Texas Roadhouse has steadied the rampant turnover of post-COVID life and produced churn rates, Morgan says, at industry lows. That’s leading to more productive employees who, when they stay, signal they’re making money and having fun, he explains.

Guests in turn receive the experience and consistency expected of Texas Roadhouse. Even as prices hiked industry-wide, the brand never skimped on portions or service. “If I’m charging you more, wouldn’t you expect a little bit better food or better service?” Morgan says.

“We’ve never changed any of our recipes. We’re just trying to continue to deliver a great experience at a value price,” he adds. “You can spend a lot of money at Texas Roadhouse. But there’s also a value portion of the menu that’s always been there that I think protects us. We want to be very careful about that.”

Plainly, through all the industry’s value turmoil, Texas Roadhouse’s top-line growth confirms to Morgan people view the brand as a “good deal.” And that boils down to the aforementioned levers of trust, service, consistency, and never losing sight of what customers need—answers that come from managing partners making decisions on the ground level.

Along these lines, however, Morgan says, Texas Roadhouse wants to talk about staying true to itself while also evolving. Even going back a decade, the chain was considering pay-at-the-table, for example. It eventually tried to let diners use phones or Apple Pay, etc., yet it never took hold.

Then, in 2022, the company partnered with Ziosk on “Roadhouse Pay” tablets that allow customers to check out when they’re ready. Immediately, Morgan says, Texas Roadhouse saw an 80 percent response. Nearly 90 percent of guests use them today. Customers can’t reorder apps or drinks—it’s strictly a convenience play so people can pay on their own terms.

The industry in those days was sorting through a torrent of post-COVID technology. Brands hurried to open access and had begun to try and decode the options. A side effect was employees and leaders gained exposure.

Morgan says Texas Roadhouse started to have people come over from other chains who had used a lot of the options at hand. One was digital kitchen technology, or KDS. The company tried it first at Jaggers and Bubba’s. Texas Roadhouse was a more difficult concept because it was so oriented, Morgan says, onto tickets and the old style. And it was successful doing so.

“But we also knew we had to try to evolve,” he says.

Texas Roadhouse customized an option and put it in a restaurant. It was a success. The next 10 worked as well. And soon, the word got out and operators wanted in. So, the company laid out a three-year plan to update every restaurant, which should happen by year’s end.

While still relatively early, Morgan said learnings stem from being more organized. The kitchen is calmer since cooks don’t have to hear paper being pulled and see tickets everywhere. The bump screen allows them to focus on orders in front of them versus watching the rail of dozens of tickets stack up, which can be intimidating at times.

“It’s been a huge win for us,” Morgan says.

Texas Roadhouse has gotten better at takeout (still no delivery). It’s installed bump outs where sensible and improved its approach. It’s also worked on the mobile app and integrated a waitlist where customers can put their name down. That, Morgan says, has been a game-changer.

The brand has begun to consider handheld tablet ordering versus a server running over to a point-of-sale as well.

But overall, Texas Roadhouse wants technology to complement experience and help it become more efficient. It won’t replace or change the company’s DNA, Morgan says.

And that brings him back to what’s still to come. There’s growth on several fronts going into 2026, whether it’s the core Texas Roadhouse brand, Jaggers, or Bubba’s 33—the latter of which has 200-store ambitions (there were 53 in Q2). Jaggers touted 15 units and is ramping up franchising. It’s a fast casual, employees like to picture, created from Taylor driving one day with his grandchildren and getting annoyed they wanted to eat different things. The result being a mashup of burgers, chicken, salads, shakes, and more. A Jaggers in Lexington, Kentucky, earlier this year marked the 800th systemwide opening for the company.

As Texas Roadhouse debuts stores, across the portfolio, Morgan says he won’t lose sight of the soul the brand was founded on. Restaurants get to teach people soft skills and show them how to lead in ways other sectors simply cannot, he notes. Plus, you get to run a business and control your destiny, just as Taylor did. “And I think that’s the part when you think about this generation that’s coming up that’s very entrepreneurial driven, our company is built off that entrepreneurial spirit,” Morgan says. “You get to be an owner-operator, but you have responsibilities to the company. But to me, it’s always been about how do we create an environment where our employees love to work? That is what defines you as a leader.”

So what kind of leader has Morgan grown into, five years in? Doster says Taylor was not a “rah-rah” guy or someone who was overly approachable. He was quiet and earned respect through vision and action. Morgan does that, too, but he has a knack for bringing folks together.

He sits in the café and dines with employees. And one of the first things Morgan did was start a softball team. “Imagine another company right now where you just started at Roadhouse and you may work in IT or you work in purchasing, and you’re on the team with the CEO,” Doster says.

Morgan chimes in Texas Roadhouse collected back-to-back softball titles, including an undefeated season, over the past four years.

“I’m a part of Roadie Nation, too,” Morgan says. “And I’ve got a job to do.”",https://www.fsrmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TexasRoadhouseJerry.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:57.303755
,EVs,2025-12-01 14:32:17+00:00,Stacker,How EVs can fix the grid and lower your electric bill | Stacker,Matt Simon for Grist,,,,,https://stacker.com/stories/transportation/how-evs-can-fix-grid-and-lower-your-electric-bill,"Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it.
Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way.
“There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added.
At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits.
“I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said.","Depending on whom you’re asking, renewable energy and electric vehicles will either destroy the grid or save it. The sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow, true enough, while a gas-fired power plant can generate electricity any time. That supposed precarity of renewables will get even shakier, critics argue, as Americans ditch conventional vehicles for electric ones, which will draw ever more power from an already strained grid.

Luckily, that’s not a realistic scenario because of what renewables and EVs have in common: giant batteries. Solar and wind farms are plugging into huge banks of them to store energy to use as needed, fixing their intermittency challenge, Grist reports. (Engineers are turning Earth itself into an even bigger battery.) And a growing number of cars with cords feature vehicle-to-grid technology, or V2G, also known as bidirectional charging. They can draw clean power when renewables are humming on the grid, and their owners get paid to send some back to a utility to meet growing demand — creating a vast distributed network that could make the electrical system more reliable, not less. Research has found that globally, less than a third of EV owners would have to opt into such a system to meet the rising need for energy storage.

Until now, we’ve been customers of utilities — with power flowing one way to homes — but more and more we’ll be active participants in the grid, sending extra battery power the other way. That shift is getting a head start in Maryland, where last month the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company partnered with Sunrun, which provides home solar and batteries, and Ford, which makes the electric F-150 Lightning, to activate the nation’s first residential V2G pilot project.

“This is the first time there are actual customers who are off-boarding power from their electric vehicles to the grid, and we’re doing it at peak times in the evening,” said Chris Rauscher, vice president of grid services at Sunrun, referring to the periods of greatest need for electricity. “So we’re actually reducing the stress and the demand on the grid — crushing the curve, crushing the peak — which helps lower costs for everyone.”

To understand how this works, think of EVs less like vehicles and more like immense batteries on wheels. In fact, the Lightning’s battery is 10 times bigger than a residential pack, Rauscher said. “There’s more energy capacity deployed today in electric vehicle batteries on the road in the U.S. than in all stationary batteries combined,” Rauscher added. “This is a massive resource.” And it’s only getting more massive: The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated that if California V2G’ed all of the 14 million EVs it’s expected to have by 2035, it could power every home in the state for three days.

In these early days of the tech, though, only a handful of models sport V2G capabilities, but the number is growing. The hardware and software aren’t wildly complicated. A special charger juices up the vehicle’s battery, then draws from the car to power a house, in the case of vehicle-to-home systems, or sends it back to the utility, in the case of vehicle-to-grid.

Utilities will have to communicate with anyone participating in such a program, for instance, with an app that allows a customer to, say, ask that their vehicle never be discharged below a certain percentage. Each utility will also need to figure out how much to compensate people for their power in order to incentivize them to join in. That might mean paying for the amount of energy provided, the same principle behind net metering, in which residential solar customers are reimbursed for the energy they give to the grid. “We’re still in a bit of an early stage here,” said Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at Baltimore Gas and Electric Company. “There are a lot of things that need to be worked out, particularly on the customer-experience side.”

That battery power need not go all the way back to the grid, though, to help utilities. For years now, owners have been using their Ford Lightning trucks to power their homes. These batteries are mammoth — the extended-range version can go 300-plus miles — and powering a home with one uses just five or six miles of that range per hour.

So say an owner returns home at 6 p.m., when demand on the grid is skyrocketing as everyone else is knocking off work and switching on air conditioners and other energy-hungry appliances. Because consumption is rising, so too is the price of electricity. But a Lightning owner doesn’t have to pay that if they’re using their battery to power their home for five hours until they go to bed, using 25 to 30 miles of range on their battery. “It basically makes the house disappear, effectively, from the grid,” said Ryan O’Gorman, Ford’s business lead for vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-home.

Then the owner can charge again when demand, and electricity prices, are lower. If they work from home, for example, they can charge during the day, when lots of solar power is coursing through the grid.

More homes tapping EV batteries also eases demand on the grid, which is especially welcome during a heatwave when everyone’s running their AC units. Those heat waves will only get worse from here — a growing challenge for utilities to provide the power that keeps people cool and safe. At the same time, ever more data centers are devouring ever more power and stressing the grid to its limits. That infrastructure also must accommodate other forms of decarbonization, like heat pumps and induction stoves, that are essential for weaning us off fossil fuels.

Instead of sitting idly in a garage depreciating, V2G turns an EV into an asset for bolstering the grid and powering the home cheaply. “Cars are parked more than 22 hours a day,” O’Gorman said. “When we look at the advantages of an EV, now that vehicle can provide savings and potentially revenue flows for the customer.” (Interestingly, even electric trains can now send juice back to the grid and generate revenue, thanks to what they gain from regenerative braking: In the Bay Area, the Caltrain system is now being compensated for that energy, slashing its estimated annual power cost from $19.5 million to $16.5 million.)

The residential V2G program in Baltimore follows other experiments across the nation with larger vehicles. In Oakland, California, for instance, the utility Pacific Gas & Electric worked with the electric bus provider Zum to deploy vehicles that take kids home in the afternoon, return to the lot, and plug back into the grid. Because their batteries are so large, they have ample power left over, sending that extra energy to the grid just as demand is spiking. They charge overnight, take kids to school, and plug in again to charge.

This kind of predictability could make commercial fleets even more powerful for V2G than residential vehicles, experts say. A school bus is on a schedule a utility can rely on — it’s parked and available at certain times of day and making the rounds at others. Plus, in the summer, they would be available almost constantly. Other fleets, like delivery and government vehicles, follow regular timetables as well.

Fleet managers can also procure large numbers of the appropriate chargers, buying into the system en masse, compared to a homeowner shelling out for just one. “In the short term, we see commercial-level V2G applications as more viable due to infrastructure costs, but we expect affordable domestic units to emerge as the market matures and demand grows,” said a spokesperson for Nissan, which has long included bidirectional charging in its electric Leaf.

Utilities are still figuring out how to coordinate this ballet between vehicle, charger, and grid on a citywide scale. But the payoff could be big, because all those EVs are existing infrastructure that could help reduce the need to build dedicated battery plants to store renewable energy. The less a utility has to build, the fewer costs it has to pass on to ratepayers. And with more V2G, a utility that has to import lots of electricity from a neighboring state can now store power locally.

Thus, this technology could reduce energy bills. And for participants, their vehicles now provide transportation and energy storage. “It would seem pretty easy to imagine that that’s going to be cheaper than building just stationary battery storage facilities that do nothing but support the grid in times of need,” said Rudi Halbright, product manager of VGI pilot implementation at Pacific Gas & Electric. “Because you’re not getting that secondary use with those batteries. They’re kind of sitting around a lot of the time.”

People are more complicated than battery banks, though. Folks with busy lives want the convenience of charging their cars whenever they like and might not even realize how much prices fluctuate throughout the day, said David Victor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies the behavior of EV drivers. Many like the peace of mind of having a fully charged vehicle ready at all times. “I take from that that V2G is going to be really, really hard for fleets outside of professionally managed fleets,” Victor said, “that we know reliably are going to be available at the time that the V2G asset is going to be needed.”

Still, given the number of EVs out there, only a fraction of owners need to participate to make a sizable impact. And residential and commercial V2G can complement each other — and in turn, complement a utility’s larger battery facilities — a widescale diversification of energy storage that could accelerate the adoption of renewables. “I fundamentally believe that bidirectional electric vehicles are going to be something that no one’s ever heard of, until suddenly everyone has it,” Rauscher said. “Once we have enough customers enrolled and deployed out there, some percent of customers not plugging in and performing doesn’t really matter.”",https://static.stacker.com/s3fs-public/images/stories/2025/11/07/grist-how-evs-can-fix.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:00:32.384297

In fact, as solar and wind expanded, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 0.1%.
“Capacity additions by solar, wind, and battery storage continue to dramatically outpace gas, coal and nuclear — and by growing margins.”","The latest “Electric Power Monthly” report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows that solar grew by 29.9% in September 2025 compared to one year earlier, and provided 9.7% of the nation’s electrical output during the month, up from 7.6% in 2024.

Utility-scale solar expanded by 35.8% while that from small-scale systems rose by 11.2% during the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by almost one-third (29.0%) and produced a bit over 9% (utility-scale: 6.85%; small-scale: 2.16%) of total U.S. electrical generation for January-September — up from 7.2% a year earlier. This is according to a review of the data by the SUN DAY Campaign.

For the third consecutive month, utility-scale solar generated more electricity than the nation’s wind farms — by 4% in July, by 15% in August, and by 9% in September. Including residential systems, solar has out-produced wind five months in a row and by over 40% during September.

Similarly, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed — by almost 65% — the output of the nation’s hydropower plants (5.5% of total generation). In September alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of the nation’s hydropower plants. In fact, in both September and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass and geothermal combined.

During the first nine months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 18.8% of the U.S. total, up from 17.1% during the first three-quarters of 2024. Further, the combination of wind and solar provided 15.1% more electricity than did coal during the first nine months of this year, and 9.8% more than the nation’s nuclear power plants.

Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, and Erin Houchin, a Salem Republican, want to finance a federal program to do widespread ecological restoration of the Ohio River and the network of waterways that comprise its basin.

The pair’s proposed legislation comes as local and national groups push an ambitious plan to address what they say are serious threats to the 204,000 square mile basin that spreads across 14 states and brings drinking water to more than 30 million people.

McGarvey is optimistic.

“The momentum’s there, the partnerships are there — across party lines, across regional lines — to hopefully start bringing the resources we need to protect the Ohio River,” he said.

The Ohio River Restoration Program Act would create a team within the Environmental Protection Agency to guide efforts to restore and protect the basin’s rivers, streams and wetlands.

The bill seeks $350 million in annual funding for five consecutive fiscal years. Money that could be used to help clean up toxic pollution, improve drinking water quality, repair fish and wildlife habitats or root out invasive species. The new team would need to create an action plan to begin addressing restoration efforts within the first two years.

The federal government would have a roadmap to follow in deciding what projects to finance: The Ohio River Basin Restoration and Protection Plan, developed by the University of Louisville’s Envirome Institute, the Ohio River Basin Alliance and the National Wildlife Federation, with input from scientific experts, community leaders and residents.

Houchin, who represents a Southern Indiana district that stretches downriver from Lawrenceburg to New Amsterdam, said she found common ground with McGarvey on this issue during discussions the two had on flights to and from Washington D.C.

The pair reinvigorated a congressional caucus for the Ohio River Basin and, with McGarvey’s leadership, got legislation to create a federal restoration program off the ground in 2024.

“We're going to try as hard as we can to take this as far as we can while the momentum is on our side, and continue to build and grow this coalition that cares about the Ohio River Basin and wants to see it funded,” Houchin said.

She said her interest in working on legislation like this stemmed from the disastrous 2023 derailment of a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine, Ohio.

“It was at that time that we were monitoring with ORSANCO, every day, the particulates that were traveling down the river. Because we do have people that rely on the Ohio River for their source of water,” she said. “And we discovered in those efforts that the Ohio River Basin is … the largest river basin without any dedicated federal funding, and it is also the second-most endangered river basin.”

Houchin said the river is a vital economic thoroughfare on which more than a third of America’s maritime commerce travels.

Bipartisan support

The legislation is co-sponsored by a Republican and two Democrats on the House of Representatives’ Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

U.S. Rep. Emilia Strong Sykes, a Democrat from Akron, Ohio and committee member, said she’s concerned about water quality, water safety, accessibility and affordability.

Sykes said the abundance of water in the Ohio River Basin, compared to the droughts facing western U.S. states, is worth protecting.

“It is much more important for us now to protect our water sources and devote the attention and resources to it now, before it's too late,” she said.

Sykes pointed to Ohio’s Cuyahoga River, which notoriously caught fire decades ago because of rampant pollution and helped inspire Congress to create the EPA, as an example of what it can look like when large bodies of water are neglected.

“Sometimes we get things right, and we learn from our mistakes,” she said. “That's what's happening here, and this is why the timeliness is just so high.”

Sykes said she’s hopeful the bill will get a committee hearing soon.

“This is, fortunately, one of the more bipartisan committees … so the likelihood is more reasonable than maybe others,” Sykes said.

Why federal involvement?

McGarvey said establishing a federal program makes sense when the goal is to rehabilitate waterways across a broad swath of the country.

“This is when it is appropriate for the federal government to get involved, to coordinate people at every single level to clean up the river all the way through,” he said. “To make sure that it's there for future generations.”

Their plan is modeled after similar federal restoration programs that have supported other historic American waters, like the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay. McGarvey said financing initiatives like these is a sound investment, with the Great Lakes program returning $3 in economic impact for every $1 in government money spent on it.

Other Congress members have joined Sykes, Houchin and McGarvey to co-sponsor the new legislation: Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan and Republican Reps. Mark Messmer and Jefferson Shreve of Indiana, GOP Rep. Michael Rulli of Ohio, and Democratic Rep.

These factors position Asia Pacific as the global centre of energy storage deployment and consulting expertise.

The North America region is rapidly expanding on a global scale due to the faster adoption of clean energy in leading sectors and the increasing development of utility-grade renewable projects. Utilities across the region are accelerating investments in large solar farms, onshore and offshore wind installations and hybrid systems that require advanced storage solutions for frequency regulation, peak shaving and grid resilience. Moreover, ongoing grid digitalization initiatives in the region and the need for AI-based asset performance modelling are fuelling the consulting business further. These initiatives support predictive maintenance, real-time grid visibility and optimised dispatch, which strengthen long-term demand for specialised engineering and integration services.

On a country level, the U.S. is experiencing a significant growth rate due to powerful moves by authorities regarding state-level clean energy demand, along with the rapid deployment of grid-based and behind-the-meter storage systems to provide a constant energy supply to every sector. States such as California, New York, Texas and Arizona are implementing aggressive storage mandates and providing financial incentives that accelerate deployment. The combination of federal tax credits, large-scale BESS projects, and expanding commercial and industrial storage installations positions the U.S. as a major driver of the North American energy storage consulting and deployment market.

Across the country, town and city governments are embedding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into routine planning, public services, and community development, demonstrating a model of localized action that is drawing attention across Europe and Central Asia. What began as targeted support from the Joint SDG Fund has evolved into a coordinated municipal movement focused on measurable progress, institutional accountability, and inclusive growth.

A National Shift Toward Measurable Local Action

The joint program—implemented by UNDP, UNICEF, and FAO—has equipped Georgia’s local governments with practical tools to convert high-level SDG commitments into actionable policy. This work includes new planning methodologies, inter-sector partnerships, and systems for tracking progress across social, environmental, and governance priorities.

One of the most significant outcomes has been the adoption of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs). These action-oriented assessments allow municipalities to benchmark their progress, prioritize interventions, and collaborate with neighboring regions. Georgia’s VLR model is increasingly referenced in international development discussions as a replicable approach to SDG localization, particularly in countries with diverse municipal capacities.

To date, more than 500 national and local officials, civil society members, and sector partners have been trained to align local development plans with SDG targets. This has improved coordination across government levels, resulting in more transparent planning cycles and clearer lines of accountability.

Data Systems Designed for People, Not Paperwork

A key feature of Georgia’s approach is the emphasis on evidence-based decision-making. The introduction of the Digital Needs Assessment Portal (social.nala.ge) enables municipalities to identify the needs of children and vulnerable families with greater precision. Developed with the National Association of Local Authorities of Georgia (NALAG) and the International School of Economics (ISET), the portal centralizes data to support targeted social services.

Complementing this system is a Child-Centered Budget Analysis (CCBA) framework that helps municipalities track how local budgets influence child welfare outcomes. Together, these tools shift municipal planning from reactive spending to proactive policy design—ensuring that children and families benefit from equitable and inclusive services.

Preliminary findings shared by program partners indicate that municipalities using the portal are better able to map service gaps, evaluate program effectiveness, and align local priorities with national social protection strategies.

Building Sustainable Systems from the Ground Up

Environmental sustainability is another core pillar of the program. Municipalities have updated their Waste Management Plans (2023–2027) to incorporate Georgia’s first structured five-level food waste hierarchy, supported by the country’s new Law on Food Loss and Waste Reduction. This hierarchy prioritizes prevention, redistribution, composting, and recovery before disposal.

More than 100 municipal officials, entrepreneurs, educators, and youth leaders have participated in community initiatives focused on reducing food waste, promoting composting practices, and supporting food donation programs. These interventions not only improve waste outcomes but also strengthen public awareness around responsible consumption—an area where local action directly influences national environmental goals.

Youth as Catalysts for Community Transformation

The program has also invested in emerging leaders. Over **100 young people—70% of them girls—**have been trained as SDG ambassadors, leading community projects, local awareness campaigns, and peer-to-peer education initiatives. Their participation demonstrates how youth-centered engagement can accelerate policy adoption and foster social innovation at the local level.

Georgia’s municipal leaders have highlighted youth involvement as a key factor in sustaining momentum, reinforcing that long-term SDG progress depends on generational continuity and civic participation.

From Local Lessons to Global Platforms

Georgia’s experience is increasingly recognized in international forums. At the Regional Forum for Sustainable Development, municipal representatives shared insights into how cross-sector partnerships are modernizing governance structures. A recent study tour with UN-Habitat in Portugal further strengthened Georgia’s ability to replicate and adapt international best practices, particularly in urban governance and community-centered planning.

These engagements underscore how locally driven progress can inform global SDG implementation, contributing to broader regional and international learning.

The next phase of the “Planning for Change with the SDGs” program aims to deepen the systems already in place. Priority areas include expanding municipal data capacity, integrating SDGs into routine policy cycles, strengthening civil society engagement, and extending support to more rural municipalities.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20251130-111009-23e-Youth%20and%20local%20officials%20collaborating%20on%20community%20sustainability%20planning%20outdoors..jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:29.098826

President Donald Trump is no fan of renewable energy, deriding efforts to expand wind and solar power as a “joke.” “They don't work. They're too expensive. They're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great,” he told the United Nations General Assembly in September.

And certainly his administration has worked hard all year to eliminate incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles in favor of boosting U.S. production and consumption of fossil fuels. Nevertheless, the country’s investment in those areas is on track to set an annual record in 2025 – though the pace of expansion shows signs of slowing, according to data compiled by Rhodium Group and the MIT-CEEPR Clean Investment Monitor.

In the third quarter, spending on clean energy and transportation jumped 8% from a year ago to $75 billion, the highest quarterly amount ever. And so far this year, such investments are running 6% ahead of the first three quarters of 2024, according to the report. A big driver for the third-quarter increase was Trump’s phaseout of $7,500 tax credits for electric vehicles on Sept. 30, which triggered a rush in buying. Retail purchases of heat pumps and battery-storage systems for residential solar customers also rose significantly.

Increased demand for electricity, driven by the rapid growth of AI data centers, likely helped boost spending on utility-scale renewable power projects and industrial decarbonization technologies, which rose 15% from the year-earlier quarter. Unfortunately, investments in manufacturing projects for clean energy technology – such as battery plants – fell for a fourth consecutive quarter and were down 26% from a year ago.

Pressure on utilities to quickly add more power-generation capacity may continue to aid the expansion of renewables, but announcements by companies related to spending on industrial decarbonization projects in the third quarter plunged 56% from a year earlier, the report said. And the loss of federal incentives to buy EVs is expected to sharply lower the growth in that segment both in 2025’s final quarter and next year. So while full-year U.S. investment in cleantech should top last year’s $267 billion tally, even with some slowing, things may not be so rosy in 2026.

The Big Read

How AI Is Ushering In A New Nuclear Age

At Aalo Atomics’ 40,000-square-foot factory on the south side of Austin, Texas, workers move five-eighths-inch-thick steel plates onto machines that slowly bend and roll them into 12-foot-wide cylinders, which they then weld into 25-foot-tall vessels. These could be made cheaper by outside contractors. But Aalo cofounder and CEO Matt Loszak wants to do this work in-house, since each vessel will eventually contain the guts of a ten-megawatt (MW) nuclear fission reactor. Five of these Aalo-1 reactor units, working in tandem, will power a single 50 MW electric turbine—enough juice to run a large data-processing center or 45,000 homes.

“It’s not a paper reactor; it’s getting built,” declares Loszak, a 35-year-old Canadian engineer now on his third startup. In August, Aalo broke ground on a two-acre site at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, where it aims to achieve “criticality” by July 4, 2026—America’s 250th birthday and the deadline President Donald Trump has set for at least three U.S. startups to prove that their advanced nuclear reactor designs work. To achieve criticality, Aalo will load a vessel with off-the-shelf nuclear fuel rod assemblies and then initiate a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction.

Producing electricity? That comes later. Even after achieving criticality, Aalo will still need to build out manufacturing and a supply chain of vendors, sign data center customers and get final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “We’ll get the factory set up, come down the cost curve and have this Holy Grail product,’’ vows Loszak, who is shopping for up to 1 million square feet for a gigafactory and recently hired Bryson Gentile, who headed Falcon 9 manufacturing at Elon Musk’s SpaceX, to set up Aalo’s mass production operation. “What Elon did [with electric cars and rockets] was kind of like running the four-minute mile. When that happens, everyone’s like, ‘Wait, this is possible,’ ” Loszak says. He hopes to produce electricity in 2027.

Demand for electricity is soaring, largely because of the power-sucking data centers undergirding the artificial intelligence boom, and Loszak isn’t the only nuclear entrepreneur aiming to ride the wave of AI dollars. A dozen ventures with names like Valar Atomics, Oklo, Kairos Power and X-energy are racing to perfect, permit and deploy a new generation of small, prefabricated reactors that could power individual data centers or even feed the larger electrical grid.

Hot Topic

Jacqueline Novogratz, Acumen founder & CEO, on investing in the developing world amid a pullback in U.S. aid and private funding

You've been in this space for 24 years. In that time, how many startups and companies have you funded in Africa and elsewhere?

About 220, roughly – maybe 240. And some of them have gone on to create whole new industries.

How has funding your investments changed over the past year, given that there’s a bit less emphasis on ESG among institutional investors?

I think that with the end of aid from the United States and the massive decline around the world, we saw both enormous disruption and destruction of lives, of people's health, and of the environment. I don't want to make an excuse for the way it was done.

At the same time, I started Acumen 24 years ago because I didn't think aid was going to solve problems in poverty. That was our beginning. I'm not nostalgic for the old age, but you can't just kill a system overnight. I think a lot of people feel that way. And now the world is looking for post-aid investment structures that go into those underdeveloped markets where people are overlooked and underestimated, and have been for as long as I've been alive. I actually find a great opportunity in this moment for these kinds of structures.

What are some examples of successes Acumen has had in funding startups in parts of the world that don't have electricity or distribution or logistics?

Probably our best example is in electrification. In 2007, 1.5 billion people on the planet had no access to electricity – 1.5 billion. We invested in one of the first off-grid solar lighting companies. It was just a box, a light. I would say irreverently that the entrepreneur didn't really know what they were doing. Neither did we. But over the next 10 years, we learned with them as they understood their customers and how to build distribution and how to finance and how to market, and how to build trust. And 10 years later, they were ready for growth capital. That was our first growth fund. Along the way, we started investing in other companies in that off-grid solar sector. And a few years ago, we realized that we, a nonprofit investor in 40 companies, had brought off-grid light and electricity to 300 million low-income people.

At that point, the world was looking at what's left: 600 million people, mostly in Africa, still have no access to off-grid light and electricity. So we asked ourselves, alright, if Acumen is going to go in and participate in what is a moral imperative as well as a productivity imperative, what's our role?

So we created a facility that is called the hardest to reach, which is unapologetically blended to take on the 16 most challenging markets in Africa that include Benin, Somalia, Chad, DRC, South Sudan, Malawi, and I could go on. We would take $60 million of philanthropy so that we could do those early-stage investments. We recently made our first loan in Somalia. Then, side by side, would be a $200 million blended debt facility so that we had enough working capital to keep companies in the countries in which they were operating. Twenty-three different stakeholders, from philanthropists to Shinhan Bank, which is a commercial bank in Korea, are coming together to make this change happen. I think this is the future if we are going to build markets for people that we have overlooked.

Since you have some of the riskiest startups out there, the understanding is that some of your portfolio companies aren’t going to make it. How do you handle that?

First of all, if you're not willing to fail, you will not succeed. Second, I think too many investors always focus on the downside. What could go wrong? In our markets, a lot could go wrong. Macroeconomic and exogenous influences, I could go on. But what we also have to ask ourselves is what is the cost of not daring? What is the cost of not trying? If you're looking at bringing off-grid solar electricity to, in our case, 70 million low-income people in very challenging markets, the risk of not daring is rising emissions. That is raising instability, and it’s raising migration. We have to start thinking more holistically about how we use the tools of investment to solve problems, recognizing that if we're careful and smart enough, we can provide returns based on the expectations of different investor classes.

The EPA and the Department of Justice have announced a nationwide settlement with Lowe’s Home Centers, LLC, requiring the company to pay a $12.5 million civil penalty for violations of the federal Lead Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule.

According to the agencies, Lowe’s failed to ensure that renovation work performed in homes built before 1978 complied with lead-safe practices. EPA’s investigation found widespread noncompliance across more than 250 renovation jobs in 23 states between 2019 and 2021. The agency cited failures such as the use of uncertified contractors, inadequate containment of dust and paint debris, and the company’s failure to provide residents with required lead-hazard information prior to beginning renovation work.

Lead-based paint, banned in the United States in 1978, remains a major source of childhood lead exposure in older housing. Renovation activities that disturb lead paint can release hazardous dust and chips that pose significant health risks, particularly to children. EPA officials emphasized that improper renovation practices can result in exposure levels known to cause neurological damage, developmental delays, and other long-term health effects.

Under the terms of the settlement, Lowe’s must implement a comprehensive, corporate-wide compliance program designed to prevent future violations. The program requires Lowe’s to use only certified renovation firms and certified renovators, verify the age of every property before beginning work, and maintain an electronic compliance system that documents all lead-safe procedures. Lowe’s is also required to conduct at least 4,000 jobsite inspections and submit regular compliance reports to the EPA for the next three years.

This settlement builds on a 2014 consent decree in which Lowe’s agreed to comply with the RRP Rule after earlier violations. EPA and DOJ officials noted that improved oversight and stronger compliance systems are essential to preventing harmful lead exposures during home renovations.

“We're excited to help power the next wave of technological advancement while delivering tangible benefits that will enhance the lives of Indiana residents for years to come.”

Infrastructure and energy to support growth

The data centre expansion is supported by a new energy agreement between Amazon and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO).

The partnership includes the creation of NIPSCO Generation (GenCo), which will manage infrastructure to supply power to the facilities.

Amazon will fund the required plants, lines and equipment without passing costs to local residents or businesses.

NIPSCO expects the agreement to generate US$1bn in cost savings for current electric customers over 15 years.

This surplus will also improve energy reliability during peak demand, such as extreme weather, by increasing total generation capacity beyond Amazon’s own 2.4GW needs.

Vince Parisi, NIPSCO President and COO, says: “This agreement structure with Amazon represents approximately US$1bn in cost savings over 15 years to our existing NIPSCO electric customers while strengthening our regional grid and economic future.

“By structuring this agreement thoughtfully, we're ensuring our current customers are protected, without increasing their rates, while we expand our capacity to meet growing demands.

“This project isn't just about powering data centres, it's about powering possibilities for our communities through thousands of new jobs, an expanded tax base and building a skilled workforce in Northern Indiana for long-term growth and prosperity.""

Governor Mike Braun adds: “This is a massive win for Hoosier ratepayers. This agreement will ensure a surplus in new energy development that will deliver real savings to Hoosier ratepayers.

“Amazon’s historic investment shows that Indiana’s business-friendly climate continues to attract world-class employers and drive growth in our state.

“This project will create more than a thousand jobs while supporting thousands more across the region, further strengthening Indiana’s position in energy dominance and economic leadership.”

And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.","On October 15, 2025, AEP Transmission LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Electric Power Company (AEP), closed a $1.6 billion term-loan financing guaranteed by the US Department of Energy (DOE), marking the first DOE loan guaranteed financing to close since President Trump’s inauguration in January. AEP operates the nation’s largest electric transmission system, spanning more than 40,000 miles and serving over five million customers. The company sought DOE financing to rebuild and reconductor approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states – Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia – modernizing grid infrastructure and improving reliability for millions of consumers.

The credit facility was structured as a low-interest term loan advanced by the Federal Financing Bank and fully guaranteed by the DOE under its Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment authority. The federal financing backed by DOE’s guarantee will significantly reduce borrowing costs and allow AEP to accelerate capital deployment at a time when private financing for large-scale transmission upgrades may be constrained.

The AEP transaction may very well serve as an early model for subsequent electric power infrastructure financings under the DOE’s newly branded Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment and Energy Dominance Financing Programs.

A Program Built to Bridge Innovation and Capital

The DOE’s loan guarantee program was created under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (then called “Incentives for Innovative Technologies”) to help finance innovative energy technologies that, at time of financing, wouldn’t meet market norms for “commercial technology.” By providing federal guarantees for loans provided by the Federal Financing Bank, or potentially private lenders, the program aimed to close the financing gap between innovative technology and market-tested (i.e., bankable) deployment.

Over the years, the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO), created to administer the loan guarantee program, financed projects that redefined the US energy landscape: utility-scale solar farms, advanced vehicle manufacturing, and more recently, next-generation carbon-capture facilities among them. Through these investments, DOE has been perhaps the principal actor in the US helping to move new-generation clean energy technologies from the margin to the mainstream.

Following the inauguration of President Biden, the loan guarantee program received a boost from both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which among other things increased the funds authorized for the program. The IRA also created a new category of projects eligible for funding under Section 1706 of Title XVII named the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing program (EIRF). In its guidance, the Biden era LPOdescribed the new funding as aiming to provide a “bridge to bankability,” especially for new projects that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution that may have trouble arranging financing from commercial lenders.

A New Mandate: Financing Energy Dominance

The new Trump Administration hassignificantly shifted US energy policy, rejecting the concept of climate change, and emphasizing instead fossil fuels as the means to achieving energy security and dominance.

The new Congress reflected President Trump’s pivot in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA revised Section 1706, rebranding it as the “Energy Dominance Program” and changing its emphasis from promoting clean energy generation to facilitating projects using fossil resources, as well as mining projects, for the sake of national security. The OBBBA rescinded the unobligated funds inked by the IRA for Section 1706 but at the same time appropriated $1 billion to DOE to “carry out activities” under section 1706 (of which not more than 3 percent is to be used for administrative expenses) and authorized $250 billion in new loan guarantees for the revised Energy Dominance program through September 30, 2028.

Consistent with the policy shift to encompass fossil resources, Section 50403 of the OBBBA removed a Section 1706 eligibility criterion that a project must “avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions.” Additionally, program eligibility is expanded to include projects that will “increase capacity or output” or “support or enable the provision of known or forecastable electric supply at time intervals necessary to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs.” The OBBBA also revised the definition of “Energy Infrastructure” to become a facility (and associated equipment), used to enable “production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.”

On October 28, DOE published an Interim Final Rule which amends the DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA. Among other provisions it will add a requirement that an electricity utility infrastructure project applying for funding from the 1706 program demonstrate that the financial benefits from a DOE guarantee will be shared with its customers, or the associated community served by it. Significantly, no similar requirement is made in the Interim Final Rule with respect to other types of Energy Infrastructure covered by the Energy Dominance program. While it is “effective” as of October 28, the period for public comment on the Interim Final Rule expires on December 29, 2025. The text of he rule and information on how to provide comments can be found here.

The above notwithstanding, Title XVII survived mostly unchanged, except for the revised Section 1706. As an important example, the OBBB did not change Section 1706 (a)(1) under which the AEP financing was closed, and which contemplates guarantees for projects to “retool, repower, repurpose or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations.” Moreover, the OBBBA did not amend Section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act, which authorizes DOE loan guarantees for projects that “avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued”, including, among others, Renewable Energy Systems, carbon capture projects and those projects that increase the domestically produced supply of critical minerals. However, the OBBBA in practice defunded the innovative energy program (among other programs) for future projects.

The AEP Transmission Financing: A Case Study in Transition

Bracewell’s representation of AEP in this transaction provides some unique insights into how DOE’s pre-existing loan guarantee framework will evolve to operate effectively within the new energy-dominance policy environment. AEP, like several utilities in the DOE queue, applied for funding and executed a preliminary term sheet before President Trump’s second inauguration in January.

The AEP deal advanced under challenging conditions – not only the change in administration after term sheet signing, but also the longest ever federal government shutdown that halted some agency operations. Despite these challenges, the transaction closed smoothly in October, aided by a pragmatic and flexible approach implemented by both the AEP and DOE teams to navigate the DOE’s existing procedural complexities, while balancing the policies and interests of DOE in following governmental norms with the commercial interests of AEP in achieving a resilient and administratively manageable financing structure under its 30-year tenure.

The willingness of both parties to overcome challenges within existing statutory and policy constraints was essential. The transaction helped establish a working model for balancing regulatory compliance with project-level realities. It provides a roadmap for future DOE-guaranteed financings, not only for the small group of forthcoming utility-oriented financings already in the queue, but also for new projects under the OBBBA’s expanded eligibility scope.

Looking Forward

Under the energy-dominance framework and its expanded reach, the DOE loan guarantee program is poised to continue to be a strategic financing platform encompassing the full spectrum of US energy infrastructure, with an emphasis on innovation, reliability, security and independence, and agnostic on type of fuel or feedstock. To prove this point, in late October DOE closed a second loan, a $1.5 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources to finance the restart and repurposing of a coal to ammonia fertilizer facility in Indiana that was idled since 2016. The revamped facility will produce 500,000 mtpy of anhydrous ammonia from coal from a nearby mine and pet coke as feedstock. And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.

For utilities and other project investors, the lesson is clear: US federal credit support remains one of the most powerful tools for accelerating capital into a changing environment for the energy infrastructure that underpins US economic strength.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.9762_2059.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:58:47.881521

“This has resulted in high costs and competitive disadvantages for the economy.” German industry is struggling on many fronts, including with US tariffs, Chinese competition, red tape, and pressure to decarbonise.
The DIHK represents nearly all German companies because membership is compulsory.
This will lead to significantly higher costs for German companies,” the paper says.
Currently, the caps in the EU emissions trading systems are set to reach zero by 2039, and in the early 2040s respectively.","One of Germany’s key business institutions, the chambers of industry and commerce, has called for an overhaul of climate policies to take pressure off companies.

“The current path of the energy transition in Germany is characterised by numerous, sometimes contradictory goals, detailed government control, insufficient European and international integration, and a lack of international coordination,” the organisation said in a climate policy paper adopted by its general assembly. “This has resulted in high costs and competitive disadvantages for the economy.”

German industry is struggling on many fronts, including with US tariffs, Chinese competition, red tape, and pressure to decarbonise. In particular, industries with a heavy use of energy in their processes such as steelmakers or chemicals have been under additional pressure due to price increases mainly for natural gas, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The DIHK represents nearly all German companies because membership is compulsory. Unlike business associations such as industry association BDI, the DIHK is not a conventional lobby group, but a public body with a legal mandate. The DIHK is the umbrella organisation for 79 regional chambers, which are expected to represent the entire business landscape, not the interests of particular sectors.

The paper notes that DIHK “has long been observing closures and relocations, particularly of energy-intensive production, and thus the loss of high-quality industrial jobs in Germany, particularly of energy-intensive production, and thus the loss of high-quality industrial jobs in Germany.”

“With its goal of becoming climate neutral by 2045, Germany has set itself a more ambitious target than the majority of industrialised and emerging countries. This will lead to significantly higher costs for German companies,” the paper says. To avoid competitive disadvantages, DIHK proposes “that German and European reduction targets should be aligned with the climate protection efforts of the most important economic competitors.”

DIHK calls for replacing strict annual climate targets

DIHK also said it opposed the strict annual climate targets laid out in Germany’s Climate Action Law, instead advocating a system that stipulates an overall budget of permissible emissions for a certain duration, but allows flexibility within that period.

Companies in Germany not only have to adhere to national regulation, but operate under a framework of EU rules. Adapting national targets would have to be complemented by changes at the European level. The EU-wide Emissions Trading Systems (EU ETS 1&2) set annually declining caps on emissions, which limits the flexibility for companies to emit more in the early years and less later.

Currently, the caps in the EU emissions trading systems are set to reach zero by 2039, and in the early 2040s respectively. However, this could change, as the EU and member states have begun talks to reform both systems and reached initial agreements.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:24.310995

CATL and Stellantis aim to have the new gigafactory in Zaragoza, located in Aragon, up and running by the end of 2026 and, with a joint investment of over 4 billion euros. The facility will run entirely on renewable energy. It is expected to deliver up to 50 GWh of lithium-iron phosphate batteries a year for electric vehicles.

CATL is the world's biggest and best-selling electric vehicle battery maker, and Stellantis is a global car manufacturer that has Jeep, Fiat, Chrysler, Dodge, Peugeot, and Vauxhall under its umbrella - among others.

These two multinational powerhouses have teamed up to build an EV battery plant with a clear aim.

""To accelerate the transition towards affordable, accessible, sustainable mobility for all,"" said Wu Qi, CEO of Contemporary Star Energy - the joint venture set up by CATL and Stellantis, in his speech at the ceremony.

Spanish Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism Jordi Hereu said the groundbreaking ceremony represents a strategic milestone in Spain's new-energy transition and industrial modernization, as well as Europe's strategic independence on the world stage.

""Today we are laying the first stone, the fruit of cooperation and of a vision of what an independent European strategy needs to be - open to cooperation, to dialogue, to work with all of the countries in the world, and especially with a country like China,"" he said.

“Steve Bridges loves USI,” says Vice President for Finance and Administration Jeff Sickman, who has worked with Bridges since 2000.
Often, Bridges would wander into USI’s campus grill and feast on a cheeseburger made by the late Ida Layman while studying in one of the booths.
“Even outside of campus, he’s so personable.
The end result was invisible to students, but everyone else was much happier.” The takeaway fed right into Bridges’ pathway to university presidency: “Pay attention to people that do the work.","In his 36-year career, Steven Bridges’ résumé lists just two employers: Sureway grocery store in Henderson, Kentucky, and the University of Southern Indiana. He’d have it no other way.

Bridges, 59, was celebrated Oct. 16 as USI’s fifth president and first alumni leader. Sentimentally, he was invested by prior presidents H. Ray Hoops, Linda Bennett, and Ronald Rochon, all of whom he served under. Long an accounting and financial officer, his dedication to his alma mater led Bridges to be named interim president in 2024 when Rochon left for California State University in Fullerton after seven years helming USI. After a national search, USI’s board of trustees recognized Bridges’ longtime skills and devotion to USI and in April offered him the full-time presidency.

“Steve Bridges loves USI,” says Vice President for Finance and Administration Jeff Sickman, who has worked with Bridges since 2000. “His commitment to the university, its students, and its faculty and staff inspires the same commitment from others and creates a great environment in which to learn and work.”

Across campus, Bridges’ appointment has been morale boosting. “He consistently keeps students at the center of every decision,” says Michael Solliday, a junior computer science major who in July was appointed to a two-year student trustee term. “He cares so much for students because he’s been there himself. … Through his presence and integrity, students feel seen and valued, and that sets the tone for the culture he’s building at USI.”

Humble Roots

Bridges’ mother and father — who were one of 11 and nine children, respectively — did not give their only child an option about attending college: “From day one, they said, ‘We need you to get an education, to do the things we didn’t get to do,” he says. They used their savings to help fund his studies. Bridges spent much of his childhood helping his father on their Henderson County farm, opening seed bags on a flatbed truck and climbing around tractors. After graduating from Henderson County High School in 1984, he helped pay for his college studies by working at Sureway. Often, Bridges would wander into USI’s campus grill and feast on a cheeseburger made by the late Ida Layman while studying in one of the booths. “That’s when I started feeling the community of people here,” he says. “You felt like you were home.”

After he completed his studies in fall 1988, then-director of USI’s Career Services Office Marilyn Schmidt recommended Bridges for his first post-graduation job as a staff accountant in April 1989. Impressed by his work ethic, attention to detail and priorities, and commitment to his future career, Schmidt remarked at his inauguration, “Steve Bridges was the perfect candidate for that job 30-plus years ago, and he’s the perfect candidate now.”

“It was like a full circle,” Solliday says. “Seeing him on campus, but then knowing his background with USI, it honestly impacts my thoughts on my own career. (This) is exactly what it looks like to build a career in purpose, service, and long-term commitment, and seeing him model it so well has really encouraged me to think bigger about my own impact.”

As he joined USI as an employee in 1989, Bridges and new wife Rosemary were expecting their first of three children, all of whom have followed their father’s footsteps in attaining higher education — and two literally: His daughters both are USI graduates. Cory, Abby, and Emma grew up rooting for the Screaming Eagles, with Cory even serving as a ball boy for Bruce Pearl during the basketball coach’s nine-season tenure at USI. “We grew up on this campus,” Cory, a commercial loan officer at Field and Main Bank, said at his father’s inauguration. “… To see our father lead the university he loves is a real pleasure.”

Known for his humble, everyman nature, Bridges’ approachability has led to a deep connection with members of the university community. “I’d see him all the time as he made his way around campus, being very interactive with students and just in general,” says Solliday, a Switz City, Indiana, native who got to know Bridges while Solliday served as a student ambassador. “Even outside of campus, he’s so personable. He always asked how I’m doing, whether with classes or anything else. A few months ago, I was in a car accident back home, and he was one of the first people to ask how I was doing.”

Helping Bridges balance the rigors of the presidency is a loving home life. His family now has grown to include five grandchildren. Like his alma mater, Bridges is intimately connected to the Tri-State: Born in Kentucky, he owns a home on Lake Barkley in honor of his father, a native of nearby Cadiz. Bridges’ mother’s family — including his 81 first cousins: Son Cory joked that “every family reunion was a public speaking event” — is based in rural Southeastern Illinois at a farm Bridges frequently visits. And his professional life has been rooted in Southwestern Indiana, and soon his personal life will follow: Longtime residents of Henderson, Kentucky, Bridges and wife Rosemary will move into the president’s residence, a Colonial Revival with 8,552 square feet just off McDowell Road near campus, when renovations are finished.

His daily routine includes a coffee date with Rosemary, an office assistant at Henderson’s Holy Name of Jesus Catholic School. “Each morning, we have ‘coffee clique,’ and it’s our time together to relax, see what’s going on, talk about our day, what we have coming up,” he says. “The ‘coffee clique’ is the foundation of my day. It’s a bit of a zen and relaxation for me before I come in and life gets busy.”

Bridges is a long-time volunteer with the Girl Scouts of Southwest Indiana, where he’s often worked on community projects alongside new CEO Mary Fee. “His leadership shines not only through his professional achievements, but in all he does,” Fee says. “He shares his expertise, wisdom, and discernment to help strengthen our mission and expand our impact. But above all, we are grateful for his steadfast commitment to this community and for the genuine friendship he extends to those he serves.”

The avid sports fan rests and recharges through fishing and quiet everyday pursuits like mowing the lawn or throwing meat on his beloved Oklahoma Joe’s smoker. “I do it the old way with wood. I don’t have the digital things where I can go do something else. I sit down and smoke the meat. And I enjoy that time with my smoker and make a point to relax and let things run through my mind,” he says. “It’s my opportunity to get away, and things come to my mind without me even trying.”

Meeting Successes and Challenges

Rising through the ranks, his work ethic has impressed many. “He has worked hard in every role that he has held,” Sickman says of Bridges, who in 1995 completed his Master of Business Administration from USI. “He adapts and rises to the occasion in whatever role he serves, and he applies what he has learned both as a student and through his various jobs to meet the needs of the university.”

Sickman notes his admiration for Bridges’ adaptability, especially as the university weathered the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. “USI did not experience layoffs as many others did, and we never missed a paycheck because his fiscal management ensured that we had enough reserves to weather any storm,” says Sickman, who served as Bridges’ Assistant Vice President for Finance and Administration. “USI remained financially healthy during that turbulent time due to his sound financial management.”

Displaying a leadership style that prioritizes teamwork, Bridges says he prefers to guide people toward results he would like to see while giving them the freedom to make it happen. “His empathy and vision, his ability to truly listen … it creates trust and fosters collaboration. He balances compassion with strategic thinking and planning for the university,” Solliday says.

Bridges gives credit to his alma mater for creating leaders, including himself. “We had lots of people that learned about the things that they needed to, to be ready for the next position,” he says. “Just like when I went to interview for those jobs — this put me in a position to be ready.” But staying out of the trenches has been tough. “One of the hardest things is not to be in the details,” he says, but he relishes having “faith in the people who do the detailed work. That’s been a culture for us, to prepare for the future.”

Bridges’ continued employment by USI means the colleagues he’s now leading have witnessed his professional milestones and missteps, a humbling position for any president. He remembers with pride a software installation that impacted record keeping from financial aid to registration. Bridges had to step away from his position as Controller and Assistant Director of the Business Office for the three-year transition. “It was a huge hit for our office to lose Steve, but in hindsight, it was for the good of the campus,” says Sickman, who as manager of payment services reported to Bridges. “It was a campuswide initiative, and they needed someone who could unify everyone, and that’s exactly why he was tapped. It showed what he could do.”

“I never took for granted the sacrifices people made and the way we went about it,” Bridges says. “It connected me to alumni, to financial aid, to payroll, to students, to finance — literally, they’re still helping me today.”

Conversely, Bridges learned a valuable lesson from an at-first bungled attempt to streamline students getting their books. He was put in charge of building the procedure, and he’s blunt about his initial missteps. “I screwed that thing up. I made it so accountant-oriented. It was a backroom disaster,” he says. “I could’ve just abandoned it because I was frustrated and embarrassed by it. But people stayed with me, and they fought through my mistakes. We came up with a better way to do it, and we achieved what we wanted to. But I had to fail. I had to figure out where I messed up to come back, let people who really did the work tell me where I was wrong. The next semester was night and day. The end result was invisible to students, but everyone else was much happier.”

The takeaway fed right into Bridges’ pathway to university presidency: “Pay attention to people that do the work. It doesn’t matter where they are in the organizational chart. Listen to them,” Bridges says. “You have to learn to be able to not give up on what you’re trying to do, to listen to the people that can help you make it better, and to adjust that path as needed.”

Has Bridges ever been tempted to leave USI? The software migration project Bridges led caught the attention of a company that wanted to hire him, but he stayed rooted to campus. “Why would I leave a place that I love? Where is it better than here?” he says. “And so, never did I seriously entertain it, but like anyone, it’s nice to want to feel wanted. But I felt wanted here, most of all.”

His appreciation for USI’s environment and his relaxed, humble nature are why long-time colleagues still grab Bridges’ ear as he walks through campus — “They’re like, ‘What do I call you now?’ and I’m like, ‘Steve,’’ he laughs — and he appreciated having that background as he assumed the presidency. “I think they would tell you that I’m a straight shooter, I’m transparent, and I think that’s maybe why there’s a comfort with me in this role. I hope that’s the case. I would consider that the biggest compliment.”

For years, South of the Border included a casino because video poker was legal in South Carolina but illegal in North Carolina.","Part of the South of the Border roadside attraction — on Interstate 95 on the line between North and South Carolina — has been put up for sale.

The owners are selling 30 acres that include the Pedroland amusement park, the ""SOB Convention Center,"" a motel building, a mini-golf course, vacant land and a former casino. The price is listed at $2.85 million.

Those parts of the attraction have closed, but South of the Border is keeping its unusual sombrero observation tower, reptile lagoon, souvenir stores and restaurants. The main motel and campground are also still in operation.

Real-estate agent Ken Jackson says he anticipates the buyer will redevelop the site to take advantage of I-95 traffic. The only condition is that the new owner can't sell fireworks, because that's already part of South of the Border.

""We've had a lot of interest from people wanting to do that, but that's the only thing that wouldn't be allowed,"" he told WUNC.

Jackson says the property for sale could be redeveloped as a hotel or other travel-oriented business. He says while South of the Border has new competition from a Buc-ee's truck stop a few exits deeper into South Carolina near Florence, the location still gets heavy traffic.

""Buc-ee's is the new shiny toy, and it is attractive to travelers as well, but there are plenty of people traveling up and down the interstate, and enough for both businesses,"" Jackson said.

But he says it's unlikely the new owner would reopen the amusement park. ""I'm not sure there's much demand for amusement parks of that size anymore, but it's a great opportunity for someone to go in and build a modern hotel,"" Jackson said. ""It'd be a great place for RV sales or RV service center — anything travel-related, logistics-related.""

According to the real-estate listing, the old carousel that remains on the amusement park site won't be included in the sale.

South of the Border has been a quirky stop for travelers since the 1950s, but it's faced criticism in recent years for its cartoon depiction of a Mexican man in its many billboard ads. They include slogans like ""You never sausage a place! You're always a weiner at Pedro's!""

As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.
Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?
Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded.
To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.","From the agrarian ideals of Thomas Jefferson to the emergence of the military-industrial complex of post-World War II, the bee has remained an essential figure of American progress and democracy.

As our country expanded westward and established our government, the honey bee has long been a marker of the past, present and future of the United States of America. Yet today, the downfall of the honey bee at the expense of American progress has raised concerns about the future of our nation.

Arriving to the American colonies during the early 17th century, the honey bee quickly became acclimated to the ecosystems of North America. Although the modern species of Apis melliferia is native to Europe, an extinct species of honey bees once pollinated the landscapes of North America 14 million years ago.

Bees, native and nonnative, have become an essential part of American ecosystems, agriculture and biodiversity. As major pollinators, bees boost the food crops of the United States and work to reduce the impacts of climate change across the globe.

Yet today, the modern bee faces the same threat it once faced 14 million years ago in North America: extinction. As anthropogenic climate change and pollution rapidly increase, pressures are placed on bee colonies throughout the country.

Regardless of origin, species of bees and pollinators are threatened today under American lifestyles, consumption and policy, facing up to a 70% colony loss in 2025, the highest in U.S. history. Bees pollinate 75% of U.S. food and agricultural crops, contributing $15 billion to the U.S. economy every year.

The urgency hasn’t been placed on reducing bee habitat fragmentation or curbing the use of agricultural pesticides that have sparked a huge loss in colonies. Instead, the United States has taken a technological approach to curb pollinator losses and avoid changing lifestyle habits altogether.

An insulting mark of bees as infrastructure and replaceable technology has shifted the importance of bees from one of ensuring food security to agricultural profit, underscoring the profit-driven mindset amid an environmental crisis.

This leads us to question whether potential solutions exist to protect bees for pollination or to ensure monopolies have cheap, ready-to-use pesticides at their disposal. As the Environmental Protection Agency reports, “certain pesticides are harmful to bees,” further stating their measures and guidelines for “protecting bees” on product labels.

Here’s the question: If the EPA knows that certain pesticides are harmful to bee colonies, why are we still using them?

Here’s my answer: profit and influence.

As agribusiness attempts to maximize yields while cutting costs, cheap pesticides will continue to be used alongside monetary incentives towards the EPA to turn a blind eye to the scope of the problem. Under the current presidential administration, we see a reversal of any progress made when deregulation is placed in their hands.

Recently, institutions and research labs, in attempts to address growing colony losses, have begun developing artificial pollinator technologies to tackle the growing strain on pollination.

Under the status quo, can we expect the needed changes to occur? Here’s the short answer: no. As development and research ramp up through robot bees and artificial replacements to native pollinators, we are going in the wrong direction.

What this does is move the use and importance of bees away from their environmental importance, crucial during a time when more emphasis on environmental protection is needed.

What is so appalling about the development of pollinator technologies is the lack of actual credibility or accountability towards anthropogenic causes of bee habitat losses and colony decline. Instead of changing consumption patterns, the United States has encouraged technological advancements that have no long-term stability.

The effectiveness of artificial intelligence replacements or modified bees is dependent on specific environmental conditions and infrastructure. Natural bees are far more efficient and effective in saving and preventing gaps in pollination. In simple terms, protecting bee habitats or changing pesticide usage is far easier than developing and pouring countless dollars into artificial replacements.

To achieve true environmental sustainability and ecological solvency, actual bees need to be prioritized, and all parties must be held accountable for degrading actions. The solvency of the American agricultural industry and food security across the globe rely on the pollination of bees.

A reality that most farmers can not afford new technologies only furthers the dominance of agricultural monopolies, creating inequalities that could be avoided by simply preserving natural resources and bee populations.

To protect our crops from the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and consumption, the U.S. needs to prioritize the ecosystems of pollinators over human demands to avoid the same fate as 14 million years ago.

Without the honey bee, our democracy and values shift from one of the American dream of freedom and prosperity, to a reality of scarcity, degradation and denial.

Protecting the honey bee is as essential as protecting our democracy and the industry on which our country was founded. To be better, accountability and action need to be taken at the root cause of the decline in bee colonies.

As the first year of working under this new strategy wraps up, growers may still have questions about how these changes will affect their operations. Here is an update and overview to help growers prepare for 2026.

Strategy Overview

The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in place since the 1970s; but in April 2022, the EPA began outlining its plan to meet ESA requirements. The primary focus has been on managing spray drift and runoff to reduce the risk of exposure to endangered species. The draft Herbicide Strategy was released in 2023 and finalized in 2024.

The new ESA language must now be included on labels beginning with new active ingredients and as actives are re-registered.

According to the EPA, the final strategy uses the most updated information and processes to determine whether an herbicide will impact a listed species and identify protections to address any impacts. Over time, all crop protection products will carry this language. The Insecticide Strategy was finalized this spring, and the Fungicide Strategy is still in development.

WinField® United has worked closely with industry associations, scientific organizations and our retail partners to advocate that the EPA’s decisions were grounded in sound science and that practical, workable solutions made it to the field.

Impacts on Growers

While there may be implications, this isn’t a fire drill. Not all product labels are immediately subject to the ESA or have the ESA language. It’s an ongoing integration process tied to new products and re-registration.

There are only a couple of labels that currently show the ESA language; and more than likely, it is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution. Depending on the risk bucket and the characteristics of the product, growers may see different mitigations for drift and runoff as well as varying buffer lengths. How it is executed on each label may also be a little bit different.

As new products come out, growers should make sure to read the label and familiarize themselves with the new language ahead of the growing season.

Growers also may have to implement additional mitigation measures, such as spray buffers or conservation practices, to minimize environmental impact. They can get ahead of this by characterizing fields and identifying any existing practices that qualify as mitigations. We assume, for many growers, their fields may already check most of the boxes for the points needed.

A Simple Solution to Help Boost Herbicide Performance

If growers need a drift mitigation option for herbicides affected by the ESA, the new SuperLock™ adjuvant from WinField United fits the bill. This novel, single formulation combines a high surfactant crop oil concentrate with proprietary drift reduction technology. It is one of the only products on the market with this combination.

One of our goals was to provide another product that meets label requirements while effectively tackling the challenge of drift management. From an ESA standpoint, SuperLock adjuvant fits in the oil emulsion category, which is a drift-reducing adjuvant category currently approved under the Herbicide Strategy. This makes it a valuable tank-mix tool to help manage drift for many growers.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt55544e1947d08b8e/690c47f6b95521970fd20835/25-WIN-1273_CP-SuperLock-13_FEATURE_1920x1080.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-01 09:00:55.525336

Booming St. Thomas, buoyed by Volkswagen’s arrival, and gloomy Ingersoll, a town where General Motors has pulled in its horns, are a relative stone’s throw apart. Yet the two are worlds apart in the anxiety about the future – both excitement and worry – that’s sweeping Southwestern Ontario’s auto belt, a backbone of one of the province’s most important industries.

Much of the uncertainty stems from President Donald Trump’s push to bring manufacturing jobs to the U.S. from abroad, potentially disrupting a Canadian industry tightly integrated with the U.S. and Mexico. Before Trump’s return to the White House, and the trade tensions that followed his tariffs and threatened tariffs against American trading partners, Ontario built about 1.3 million vehicles a year mainly for export to the U.S.

The unique capabilities of iron-air batteries The primary limitation of lithium-ion technology is its duration.
By offering a duration that is orders of magnitude longer than conventional batteries, iron-air systems can replace fossil fuel peaker plants.
Iron-air batteries sidestep this scarcity trap entirely as they are made using only abundant, inexpensive materials – iron, air and water.","“The most exciting clean tech innovation of 2025? It might just be rust.”

That is the assessment of Mark Loveridge, Commercial Director of Renewable Exchange. But Mark’s enthusiasm doesn’t have anything to do with old bike chains or an oven in need of a deep clean.

Instead, people like Mark are getting very excited about the role that rust could play in mitigating climate change.

The problem with renewable energy systems as things stand is, unlike fossil fuels, renewable energies like solar and wind are difficult to store in the quantities we need.

This means that when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow, energy supplies run low.

The renewable energy storage problem

For decades, the energy storage conversation has been ruled by the lithium-ion cell, a technology that powers everything from our mobile phones to electric vehicles.

But with 2025 drawing to a close, a chemically distinct contender has emerged from the laboratory to the electrical grid.

""After decades of dominance by lithium-ion, 2025 is potentially the turning point for long-duration energy storage (LDES), and iron-air batteries are leading the charge,"" Mark says.

The premise is elegantly simple, in the way that the world’s best inventions often are. These batteries harness the process of reversible rusting.

During discharge, the battery ""breathes"" in oxygen from the air which converts iron pellets into rust and releases energy.

To charge, an electrical current turns the rust back into metallic iron and the battery ""exhales"" oxygen.

The unique capabilities of iron-air batteries

The primary limitation of lithium-ion technology is its duration.

While excellent for short bursts of power lasting two to four hours, lithium-ion becomes prohibitively expensive when trying to bridge multi-day gaps in renewable generation.

This is where iron-air technology finds its niche.

""They're capable of storing energy for 100+ hours - enabling wind and solar to keep the lights on, even when the sun doesn’t shine or the wind doesn’t blow,"" Mark explains.

By offering a duration that is orders of magnitude longer than conventional batteries, iron-air systems can replace fossil fuel peaker plants.

""Ideal for grid-scale decarbonisation, especially during multi-day renewable lulls,"" Mark adds.

From theory to practice

The technology has moved rapidly from theoretical models to concrete infrastructure this year.

""This year, Ore Energy in the Netherlands delivered the world’s first grid-connected iron-air battery, and Form Energy in the US raised over US$400m to bring this tech to commercial scale,"" Mark says.

The Ore Energy pilot, connected to the grid in Delft in July 2025, represents a crucial proof of concept for the European market.

It demonstrates that these systems can be integrated safely into dense urban environments.

Across the Atlantic, Form Energy has operationalised its commercial-scale factory in Weirton, West Virginia, on the site of a former steel mill.

The company is currently fulfilling orders for major utilities, including Xcel Energy and Georgia Power, with projects expected to come online in late 2025 and 2026.

The geopolitics of abundance

Beyond the technical specifications, the iron-air battery offers a significant geopolitical advantage.

The transition to clean energy has often meant trading a dependency on fossil fuels for a dependency on rare earth minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel – all of which are growing scarcer and more contested.

Iron-air batteries sidestep this scarcity trap entirely as they are made using only abundant, inexpensive materials – iron, air and water.

This abundance translates to stability and security for national energy strategies, reducing conflict and streamlining supply chains.

What’s more, the environmental profile of these batteries aligns closely with circular economy principles simply because their active materials are non-toxic and easily recyclable at the end of the system's life.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/924f9c4aec2cbdefa276e5955b807c30:de82df3e099ad2a5a538121a8fe9b10e/iron-air-battery-arrays-can-be-built-at-huge-scales.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:05:28.422173

Less than 20% of applications to the Innovation Fund are successful, according to the presentation.
Leon de Graaf of the Brussels-based consultancy Sustainable Public Affairs, said the Innovation Fund “clearly serves a purpose”.
The commission has estimated that about €40bn could flow from the ETS into the Innovation Fund by 2030.","The EU has only paid out a fraction of the money it says it has committed for green technologies, as companies spend up to 3,000 hours and an average €85,000 to access funds from a flagship programme.

Of €7.1bn awarded from the bloc’s Innovation Fund since it was established in 2021, only 4.7% has been paid out to companies because of the red tape required to access the money, according to European Commission figures.

The application process is also extremely lengthy and bureaucratic. In an internal presentation this month, seen by the Financial Times, the commission said that 77% of those seeking funding had to subcontract parts of the application process to consultants because of the “high burden”.

Average administrative costs were €85,000 per application, it said, even higher than the average €32,000 spent to access the EU’s research grant scheme, Horizon Europe.

Less than 20% of applications to the Innovation Fund are successful, according to the presentation. Of the projects that had been awarded grants, only 6% were operational, while 15 to 20% face delays.

The hold-ups in disbursing the funds are the latest example of how bureaucracy is stifling the EU’s competitiveness. In a major report last year, the former European Central Bank governor Mario Draghi said that administrative burdens were one of the main reasons for Europe’s “static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines”.

The Innovation Fund, which uses revenues generated from the bloc’s emissions trading system, is one of the world’s largest financing programmes “for the demonstration of innovative low-carbon technologies”, the commission claims.

It was touted as one of the main funding platforms to help the bloc compete with the US after former president Joe Biden announced $369bn of funding and tax credits for green technologies through the Inflation Reduction Act.

‘Very low success rate’

Victor van Hoorn, director of trade body Cleantech for Europe, said some businesses have reported spending 3,000 hours on applications to the Innovation Fund — if carried out by one person alone this would be equivalent to more than a year and a half based on the EU’s 36-hour average working week.

“The biggest challenge [we hear] is the amount of resources, the amount of documentation and all of that for a frankly very low success rate,” said van Hoorn.

Eoin Condren, executive director for corporate development at cement company Ecocem, said for its last application to the fund, it had an entire team dedicated to it for five months “costing hundreds of thousands of euros”.

“Large companies can absorb that, but smaller firms developing breakthrough technologies can’t,” he added.

Condren also noted that much of the money went to “big umbrella technologies like [carbon capture and storage] and green hydrogen . . . yet these large, often lossmaking projects are notoriously hard to finance, causing long delays in actually deploying funds”.

An EU official said the low payment rate reflected “the normal or expected implementation milestones for Innovation Fund projects”, adding that “first-of-a-kind projects generally also need more time to reach financial close, be built and enter into operation compared to, for example, research projects”.

“While the application process is demanding, it is also an opportunity to improve the project and the effort is commensurate with the size of the support that is offered,” the official added.

Difficult market conditions

Another issue with the fund is that market conditions in Europe make it difficult even for companies that receive grants to establish themselves and turn a profit.

Vianode, a company making low-carbon synthetic graphite for electric vehicle batteries, was awarded a €90mn grant in 2023 but decided not to go through with its European facility because of the flood of cheap Chinese graphite into the market. It instead set up in Canada, where it secured an offtake agreement with General Motors.

“In the end it comes down to what price you can compete for and with the Chinese dominance, the European market is very, very challenging for us now. It’s different in North America: there the battery producers have an incentive to choose non-Chinese,” said Andreas Forfang, vice-president for sustainability and public affairs at Vianode.

Leon de Graaf of the Brussels-based consultancy Sustainable Public Affairs, said the Innovation Fund “clearly serves a purpose”. Its application rounds were often several times subscribed, he said, adding that “the way the money is currently given is not fit for purpose”.

The commission has estimated that about €40bn could flow from the ETS into the Innovation Fund by 2030.

But van Hoorn said the small proportion that had so far been paid out showed that “most money is just sitting there due to complex milestones” resulting in a “huge opportunity cost” for the EU.",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/3yre6k-2025-chevrolet-equinox-ev-front-left-4.26.25.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/2025_Chevrolet_Equinox_EV_front_left_4.26.25.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:53.746728

As President Donald Trump nears the end of his second term’s first year, policies he’s implemented will affect how that plays out.

“They're really just taking a fine-tooth comb and looking at every single thing — whether that be justifiable, whether that be a knee-jerk reaction to, ‘Well this came out of the previous administration, so we want to see it,’” an EPA employee who works on water issues said while discussing how the Trump administration oversees the department.

Radio IQ is not identifying the federal employee — who’s been with the agency for more than 20 years — to protect them from potential retribution for speaking with media.

During the recent government shutdown, the employee said all functions of the department critical to public health remained in operation. They added that EPA leadership has been clear that the department will “be doing things that we are statutorily required to do.”

That doesn’t mean the tenor of the office hasn’t changed.

“Let's say, we've got a proposal or a project that is focused on providing resources and information related to climate change effects,” they said. “Instead of focusing on ‘climate change,’ let's talk about ‘extreme weather events.’ We've been talking [about] ‘sunny day flooding.’ … It's climate-change effects, but we don't just say the blanket term, ‘climate change.’”

Dozens of executive orders and federal policy changes have impacted funding for environmental initiatives, but the EPA employee said it’s going to take more time to see the real effects of those adjustments.

The changes are still being assessed in Virginia, too.

“We don't yet have that full picture of how all of the programs we rely on will be impacted,” said Adrienne Kotula, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, while discussing the impact of changing federal funding on cleanup measures. “We're certainly keeping track of it at the federal level on a case-by-case basis. But the full scope of everything is yet to be seen.”

Another unknown is the availability and accuracy of federal data; Kotula pointed specifically to information from the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. She said the annual release of pertinent data is just beginning and she’d “start taking the longer view of what's available to us, and how we need to adjust moving forward — and whether or not that's necessary.”

In that vacuum, state lawmakers have begun prefiling proposed legislation for the upcoming General Assembly session that begins on Jan. 14. Among those bills are a few introduced by Democrats focused on energy efficiency and home weatherization, as well as allowing solar canopy requirements in some nonresidential parking developments.

In contrast, Republican lawmakers are aiming to repeal some restrictions on single-use polystyrene food containers and ease penalties on utilities if they’re unable to meet renewable energy portfolio standards.

Trump has maintained his policies will bring down utility bills, though recent data refutes that. The administration also has asserted lower gasoline prices are the result of its “commitment to American energy production.”

A former advisor to President George W. Bush recently told Politico that Trump “could claim an assist, not a total responsibility, for lower oil prices.”

“The actions that this administration is taking [has] set us back decades,” said Lee Francis, chief program and communications officer at the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. “The ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ reversed almost entirely the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the biggest piece of climate legislation ever passed in our nation's history. And in doing so, it undermined … investment in Virginia, set us back years on our climate goals and is going to raise energy costs.”

Francis interpreted November’s election results to mean voters were concerned about affordability and energy costs, swinging control of state government to Democrats after four years under Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.

After decades as a federal worker, the EPA employee seemed familiar with that kind of shift: “Every four years, it's going to swing back in the other direction to a certain extent … . Because that's what's going to happen. I mean, that always happens.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ecc3383/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3968x2083+0+281/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2Fb7%2Fa2d7fea744be9fe5bebe5c14e93f%2Fap22073812303281.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:06:21.324062

The report provides recommendations for South Korea to mitigate supply chain carbon risks and strengthen the competitiveness of its tech industry.
Key measures include establishing a public-private supply chain carbon risk management system, improving access to renewable energy, and removing bottlenecks in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).
Additional recommendations call for devising financial support through government-backed funds, tax rebates, and low-interest loans to address supply chain carbon risks, as well as developing a domestic ETS market and strengthening international decarbonisation initiatives.
For additional information: Navigating supply chain carbon risks in South Korea","Scope 1 emissions are associated with direct inputs to a production process and are under the control of a manufacturing company. Scope 2 emissions arise indirectly from purchased energy and inputs needed to produce a product, and Scope 3 emissions represent the embedded carbon from Scope 1 and 2 activities that were required to manufacture finished goods.

“The inclusion of indirect GHG emissions, such as Scope 2 and 3, could substantially increase supply chain carbon risks, including investment aversion, higher carbon cost exposure, and counterparty and reputational risks” said report author Michelle (Chaewon) Kim, IEEFA’s Energy Finance Specialist, South Korea.

IEEFA’s analysis shows that South Korea’s leading chip maker, Samsung Device Solutions (DS), recorded Scope 1–3 emissions of approximately 41 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2024 - the highest among seven major global tech companies — with a carbon intensity of 539 tCO2e per USD million of revenue.

Another South Korean chip manufacturer, SK Hynix, recorded a carbon intensity of around 246 tCO2e/USD million.

These emission levels compare unfavourably with those of the global Big Tech companies purchasing these chips. For example, Apple has a carbon intensity of around 37 tCO2e/USD million, while Google and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have carbon intensities of 67 tCO2e/USD million and 107 tCO2e/USD million, respectively.

These reflect their global strategies to maximise clean energy use and minimise GHG intensity across complete supply chains.

South Korea’s economy is highly dependent on international trade, which accounts for approximately 70 percent of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Intensifying supply chain carbon risks could significantly impact national economic viability.

The report examines how carbon regulations, including carbon taxes, emissions trading systems (ETSs), the European Union’s (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), and voluntary carbon management initiatives, could undermine South Korea’s export competitiveness by increasing domestic carbon costs.

Although semiconductors are currently exempt from the EU CBAM, and Scope 2 and 3 are omitted, their inclusion in the future could impose significant expense.

IEEFA estimates that South Korean chip importers could face approximately $588 million (KRW847 billion) in CBAM certificate expenses between 2026 and 2034.

“The sharp increase in CBAM costs may prompt European importers to switch their chip suppliers from high-emission South Korean producers to low-carbon suppliers” added Ms Kim.

IEEFA conducted a scenario-based case study, assuming the inclusion of semiconductors in the EU CBAM’s scope.

The analysis estimates the CBAM certificate costs using an Embedded Emission Factor (EEF) that covers the entire supply chain (Scope 1–3). It applies an embedded carbon intensity based on value rather than mass, using annual GHG emissions and revenues to determine the value-based EEF, reflecting the lightweight and high-value characteristics of semiconductors.

“An estimated $162 million (KRW233 billion) of CBAM certificate expenses could be incurred in 2034 under the high EU ETS scenario” said Ms Kim. This equates to 9.9 percent of the total chip exports to the EU.

Investors are increasingly excluding carbon-intensive companies from their portfolios, which could limit access to financing for high-carbon emitters, raising the cost of capital and reducing corporate valuations.

According to IEEFA’s analysis, if Scope 2 and 3 emissions were included in the South Korean ETS, Samsung DS’s carbon costs under the current 10 percent paid allocation system would be $26 million.

If free allowances are removed and companies pay 100 percent of their allocation in the future, the ETS expenditure could increase tenfold to $264 million.

Rising carbon costs in liquefied natural gas (LNG)-powered semiconductor clusters and fossil fuel-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) data centres could further increase counterparty risks and production expenses, particularly if LNG is later included in the CBAM scope.

High-emission companies risk exclusion from global supply chains. Countries heavily reliant on fossil fuels may also face the ‘exodus risk’ of companies relocating to more low-carbon-friendly nations.

Leading global tech companies are adopting low-carbon supply chain strategies to reduce indirect Scope 3 emissions, such as Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Programme and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSMC) Collective Procurement Programme.

The report provides recommendations for South Korea to mitigate supply chain carbon risks and strengthen the competitiveness of its tech industry.

Key measures include establishing a public-private supply chain carbon risk management system, improving access to renewable energy, and removing bottlenecks in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS).

Additional recommendations call for devising financial support through government-backed funds, tax rebates, and low-interest loans to address supply chain carbon risks, as well as developing a domestic ETS market and strengthening international decarbonisation initiatives.

As the demand for renewable energy solutions continues to surge, the industry is battling a widening skills gap that must be addressed quickly to meet global carbon emission goals.

In this blog, we delve into the pressing issue of talent shortages within the renewable energy sector, examining the causes, implications, and viable solutions to ensure companies and stakeholders are well-equipped to thrive in this rapidly changing industry.

The Energy Transition

The energy transition refers to the global shift from traditional, carbon-intensive energy sources to sustainable and renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal. Governments, businesses, and communities are pushing this shift to cut emissions and fight climate change. As a result, the energy landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, as the diversification of energy sources calls for rapid industry growth.

This increased focus on renewable energy has created a surge in demand for skilled professionals with expertise in areas such as solar panel installation, wind turbine maintenance, energy storage systems, and grid integration. There’s a growing need for specialised talent to design, build, operate, and maintain renewable energy infrastructure. As a result, traditional energy companies, as well as new entrants in the renewable sector, are aggressively competing for a limited pool of qualified candidates.

The growth rate in the energy transition also outpaces the learning and development of candidates who lack the necessary skills and expertise. The evolution of technologies and regulations in the renewable energy space is forcing the industry to adapt quickly, often leaving a gap for professionals with up-to-date knowledge and qualifications. Equally, the retirement of experienced workers from the conventional energy sector and the inadequate pipeline of new talent entering the renewable energy workforce have made the shortage of skilled labour much more significant.

Advancing Technologies and Innovation

Advancing technologies and innovation in renewable energy have undoubtedly revolutionised the industry, but have also created a significant skills gap and talent shortage. Renewable technologies like solar, wind, and storage are evolving fast - faster than the workforce can keep up. capable of implementing, maintaining, and advancing these technologies. As a result, companies in the renewable energy sector are facing a shortage of qualified professionals with the necessary expertise to drive these innovations forward.

Traditional educational programmes and workforce development initiatives have struggled to keep pace with these changes, leading to a shortage of professionals with the right skills and knowledge.

Equally, the increasing complexity of renewable energy systems requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise in engineering, data analytics, cybersecurity, and project management. This demand for a diverse skill set further exacerbates the talent shortage as companies struggle to find individuals with the necessary combination of technical, analytical, and strategic capabilities.

Navigating Talent Shortages to Ensure Secure Renewable Pipelines

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the world will need to create 14 million new renewable energy jobs by 2030 and move another 16 million workers to renewable energy roles. To grow sustainably, companies need to tackle the talent shortage head-on. . As the demand for renewable jobs continues to outpace the supply of skilled professionals, companies must focus on attracting, developing, and retaining top talent.

Investing and Nurturing Talent

Investing in specialised training programmes, partnerships with educational institutions, and apprenticeship initiatives can help build a pipeline of skilled workers equipped to meet the industry's evolving needs. Additionally, fostering a culture of continuous learning and professional development within the organisation can empower existing employees to upskill and adapt to the changing technological landscape.

Not only does this train any new recruits into the industry, but it also offers those in different sectors with a wealth of experience the chance to diversify from other energy industries and bring the skills and knowledge they already have to the renewable sector.

Time and cost are real concerns - but the sooner companies invest in training, the faster they’ll build a strong talent pipeline.. One of the key offerings that companies can provide is specialised technical training. Courses on solar power systems, wind turbine technology, energy storage solutions, and other renewable energy technologies equip individuals with in-depth knowledge. With this expertise, they can effectively contribute to the design, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.

Learning and development can provide access to up-to-date information on industry standards, policies, and best practices, ensuring that talent is well-informed and compliant with industry requirements.

Mentorship and coaching programmes can also be invaluable for talent development. Companies can facilitate mentorship opportunities with seasoned professionals in the renewable energy sector, providing guidance and insight to support the career growth of less-experienced individuals.

Defining Company Culture

Defining a compelling employer brand and nurturing a distinct company culture can be the difference between attracting top-tier talent and falling behind the competition.

Renewable energy talent is drawn to organisations that cultivate a positive, inclusive, and supportive work environment. A company's mission, vision, and values should not just be words on paper but resonate authentically in every interaction and initiative.

Culture shapes every part of the employee experience—from hiring to retention. Prioritising cultural fit is paramount when it comes to renewable energy recruitment. During any talent acquisition efforts, companies should emphasise the importance of their culture and align it alongside the skills and experience they require to attract their ideal candidates.

EVP

An employer value proposition (EVP) encapsulates the unique rewards and benefits that differentiate a company from its competitors. By pinpointing organisational strengths, such as distinctive benefits, an inclusive company culture, unparalleled career growth avenues, or flexible work structures, companies can craft a compelling EVP that delivers an authentic look at what working life will be like for the next new employee.

EVP pairs closely with the employer brand. A robust employer brand celebrates diversity, champions innovation, and prioritises employee well-being. To attract top talent and potential hires, companies should prominently spotlight these attributes on their websites, social media, job descriptions, and throughout the interview process.

Note: An EVP is only as impactful as its reach. Ensure EVP permeates all company touchpoints, from job postings and websites to social media channels. An EVP that stands out can significantly amplify talent attraction strategy.

Authentic employer branding begins with the current workforce. Employees naturally evolve into brand ambassadors when they feel valued, engaged, and genuinely content in their roles. Their enthusiasm and pride amplify an employer brand, which will help companies build a reputation as a go-to employer within the industry.

One study found that around 70% of prospective employees would turn down job opportunities if the company offering the position had a bad reputation—even if they were out of work. This emphasises the need to invest in and uphold a stellar employer brand rooted in genuine employee experiences and organisational values.

Benefits also play a key role. These could include a competitive salary, bonuses, annual leave, health insurance, hybrid working, and more.

Streamlining Talent Acquisition Strategies

As competition for attracting top talent in the renewable energy recruitment space grows, streamlining the talent acquisition strategy is another step towards increasing your chances of hiring the people you require, whether permanent or contract.

Speed matters. In today’s market, delays can cost you the best candidates. By refining and accelerating the recruitment process, companies can swiftly identify, engage with, and onboard the best talent before competitors get there first.

Analysing the existing process and identifying any bottlenecks is key to speeding up the process. This could be the time it takes to get back to a candidate to offer them a position, potentially taking too long to post job specs or review candidate CVs. Once it’s been determined what could be costing the most time and resources, companies should optimise these without compromising the integrity of their hiring standards.

First impressions matter: As part of the strategy for attracting talent, it's crucial to remember that this is a candidate's first interaction with an organisation - and first impressions count. An efficient, organised, and transparent hiring process instils confidence in candidates and bolsters an organisation's reputation in the talent market.

Thinking about first impressions isn't just referring to the interview stage, where a company meets the candidate for the first time in person or through a virtual call. Their first impression could come at any moment, from renewable energy job specs, social posts, websites or through word of mouth. Ensuring a brand gives off the right impression across all channels is vital, as you never know when a candidate could be interacting with the company and gaining a first impression.

The Job Listing Experience

Streamlining the application process demonstrates respect for candidates' time and enhances their overall experience with the organisation. For in-demand talent, a seamless job process can be a decisive factor in choosing one employer over another.

Transparent job advertisements are crucial for attracting qualified candidates and building trust with potential employees.

By clearly outlining the job responsibilities, requirements, and company culture, transparent job adverts set realistic expectations and ensure that candidates understand what the role entails. This transparency not only helps attract candidates whose skills and values align with the position but also reduces the likelihood of mismatches and turnover, which in turn causes further delays in securing the best talent.

While job boards remain crucial to talent acquisition, the sheer volume can be overwhelming for active and passive candidates. Strategically selecting platforms that align with the renewable industry nuances and the specific roles being targeted will lead to a more robust talent pool better fitted to the required roles.

In today's digital age, leveraging social media also amplifies the reach of job posts. Platforms like LinkedIn, X, and industry-specific forums can serve as excellent channels to showcase job vacancies, reaching passive and active job seekers alike.

Attracting top talent is about being clear, specific, and compelling - right from the job post. . A well-articulated job description can be the first step in forging meaningful connections with potential hires, setting the stage for successful collaborations in the renewable energy industry.

Finding the Right Partner

For a company, getting talent acquisition right can be an impossible task. The specialised nature of roles within the renewable energy sector often demands candidates with a unique blend of technical expertise, industry-specific knowledge, and a deep understanding of sustainability practices. This requires a rigorous talent acquisition process, which many companies don’t have the time or expertise for.

A high-performing hiring team is instrumental in attracting top talent. Therefore, companies need to ensure their HR and recruitment teams are equipped with the necessary tools, training, and resources to execute their roles effectively.

Many organisations turn to recruitment process outsourcing (RPO) as a partner to support with talent acquisition. These organisations can offer their vast expertise to ensure these technical roles are filled quickly and compliantly. Often, they also have an extensive talent pool already.

A staffing provider can offer invaluable support to a company grappling with talent demands in several ways:

Specialised Recruitment Expertise: RPO providers are equipped with specialised knowledge and expertise in identifying and attracting top talent in various fields, including renewable energy. They can efficiently source, screen, and present qualified candidates, saving the company time and resources in the hiring process.

Access to a Diverse Talent Pool: These providers often have access to a vast network of professionals, including those with specialised skills in renewable energy technologies and sustainability. This can significantly expand the company's options and increase the likelihood of finding the right fit for their specific talent needs quickly.

Flexibility and Scalability: They can offer flexible staffing solutions to help companies manage fluctuating talent demands. Whether the need is for short-term project-based roles or long-term strategic positions, staffing providers can tailor their services to meet the company's evolving requirements.

Industry Insights: A reputable staffing provider with experience in the renewable energy sector can offer valuable industry insights, including salary trends, in-demand skills, and talent market dynamics. This information can guide the company in making informed decisions about its talent acquisition and retention strategies.

(TSX:NDM)(NYSE American:NAK) (""Northern Dynasty"" or the ""Company"") and its 100%-owned U.S.-based subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership (""Pebble Partnership"") announce that the National Mining Association (""NMA""), the American Exploration & Mining Association (""AEMA""), the Alaska Mining Association (""AMA"") and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the ""Chamber"") have filed Amicus Briefs in the Alaska Federal Court in support of one of the largest undeveloped copper projects in the world, located in the U.S., which is being blocked by an illegal Obama/Biden veto.

""We appreciate the important support from the NMA, the AEMA, the AMA and the Chamber, as we fight back against the injustice of the illegal Obama/Biden-era veto,"" Ron Thiessen, Northern Dynasty President and CEO stated. ""The Obama EPA dreamed up this scheme to handicap future mining activity in the U.S., and the Biden EPA put this injustice into action without regard to the economic harm it could cause to all Americans.""

The NMA, AEMA and AMA summarize their argument with:

""…This case is exceptionally important to amici's members, the mining industry, and the nation's economy. The proposed mine-which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has unlawfully vetoed-will provide a crucial source of copper for construction, transportation, electrical and electronic projects, industrial machinery, and defense applications. Copper also plays an inextricable role in nearly all forms of renewable energy. The EPA's aggressive and unprecedented use of a regulatory veto comes just as the world prepares for a global shortage of copper and other minerals due to the surging demands of digitalization and electrification. While the United States has one of the world's greatest mineral repositories, the ability to get those minerals into the supply chain to help meet America's needs is threatened by crippling regulatory uncertainty, including the overly broad nature of EPA's asserted authority.

The misuse of EPA's veto authority casts a cloud over mining projects in Alaska and beyond. Regulatory obstacles to mineral development harm not only the U.S. mining industry, but also domestic manufacturing, innovation, and security… Amici and their members need certainty in the federal regulatory landscape governing mining operations and urge the Court to hold EPA to its statutory mandate and to prior interpretations and practice.""

Major arguments in the Chamber's brief include:

""…EPA vetoed a permit that is a crucial prerequisite for construction of the Pebble Mine...without considering the significant financial consequences of that veto for the project proponents, the State, and the national economy...""

""…Congress' instruction to EPA in Section 404(c)-that the agency evaluate whether effects are ""unacceptable"" before exercising backstop authority-is a paradigmatic demand that regulation proceed only after a reasoned consideration of costs. The statutory term ""unacceptable"" rivals those adjectives that the Supreme Court has already determined to ""naturally"" embrace a consideration of costs before an agency chooses to regulate…""

""…EPA ignored these principles by straining to read the word ""unacceptable"" out of Section 404(c). But the sheer ingenuity of the agency's reading underscores that it cannot be the ""best"" interpretation of Section 404(c) and therefore cannot justify EPA's decision…""

""…EPA's approach would turn the principles of reasoned decision-making inside out. It would encourage agencies not only to view the consequences of their actions through a keyhole-ignoring even sizeable costs of those actions-but also to shield that evaluation behind the Potemkin rationale of an ""alternative basis."" The upshot would be bad regulation badly explained. Nobody is well served when EPA erases a project of Pebble's magnitude and importance after (at most) feigning to check the price tag, and project developers, in particular, are likely to confront a chilled investment climate and other injuries to their reliance interests if the agency's approach is upheld…""

""...The Court should set aside EPA's veto and emphasize the importance of considering costs to determinations made under Section 404(c)…""

However, Alcolumbre scheduled a vote just hours after Lula nominated Attorney General Jorge Messias to the open seat on the Supreme Court.
After clearing the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the Lower House.
Other issues that could be challenged include the weakening of the National Public Security Fund (FNSP) and the funding of the National Anti-Drug Fund (FUNAD).
Despite talks about appealing to the Supreme Court, Lula often publicly argues that the government should avoid judicializing disputes.","The tense relationship between the Executive branch and Congress has led President Lula’s administration to reassess its strategy and increasingly see the Judiciary as a safe haven against potential setbacks imposed by lawmakers.

Recently, as tensions between the branches have escalated, the government has begun to consider bringing at least three cases to court after facing defeats in the Lower House and the Senate. However, this approach contradicts President Lula’s repeated message that the government should avoid litigation in politics.

One of the issues that may be brought to the Supreme Court is in the economic field. Last week, the Finance Ministry’s number two, Dario Durigan, indicated that the government is considering whether to go to court if Congress advances so-called “fiscal bomb” proposals—measures with severe negative effects on government finances.

His remarks came days after the Senate approved a supplementary bill with a multibillion fiscal impact that regulates the special retirement rules for community health agents and endemic-control workers. The bill guarantees these workers retirement at their last full salary (integrality) with adjustments equal to those granted to active civil servants (parity), and it establishes their own age and service-time requirements. The proposal is criticized by public-finance experts and is seen as a dangerous precedent for the sustainability of Brazil’s pension system.

Initially, the government was optimistic that the bill would not be brought to the floor by Senate President Davi Alcolumbre, who had been considered an ally of the Lula administration in Congress. However, Alcolumbre scheduled a vote just hours after Lula nominated Attorney General Jorge Messias to the open seat on the Supreme Court.

After clearing the Senate, the bill now proceeds to the Lower House. Some government members argue there is still room to negotiate the details, but they are also preparing for litigation amid rising tensions and no signs of de-escalation.

Although the Finance Ministry had already opposed the proposal, it passed without any dissenting votes or speeches, uniting members of both allied and opposition parties. In response, Durigan said on the 26th that the three branches “cannot throw everything away” after a joint effort by all institutions.

Another issue considered crucial for the administration is the environmental licensing bill. On Thursday (27), Congress overturned 52 of the 63 vetoes issued by Lula. The move was mainly driven by the agribusiness caucus and business sectors opposed to the vetoes. The government had long expected the possibility of the vetoes being overturned, but Congress postponed the session until after COP30—the climate conference held in Belém this month—in an attempt to minimize damage to the Legislature’s image.

A vote on the remaining vetoes was delayed indefinitely. As a result, most of the new Environmental Licensing Law—approved by Congress in July and criticized by environmentalists and the federal government’s environmental agency—now takes effect.

Lula is set to discuss the issue with the Environment Ministry and the Chief of Staff Office to explore legal options and potential actions. Environmental groups and left-wing parties have already threatened to bring the overturned vetoes to the Supreme Court.

A third proposal on the Executive branch’s radar is the anti-gang bill. The version drafted by rapporteur Guilherme Derrite was approved in the Lower House on the 18th, despite the government’s efforts to revise several parts of the report. The Planalto Palace now hopes to reverse the outcome in the Senate, but it already acknowledges, behind the scenes, that it has grounds to challenge key sections of Derrite’s report in court if the bill moves forward in its current form and reaches the president for signature.

The government’s main arguments are outlined in a report prepared by the Justice Ministry and obtained by Valor. The document states, for example, that the lawmaker’s proposal would violate the Fiscal Responsibility Law (LRF). Other issues that could be challenged include the weakening of the National Public Security Fund (FNSP) and the funding of the National Anti-Drug Fund (FUNAD). There is also debate over whether Derrite can redesign these constitutionally mandated security funds using ordinary law.

Turning to the courts is not new for the Lula administration. In July, at the president’s own request, the Attorney General’s Office (AGU) filed a petition with the Supreme Court to reinstate the decree that increased the Tax on Financial Transactions (IOF) rates. At the time, Messias argued that Congress violated the separation of powers by overturning an executive decree and that AGU’s only option was to “defend” the president’s autonomy.

Despite talks about appealing to the Supreme Court, Lula often publicly argues that the government should avoid judicializing disputes. At the start of his third term on January 27, during a meeting with governors, he said he would “work and talk extensively” to ensure each branch has the autonomy to carry out its functions. He then told party leaders to avoid “litigating politics.”

“We are responsible for so much litigation,” Lula said at the time. “When we lose something in Congress, instead of accepting the rules of democratic play—that the majority wins—we appeal to another branch to see if we can win there.” He added, “We need to stop doing politics this way, because it leads the Judiciary to intrude on the Legislative and start legislating in Congress’s place.”

In 2025, Lula reaffirmed that stance. At the opening of the 26th March to Brasília in Defense of Municipalities in May, he urged mayors and lawmakers to settle federal disputes “at the negotiating table, not in the courts.” He added: “Issues should only go to the Judiciary when our political capacity is exhausted—when we show ourselves unable to continue negotiating to find a peaceful solution.”

Despite the government’s apparent contradiction of turning to the courts, experts interviewed by Valor say the move makes sense when Congress violates the Constitution. “It is absolutely consistent to appeal to the Supreme Court, particularly when Congress pushes political issues forward in the face of constitutional prohibitions. One example is the conditional impossibility of granting amnesty,” said Fernando Augusto Fernandes, a researcher and attorney with a PhD in Political Science at the Federal Fluminense University (UFF). “We must distinguish litigation from the unconstitutional politicization of Congress’s relationship with the Executive branch,” Fernandes said.

“Over the next five years, our goal is to be a global leader in electronic materials offering a broad materials portfolio to serve leading semiconductor customers.”","A global leader in advanced materials solutions, Materion Corporation (Materion) supports a variety of high-performance industries including telecom and data center, energy, automotive, semiconductor, industrial and aerospace. Built on a series of acquisitions, the company has nearly 100 years of expertise and has been known as Materion since 2011. It operates in three business segments – Performance Materials, Precision Optics, and Electronic Materials (EM).

Leo Linehan, President of EM, outlines how his sector is integral to delivering breakthrough solutions: “Materion’s EM business is a leading global supplier of thin film deposition materials, inorganic chemicals, and microelectronic packaging supporting a wide range of markets.

“Deposition materials make up more than 70 percent of EM’s business. Our product portfolio includes sputtering targets, evaporation materials, and precursor materials for atomic layer deposition (ALD). We are currently ramping production of these precursor materials to support ALD being used in high-performance memory and logic applications, which we’re really excited about.

“We’re also taking advantage of our recent acquisition of a site in South Korea to further grow our target business and give us a footprint close to semiconductor market leaders, allowing us to better partner with them.”

The transaction saw Materion purchase manufacturing assets for tantalum solutions from Konasol, a Korean manufacturer serving the semiconductor and adjacent markets. “The acquisition is a strategic investment that will enable us to better serve semiconductor customers in Asia. It included a newly constructed, state-of-the-art facility with specialized equipment used to produce fully finished tantalum sputtering targets.

“It also helps strengthen our position as a leading supplier of tantalum targets, increasing our capacity to supply critical high-growth deposition materials used in leading-edge semiconductor chips, including those used in high-performance computing and artificial intelligence applications.”

With its headquarters in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, Materion has a legacy of being a North America-based materials provider with manufacturing assets and capabilities across the globe. It employs more than 3000 people worldwide, serving customers in more than 60 countries and, as more reshoring takes place in the US and Europe, it has strategic locations close to customers in both regions.

Regarding manufacturing specifically, Leo says Materion often acts as the bridge from minerals that come out of the ground, with a wide spectrum of physical and chemical properties, to manufacturers: “In order to manufacture our products, we transform, refine and upgrade the materials using melting, pressing and other industrial equipment. This ensures the product is process-capable and controlled enough for one of the most demanding manufacturing environments in the world: semiconductor manufacturing.

“Our factories are a mix of new and old. We’ve completed a series of investments around new, cutting-edge manufacturing equipment, including some of the latest generation, fully automated production equipment. This new equipment has been designed for the demands of Industry 4.0.”

As suppliers to high-tech industries such as data centers and EVs, Materion collaborates closely with its customers when it comes to developing custom material solutions for their applications. Leo says: “We supply the materials that are deposited as thin films onto the semiconductor wafers that are used to support the construction and running of data centers, EVs and cloud computing. Essentially, we develop and provide the materials needed to ensure the optimal performance of semiconductors. Our research and development efforts center on partnering with customers to drive new product and technology innovations.

“Our customer relationships are of primary importance to our business and our production teams. The voice of the customer remains the guiding light in understanding how we can continue to improve and better serve them, as well as what opportunities we may have to meet their needs of tomorrow and beyond.

“We work with our suppliers the same way we work with customers: in close partnership. We work directly in their facilities, we visit them, and we maintain open communication to ensure quality and security of supply. Raw material quality and availability are critical to providing our customers with the high-quality materials they require.”

Alongside global acquisitions and technological advancements, Materion prides itself on the close relationships formed within the organization: “Our people are essential to the success of our business,” Leo explains. We take pride in cultivating and developing a strong sense of competitive spirit within our organization to drive results. We know it’s key to our success in the hyper-competitive semiconductor market. Our culture is rooted in our people and their ability to work safely to meet customer requirements.

“Furthermore, we like to think what sets us apart from competitors is the fact that we focus on fostering cross-functional connections across our customers’ organizations. We believe that the closer the relationships we have with our customers, the better we will be able to support their businesses. Time, speed to market and how rapidly we’re able to commercialize technology are critical in this industry, and we’re able to do this by working in close collaboration with our customers. We place great emphasis on our organization’s core values and our mission to be our customers’ partner of choice for their material needs.”

When asked about the company’s approach to sustainability, Leo describes Materion as being committed to sustainable business practices that ensure the wellbeing of its employees, customers and communities. Materion currently ranks among the top 35 percent of all companies assessed by Ecovadis for the topics of environment, labor and human rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. In addition, it has previously been recognized as a climate leader by USA Today.

“As part of our sustainability program, we support the Ten Principles of the United Nationals Global Compact,” Leo elaborates. “We are fully committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and to the responsible use and management of natural resources, and we acknowledge our responsibility to manage operations in a way that minimizes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their impact on climate change.

“We are focused on continuing to implement sustainability strategies throughout the organization to reduce our product carbon footprint, increase our use of renewable energy resources, and improve engagement with our customers and stakeholders including CDP reporting and increased disclosures. Some examples of our sustainability programs include five of Materion’s sites using 100 percent green electricity; an increase in the number of sites using renewable energy resources, including solar panels, precious metals recycling programs that offer a circular economy for our customers, with 100 percent recycling for gold and tantalum materials, and partnering with our suppliers to ensure ESG compliance and traceability.”

Looking to the future, Materion is determined to keep building its customer relationships. “When we think about 2026 and beyond, we are committed to supporting our customers on new technologies being developed for the future AI, cloud-driven industry that’s developing,” concludes Leo. “As the world continues to rely more on AI and cloud computing, the need for new technologies and materials to support this rapid growth will be critical. We’re excited to play a role in the next generation of materials needed to power the world.

“Over the next five years, our goal is to be a global leader in electronic materials offering a broad materials portfolio to serve leading semiconductor customers.”",https://manufacturing-today.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Materion-242-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 08:00:26.275410

With a strategic vision aligned with Europe's commitment to sustainable electric mobility, the Moroccan government is taking significant steps to establish a secure and sustainable supply chain for electric vehicle battery manufacturing. In a recent interview with Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, Morocco's Minister for Industry and Trade, Ryad Mezzour, delved deeper into Morocco's ambitious plans and the strategies underpinning its ascent in the global battery industry. Please note that this interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Platts: Could you elaborate on how Morocco is positioning itself as a key player in global battery supply chains and the production of electric vehicles?

Ryad Mezzour: Our strategy originated from Europe's commitment to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable mobility by 2035. Fifteen years ago, under the leadership of His Majesty [King Mohammed VI], we established a comprehensive ecosystem for car manufacturing, primarily targeting the European market. To remain competitive, we recognized the necessity of electrifying our production and integrating into the battery value chain. This journey began approximately six or seven years ago, during which we focused on developing the entire supply chain -- from raw materials to finished vehicles -- to meet the integration requirements for products exported from Morocco to Europe under our free trade agreement. We identified several key assets: abundant mineral resources, strong energy capabilities, competitive advantages, and a strategic response to commercial tensions at that time. Our strategy is clear: we have the capacity to produce 1 million cars annually and must ensure we can supply all necessary batteries. If we have excess production, we plan to deliver these batteries to our regional partners, effectively providing them with alternatives to the solutions currently available only in Asia. Our goal is to establish Morocco as a hub for producing battery components and electric vehicle batteries, encompassing the entire value chain rather than focusing solely on gigafactories.

Platts: What specific policies has the Moroccan government introduced to support this strategy?

Ryad Mezzour: We have created a global ecosystem to support all investments in Morocco. While there is no specific support program exclusively for batteries, we do offer competitive advantages. Firstly, Morocco is the world's leading reserve of phosphate, which aligns with the growing demand for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) technology in batteries. The availability of phosphate and phosphoric acid makes Morocco a key player, as we are one of the largest exporters of these commodities. Secondly, we have strategically developed our renewable energy resources, allowing us to produce energy at competitive prices. In fact, Morocco stands out in this region for its competitiveness in renewable energy production. Additionally, we have a proven track record in manufacturing a wide range of complex materials, including fertilizers, automotive components, and even aircraft engines. This capability demonstrates that Morocco is an industrial country equipped to deliver sophisticated manufacturing solutions. When considering all these factors -- talent, energy resources, material availability, and world-class infrastructure -- Morocco is uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive solutions in this region.

Platts: Given the competitive landscape for investment, what incentives does Morocco offer to foreign companies, particularly in the areas of mining and battery manufacturing?

Ryad Mezzour: For mining companies, the most compelling incentive is access to abundant resources. This is a significant factor for investors. For manufacturing, we provide support in terms of infrastructure development and facilitating trade. In some cases, we can arrange co-investments with Moroccan partners, which helps foreign investors feel more secure, especially if they are unfamiliar with the local market dynamics. However, the incentives for the mining industry are generally less pronounced than for other sectors due to the inherent rights associated with resource access. We also offer some of the most competitive renewable energy rates available today.

Platts: What are Morocco's long-term goals for its battery industry? What specific milestones is the government aiming to achieve?

Ryad Mezzour: We have already begun exporting precursors since January 2025. By June 2026, we expect to produce our first battery cells and modules. Batteries are already being assembled in several of our original equipment manufacturers' (OEMs') plants. Additionally, we will have our first battery management systems, electrolytes, and separators ready early next year, with anodes expected by the second quarter. Our complete value chain will be operational to serve between 400,000 and 500,000 cars annually, potentially by the third or fourth quarter of 2026.

Platts: Does Morocco have the necessary ports, roads, and other infrastructure to support these projects, or will additional development be required?",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-01 14:01:01.652830

Fusion energy is the same sort that powers the sun. And, as the International Atomic Energy Agency has explained, nuclear fusion occurs when two light atoms combine to form a heavier atom, releasing a lot of energy.

If we could harness this reaction, we might be able to generate more of the energy we need while transitioning away from less sustainable sources. But there have been obstacles standing in the way of problem-free fusion development. For example, even the tiniest wisp of air can stop a fusion reaction, as experts noted in Power Magazine.

Now, Commonwealth Fusion Systems in Massachusetts says it is creating a container to keep a fusion reaction entirely airtight. The company has called this a ""vacuum vessel,"" describing the 48-ton steel container as ""instrumental,"" as CFS works toward ""large-scale commercial fusion energy."" As of late October, the first half of the vessel had been delivered.

""This is a really exciting time,"" said Brandon Sorbom, a CFS co-founder and its chief science officer, in a news release. ""It's a big moment for us because we have a big piece of hardware showing up, but it's also just a really big moment for the industry.""

While furthering fusion energy is an exciting prospect for many, researchers don't have all the kinks worked out just yet. There are still major obstacles to address in terms of sustaining and containing a fusion reaction that puts out more energy than it takes in — and doing so cost-effectively.

Nuclear fusion could one day create tremendous amounts of carbon-pollution-free electricity without the dangerous, long-lasting radioactive waste of today's nuclear fission reactors. But the technology to make a commercially viable fusion plant does not exist yet.

Driver: Rapid digital substation deployment in accordance with IEC 61850 standards

The quick implementation of digital substations in accordance with IEC 61850 standards will lead to a major boost in the merging unit market globally. Since utilities and grid operators move digital substations, the demand for merging units, which collect and digitize analog signals of traditional instrument transformers, will drastically rise. Its growth is supported by the implementation of IEC 61850 Edition 2.1 that suggests the introduction of enhanced interoperability, real-time monitoring, and enhanced cybersecurity measures in mixed-vendor settings. Main solutions such as PCM600 and IET600 of Hitachi Energy are certified under this new edition, which simplifies the engineering and configuration of the digital substations, which enhances integration of merging units and its project implementation is quicker. Moreover, digital substations can provide high cost savings, safety improvement, and asset management. The shift to process bus architectures and virtualized protection and control systems continue to enhance the pace of merging unit implementation in upgrades and new projects in the brownfield. Other recent implementations have shown decreases in engineering labor, cabling downsizing, and increased reliability, which has enabled transition to the concept of unmanned substations and remote diagnostics. All in all, the increased pace of digitalization and greater IEC 61850 compliance is turning the merging units into the necessity of the present-day power grids.

Restraint: Limited technical expertise to support digital protection systems

One of the limitations on the integration of the unit market is the lack of qualified specialists familiar with the IEC 61850-based protection, sampling and substation automation. Most utilities, particularly in developing areas, do not have engineers who have been trained on the configuration, commissioning and maintenance of the sample-value systems. These skills cut short down the speed of digital substation projects, drives up commissioning expenses, and extends project schedules. Consequently, areas with untrained engineers might be reluctant to install digital substations in units of merging format, which restricts expansion in the market. In the case of merging units, this shortage of skilled workforce poses major obstacles. The misalignment between MU output and protection IED logic, the incorrect configuration of SV streams or poor time synchronization (PTP/IEEE 1588), as well as improper time synchronization between the volumetric signal and the protective relay itself may endanger the reliability of the system. Reports at utilities have been made at the Digital Substation forums, which have reported incidences of commissioning delays due to the lack of expertise in dealing with MU interoperability among vendors. This adds costs to the projects, protracts commissioning schedules, and reduces the level of trust in digital substitution adoption.

Opportunity: Massive retrofit potential in aging transmission & distribution infrastructure

The aging transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure worldwide presents a massive retrofit opportunity for the merging unit market. Many existing substations are based on legacy analog technology, which is costly to maintain, less reliable, and lacks the flexibility required for modern grid demands. Retrofitting these substations with digital elements such as merging units enables utilities to extend the life of their assets while modernizing essential functions without complete replacement. Merging units are critical in this retrofit trend by bridging the gap between conventional instrument transformers and the digital protection and control IEDs compliant with IEC 61850 standards. They convert analog signals from existing transformers into digital data streams transmitted over optical fiber or Ethernet-based process buses. This approach allows utilities to retain primary equipment while gaining the substantial benefits of digital substations, including enhanced safety, reduced wiring complexity, smaller physical footprint, and improved data accuracy for protection and monitoring. The retrofit potential is underscored by the urgency of upgrading aging grids to accommodate increasing renewable energy integration, decentralized generation, and smart grid functionalities. A fully digital or hybrid substation architecture increases system resilience, operational efficiency, and cybersecurity, and critical aspects as grids become more complex.

Challenge: Stringent cybersecurity requirements to protect merging units as critical interfaces in digital substations

Stringent cybersecurity requirements have become a major challenge for the merging unit market as digital substations increasingly rely on Ethernet based communication for protection and control. Merging units transmit high speed sampled value data and GOOSE messages, making them critical points in the substation’s communication chain. Research highlights that IEC 61850 communication, while efficient, was not originally designed with strong built in security. This creates vulnerabilities where attackers could spoof or manipulate sampled values or protection messages, potentially causing false trips, relay mis operations, or blocking protection functions. IEC 62351 provides guidelines for securing these communications through authentication and encryption, but many existing IEDs and merging units still lack full compliance, especially in real time environments where even milliseconds of delay can compromise system performance. Implementing cybersecurity in process bus networks adds further complexity for utilities and vendors. Adding cryptographic protection can introduce latency, requiring merging units to balance security with the strict timing needs of protection systems. In addition, utilities must deploy certificate management systems, secure key handling processes, and continuous monitoring to protect multivendor IEC 61850 systems. This significantly increases cost and engineering effort, particularly in regions where OT cybersecurity expertise is limited. As a result, the need to meet rigorous cybersecurity demands slows down merging unit adoption and complicates digital substation deployment.

Sleek Teslas cruising along Sheikh Zayed Road, Porsche Taycans parked in Downtown Dubai, and EQS models gliding silently through Marina are now common sights. The shift toward electric luxury cars represents more than a technological trend; it reflects the UAE’s evolving vision for mobility, sustainability, and modern urban living.

A Changing Mindset Toward Sustainable Luxury

As the UAE moves toward cleaner and smarter energy solutions, residents have begun to rethink what luxury means. Traditionally, performance and exclusivity defined luxury cars. Today, environmental consciousness and quiet refinement also play significant roles. Electric models deliver instant torque, futuristic cabin design, and a calm driving experience qualities that align well with the lifestyle of cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Accessibility Through Premium Market Options

Electric luxury cars have become more attainable due to the increasing availability of high-end EV models across rental and ownership markets. Many travelers explore these cars during their stay, which also contributes to rising interest. Editorial sources often mention platforms such as the GTR Luxury official site, where enthusiasts learn about premium vehicle options as part of their planning. This exposure helps more people experience electric mobility without committing to long-term ownership.

Government Initiatives Accelerate Adoption

The UAE government has played a significant role in encouraging electric vehicle usage. Free parking incentives, toll exemptions, and charging infrastructure expansions have all influenced buying and renting decisions. Dubai alone has installed hundreds of public charging points through DEWA’s Green Charger initiative, making EVs more practical for daily use. These measures create a supportive ecosystem where luxury electric models can thrive.

Charging Infrastructure That Supports Seamless Use

A strong reason behind the rise of electric luxury cars is the rapid development of charging stations across the country. Residents can find chargers in malls, residential communities, business districts, and hotels. Locations such as JBR, Dubai Hills, and City Walk have made charging accessible to both residents and tourists. This infrastructure reduces range anxiety and gives drivers confidence to use EVs for longer routes, including trips to Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Fujairah.

Performance That Matches and Sometimes Exceeds Traditional Supercars

Modern electric luxury cars outperform many conventional supercars in acceleration and handling. Models like the Tesla Model S Plaid and Porsche Taycan Turbo S deliver instant power with no engine noise. This appeals to drivers who appreciate performance but prefer a more refined, futuristic feel. The smooth roads of Dubai especially Al Khail Road, SZR, and the long stretches near Expo City make EV performance even more enjoyable.

A New Aesthetic for Social Media Culture

Electric cars carry a distinct visual identity. Their clean lines, LED lighting signatures, and minimalist interiors make them appear futuristic in photographs. Influencers and travelers often showcase EVs at locations such as Bluewaters Island, Museum of the Future, and Palm West Beach. This association with modern design contributes to their popularity, especially among younger demographics who value visual storytelling.

Lower Operating Costs and Practical Daily Use

Although luxury EVs come at a premium price, their operating costs are relatively lower. Electricity is cheaper than fuel, and electric motors require less maintenance than traditional engines. For daily commutes between Marina and Business Bay or frequent drives to Abu Dhabi, EVs offer a cost-efficient alternative while maintaining luxury. This economic practicality appeals to long-term residents and business executives.

Corporate and Fleet Adoption

Companies in the UAE are also introducing EVs to their fleets as part of sustainability commitments. Hotels, private chauffeur companies, and business groups increasingly choose electric luxury sedans and SUVs to align their brand image with future-forward values. This corporate shift further normalizes EV usage across the country.

A Strong Future Outlook

With each passing year, more luxury EV models enter the UAE market. BMW i7, Mercedes EQS SUV, Audi e-tron GT, and Lucid Air are gaining traction among early adopters. New charging corridors and city-wide sustainability programs suggest that EV usage will continue rising. Dubai’s commitment to smart mobility drone taxis, autonomous vehicle testing, and AI-powered traffic systems shows that electric transport fits naturally into the country’s long-term vision.

The growing popularity of electric luxury cars in the UAE reflects a blend of lifestyle evolution, technological progress, and nationwide sustainability goals. With strong infrastructure, attractive incentives, and high-performance models entering the market, EVs are becoming an integral part of the country’s modern driving culture. Their presence on the roads signals a shift toward a cleaner and more futuristic mobility experience.",https://www.cuindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/word-image-13675-1-1024x576.png,N,,2025-12-01 12:04:41.075305

Climate change requires coordinated international responses. Between 2021 and 2023, weather- and climate-related disasters cost an estimated $182.7 billion in the U.S. and $162 billion in the EU. Yet political divisions continue to impede transatlantic climate adaptation, particularly as U.S. federal engagement has stalled and climate change policy grows increasingly contested. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency’s core functions—regulating pollution, conducting environmental research, enforcing compliance, supporting state programs, responding to environmental hazards, and protecting public and environmental health—have been sharply curtailed under the new administration. At the 2025 United Nations General Assembly in September, President Trump called climate change policy “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” With such open rejection of scientific evidence and the international climate consensus, federal-level transatlantic cooperation appears unlikely.

However, subnational diplomacy has proven remarkably resilient. At the same UN General Assembly, California Governor Gavin Newsom met with numerous international officials, including EU Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra, to reaffirm state-level climate commitments and explore deeper transatlantic cooperation. This outreach illustrates how subnational actors can sustain climate progress even when federal leadership falters. This article therefore proposes a new framework to harness and enhance such collaboration.

A New Framework for Collaboration

In an era of political uncertainty, subnational partnerships between U.S. states and the EU offer a promising alternative channel for climate cooperation. This article introduces the Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework (TSRF), a novel approach aimed at strengthening climate adaptation efforts and delivering tangible benefits even in periods of U.S. federal inaction. Subnational actors are already engaging European partners, often with meaningful, if uneven, results that demonstrate both the promise and the limits of decentralized climate diplomacy. A compelling example is the cooperation between California and the European Union during the first Trump administration. In 2018, the European Commission and California signed a Memorandum of Understanding on emissions trading and clean energy, which led to regular technical exchanges, joint workshops on carbon markets, and continued alignment on vehicle emissions standards even as U.S. federal policy moved in the opposite direction. This partnership not only preserved transatlantic policy learning during a period of federal retrenchment but also helped stabilize global confidence in subnational climate leadership. Beyond this case, numerous other initiatives illustrate the emerging architecture of subnational engagement: California’s recent partnership with Denmark on green economy resilience; coalitions such as We Are Still In and the U.S. Climate Alliance; EU-backed initiatives such as the Global Covenant of Mayors and the International Urban Cooperation (IUC), and global networks that include US and EU actors such as the Under2Coalition or the Coalition for High Ambition Multilevel Partnerships (CHAMP) for Climate Action.

Yet these efforts often remain fragmented, underfunded, and institutionally fragile. Entrenched partisan polarization makes consistent federal climate leadership increasingly unlikely. A shift toward “diagonal cooperation”—collaboration between subnational U.S. actors and European regional or supranational entities—is therefore crucial. Backed by the EU and driven by U.S. states, regions and cities, the TSRF could synchronize existing networks such as the Transatlantic Climate Alliance and elevate overlooked initiatives like wildfire prevention and flood control. Subnational diplomacy, which means linking U.S. states, cities, private actors, and EU partners, offers a viable path forward. The TSRF would institutionalize and scale these efforts through a permanent governance anchor capable of tracking commitments, coordinating partnerships, and sustaining innovation across the Atlantic. Before outlining such an institutional backbone, the article turns to sectoral examples that illustrate foundational components of the TSRF.

Sectoral Examples Illustrating TSRF’s Potential

Flood Control and Coastal Protection: Learning from the Dutch Dialogues

Flooding endangers coastal and riverine communities across the Atlantic, yet subnational partnerships have already shown how local actors can connect global expertise to local needs. The Netherlands—renowned for its ability to hold back the North Sea—has become a global leader in water management, and has exported its expertise to flood-vulnerable U.S. states.

After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005, disproportionately affecting lower-income communities and communities of color, Dutch officials invited Louisianan leaders to tour the Netherlands’ flood management systems to prevent future devastation. This exchange laid the foundation for the Dutch Dialogues: workshops between Dutch engineers and U.S. city planners that reimagined New Orleans’ relationship with water management and strengthened the resilience of at-risk communities. These workshops generated green infrastructure ideas such as wetland restoration and expanded drainage basins, which now shape New Orleans’ current resilience strategy. Similar approaches have since been adopted in Charleston, South Carolina, and Virginia’s Hampton Roads region.

These exchanges show the value of subnational partnerships. Cities like Charleston can collaborate directly with Dutch water authorities and U.S. academics without awaiting federal action. A TSRF would provide sustained support through structured coordination, funding opportunities, and formal governance to ensure durable cooperation beyond shifting political landscapes. A standing Transatlantic Resilience Advisory Committee, composed of regional U.S. officials and EU diplomats, could meet regularly to evaluate pilot proposals, oversee city-to-city partnerships and maintain ongoing transatlantic dialogue. By embedding coordination within an institutionalized forum rather than relying on one-off exchanges, the TSRF would shift collaboration from episodic inspiration to sustained resilience-building.

To support this, the TSRF would create a central coordination mechanism—potentially hosted by EU member states or the European External Action Service. The hub would not impose top-down rules; rather, it would identify shared risks, pool knowledge, and support joint adaptation strategies. U.S. municipalities seeking Dutch-style flood management tools could access EU technical expertise, apply for co-funding from EU adaptation instruments, and obtain logistical support for workshops or site visits. By offering continuity even as U.S. federal priorities shift, the TSRF would sustain long-term, resilient partnerships.

Wildfire Resilience: Shared Strategies from California to the Mediterranean

Wildfires offer another striking example of how the TSRF could enhance cooperation. Both North America and Europe now face increasingly severe fire seasons fueled by climate change. In 2020, California wildfires emitted smoke plumes that crossed the Atlantic; in 2022, 20 EU member states recorded above-average burned areas, including significant fires in Germany, the Czech Republic, and beyond.

Despite these shared challenges, transatlantic wildfire collaboration remains fragmented. The TSRF could facilitate subnational partnerships between wildfire-prone states such as California and European counterparts like Spain, Greece, and Portugal. These partnerships could focus on early warning systems, data exchange, forest management, and firefighting techniques. For example, the EU’s Copernicus Emergency Management Service generates satellite wildfire maps on demand; under the TSRF, U.S. state wildfire agencies could access these during major fire events. Likewise, California’s ALERT California camera network—an AI-enabled early detection tool—could be shared with European civil protection agencies. Sector-specific transatlantic working groups could link California’s Cal Fire with Greece’s fire service to exchange best practices in real time. Such peer-to-peer cooperation would save lives and property, while strengthening public support for climate partnerships despite national political tensions. A governance hub within the TSRF would ensure these partnerships become institutionalized and consistent rather than dependent on individual administrations or crises.

Building Institutional Backbone: An EU-Coordinated Governance Hub

For the TSRF to endure, it must be supported by sustained coordination that can weather fluctuations in U.S. federal policy. A governance hub housed within the European External Action service could serve as this backbone, centralizing progress in two ways.

First, it could track subnational commitments through a publicly accessible registry of climate-resilience pledges by city, state, and region. Beyond simple self-reporting, this system would integrate progress indicators, timelines, and metrics drawn from existing EU adaptation frameworks, enabling more meaningful dialogue with subnational U.S. actors about implementation gaps and opportunities. This effort could incorporate existing networks such as the Climate Alliance and America Is All In, giving subnational initiatives stronger international institutional connections and implementation capacity.

Second, the hub would facilitate structured exchanges and serve as a clearinghouse for technical expertise, partnership matching, and knowledge transfer. It would link wildfire agencies, coastal resilience offices, emergency-response teams, and local disaster-management units across the Atlantic. This structure would move cooperation from informal networking to institutionalized exchange.

Scaling Peer-to-Peer Cooperation: Transatlantic Innovation Exchanges

The TSRF could formalize “climate resilience twinning” arrangements, modeled on sister cities but focused on adaptation rather than cultural exchange. Pairing EU cities or regions with U.S. counterparts that face similar climate risks, such as matching a flood-vulnerable U.S. coastal community with a European city pioneering nature-based flood defenses, would create sustained channels for peer learning and policy transfer. Fellowships, staff exchanges, and recurring Resilience Dialogues would bring stakeholders together to share data, test approaches, and co-develop solutions. These connections would help cooperation persist beyond electoral cycles and enable long-term planning despite federal uncertainty.

Financing Action: A Joint Resilience Investment Fund

To convert plans into action, the TSRF should be backed by a Joint Resilience Investment Fund designed to attract private capital. The recent Clean Investment Monitor Update estimates that U.S. clean energy and transportation investment reached $68 billion in the second quarter of 2025, holding steady relative to 2024 and accounting for 4.8% of total private investment in structures, equipment, and durable goods—indicating substantial private investment capacity.

The fund could mobilize additional private capital from both sides of the Atlantic and support climate-resilience startups and public-private pilot programs. This would provide financial continuity less vulnerable to shifts in federal funding and further embed transatlantic economic collaboration within the TSRF.

Conclusion

In today’s volatile political environment, transatlantic climate resilience requires innovative cooperation beyond traditional U.S.-EU diplomacy. As the climate crisis accelerates, cooperation must adapt and evolve accordingly. Local and regional actors have demonstrated that they can sustain collaboration in politically unstable times. The Transatlantic Subnational Resilience Framework offers a way to institutionalize this momentum by connecting cities, states, and private actors across the Atlantic through a durable framework that shares goals, builds knowledge, and mobilizes resources.

This alliance is not only feasible, it is already emerging in sectoral pockets. What is missing is the connective institutional tissue to coordinate and deepen these partnerships to align them into a more integrated transatlantic resilience agenda, which could spill over into other areas of climate change policy. The TSRF can transform fragmented initiatives into a cohesive resilience strategy, reinvigorating the U.S.-EU relationship and linking communities in a shared mission to confront a profound challenge of our time.

Doral thus increased its stake in the US company to 36%, with an option to buy a further 5% later.","The share price of renewable energy company Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources (TASE: DORL) has risen by over 20% in the past two days, and in the past year it has risen by over 140%, leaving its cleantech competitors far behind. The sectoral index has risen by just 25% in the past year.

Owners become billionaires

In fact, since releasing its quarterly financials, Doral added almost NIS 1 billion to its market cap in two sessions, to reach NIS 5.5 billion. The big gainers are of course the founders, chairperson Doron (Dori) Davidovitz and Alon Kesel, each of whom holds 19% of the company. The recent jump in the share price added about NIS 200 million to the value of each of their holdings, bringing them close to being shekel billionaires, on paper.

What impressed investors so much in Doral’s financials? Although the company still posts losses, it presents more than 50% growth in revenue. But two pieces of positive news encouraged the market. The first is to do with taxation, the second with guidance, and both are connected to the question whether Doral has had the luck to be in the right place at the right time.

Right place: the US. The scope of Doral’s projects there is huge, and already amounts to 7.7 gigawatts. For the sake of comparison, that is just over half the power consumption of the entire State of Israel at the peak of the winter season. In addition, projects that could yield another 2.5 gigawatts are expected to start construction in the coming year and to be connected to the grid in by the end of 2027. All this is in the red-hot US market, where demand for energy, particularly solar energy, is expected to be dramatic in the coming years.

Right time: Doral is expected to complete these projects just before the expiration of the tax breaks for renewable energy developments in the US. Leader Capital Markets analyst Gilad Ben-Zvi says, ""In the previous financials they reported only 2.5 gigawatts that they were certain would qualify for the tax breaks, and following recent developments they are now able to provide another level of certainty for investors on the large scope of mature projects that they will manage to connect.

""There’s a very strong environment at present in the US energy market, because of the considerable rise in demand for power in the coming years from new server farms and the substantial consumption of electricity for artificial intelligence.""

Doral is considered to be in a good position in relation to US companies as well, since it is expected to manage to connect new projects, and apply the tax breaks to them, while its competitors are still standing in line to connect to the grid.

""They’ll need a lot of money to meet the guidance""

RELATED ARTICLES

The combination of the tax breaks, the acceleration of projects, and the company’s unique positioning, have led Doral to issue optimistic guidance. The projects in the US will yield EBITDA of over $850 million a year from 2029, which compares with $61 million in the first nine months of 2025, and just $10 million in 2024. But what are the chances of meeting this fantastic guidance?

In order to maximize profits, Doral increased its position in US subsidiary Doral Renewables LLC by buying 10% of its shares from US partner/CEO Nick Cohen for $67 million. Doral thus increased its stake in the US company to 36%, with an option to buy a further 5% later. Incidentally, former Mossad chief Yossi Cohen serves as a director on Doral’s behalf in the US company, and holds options on its shares estimated in the past to be worth tens of millions of shekels.

There are, however, several question marks over Doral’s optimistic forecast. ""There is still uncertainty about the company’s ultimate value,"" says Leaders Ben-Zvi, adding ""we are still waiting for the next offering.""

Doral, he says, is still a company short of cash, and in order to finance its wave of construction ""they will need a lot more money, which will come from raising capital or even an IPO in the US. But the current deal gives a floor to the company’s value, and that’s what provided a following wind for the stock.""

Of course it remains to be seen whether the positive investor sentiment is maintained, and whether Doral will abide by its dramatic promises in the US market.

Electric vehicles now account for nearly 90% of lithium demand, up from 64% in 2020, with global EV sales expected to exceed 20 million units in 2025. The energy sector accounted for 85% of total battery metals demand growth over this period.

Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining in 2023, while China is responsible for 80% of graphite mining and over 90% of refining. The average market share of the top three refining nations for key energy minerals rose from around 82% in 2020 to 86% in 2024, creating vulnerabilities that Western governments are addressing through diversification initiatives and domestic production incentives.

Indonesia's share of mined nickel production has risen from 16% in 2017 to around 50% in 2023, with Indonesia's total nickel pig iron production reaching approximately 1.85 million tonnes in 2024 and expected to reach around 2 million tonnes by 2025, accounting for 53.5% of global primary nickel production. This dominance creates both supply security concerns and pricing power dynamics.

Recent market action demonstrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures in China experiencing dramatic swings. Exchange regulatory measures imposing stricter trading rules and supply-side signals from production restarts contributed to a 9% single-session drop to ¥91,020/tonne after peaking at ¥102,500/tonne. Despite near-term corrections, underlying demand tied to electrification remains robust as battery gigafactory construction accelerates globally.

Western governments are prioritizing supply chain diversification through comprehensive policy frameworks. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and Australia's Modern Manufacturing Initiative provide tax credits, loan guarantees, and offtake support for domestic battery metal production, reducing project financing risk and creating government-backed demand for Tier-1 jurisdictional assets.

The Battery Metals Imperative

The global transition to electrified transportation and renewable energy storage is creating structural demand for critical minerals essential to battery production. Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin have emerged as foundational commodities enabling the shift away from fossil fuels, positioned at the intersection of climate policy, technological innovation, and supply chain security. The investment thesis for battery metals rests on fundamentals distinct from traditional commodity cycles. Policy-driven demand supported by government mandates and emissions regulations provides visibility extending through 2030, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration.

Global Trends Driving Battery Metals Demand

The electrification of transportation represents the primary demand catalyst for battery metals, with penetration rates exceeding forecasts. EV sales surged past 7 million units in the first half of 2025, a 28% year-over-year increase, with the International Energy Agency projecting full-year sales could approach 20 million units. Major automotive markets have established regulatory timelines phasing out internal combustion engines by 2035, creating policy certainty driving massive capital investment across automotive supply chains.

Battery chemistry evolution reshapes demand profiles for individual metals. Nickel-rich cathode chemistries maximize energy density and vehicle range, driving nickel intensity per vehicle upward. Batteries, the heart of every electric vehicle, rely heavily on lithium, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and graphite as key cathode and anode materials. Each EV requires approximately 50-100 kilograms of graphite depending on battery size, while copper content increases dramatically versus combustion vehicles due to electric motors, battery systems, and charging infrastructure.

Energy Storage & Grid Applications

Grid-scale energy storage is emerging as a complementary demand driver, with battery installations required to manage intermittency from renewable generation. Battery energy storage system installations are set to increase from 205 GWh in 2024 to 520-700 GWh by 2030, a 2.5-3.5x increase. Residential and commercial storage applications add another demand layer, with home battery systems gaining adoption in markets with high electricity costs or time-of-use pricing. These distributed storage applications utilize similar lithium-ion chemistries to EVs, competing for the same battery metal supply.

Supply Chain Reshoring Imperatives

Geopolitical tensions have elevated supply security to strategic priority for Western governments and automakers. In 2023, Australia, Chile and China mined about 85% of global lithium, with almost 65% refined in China and another 25% in Chile. Indonesia accounted for over half of nickel mining, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was home to almost two-thirds of the world's cobalt mining. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's domestic content requirements for EV tax credits, Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy, and the European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act all prioritize domestic or allied-nation sourcing, creating structural demand for battery metal projects in stable jurisdictions at premium prices.

Supply Challenges: Commodity-Specific Constraints

The nickel market is experiencing supply transformation as Indonesian production dominates global output. In 2023, Indonesia accounted for 53.1% of the global nickel supply and was projected to reach 2.1 million metric tons by the end of 2024. However, this creates market vulnerabilities. The global primary nickel market is expected to remain oversupplied in 2025, with production from Indonesia forecast to expand further despite challenges like tight nickel ore availability and potential royalty rate hikes.

Battery sector dynamics add complexity, as the battery sector saw a shift in preferences from nickel-rich nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries toward nickel-free lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, driven by price competitiveness. Despite this, the battery sector is expected to increase nickel consumption to 543,000 tonnes in 2025, making up 15.2% of global consumption. Nickel sulphide deposits in stable jurisdictions command premiums as automakers seek long-term, low-carbon supply agreements outside concentrated Asian supply chains.

Lithium: Price Volatility Masking Structural Growth

Lithium markets navigate the aftermath of speculative excess. Recent price action illustrates ongoing volatility, with lithium carbonate futures experiencing dramatic swings following exchange regulatory measures and production restart announcements. A major mine with potential output of approximately 46,000 tonnes per year, roughly 3% of projected global supply, exemplifies how quickly brownfield supply can respond to price signals.

Despite near-term volatility, lithium prices dropped nearly 20% in 2024, reaching similar prices to late 2015 levels, despite lithium demand in 2024 being about six times bigger than in 2015. The IEA warns that low prices could discourage future investments and might cause supply shortages for lithium and nickel by 2030. Greenfield lithium projects face extended permitting timelines and infrastructure development requirements, meaning supply responses to sustained higher prices will lag by years.

Graphite and Other Critical Minerals

Graphite supply is even more concentrated, with China responsible for 80% of mining and over 90% of refining. Natural flake graphite must undergo purification, spheronization, and coating processes to meet battery anode specifications, requiring specialized facilities and technical expertise concentrated in China. Western graphite projects must demonstrate integrated processing capability to produce battery-qualified material, adding capital intensity and technical risk beyond conventional mining operations.

Company Case Studies

Canada Nickel's Zero-Carbon Nickel Production (TSXV:CNC)

Canada Nickel is advancing the Crawford Nickel Sulphide Project in Ontario's Timmins region, positioning the asset as potentially one of the world's first zero-carbon nickel mines. The company recently secured an oversubscribed financing to advance engineering, permitting, and development activities.

As CEO Mark Selby stated their offering options:

""The Offering is oversubscribed. The Underwriters intend to fully exercise the Over-Allotment Option… If the Over-Allotment Option is exercised in full, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be C$15.0 million.""

The proceeds support steps toward a construction decision targeted for 2026.

Crawford ranks as the world's second-largest nickel reserve and is expected to become the third-largest nickel sulphide operation globally based on feasibility study production rates. The deposit contains over 1.7 billion tonnes of reserves supporting a 41-year mine life, with life-of-mine cash costs of US$0.39/lb positioning Crawford in the first quartile globally. Updated FEED optimization improved after-tax NPV to US$2.8 billion with IRR exceeding 17%.

The decarbonization strategy through carbon sequestration, demonstrating 1.5 million tonnes CO₂ storage annually through IPT carbonation with potential scaling to 10-15 million tonnes via NetCarb Alliance, could position Crawford as a supplier of zero-carbon nickel to automakers with stringent emissions requirements. The broader Timmins Nickel District encompasses 42 km² with multiple discoveries including high-grade intercepts at Bannockburn showing 3.95% nickel over 4 metres, suggesting district-scale growth potential beyond Crawford alone.

Sovereign Metals (AIM:SVML) : Rutile-Graphite By-Product Economics

Sovereign Metals is developing what it describes as the world's largest known rutile resource and second-largest known flake graphite resource in southeastern Africa. As the company notes:

""Kasiya holds 17.9 Mt of contained rutile (world's largest) and 24.4 Mt of contained graphite (world's second-largest).""

The unique aspect is that graphite emerges as a natural by-product of rutile mining, creating economics distinct from standalone graphite projects.

The Optimised Pre-Feasibility Study demonstrates pre-tax NPV of US$2.32 billion with 27% IRR, supporting steady-state production of 246,000 tonnes per annum rutile and 265,000 tonnes per annum graphite. Processing advantages stem from soft saprolite ore enabling simpler methods than hard-rock graphite peers, producing higher carbon concentrate at 96-98% versus typical 94-95%, while achieving up to 57% large-jumbo flake commanding premium prices.

The by-product economics create competitive advantages, with incremental graphite production cost of US$241/tonne sitting below Chinese weighted average cost of US$257/tonne, positioning Sovereign in the lowest-cost quartile on global cost curves. A successful 6-month pilot operation mining 170,000 cubic meters validated the full production chain, informing feasibility parameters and de-risking execution. With Definitive Feasibility Study expected in Q4 2025, Sovereign is advancing toward financing and construction decisions.

Fitzroy Minerals (TSXV:FTZ): Dual-Track Copper Strategy

Fitzroy Minerals pursues a dual-track copper strategy in Chile's premier copper belt, combining fast-track oxide development for near-term cash flow with deeper sulphide exploration for long-term scale. The company recently appointed a technical advisor who emphasized the strategic value of this approach.

As President and CEO Merlin Marr-Johnson stated their management:

""I am also delighted that Fitzroy management has outlined a fast-track route to non-operated copper production at Buen Retiro, which could give the Company sufficient cash flow to self-fund exploration in future years.""

The company holds approximately C$11M in cash supporting an ~C$8M exploration budget. The oxide project spans over 1.4 km of continuous copper mineralization with predominantly leachable minerals enabling low-cost heap leach processing. Brownfields status provides permitting advantages, while nearby hydrometallurgical infrastructure offers potential toll-processing solutions reducing capital intensity. Preliminary Economic Assessment is underway.

The sulphide project targets a large-scale copper-molybdenum-gold-rhenium porphyry system with initial drilling confirming 200 metres at 0.46% copper with higher-grade sub-zones. Multiple kilometre-long geophysical and geochemical anomalies across the 18,000 hectare land package suggest substantial exploration upside. By-product metals including rhenium, a scarce element used in superalloys, could materially enhance project economics. Strategic positioning between two major producing districts in a region with established infrastructure provides development advantages.

Rome Resources (LSE:RMR): High-Grade Tin Discovery

Rome Resources advances high-grade tin-copper-zinc-silver discoveries in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern region, located 8 km from one of the world's highest-grade producing tin mines. The company recently announced a £200,000 placement to fund additional drilling related to ongoing tin discoveries, highlighting continued support for exploration of critical minerals in a district with demonstrated world-class grades.

The asset portfolio centers on two prospects: a tin-copper-zinc-silver system at Mont Agoma and a high-grade tin-only system at Kalayi. Over 5,000 metres across 26 holes have been drilled by mid-2025 with first resource models initiated for both targets. Mont Agoma hosts polymetallic mineralization with geochemical and drill data indicating large undrilled deeper zones representing expansion potential, while Kalayi features high-grade plunging tin shoots across a 2-km-long soil anomaly.

Tin's supply-demand fundamentals support the exploration thesis, with the metal identified as highly leveraged to electrification through solar panel manufacturing, electronics, and specialized battery applications. Global tin demand is forecast to grow up to 40% by 2030 driven by technology adoption. Rome operates three drill rigs with on-site core logging and XRF facilities, plus approximately 1,000 kg of metallurgical samples shipped for beneficiation testwork to understand multi-metal recovery potential. With continued drilling momentum and resource modeling underway, Rome represents early-stage exposure to high-grade tin discovery in a district with demonstrated production history.

The Investment Thesis for Battery Metals

Supply chain security premiums favor projects in Canada, Australia, and stable jurisdictions over lower-cost but geopolitically risky alternatives. Western automakers and governments increasingly prioritize supply reliability and ESG credentials over marginal cost advantages, supporting valuation premiums for Tier-1 assets even with higher operating costs.

Battery metal developments advancing with automaker offtake agreements, government loan guarantees, or critical minerals program participation demonstrate external validation and reduced financing risk. Projects lacking strategic alignment face higher hurdles securing project finance and may trade at discounts despite strong technical fundamentals.

Nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin each face distinct supply-demand dynamics and price cycles. Portfolio allocation across multiple commodities provides downside protection when individual metals experience corrections while maintaining upside exposure to electrification's broad-based critical mineral demand.

Advanced-stage projects with completed feasibility studies and near-term construction decisions offer less execution risk but potentially lower return multiples, while earlier-stage exploration and resource definition plays provide higher risk-adjusted returns for patient capital willing to accept development timeline uncertainty and permitting risk.

As automakers face increasing pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions across supply chains, battery metals produced with renewable energy and carbon sequestration capabilities command premiums. Projects demonstrating low-carbon production pathways gain competitive advantages in customer qualification processes beyond pure cost competitiveness.

Given China's dominance in processing and its significant role in mining certain battery metals, policy shifts around production quotas, export restrictions, or environmental enforcement can rapidly tighten supply and drive price movements. Regulatory developments in Indonesia for nickel and China's domestic lithium market interventions create asymmetric risk-reward scenarios.

The battery metals investment case rests on secular electrification trends creating durable demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, copper, and tin, while supply responses remain constrained by permitting timelines, capital intensity, and geopolitical concentration. This supply-demand imbalance, amplified by Western governments' strategic prioritization of supply chain security, creates a favorable multi-year environment for projects in stable jurisdictions even if near-term prices experience volatility. Policy support through tax credits, loan guarantees, and domestic content requirements materially de-risks project financing for advanced-stage assets aligned with government critical minerals strategies.

Investor approaches should emphasize jurisdictional quality and strategic positioning over pure resource metrics. Projects in Canada, Australia, and other Tier-1 jurisdictions benefit from nearshoring premiums as automakers prioritize supply security, while developments with automaker partnerships or government backing demonstrate external validation reducing execution risk. Portfolio construction across multiple battery metals provides diversification, as individual commodities experience distinct price cycles. Lithium's recent volatility contrasts with nickel's structural deficit and graphite's processing bottlenecks, suggesting uncorrelated return profiles.

The four case study companies exemplify different risk-reward profiles within battery metals: Canada Nickel offers large-scale nickel sulphide development with zero-carbon differentiation and district growth potential; Sovereign Metals provides unique rutile-graphite by-product economics with near-term DFS completion; Fitzroy Minerals balances near-term oxide cash flow against sulphide exploration upside in established copper districts; and Rome Resources represents early-stage high-grade tin discovery with resource growth potential but elevated jurisdictional and exploration risk. For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition through tangible supply-demand fundamentals and reduced geopolitical vulnerability, battery metals in quality jurisdictions present compelling opportunities as electrification transitions from policy aspiration to physical infrastructure reality.

TL;DR

Battery metals present compelling investment opportunities as electric vehicle adoption and energy storage drive structural demand growth across nickel, lithium, graphite, and copper. Supply constraints persist from geopolitical concentration with Indonesia controlling over 50% of nickel and China dominating graphite processing, while Western governments prioritize supply chain diversification through reshoring incentives. Canada Nickel advances zero-carbon nickel production with district-scale potential, Sovereign Metals offers unique rutile-graphite by-product economics, Fitzroy Minerals balances copper oxide development with sulphide exploration in Chile, and Rome Resources pursues high-grade tin discovery in the DRC. Projects in Tier-1 jurisdictions with strategic partnerships command premiums as automakers secure long-term supply, creating favorable outlook for quality battery metal assets despite price volatility.

Improving system reliability by fully anticipating how renewables and DERs affect the whole power system.
PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions.","For a decade and a half, the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) forecast of electricity consumption was predictable — and predictably flat. Indeed, between 2005 and 2020 load growth averaged about 0.1%, pushed slightly upward by population and economic growth while also held down by improved efficiency.

The rest of the world has also seen relatively modest growth in electricity demand. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand grew by an average of 2.6% between 2015 and 2023.

Today, however, we have entered the era of load growth, which is witnessing a generational shift on how energy is generated, transmitted and consumed. The demand as it used to be, in terms of predictability and density, has transformed itself into patterns that are complex to predict and extremely high density, thanks to greater demand from electric transportation, manufacturing and, of course, the boom in electricity-thirsty data centers. The U.S. Department of Energy has forecasted that data centers could consume as much as 580 TWh annually in 2028, equal to about 123 GW and representing up to 12% of total US electricity consumption. Across the globe, electricity demand is forecasted to rise by 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026 – with China and India growing significantly faster.

Reliable supplies of increasing amounts of electricity are an economic and societal imperative, which is why utilities are making historic investments in grid infrastructure and assets. According to the International Energy Agency’s 2025 World Energy Investment report, capital investment in the energy sector is set to rise by $3.3 trillion, a 2% increase from 2024. $2.2 trillion of that investment includes funds earmarked for grid optimization.

The German utility E.ON announced plans to invest 34 billion Euros on grid infrastructure between 2024 and 2028. The Indian government says the country needs to invest over $500 billion USD by 2032 to provide the power the growing country requires. The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund has committed over $500 million and disbursed more than $460 million to 15 projects across six ASEAN countries. The fund provides loans to finance infrastructure investment projects such as renewable energy plants and transmission and power grid development.

But the challenge remains: Not all investments are created equal in terms of ensuring the reliability of a grid buffeted by rapidly growing demand, extreme weather, a proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs), and aging equipment. Utilities, regulators, grid operators, and developers all need to direct their investments efficiently and effectively, simultaneously meeting demand while also improving reliability and containing costs.

The integrated system planning imperative

Put simply, utility planners are faced with a challenging task. Making their task even more daunting is the reality that the tools and processes planners have long relied on were built for a very different power system than we have now. Transmission, distribution and generation planners have traditionally worked to manage and orchestrate a centralized generation with unidirectional flows of electricity. Planning departments have traditionally been structured vertically, creating divides between functions that solve for economics, physics and system adequacy.

When load growth was modest and electricity flowed in one direction from large power plants to consumers, that approach worked well. But in today’s high load growth environment, where a larger share of renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DERs) are being integrated and extreme weather threatens system reliability, a more holistic approach to planning is critical. When different planning teams use their own complicated models with various tools and data, working together becomes difficult and time-consuming. Today’s grid planning needs to bring these different approaches together to make the process faster, more accurate, more adaptable, and more collaborative.

Integrated system planning (ISP) acknowledges the pressures of load growth and the complexity and interdependencies of the quickly evolving power system and provides a pathway for the collaboration and coordination needed in planning today. It serves as the backbone for maintaining system adequacy by implementing comprehensive planning for the future grid and delivering a path for a reliable, sustainable and affordable power system.

The value of ISP:

Comprehensive analysis for making faster planning decisions that drive investment signals, operational efficiency, and stakeholder collaboration.

Maximizing the efficiency of investments that drive prioritization while accounting for rapidly changing demand and interconnection requests.

Improving system reliability by fully anticipating how renewables and DERs affect the whole power system.

Accelerating planning cycles to better meet the needs of customers who require electricity as fast as possible.

Improving regulatory outcomes by providing transparency around the need for capital investments.

Powering ISP with PlanOS

ISP requires more than a desire for traditionally siloed planning operations to work together. It demands actual tools to enable seamless, efficient, and valuable collaboration.

GE Vernova’s PlanOS was built to provide a platform that unifies planning data and models capacity expansion, resource adequacy, production cost, and power flow analysis. Instead of running these vital planning studies separately and hoping to reconcile results later, PlanOS integrates them in real time. The result: insights from one planning domain immediately inform others, improving speed and reducing the potential for errors.

A unified data model is the foundation of the PlanOS platform, ensuring all planners work from the same assumptions. Updates flow across the system, eliminating the time-consuming and error-prone process of manually reconciling disparate spreadsheets and models.

PlanOS also enables scenario-based planning, giving utilities the ability to explore multiple potential futures and stress-test investments under different load growth, policy, and technology conditions. Collaboration features like version control and distributed access enable diverse teams to work together seamlessly without losing the specialized tools they need.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/x8jR5LJi2JNqDZNfz53ufHGUi8eo5xofSBDKt6nPOXw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjk5OTQ3ODQzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:20.101270
,Indiana American Energy ,2025-12-01 10:13:36+00:00,Utility Dive,Rethinking reliability: Why IBRs need independent verification | Utility Dive,Jonathan Susser,,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/spons/rethinking-reliability-why-ibrs-need-independent-verification/806196/,"That’s where third-party verification comes in.
Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise.
In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need.
That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs.
Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted.","We rely on the objectivity and trustworthiness of third parties to stay informed and make better decisions throughout our lives. Before purchasing a house, home inspectors help us identify issues we may overlook. In business, external auditors assess financial statements for accuracy and compliance.

But at a time of rapidly rising demand for electricity and other threats to the reliable supply of power, inverter-based resources (IBRs) are interconnecting to the grid without any comparable level of evaluation — without confirmation that they align with their interconnection agreements and without assurance that the models used by transmission operators reflect what’s on the ground.

And when models don’t reflect what’s on the ground, and when what’s on the ground doesn’t conform to requirements, the consequences can be severe. That’s where third-party verification comes in.

But how did we get here?

Getting IBRs online requires a different approach than we’re used to

Synchronous sources of generation — the backbone of our grid for more than a century — have traditionally been built and maintained by the entities also responsible for ensuring the reliability of the bulk power system: utilities.

With IBRs, those responsibilities are more commonly dispersed, with project developers and generator owners building facilities with an emphasis on cost and speed, and transmission operators tasked with maintaining grid stability.

Not only that, but IBRs, as a technology, differ significantly from synchronous generation. They’re based on software that controls the instantaneous output of power electronics, with no spinning inertial mass to provide a guaranteed stability buffer during times of regional grid instability. Inverters can provide excellent grid stability support, too — but only when their hundreds of adjustable functions and parameters are correctly set.

This new landscape calls for new strategies for keeping the grid running as smoothly and dependably as we’ve come to expect in the U.S.

A lack of verification can have real consequences

Although grid operators may have interconnection agreements based on industry standards and guidelines, such as IEEE 2800, without verification that those standards and guidelines are actually being followed, we can’t be confident that they’re doing any good.

Through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s (NERC’s) disturbance reports and alerts on reliability risks, we know that IBR plants are often configured incorrectly, putting the grid at risk due to unexpected and unnecessary tripping events — like what happened in Odessa in 2021 and 2022 and in the Iberian Peninsula earlier this year.

We’ve witnessed as much in our own on-site inspections of 300+ distribution- and transmission-connected IBRs. We continue to find inverters programmed with protection-related settings that deviate from known requirements and power plant controller (PPC) settings misaligned with the facility’s voltage schedule requirements specified by the transmission operator.

In fact, nearly every site we’ve visited since our work in this space began in 2017 has had deficiencies and discrepancies that have needed addressing.

Third-party verification is the solution the industry needs right now

Having a third party commission and verify IBRs — review site documentation and installed inverter settings, conduct PPC demonstrations, update and reconcile facility models — bridges the gap between transmission and generator operators.

Ultimately, it’s quality assurance that reveals whether facilities comply with the appropriate standards and agreements and whether grid operators can trust that their sites will perform as expected.

Asking project developers or transmission operators to provide their own oversight is problematic: conflicting motivations and incentives, a lack of resources and unspecialized expertise. A neutral third party can develop the proficiency necessary to confront the unique complexity of IBRs.

In our ideal world for highest grid reliability, every IBR site receives third-party verification

To put it bluntly, we can’t currently rely on our IBR facilities to the degree that we need. That may not be apparent in monthly performance reports; it may only show up during major events. But those are what we’re trying to avoid.

Unfortunately, the compliance issues that we and others are finding are unlikely to resolve themselves, and that will only elevate risk as IBR penetration — and load growth from data centers, manufacturing and electrification — increases.

That’s why we feel so strongly that independent verification is necessary for us all to truly be confident in the reliability, safety and performance of IBRs. Even starting small, initiating a pilot program or updating documentation requirements, can make a big difference.

Just like a home inspection puts buyers at ease, third-party verification can do the same for grid operators, providing assurance that the resources they’re integrating will perform as predicted. It’s a smart investment in the future of our power system.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IAeJb4vCx-DuczRLtIsiG-B7oKlvIQ3zLNxc8Y8a7eQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9BRV9IZWFkZXJfSW1hZ2UucG5n.webp,N,,2025-12-01 08:01:24.613564

""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""","Data centers are fueling a race to develop artificial intelligence tools that have the potential to revolutionize almost every sector of society, and Big Tech is receiving bipartisan support at nearly every level of government to aid in this global competition for AI dominance.

But these building projects that have become a unifying force for politicians are also galvanizing communities that object to seeing one of these behemoth campuses of computer servers pop up in their backyards.

RELATED: Pa. and N.J. want data centers to guarantee their own power supply

Last month in Plymouth Township, the zoning board held a public hearing to discuss a proposal to build a 2 million square-foot data center at 900 Conshohocken Road, transforming 10 buildings at the former Cleveland-Cliffs steel mill that sits on 66 acres of land along the Schuylkill River into a high-tech network.

When Montgomery County residents learned about the plan to build this facility near their homes, they began fighting back – citing concerns over the project's potential impacts on the environment and their energy bills.

""This is like a David versus Goliath fight, and we're trying to get everyone mobilized and understand this,"" Patti Smith, who organized a petition that received over 1,000 signatures, said before the hearing.

Then on Nov. 18, residents packed the room to voice their opinions at the zoning hearing, only to find out that the developer had to withdraw the application over a legal issue because the agreement of sale of the property was not finalized. While this appears to be a victory for the community activists, they anticipate the developer will refile the application and are concerned this move only allows more time for an ordinance to be drafted that would give the company a stronger legal standing when the proposal is revisited.

In neighboring Chester County, another data center that's being proposed at the former Pennhurst State School and Hospital site is also receiving strong opposition from the community, with a petition that's racked up over 12,000 signatures. That proposal could also stall as opposition is pushing for an ordinance to tighten regulations.

While these neighbors are standing up against Big Tech, they are also realizing they're confronting resource-rich developers and a government that in many ways is working to ease restrictions as the country tries to meet the insatiable energy demands created by the growing use of AI platforms like ChatGPT.

In June, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) announced that Amazon will spend at least $20 billion to develop cloud computing and AI innovation campuses in the state. The investment, which the company says will create at least 1,250 tech jobs, will start by building facilities in Falls Township in Bucks County and Salem Township in Luzerne County before exploring other communities for future sites.

Shortly after that investment was touted by state officials, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to accelerate federal permitting of data center development.

Then last month, governors from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia (three Democrats and one Republican) submitted a joint proposal that would fast-track approvals for data center projects in which developers agree to build energy lines or substations and generate at least enough electricity to offset how much power the facility is expected use.

""Everybody wants to be the biggest and best adopter of AI technology and make the most money for their state, but it's very short-sighted,"" said Genevieve Boland, one of the organizers of the Cleveland-Cliffs petition. ""So the direction is coming from the federal government to essentially expedite data center approvals everywhere across the country and that has been trickled down to the state. Shapiro made a deal with Amazon and that was a huge deal. And then his mandate has trickled down to regional and local zoning boards to do whatever to approve these data centers.""

Impact on electric bills

While the AI boom is putting pressure on existing electricity grids and causing a nearly unquenchable thirst for more energy resources, it remains to be seen how these demands will affect the bills of residential customers.

The U.S. Department of Energy reported last year that data centers consumed about 4.4% of the total U.S. electricity in 2023, and it predicts that will rise to 12% by 2028.

And the increase in the number of these facilities has coincided with a rise in costs. In Pennsylvania, the average electric bill has gone from $134.85 in 2022 to $160.57 this year, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

But data centers might not be completely to blame for the higher bills, said Geoffrey Blanford, a principal technical executive at the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that does research for the nation's electric power industry.

""Most of the increase has been related to economy-wide inflation trends,"" he said. ""Where it's been faster than inflation has been in places like California, which had a really steep increase that's mostly related to wildfire impacts. ... Other places like New England, you've also seen higher prices. But again, that's more around (transmission and distribution) costs, grid modernization and resilience more so than data centers. So there are a lot of factors. Data centers are potentially one of them but really has not been the main one for what we've seen recently.""

Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the average retail price of electricity in Pennsylvania over the past six years has risen 7.4% faster than inflation, the New York Times reported. In New Jersey, it's up 6.1%. But it's actually down in other parts of the country — including much of the Southeast, Midwest and Mountain regions.

In addition to the quantity of data centers, the speed at which they are being built is also causing a power problem. Despite their size, these massive campuses can be built within a year or two in many cases. And the projects often require investments to improve the local grid, like adding new sources to generate energy or enhancing existing systems.

""They can be built pretty quickly, which means it puts a lot of pressure on the timeline for adding grid resources, which tend to be a little bit slower than how fast you can add a data center,"" Blanford said. ""So it's been a major issue for power system planning.""

Tech companies have now become both energy consumers and producers, and whether individuals and small businesses see a jump in their bills might be dependent on state regulators and lawmakers making sure those firms cover the expenses.

""In theory, there are potential benefits to the electric system from having a large load there,"" Blanford said. ""... It can help with reliability, and it's not necessarily something to take for granted that it's going to increase electricity prices. In fact, it could decrease electricity prices by having more energy to spread the fixed costs over.""

Another factor that could impact utility bills is the Trump administration's stand against renewable energy projects, said Sorelle Friedler, a professor of computer science at Haverford College who served as the assistant director for data and democracy under the Biden administration. The Interior Department's policies are causing permitting delays and the agency has been reviewing previously approved wind and solar farms.

""So we're actually, as a society right now, reducing the amount of energy that we could be generating while increasing the usage of it,"" Friedler said. ""So I don't think that's going to be good for any of our energy bills.""

To try to protect consumers, some politicians are stepping in. In New Jersey, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill campaigned on halting rising utility costs, promising to freeze rates and declare a ""state of emergency on utility costs"" on her first day in office.

""My priority is relief to New Jersey consumers, and I will bring everyone to the table to deliver it,"" she said in a statement.

Environmental impact

The AI boom is only a few years old so grasping the environmental impact can be challenging, but a study by Cornell University researchers published last month in the journal Nature Sustainability set out to quantify the industry's ecological footprint – and their estimations are staggering.

Depending on the speed of AI growth, researchers said U.S. data centers could eventually consume as much as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars per year, which would be equivalent of the annual resource consumption of the entire state of New York.

The Cleveland-Cliffs project in Plymouth Township calls for electricity generated by use natural gas turbines, which is cleaner than burning coal but still emits pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxides, formaldehyde and benzene. The Environmental Protection Agency warns that exposure to these types of emissions can have serious health effects, even though power plants have made great strides in reducing them over the past couple decades.

""As soon as we heard natural gas turbines ... we became incredibly alarmed,"" said Smith, the organizer of the petition against the project. ""... My preferred exposure to formaldehyde is honestly zero per year.""

The cooling system needed to prevent servers from overheating also has an environmental impact. Google said in 2021 that its average data center consumed around 450,000 gallons of water per day, which it said was the ""same amount of water used to irrigate 17 acres of turf lawn grass once.""

In their study, the Cornell scientists recommend holding tech companies to similar standards put on vehicle manufacturers to mandate fuel efficiency – with tighter regulations, more transparency and benchmarks for energy usage.",https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/USATSI_27527015.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:22.284153

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem.","Judith Enck has spent her entire career working to protect public health and the environment.

Enck took the helm of New York’s oldest environmental organization, Environmental Advocates NY, soon after graduating college, then went on to hold senior leadership roles in state and federal government, including as deputy secretary for the environment in the New York Governor’s Office and a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator during Barack Obama’s two terms. Now, as a professor at Bennington College and president of the Vermont-based nonprofit Beyond Plastics, Enck is on a mission to “end plastic pollution everywhere.”

Toward that end, Enck, who describes herself as a “solid waste gal,” wrote a new book with journalist Adam Mahoney called “The Problem With Plastic.”

The main problem with plastic, the authors say, is that it’s ubiquitous, polluting the planet, driving climate change and making us sick.

Plastic production has increased exponentially, from about 2 million tons a year in 1950 to 450 million tons a year today, with no limit in sight. And because plastics are made from fossil fuels and thousands of toxic chemicals derived from oil and gas, they cause harm throughout their life cycle, from extraction of the fossil fuels they’re made of to their production, use and disposal. Low-income communities and people of color who live near plastic plants bear the brunt of the industry’s toxic emissions, Enck and Mahoney say. Yet we all inhale and consume hundreds of thousands of microplastics per year.

Plastics have become so pervasive that scientists have found them blowing in the wind, near the peak of Mt. Everest, in the snow of Antarctica, in the ocean’s deepest trenches, in placentas, breast milk, stool, blood, lungs and even in our brains.

Plastic was never designed to be recycled, Enck explains in the book. The only aspect of plastics actually being recycled is the myth that recycling will stop plastic pollution. Inside Climate News recently spoke with Enck about the extent of the plastic crisis, its role in the climate crisis and what it will take to move beyond plastic. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

LIZA GROSS: Was there a specific moment or event that made you decide that plastic pollution was the issue you wanted to devote your time and energy to?

JUDITH ENCK: Well, there are two moments. One is the moment I was born. My parents, the late Helen and Sonny Enck, named me after St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. But I don’t believe plastics is a lost cause. I just think it’s an uphill battle.

But seriously, I do remember a moment, though it’s not like I wasn’t following the issue.

I was sitting at my desk at EPA Region 2 in lower Manhattan, and I read an article about the massive amount of plastic loading into the ocean, and it stopped me in my tracks. I know how important the ocean is, a major source of protein for most of the world. And I read that about 80 percent of plastic in the ocean comes from the land. It’s roadside litter that goes down a storm drain, into a stream, into a river, into the ocean. Or it’s derelict fishing gear. And it is really damaging the ocean.

And I decided at that moment, when I left the EPA, I was going to work on plastics. I didn’t know how, I didn’t know where, but that’s what led to the launching of Beyond Plastics, and then eventually the writing of this book.

GROSS: People often talk about plastics breaking down, but I’ve heard you say that’s not the right way to think about it. Could you expand on that?

ENCK: Plastics are made from fossil fuels and chemicals, and they are not degradable. So they don’t break down, they become smaller pieces of plastic. And in many ways, those smaller pieces are a much greater risk. So five millimeters or less is a microplastic, the size of a grain of salt. And then even smaller than that is a nanoplastic, and that’s what we’re breathing in and swallowing and, and that’s what’s building up from the Himalayan Mountains to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and everything in between.

GROSS: One thing that people might be surprised to learn is that plastic recycling was actually a PR strategy. In the book, you say that’s been part of a strategy to shift responsibility from the producer onto the individual consumer, to obscure the fact that companies are producing huge volumes of materials that can’t be recycled. How did that strategy become so effective?

ENCK: Because we were all subjected to a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign by plastic companies deceiving us into thinking we can recycle most of our plastic, which just isn’t true. You can recycle an old aluminum can into a new can, newspaper into cardboard or other paper products. But with plastics, we’ve got 16,000 different chemicals, many different colors, many different plastic types, or polymers. Think of your own home. You may have a bright orange plastic soap detergent near your washing machine and a black plastic takeout container in your refrigerator and a plastic bag on your counter. None of them can be recycled together. You have to separate everything by color, by chemical and by polymer. The people who know this the best there are plastic manufacturers, and yet they chose to spend millions of dollars telling us, don’t worry about all of your single-use plastic packaging, for instance, just put it in your recycling bin. But it really messes up recycling programs.

So I want to be clear: People should keep recycling paper, cardboard, metal and glass, and compost your yard waste and your food waste. But plastic recycling has been an abysmal failure.

GROSS: I was surprised to learn that the industry intentionally created confusion around recycling symbols, conflating the chasing arrows symbol that indicates products were made out of recycled materials with the numbers used to indicate things that can be recycled. It’s amazing how those very simple symbols could be such a powerful tool of misinformation.

ENCK: Yes. On one hand, it’s great that people look for the symbol because they want to do their part. But it is a huge problem when it’s used deceptively. The [Federal Trade Commission] has a voluntary guide that tells you when you can and cannot say that something is recyclable and when you should and shouldn’t use the symbol. But it’s voluntary, so most of the companies ignore that.

And you know, when pressed, I do say keep recycling number one and number two plastic. You have a little bit of a fighting chance that they will get recycled. Most of the other plastic either gets littered in the environment or goes to landfills or to incinerators. And what’s really troubling is, unless plastic is burned at a garbage incinerator, which is fraught with air pollution and other pollution problems, every single piece of plastic ever created is still on the earth today.

GROSS: Even if we were able to recycle things, with all the chemicals that are in these plastics, wouldn’t recycling just be concentrating the chemicals? Do we need to worry about that with the items that actually can be recycled, the ones and twos, as well?

ENCK: A lot of these 16,000 chemicals are very toxic. We’re talking about PFAS chemicals, lead, mercury, cadmium, vinyl chloride, things that should not be touching our food. Beyond Plastics does not believe that recycled plastic should be used in any food packaging. We don’t want food or beverage packaging made from recycled plastic.

We’ve looked a little bit at the Food and Drug Administration process for companies to get approval to use recycled plastic in their consumer products. And the nicest thing I can say about it is it’s a very flimsy process itself. It’s self-reporting, and the FDA seems to have a giant rubber stamp out. They’re not looking out for our health and our well-being when they allow recycled-content plastic for food packaging.

GROSS: Speaking of all these toxic chemicals in plastics, scientists have been linking plastics increasingly to all sorts of non-communicable diseases. What are they learning about potential mechanisms of harm in what seems to be a relatively new yet ballooning research field?

ENCK: It is new, which is why the cuts in federal funding for public health research is so concerning. The first really comprehensive study I looked at was the presence of microplastics in the human placenta, which was done by Dr. Ragusa in Rome with some other Italian scientists. The baby is only in utero for seven, eight, nine months and is already being born pre-polluted, and there’s also microplastics in breast milk.

Microplastics have been found in virtually every part of the human body that scientists have looked at. We either inhale them or we swallow them, and microplastics have been found in our blood, our kidneys, our lungs, male testicles.

I think two of the most significant studies are one that was published by New England Journal of Medicine, looking at microplastics in the heart arteries, and they looked at plaque, and found if you had microplastics on the plaque, which many of the patients did, you had an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and premature death. And then another recent study looking at microplastics in the brain unfortunately documented that the microplastics, nanoplastics, cross the blood-brain barrier and increase risk of Alzheimer’s and other neurological diseases.

And recently there have been a couple articles about people asking, can you get it out of your body? It’s not like lead and chelation. You know, there’s no easy way to get this out of your body. So let’s redouble our efforts to prevent it from going into our bodies.

GROSS: What is the best way for people to keep this stuff out of our bodies?

ENCK: You can’t shop your way out of this problem. There are some steps you can take. The book has a section for people to do a home audit. Look at your kitchen. Get rid of that plastic cutting board. Do not put plastic in the microwave. Only buy cotton bed sheets because you’re spending, on a good day, seven hours in bed, so make sure your sheets and blankets are not made of plastic.

I know a lot of people who tell me the great lengths they go to avoid plastic, and if I’m close friends with them, I say, “That’s really good—could you spend half of that time calling your legislator and writing a letter to the editor?” We have to get systemic change. We have to mainstream alternatives to plastics.

Now here’s the good news: A lot of the alternatives are already here. Give me old-fashioned paper, cardboard, metal, glass, because it can be made from recycled material, and actually does get recycled. But I want to emphasize, by far the most important thing is reduction, reuse and refill. Building that refill-reuse infrastructure is crucial.

GROSS: There’s a lot of talk about stopping plastic pollution at its source. So just cap the production. More than 100 countries during the recent U.N. plastics treaty talks pushed for that to no avail. What do you think some of the most promising strategies are to really get a handle on this crisis?

ENCK: I think the action is at the state and local level. There are a lot of people—and we wrote the book for these very people who want to do something about the plastic crisis—and they can show up at their city council and say, “Let’s ban plastic bags.” They can show up at their county legislature and say, “Let’s provide funding to Meals on Wheels and restaurants to install dishwashing equipment so we’re not all eating our delicious food off of, you know, polystyrene plastic plates and forks.”

The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.

And then you climb the ladder. In New York, for instance, New York City banned plastic bags, and then the state did. That one little thing of banning all plastic bags at retail stores has been immense, and it’s just one of many things that can happen.

“The way we’re going to win is with probably 1,000 different strategies, with tens of thousands of different people in the lead. This issue really calls out for local action.”

GROSS: There was a pretty striking stat in the book about plastic production emitting four times more greenhouse gases than the global aviation industry, which we think of as a massive contributor to the climate crisis. Why do you think the connection between climate and plastic is still unappreciated?

ENCK: Climate change has been front and center for a long time, and it is an overwhelming problem. Then you layer on plastics as a climate issue—it’s just a lot. But it’s actually not hard to document. Back in 2001 I wanted to figure out, because no one else had done it, what are the greenhouse gas emissions over the plastic life cycle?

We commissioned a report to look at greenhouse gas emissions from production, use and disposal, and what we found was pretty disturbing. We found that 232 million tons of greenhouse gases were emitted every year. That’s the equivalent of 116 coal-fired power plants. So we did this report, The New Coal: Plastics and Climate Change.

Beyond Plastics and the Center for International Environmental Law both identified plastics as a major climate issue. I just think the climate crisis is overwhelming, and people think about power production and transportation.

Now here’s the great irony: fossil fuel companies know they’re losing market share for transportation and power production. So their plan B is plastic production. The largest plastic producer in the U.S. today is ExxonMobil.

GROSS: You dedicated the book to the low-income communities of color living in the shadow of plastics facilities in the Gulf Coast and beyond. Are there any stories you heard from people living near these plants that really stuck with you?

ECNK: I was in Port Arthur, Texas, a couple years ago, and looking at this enormous petrochemical buildout, with local residents dependent upon the jobs, dependent upon this industry to keep Port Arthur alive, and yet Port Arthur is not doing well. I toured the Houston Ship Channel with a representative from Houston Air Alliance, and saw how close people’s homes are to these facilities. Same thing in Cancer Alley in Louisiana.

Our government has allowed the creation of sacrifice zones, and that is unethical. If people had resources, a lot of them would move. But they don’t have financial resources, nor should they move. These are their ancestral homes.

You hear Jo and Joy Banner with the Descendants Project talking about how we went from plantations to chemical plants. The through line is racism. So it means a lot to have, for instance, Dr. Robert Bullard endorse the book and the others, mostly women, happy to be profiled. They’re just doing extraordinary work, facing enormous odds, but they’re also winning.

Gross: Is there a final hopeful message you’d like to share?

ENCK: We wanted the book to be hopeful, which is hard to do on this issue. But we are hopeful, because while I don’t live in Cancer Alley or the Houston Ship Channel, I can work on policies to reduce the demand for plastics. That’s why we wrote the book. You can’t just leave it to people living in Cancer Alley to solve the problem.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2226334572-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 09:01:07.471384

Read also: The Role of Sustainable Practices in Modern Supply Chain Management

The pandemic and geopolitical chaos have exposed the fragility of global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rates overseas is no longer viable. When the true costs emerge, delays, lost sales, and bloated inventory, the math favors inventory that is closer to the customer. When a container is delayed or a supplier in Asia is disrupted, empty shelves, stock-outs, and lost sales flood the P&L. Availability and next-day (or near-next-day) fulfilment matter far more to consumers than the country of origin. That shifts the advantage toward production and logistics closer to demand.

The Proof It’s Happening (and Not Just Rhetoric)

US Export-Import Bank Commits $100 Billion to Secure Supply Chains

This resurgence isn’t a talking point — it’s measurable.

Manufacturing and construction are at historic levels. As companies regionalize production, such as chips, batteries, and clean-energy components, spending on U.S. factory construction has surged to unprecedented highs, reaching a $223 billion seasonally adjusted annual rate in July 2025 (up from low double-digit billions less than a decade ago).

Reshoring is driving real employment growth. The nonprofit Reshoring Initiative reports that 244,000 jobs were announced in 2024, tied to reshoring and foreign direct investment, with a cumulative total of ~1.7 million jobs since 2010. Announcements aren’t the same as payrolls, but they do signal capital commitments, vendor build-outs, and logistics reconfiguration.

Companies are publicly committing to significant U.S. investments. For example, Texas Instruments announced plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing (in Texas and Utah), creating some 60,000 jobs. Nvidia, TSMC, IBM, and Apple have all followed suit, publicly announcing investments in U.S. manufacturing capacity this year.

Collectively, these indicators point to a re-anchoring of critical production closer to end demand.

The Technology Stack Making “Made in America” Competitive

Ultimately, it’s not enough to bring the factory home. The new path to competitiveness is via digital + proximity. Ten years ago, domestic production was seen as a cost burden. Today, tech is turning it into a competitive advantage:

AI and advanced dispatch replace manual routing, compressing decision cycles from hours to seconds.

Digital twins enable companies to simulate thousands of “what-if” supply-chain scenarios (supplier shifts, demand swings, regional disruptions) before committing capex.

Automation and robotics reduce repetitive labor and human error across inbound, warehouse, and packaging operations.

End-to-end visibility at the SKU or carton level enables leaner inventories without sacrificing control.

Executives are leaning in: Deloitte’s 2025 smart-manufacturing research reveals that manufacturers are intensifying their digital initiatives to navigate complex transformations, mitigate operational risks, and mitigate labor scarcity. Broader Deloitte work finds the vast majority of manufacturers are already implementing advanced digital capabilities beyond pilots.

From Strategy to Execution: A New Playbook for the American Supply Chain

The new manufacturing boom isn’t just about bringing production back; it’s about moving smarter once it’s here. Modern supply chains are increasingly defined by:

Flexible fleets that shift seamlessly between middle-mile, LTL, and final-mile modes.

Dynamic cross-docks and forward deployments that position inventory closer to regional demand.

Software-orchestrated visibility that enables instant reconfiguration when disruptions occur.

Success metrics that matter to customers: on-time delivery, inventory turns, sell-through, cost-to-serve (which now includes dwell, touches and damage).

Here’s what that looks like in practice:

Start at the Customer Edge.Don’t “boil the network.” Begin with the customer promise and work backward. Identify where long lead times or stockouts are breaking the experience, and pilot near-market solutions that close the gap. Modular, tech-enabled cross-docks and forward-deployed inventory enable the repositioning of freight closer to demand, allowing for faster fulfillment without the need for permanent infrastructure.

Use Automation to Offset Labor Costs.The real savings aren’t in cutting labor, they’re in cutting waste. AI-driven routing, dynamic load planning, and real-time dispatch reduce empty miles and idle time across middle-mile and LTL operations. When every mile, pallet, and dock slot is optimized automatically, higher employee wages become a non-issue.

Design for Optionality, Not Rigidity.Volatility is permanent, so optionality must be too. Build networks that can flex between modes – dedicated, pool, LTL, or parcel injections – based on cost, demand, or disruption. Tech-orchestrated nodes and dynamic cross-docks enable you to shorten lanes, diversify port of entry points, and rebalance flows in hours, not weeks.

Choose Partners for Adaptability.Yesterday’s networks were built on legacy partnerships; tomorrow’s are built on APIs. Work with providers who can deliver bespoke solutions in weeks, integrate live data into your TMS, and adjust service levels dynamically. Transparency, automation, and speed of integration are now the true hallmarks of reliability.

Future-Proof Against Policy and Tariff Shocks.Geopolitics won’t stabilize anytime soon. Prepare for tariff or sourcing volatility with digital twins and scenario modeling that simulate the impact of cost, transit time, and service across different configurations. When border rules or input prices change overnight, your network shouldn’t stall; it should re-route itself.

The “American Supply Chain Renaissance” isn’t about waving flags. It’s a pragmatic response to customers who value “in-stock tomorrow” over theoretical landed-cost savings next quarter. Capex is flowing into U.S. factories at record levels; policy is accelerating strategic sectors; digital operations are collapsing time and risk. Companies that align proximity with intelligence and measure success the way customers actually feel it will set the pace in the decade ahead.

Industry Context & Drivers

What factors are driving the resurgence of “Made in America” in supply chains today? It’s simple: speed wins. Consumers don’t care where something is made—they care if it’s in their hands tomorrow. COVID and geopolitical chaos ripped the cover off fragile global supply chains, and the old model of chasing the lowest labor rate overseas doesn’t cut it anymore. When the true costs show up—delays, lost sales, bloated inventory—the math favors being close to the customer. That’s the shift.

How have global disruptions reshaped the cost-benefit analysis of nearshoring or reshoring? For decades, companies optimized for the lowest unit cost. That equation was broken the moment a container stuck offshore meant empty shelves and millions in lost sales. The smarter equation now is reliability times speed, divided by risk. Nearshoring and reshoring aren’t patriotic gestures—they’re risk-adjusted, customer-centric business decisions.

In what ways has technology made domestic manufacturing and logistics more viable compared to five or ten years ago? We’re not relying on nostalgia. We’re relying on new math powered by technology. AI dispatches trucks instantly, robotics strip out warehouse labor, digital visibility lets you run leaner without losing control. Ten years ago, U.S. production looked like a cost drag. Today, tech is what makes it a competitive weapon.

Technology’s Role

Which supply chain technologies are enabling companies to make U.S.-based production competitive? The breakthroughs are in AI, robotics, digital twins, and visibility. AI kills wasted human planning hours. Robotics remove repetitive labor. Digital twins let you test a thousand network scenarios before you spend a dollar. And SKU-level visibility puts you in control of inventory in ways legacy systems never could. This isn’t about keeping up—it’s about leapfrogging.

How are freight networks and logistics infrastructure evolving to support more regionalized supply chains? We’re breaking away from the monolithic mega-DC playbook. The future is modular and on-demand. Flexible fleets, dynamic cross-docks, forward deployments—it’s about configuring networks in real time around customer demand. That’s why we built Warp. Legacy LTL and pool providers are frozen in 1995. Shippers don’t need nostalgia, they need adaptability.

Do you see “Made in America” relying more on digital coordination than physical expansion? Absolutely. You don’t win by pouring concrete; you win by coordinating smarter. We don’t need ten times the warehouses—we need networks that operate like living systems, with software that flexes every asset at peak performance. The future of Made in America is built on digital intelligence, not brute force.

Investor & Policy Perspective

How are government incentives shaping decisions around domestic production and logistics? The CHIPS Act and IRA didn’t just hand out subsidies—they reprogrammed boardroom strategy. If the factory’s in the U.S., the logistics backbone has to be here too. Incentives are accelerants, but the underlying fire is customer demand for faster, more reliable supply chains.

What are investors looking for in logistics and supply chain tech companies tied to the Made in America trend? Investors are done with vanity metrics and “Uber for freight” slides. They’re asking: does your technology actually bend the cost curve and improve service? At Warp, the answer is yes—because we eliminate manual waste in freight networks. That means lower costs, faster delivery, and happier customers. That’s what investors want: defensible tech tied to customer outcomes.

Are U.S.-based logistics startups seeing a funding boost tied to this shift? Yes, but the bar is higher. Spray-and-pray money is dead. What’s left is disciplined capital chasing companies that align with policy, with economics, and with customer reality. If you can prove you’re making Made in America competitive by giving customers faster, cheaper, more reliable freight, there’s money for you.

Actionable Insights for Shippers

What are the first steps shippers should take if they want to rebalance supply chains toward U.S. sourcing or production? Start with the customer experience. Where are you failing them today—stockouts, long lead times, unreliable deliveries? Map those pain points, then rebuild lanes and sourcing strategies around fixing them first. Don’t boil the ocean. Prove it one customer problem at a time.

How can shippers use technology to identify cost savings that offset higher domestic labor costs? Focus on eliminating waste, not labor. Visibility down to the carton, automated routing, smarter packaging, dynamic cross-docks. When you cut out empty miles, extra touches, and bloated safety stock, you offset labor costs overnight. Tech isn’t just a cost saver—it’s a customer experience enhancer.

Which metrics or KPIs should shippers track to evaluate the success of reshoring or nearshoring moves? Measure what your customer feels. On-time pickup and delivery, inventory turns, sell-through rate, cost to serve, damage claims. If your shelves are full, your deliveries are predictable, and your product is moving faster, you’re winning. Anything else is noise.

What kinds of partnerships should shippers prioritize in a Made in America strategy? Only partner with tech-enabled providers who can build around your needs. You don’t need “relationships” and handshakes—you need innovators who can stand up bespoke solutions fast. That’s the difference between another vendor and a true competitive edge.

For companies hesitant about reshoring, what low-risk pilots or partial moves could they test? Pilot with the customer in mind. High-margin SKUs, seasonal launches, or key markets where delivery speed drives loyalty. Or consolidate inbound vendor freight domestically. Start small, but make sure the experiment ties directly to customer outcomes—faster shelves stocked, fewer delays, higher sales.",https://www.globaltrademag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2635552345-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 05:58:09.741367

“This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills?
“I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.” Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs.","As loyal Republicans, Reece Payton said that he and his family of cattle ranchers in Hogansville, Ga., had one thing on their minds when they cast their ballots in November for the state’s utility board — “to make a statement.”

They were already irked by their escalating electric bills, not to mention an extra $50 a month levied by their local utility to cover a new nuclear power plant more than 200 miles away. But after they heard a data center might be built next to their Logos Ranch, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, they had enough of Republicans who seemed far too receptive to the interests of the booming artificial intelligence industry.

“That’s the first time I ever voted Democrat,” Mr. Payton, 58, said.

Message sent.

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips.

The utility also offers rebates for customers of any income for purchasing electric appliances, including geothermal heat pumps.","Jean Gay-Robinson said she ​“cried tears of joy” when utility ComEd switched all the polluting gas-fired equipment in her Chicago home to modern electric versions, at no cost to her. As a retiree on a fixed income, she is relieved that she’ll likely never have to buy another appliance, her energy bills are lower, and her home feels safer. ​“I don’t have to worry about gas blowing up or carbon monoxide, that kind of nonsense,” she said.

Gay-Robinson is among the hundreds of people who have benefited from a provision of Illinois’ 2021 clean-energy law that allows electric utilities to meet energy-conservation mandates in part by outfitting low-income households with electric appliances that reduce their bills — even though such overhauls actually increase, rather than decrease, electricity use.

Such policies are rare nationwide, but the approach could be a tool to help keep building decarbonization rolling as the Trump administration kills federal incentives for home electrification.

Modern electrical appliances — like induction stoves, electric dryers, and heat pumps that warm and cool spaces — are generally much more energy-efficient than their fossil-fueled counterparts. That means electrifying appliances cuts the amount of fossil fuels burned, even in places where gas and coal plants feed the power grid, said Nick Montoni, senior program director of policy and markets at the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center at North Carolina State University. As more renewable energy comes online, the emissions linked to electrical appliances decrease even further.

Plus, families breathe significantly cleaner indoor air when they change to an electric cooktop, due to the slew of health-harming pollutants emitted by gas stoves.

But replacing appliances is not cheap, and under the Trump administration’s budget law, federal tax credits to help households afford electric heat pumps and water heaters expire in December — seven years earlier than they were previously supposed to. Meanwhile, the future is uncertain for the federally funded Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates (HEAR) program, an Inflation Reduction Act initiative that is administered by states and provides incentives for electric appliances. While some states have already launched their HEAR programs, the Trump administration put the remaining funds on ice earlier this year, and Illinois has not yet received its allotment.

Amid this federal upheaval, state policies that incentivize utilities to pick up the tab for electrification can be especially impactful.

“It’s expensive to electrify because it requires up-front cost,” said Montoni, who formerly served as deputy chief of staff at the Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. ​“You have to be able to afford a heat pump, an induction stove, an electric water heater — those aren’t inexpensive. That’s why there are rebates and incentives.”

Illinois utilities commit to electrification

Illinois law requires ComEd to cut electricity consumption each year by an amount equivalent to 2% of the utility’s annual sales in the early 2020s. The state’s other big electric utility, Ameren, faces similar rules in 2029 under a law passed this fall, though in the past it had lower savings mandates.

The 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act specifies that a portion of mandated energy savings — 5% since 2022, 10% starting next year, and 15% after 2029 — can come from electrification. The law also created a formula to convert the amount of energy used by a gas-powered appliance to electricity in kilowatt-hours, allowing an estimate of how much energy is saved by switching from gas to electric.

“So if a home gets partially or fully electrified through an electric energy-efficiency program, the utility claims the savings by calculating the difference between the gas therms in kilowatt-hour equivalents and the kilowatt[-hours] added via the electric measures,” explained Kari Ross, Midwest energy affordability advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Montoni called the policy ​“a pretty interesting mechanism — not unique, but very rare, from what I’ve seen.”

Michigan does have a similar policy, since a 2023 law allows electric and gas utilities to claim electrification as part of their mandatory energy-waste reduction. That legislation also includes a formula for determining the energy-efficiency gains from going electric.

Montoni said allowing electric utilities to count electrification toward their efficiency mandates is an important way to incentivize the shift off fossil fuels, especially in the more than a dozen states where different utilities provide electric and gas service.

When a utility provides both gas and electricity, electrification will typically show overall energy savings, Montoni explained. But when a utility provides only electricity, a formula similar to Illinois’ is needed for the utility to show that it is saving energy, even though a given customer’s electricity use actually increases after electrification.

In northern Illinois, ComEd is the primary electric utility, operating alongside two major gas utilities.

Through its whole-home energy-efficient electrification program, ComEd pays all up-front costs for electric appliances and heat pumps for households earning at or below 80% of the area median income. That initiative has electrified over 700 low-income households since it launched in 2022. The utility also offers rebates for customers of any income for purchasing electric appliances, including geothermal heat pumps.

ComEd’s energy-efficiency plan approved by state regulators says that a quarter of spending on electrification must be for low-income households, and the utility can undertake electrification only if it will save a customer money on their energy bills. Michigan’s law includes a similar provision.

“We carefully model each home to make sure proposed upgrades result in energy savings,” said Philip Roy, ComEd’s director of clean energy solutions. ​“Nationally, I’m pretty sure this is one of the more ambitious approaches to electrification, especially for income-eligible customers.”

Gay-Robinson said she has saved some money on her bills since her home’s overhaul last summer, and more importantly, she has reliable appliances to get through Chicago’s extreme weather.

She recommended the ComEd overhaul to a friend, who was suffering through hot summers in poor health and without air-conditioning. Gay-Robinson thinks the electric heating-cooling system her friend got at no cost may have saved her life.

Gay-Robinson said she still prefers cooking with gas, but she’s grateful ComEd provided new cookware along with her electric induction stove. ​“I thought it would be hard to even work the doggone stove. It looks like something out of the future,” she said. ​“But it wasn’t as hard as I thought.”

More retrofits like Gay-Robinson’s are on the way. In an agreement with stakeholder groups and regulators, ComEd has committed to spend a total of $162.3 million over the next four years on electrification and weatherization, which reduces the amount of power needed to heat and cool spaces.

In central and southern Illinois, Ameren provides both gas and electric service.

Ameren has not undertaken ambitious electrification programs like ComEd, and it had lower energy-efficiency mandates until the clean-energy law passed in October brought its targets into parity with ComEd’s. But Ameren will spend $5 million through 2029 helping customers switch from propane-fired heat, which is common in rural areas, to electric heat pumps.

Changing times

Home-electrification retrofits that lower energy bills may be harder to come by in Illinois and beyond in the future, as electricity prices spike due to the record-high cost of securing enough power-generating capacity for the PJM Interconnection regional grid, which spans 13 states.

Since ComEd is only allowed to offer customers new electrical appliances that will reduce their bills, high electricity prices mean some exchanges that worked in the past will no longer qualify; keeping a gas appliance may be cheaper.

“We are in a moment where further iteration is needed” on electrification policies, said Roy, also citing the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on appliance costs and the looming expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient equipment.

“We see a lot of momentum with these programs,” said Roy. ​“We think [electrification] will play a key role in not just energy-efficiency goals but broader energy policy. Combining all those elements — traditional energy efficiency, electrification, rooftop solar, battery storage — we have a lot of the tools, we just have to fine-tune the policy structures and incentives so we can accelerate the transition.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Water-heater-being-moved_GettyImages-2169894284.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f619c14dad71f25dfc6335203aeadbc5,N,,2025-12-01 04:58:19.927393

European leaders paint an optimistic picture: South Africa possesses abundant renewable resources, critical minerals for electrolysers, and growing industrial capacity that could position it as a global clean hydrogen leader. South African President Ramaphosa echoes this enthusiasm, envisioning hydrogen as a way to marry Africa’s mineral wealth with renewable energy to decarbonise industries while creating jobs and stimulating investment.

While green hydrogen development is promoted as a climate necessity and force for sustainable development, the inequitable investment partnerships South Africa is making with foreign partners risk reproducing the same extractive relationships where African countries provide raw input while others reap the industrial and financial benefits.

In global trade relations, access to resources and production capacity has rarely translated into control or equitable benefit. Africa’s vast resource potential has historically been externally controlled, with limited domestic value capture. This pattern risks repeating itself in the emerging green hydrogen economy.

South Africa holds a critical role in the emerging hydrogen economy as a source of renewable energy and green hydrogen production. Yet, its position is increasingly shaped by structural and historical dynamics, reducing it to a resource extraction zone, serving the decarbonization and energy security goals of Global North partners.

While European nations secure high-value activities such as technology development, market leadership, financing, trade agreements, and certification schemes within their own borders, South Africa is relegated to low-value roles in production and supply.

Germany’s National Hydrogen Strategy, for example, positions the country as the “lead provider of hydrogen technologies by 2030” (e.g. fuel cell technology), while sourcing hydrogen from partner countries in the Global South. Partner countries are expected to supply raw materials and low-value hydrogen commodities, while Germany retains control over advanced technologies and market access. Similarly, the Netherlands positions itself as Europe’s “hydrogen gateway,” capturing lucrative trading, storage, and transport activities while externalising environmental and social costs to supplier nations.

South Africa’s own Green Hydrogen Commercialisation Strategy, though framed as nationally driven, emphasises export markets. It outlines a vision for over 100 GW of dedicated renewable energy capacity, primarily for export, requiring extensive infrastructure such as desalination plants, specialised transport networks, and dedicated export ports.

This export-first approach risks diverting renewable energy away from urgent domestic priorities like energy access, industrialisation, and job creation, reinforcing green extractivism; the appropriation of land, water, and other resources for renewable energy projects in ways that replicate the exploitative patterns of fossil fuel extraction rather than inclusive development.

Mechanisms of contemporary extraction

Green extractivism operates through sophisticated neoliberal mechanisms that legitimise resource appropriation as a climate necessity. Foreign direct investment and public-private partnerships establish corporate-led governance frameworks that prioritise investor returns over local benefits. Rather than supporting adaptation and mitigation for vulnerable populations, climate finance consolidates corporate control over resource governance and embedding neoliberal policy frameworks within national strategies.

South Africa has restructured its institutions and policies to create an investor-friendly ecosystem, offering tax incentives, subsidies, and tailored regulatory processes to attract foreign investment. The German KfW Development Bank’s allocation of $1.3 billion to support South Africa’s hydrogen sector comes with structural reform conditions mandating increased private sector participation in energy governance. Public funds are channelled through the blended finance platform SA-H2 Fund to de-risk investment in the Coega Green Ammonia project, led by UK-based Hive Energy.

Despite its strategic importance, the project’s value chain remains largely dominated by foreign entities. Its substantial output of one million tonnes of green ammonia annually is geared toward export markets in Asia and Europe. Financial risks are socialised through public funding, while profits are expected to flow primarily to international investors.

South Africa’s profound structural vulnerabilities, shared by many African economies, undermine its position in international energy and trade relationships. Economic fragility, driven by persistent unemployment, extreme inequality, currency depreciation, and Eskom’s debt crisis, intersects with critical infrastructure deficits across multiple sectors. The country faces a strained electricity grid, limited gas pipeline infrastructure, water scarcity in regions targeted for hydrogen production, and port facilities ranked among the world’s least efficient.

These vulnerabilities create conditions where any promise of development becomes difficult to refuse, regardless of its terms. While South Africa mobilises its renewable energy resources to serve European decarbonisation goals, millions of its citizens continue to experience energy insecurity through persistent load-shedding. Even green fertilisers produced from hydrogen remain unaffordable for smallholder farmers.

Renewable energy generation for hydrogen production requires vast territorial appropriations that bring industrial development into direct conflict with existing land uses. Hydrogen production is particularly water-intensive, exacerbating water scarcity in arid regions like the Northern Cape, where major projects are planned.

The transformation of strategic ‘Hydrogen Hubs’ treats these regions as abstract spaces for industrial development rather than lived environments sustaining cultural identity and economic security. Sasol’s Boegoebaai hydrogen cluster in the Northern Cape, spanning 60,000 hectares, risks dispossessing the indigenous Nama people of their ancestral lands.

Similarly, the deep-water port and desalination facility to support hydrogen production risks disrupting marine ecosystems due to brine discharge, increased salinity, and thermal pollution from desalination plants. The fishing community also face displacement and loss of livelihoods, especially in areas like Port Nolloth.

Mpumalanga, long devastated as a sacrifice zone for coal production, has suffered from severe air pollution, land degradation, and widespread health impacts. The province is now home to three major green hydrogen projects being developed on land leased from Eskom, near existing coal infrastructure: Sasol Hyshift in Secunda, Camden Green Hydrogen and Ammonia in Ermelo, and HDF Renewstable Mpumalanga in Standerton.

This new wave of industrial transformation risks further marginalising local communities by concentrating the burdens of both the old carbon economy and the emerging green economy.

Contested vision of just transition

Despite the policy rhetoric emphasising ‘just transition’ — the shift to a low-carbon economy that ensures fairness and inclusion for workers and communities affected by the transition – current arrangements demonstrate a significant disconnect between transformative aspirations and material realities.

The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan shows a striking imbalance between infrastructural spending on large-scale export projects and social investments in community benefits and addressing energy poverty. Of the 1.5 trillion rand total investment, only 60.4 billion rand specifically targets just transition initiatives in Mpumalanga, the province most affected by coal sector transitions.

European hydrogen strategies, including the EU Hydrogen Strategy and related initiatives like the European Hydrogen Backbone and Clean Hydrogen Partnership, focus on industrial competitiveness, infrastructure development, and decarbonisation targets, completely ignoring community consultation. This systematic exclusion occurs despite South Africa’s constitutional commitments to democratic governance and communities’ rights to clean water and land.

There is an urgent call for a justice-centred ‘post-extractivist transition’, one that envisions development beyond resource extraction, prioritising ecological sustainability, community autonomy, and equitable benefit-sharing across Africa. This approach should centre local control in global climate and energy debates. While some level of resource extraction may be necessary to support the energy transition, such activities must reinforce rather than erode community rights, environmental stewardship, and inclusive development.

A justice-centred post-extractivist transition should restructure international energy and trade relationships to centre genuine community participation in project design and ownership structures, recognising communities’ right to refuse projects that don’t serve their interests, regardless of broader climate justifications. Instead of treating consultation as a mere procedural requirement, it should embed community veto power into governance structures and ensure affected populations maintain meaningful control over decisions affecting their territories.

Projects should demonstrate direct contributions to addressing energy poverty and strengthening local economies through community ownership models, local manufacturing capacity, and revenue sharing that enhances rather than displaces existing economic activities. The land-intensive nature of renewable energy infrastructure makes territorial rights central, requiring integration of renewable development with existing land uses and community priorities.

South Africa faces conflicting development visions: one treating the continent as an extraction zone serving global markets, and another positioning renewable energy as a foundation for energy sovereignty, democratic participation, and equitable development.

Current policy trajectories lean heavily toward the former, but structural contradictions point to the need for alternative visions. Alternative visions must challenge the financial, trade, and governance frameworks that privilege Global North interests over Global South priorities.

South Africa could leverage its strategic position differently. Rather than competing to offer the most attractive investment incentives, it could coordinate with other African hydrogen producers to establish minimum standards for foreign investment, similar to how oil-producing nations have used collective bargaining. Regional cooperation could help resist the race-to-the-bottom dynamics that characterise current negotiations.

While the global energy transition shows signs of reproducing historical patterns of extraction, it also holds the potential to become a foundation for more equitable international trade relations. The direction ultimately depends on whose interests shape the transition’s terms and whose voices are centred in energy governance. A justice-centred post-extractivist transition must recognise the complementarity of climate action and decolonisation, and pursue these together.

The hydrogen economy is still emerging, and its final structure remains contested. Decisions made in the coming years about ownership models, governance frameworks, and benefit-sharing mechanisms will determine whether this transition strengthens or undermines the prospects for genuine sustainable development in South Africa — and whether it becomes an effective tool for global decarbonisation.

At the Africa Climate Summit 2025 held in Addis Ababa in September 2025, leaders and experts explored ways Africa can benefit more from its resources.

Under the theme “Accelerating renewable energy, nature-based solutions, e-mobility, and scaling up climate finance,” the Summit sought ways to build a resilient and prosperous future for Africa. The important question, however, was whether Africa would continue exporting its raw materials for others to reap the profit or seize this moment and drive the agenda of its transformation.

Speaking at the Summit, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), Claver Gatete, called for a united African front in order to leverage these resources strategically.

“We cannot afford to repeat the exploitative patterns of the past,” he said. “Africa must industrialise using its own resources, creating jobs and sustainable growth of our people.”

The current net-zero clean energy race has triggered surging global demand for minerals used in batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, of which Africa is a key supplier.

Mr. Gatete emphasised the need for African governments to invest in local processing, value addition, and stronger regional cooperation, and avoid exporting raw minerals.

Risks and opportunities

The Summit highlighted both opportunities and risks. On one hand, critical minerals could generate billions in revenue, accelerate clean industrialisation and help Africa achieve the SDGs.

On the other hand, unchecked extraction will not benefit Africans and would worsen inequality and environmental degradation.

Mr. Gatete called for building continental capacity to process, refine, and manufacture components like batteries within Africa. He cited the ECA—Afreximbank Battery and Electric Vehicle (BEV) value chain initiative, launched in the DRC and Zambia, to build special economic zones (SEZ) for producing electric vehicle battery precursor and components as a concrete example of this shift “from resource extraction to technological innovation and prioritisation of local value addition.”

To expand this further, participants emphasised the importance of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to develop integrated regional value chains, reduce external dependence, and unlock economies of scale. In the same breath, they called for continental unity to avoid fragmented national policies that could weaken Africa’s bargaining power.

To address this, ECA proposed the formation of African Critical Minerals Alliance—to harmonise regulations, negotiate better trade deals and promote intra-African collaborations.

“Unity is our strength,” Mr. Gatete reminded participants. “By working together, African countries can ensure that green minerals become a foundation for prosperity, not another lost opportunity.”

Africa’s financing gap for climate action was also discussed at the Summit, with leaders renewing their calls for increased international climate finance, debt relief and technology transfer. They also underscore the importance of the private sector investment aimed at strengthening regional value chains, building local processing capacity and expanding critical infrastructure.

The Africa Climate Summit 2025 ended with the adoption of the Addis Ababa Declaration, a renewed commitment to place sustainability, equity, and local development at the heart of mineral exploitation. The message was clear—Africa holds the key to the global green transition. The challenge now is how to turn that potential into lasting, inclusive prosperity for its people.

One of the main changes in the solar industry is the decrease in installation costs. Sun wrote that ""the cost to install solar has plummeted by more than half over the last decade.""

Installing a solar system for your home is one of the most effective ways to save on your utility bills while sheltering your home from rising energy prices. Whether you decide to lease or purchase panels for your home ultimately depends on your budget and long-term housing situation.

""It's worth leasing if the costs to do so are cheaper than your current electricity bill,"" Sun wrote. ""If you can afford it, it's generally better to buy, especially if you plan to stay in your home for at least seven years.""

Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.","Heritage buildings face a dilemma – how to embrace the future without erasing the past.

As clean technologies and renewable energy gain momentum across the UK and beyond, historic buildings face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. This is, in part, intensified by concerns around their typically poor energy efficiency, often a result of age, design and traditional construction materials.

Many sustainable retrofits – such as LED lighting, heat pumps, and improved insulation – have proven relatively straightforward to implement without compromising the integrity or appearance of heritage and listed buildings. The integration of solar technology, however, has not always been readily accepted or implemented.

Solar roofing: Preserving the past while powering the future

Solar is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the world, but both official heritage guidelines and public opinion have indicated concern about the visual impact of traditional rooftop solar panels on historic buildings. The core challenge lies in reconciling modern, often bulky, technology with the architectural integrity and charm of the past.

Rooftops are ideal for solar installations, thanks to their unobstructed access to sunlight and efficient use of space. However, traditional solar panels can be visually intrusive – especially on heritage and protected buildings.

This is where building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar roofs come in: seamlessly integrated into the roof structure, they enable protected buildings to adopt clean energy without compromising aesthetics.

Blending into the architecture, quality solar roofing is often described as “invisible”. BIPV technology has now advanced to support buildings with distinctively coloured roofs – such as green oxidised copper or terracotta tiles – by offering solar materials in matching shades, allowing discreet rooftop solar integration for the first time.

UK heritage guidance embraces solar, but adoption remains limited

As the UK Government rolls out its ambitious Clean Power 2030 Action Plan – targeting 45–47 GW of solar generation capacity by 2030 – heritage organisations have also become increasingly committed to integrating solar into their properties and guidance policies; albeit with caution to protect visual appearance.

For example, Historic England updated its guidance in July 2024 to clarify that – with the necessary permissions and careful visual planning – solar panels can be appropriately integrated into heritage buildings. Prior to this, installations were often hindered by inconsistent decision-making across local councils.

However, despite this policy progress, uptake remains low. A government-commissioned review found that 87% of heritage building owners perceive listed-building consent as a barrier, and 75% say it prevents energy efficiency upgrades. In practice, only a small fraction of heritage buildings currently feature solar installations, highlighting the failure of standard panels to win widespread acceptance.

York Minster: The exception that proves the rule

Leading the way among religious buildings, the Church of England (one of the UK’s largest heritage custodians) pledged net-zero carbon emissions across its buildings by 2030. A recent example of solar integration is the iconic York Minster, which activated 184 solar panels in January 2025. These panels, discreetly positioned on the South Quire roof, will generate around 70,000 kWh annually – roughly a third of the Minster’s electricity demand.

Yet the installation drew public criticism: “Fitting panels to a historic building like that seems absurd…” and “That seems wrong on a historic building. I’m pro solar panels, but I don’t think they’re appropriate everywhere” are just two of the comments made by local members of the public when the solar plans were announced. This underscores how traditional panels can still clash with heritage sensibilities and deter broader adoption.

Still, the emissions and cost-savings potential of solar for heritage buildings is hard to ignore.

Bath Abbey offers a compelling feasibility study on solar’s potential: modelling suggests 164 PV panels could generate around 45 MWh per year – 35% of its annual usage – saving 10 tonnes of CO₂ annually, with payback in 13 years and a projected profit of £139,000 over 25 years.

Gloucester Cathedral – which installed 150 solar panels on its nave roof in 2016 – has reduced its energy costs by over 25%. It is considered the oldest UK cathedral with a solar installation, but one of many historic religious buildings in the UK to make such a move.

BIPV: The solution for widespread adoption

Rather than relying on rare, high-profile exceptions, the heritage sector now needs a solution built for scale – BIPV solar roofing delivers this.

Instead of ‘clashing’ with history, integrated solar roofing:

Merges with the existing roofline, avoiding the ‘stuck-on’ look

Mimics traditional materials like slate, terracotta or oxidised copper with coloured options

Eliminates the most significant barriers – visual impact and public resistance – by remaining discreet.

As Sonia Dunlop, CEO of the Global Solar Council, puts it, “In some cases, BIPV could be appropriate” for historic buildings, highlighting that suitable technology already exists today to meet the needs of heritage custodians.

Mock-up images of Westminster Abbey (top) and Canterbury Cathedral (bottom) demonstrating how the buildings would look if retrofitted with BIPV solar roofing

Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral are two examples of iconic UK heritage buildings which have not yet adopted solar PV despite the Church of England initiatives. Their esteemed heritage status rightly calls for more careful scrutiny of how installations might impact aesthetics.

Solar roofing offers a solution. Instead of traditional panels that may jar with the fabric of these sites, mock-ups show how discreet BIPV roofing could be applied seamlessly – maintaining their tradition and style whilst generating clean, renewable energy to keep the buildings running. For custodians of these buildings, this is the first credible way to reconcile climate action with heritage protection.

Balancing preservation with progress

Renewable energy is the future – and soon, even the most exceptional buildings will need to adapt. The key is applying innovative, tailored solutions that support organisations in making the transition – with respect for their values and context. Solar roofing delivers exactly this for heritage buildings.

It’s a two-way street: if we're asking heritage organisations to commit to climate action, we must also respect their stewardship of historic fabric and place. That’s the difference between symbolic early adoption and genuine, scaled climate leadership.

Marrying the past with the future may not be straightforward – but it's essential. These treasured buildings will only endure if we protect both their history and the planet they stand on.

This collaboration marks a significant step toward taking GM’s advanced battery technology beyond EVs and builds on GM and Redwood’s existing collaboration.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” said Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion and sustainability at GM. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars – we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

In June, Redwood Materials launched Redwood Energy, a new business that deploys both used EV packs and new modules into fast, low-cost energy-storage systems built to meet surging power demand from AI data centers and other applications. The memorandum enables Redwood to pair that integration expertise with both second-life GM EV packs and U.S.-built batteries, delivering a domestic solution from cell to system.

Already, GM second-life electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to help power the largest second-life battery development in the world and the largest microgrid in North America, at Redwood’s 12MW/63MWh installation in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

“Electricity demand is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, driven by AI and the rapid electrification of everything from transportation to industry,” said JB Straubel, founder and chief executive officer of Redwood Materials. “Both GM’s second-life EV batteries and new batteries can be deployed in Redwood’s energy storage systems, delivering fast, flexible power solutions and strengthening America’s energy and manufacturing independence.”

U.S. electricity demand continues to grow, driven in part by AI data centers that are on track to triple their share of national electricity usage from 4.4 percent in 2023 to 12 percent by 2028. As power consumption increases, there’s an expanding need for energy storage systems that can act to offset power outages and reinforce the grid when demand is high or supply is limited.

UK: National Grid has joined the Northern Powerhouse Partnership (NPP), strengthening its commitment to expanding clean-energy infrastructure, developing local skills, and supporting economic growth across the North of England. The move comes as part of The Great Grid Upgrade, the company’s wide-ranging investment programme designed to connect more affordable, home-grown renewable power to the national network.

The announcement was marked at the Eastern Green Link 2 (EGL2) converter station visitor centre in Wren Hall, recently opened by Keir Mather MP. The event brought together apprentices, industry leaders and regional partners, highlighting the collaboration behind the upgrade programme.

National Grid’s major projects in the North include Eastern Green Link 1 and 2, Yorkshire Green, and proposed developments such as the Cross Border Connection and North Humber to High Marnham. Collectively, the company’s network investment is expected to support up to 55,000 jobs across the UK by 2030, with a significant share in northern communities.

The economic impact is already visible. On EGL2 alone, construction partner BAM is creating around 200 roles, including apprenticeships and specialist engineering jobs. ‘Meet the buyer’ events for EGL1 and EGL2 have helped hundreds of northern SMEs access new opportunities in civil works, cabling, transport, environmental services and technical design. METLEN, delivering the EGL1 converter station, has so far awarded contracts worth around $225,000 (£170,000) to small and medium enterprises.

National Grid is also upgrading Grid Supply Points and replacing overhead line crossings, such as the River Tyne, with modern cable tunnel solutions to support regional transport, industry and long-term growth.

BACKGROUND The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS.
EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season.
Eliminations The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters.
However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.","On November 20, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Proposed Rule) in the Federal Register to update several regulatory definitions defining ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act (CWA).

The Proposed Rule is a culmination of decades of agency and judicial process that at times narrowed and expanded the scope of federal jurisdiction over our nation's waters. Driven by the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency (Sackett), the Trump Administration is poised to change the definition of WOTUS to limit federal jurisdiction. These changes are intended to respect State and Tribal authority and promote regulatory certainty and clarity.

As further explained below, the Proposed Rule would clarify the definition of WOTUS by defining ""continuous surface connection,"" ""relatively permanent,"" and ""tributaries,"" and would clarify several exemptions under the CWA. Additionally, the Proposed Rule would add a new exemption for groundwater and would eliminate interstate waters that don't themselves independently qualify as WOTUS from federal jurisdiction.

EPA and the Corps are also inviting comments on alternative approaches and additional revisions to the WOTUS definition and its implementation. Comments must be received on or before January 5, 2026.

BACKGROUND

The CWA applies to ""navigable waters,"" which is defined as ""the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas,"" but the CWA does not further define WOTUS. This lack of statutory definition has resulted in ambiguity, protracted rulemaking, and decades of litigation over the breadth of WOTUS.

Most recently, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the definition of WOTUS in Sackett. The Court adopted a narrow interpretation of WOTUS, holding that the CWA's use of ""waters"" encompasses ""only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographical features,'"" such as streams, oceans, rivers and lakes. Similarly, Sackett concluded that the Agencies' definition of ""adjacent,"" used to determine whether a wetland constituted a jurisdictional water under the CWA, was too broad, and affirmed that the ""continuous surface connection"" test is the appropriate standard. Shortly thereafter, the Corps and EPA under the Biden Administration promulgated regulations conforming the regulatory definition of WOTUS to the Sackett decision (Amended 2023 Rule). EPA and the Corps are now proposing to revise the definition again to address concerns raised by stakeholders about the Amended 2023 Rule, including assertions that the Amended 2023 Rule does not adequately comply with the Supreme Court's interpretation in Sackett of the scope of Federal jurisdiction and implementation-related issues.

For additional background and history of the WOTUS saga, refer to Van Ness Feldman's past alerts and notices.1

KEY CHANGES

Definitions:

The most significant proposed changes would revise the definitions of two terms that guide whether a water is a WOTUS or not: ""relatively permanent"" and ""continuous surface connection."" The rule also clarifies the definition of ""tributaries."" Each term plays an important role in determining whether a particular water qualifies as a WOTUS.

WOTUS includes (1) traditional navigable waters and the territorial seas; (2) most impoundments of ""waters of the United States;"" (3) relatively permanent tributaries of traditional navigable waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments; (4) wetlands adjacent (i.e., having a continuous surface connection) to traditional navigable waters, impoundments, and tributaries; and (5) lakes and ponds that are relatively permanent and have a continuous surface connection to a traditional navigable water, the territorial seas, or a tributary.

Relatively Permanent. The Proposed Rule would define ""relatively permanent"" to mean ""standing or continuously flowing bodies of surface water that are standing or continuously flowing year-round or at least during the wet season."" The relatively permanent definition applies to tributaries, lakes and ponds, and adjacent wetlands.

With the addition of ""at least during the wet season,"" the Agencies propose to add a temporal element to the test. ""Wet season"" would be defined using existing agency tools, and quantitatively as the point at which ""precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration,"" and would vary by geographic region and ecotype. Significantly, water must stand or flow for the entirety of the wet season to qualify as ""relatively permanent;"" intermittent flow, or longer flow not occurring during the wet season do not qualify as relatively permanent waters. The Agencies are soliciting comments on alternative methods that could better define the wet season given site and region-specific factors.

Continuous surface connection. The Proposed Rule would define a continuous surface connection as one ""having surface water at least during the wet season and abutting (i.e., touching) a jurisdictional water.""

EPA and the Corps would apply a two-prong test requiring both: (1) abutment of a jurisdictional water; and (2) having surface water at least during the wet season. The Agencies explain that this is meant to limit the scope of jurisdictional wetlands by suggesting that even if a wetland is more broadly delineated, only those portions of the wetland that have surface water that abuts or touches a jurisdictional water during the wet season are under federal jurisdiction.

Tributaries. The Proposed Rule would redefine tributaries as ""bod[ies] of water with relatively permanent flow, and a bed and bank, that connects to a downstream traditional navigable water or the territorial seas, either directly or through one or more waters or features that convey relatively permanent flow.""

This definition expressly excludes ""a body of water that contributes surface water flow to a downstream jurisdictional water through [natural or artificial] feature[s]... if such feature does not convey relatively permanent flow."" However, tributaries do include natural, man-altered, and man-made waterbodies, such as rivers, streams, ditches, canals, lakes, ponds, and impoundments,"" as long as they connect to a downstream traditionally navigable water. Tributaries may connect through non-jurisdictional features, so long as those features convey relatively permanent flow.

Exclusions

The Proposed Rule would modify three existing jurisdictional exclusions for waste treatment systems, prior converted cropland, and ditches, and adds a new exclusion related to groundwater.

Waste water systems. The Proposed Rule would continue an existing exclusion for waste treatment systems, and define ""waste treatment systems"" as ""including all components of a waste treatment system designed to meet the requirements of the [CWA], including lagoons and treatment ponds (such as settling or cooling ponds), designed to either convey or retain, concentrate, settle, reduce, or remove pollutants, either actively or passively, from wastewater prior to discharge (or eliminating any such discharge).""

By adding this definition, the Proposed Rule appears to expand the scope of the exclusion to include all components of a waste treatment system. The Preamble of the Proposed Rule acknowledges that a cooling pond constructed within a WOTUS would be excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction provided it complies with CWA requirements.

Prior Converted Cropland. The Proposed Rule continues the long-standing exclusion of prior converted cropland, but clarifies that the exclusion does not apply to abandoned cropland. The Agencies propose that prior converted cropland is considered abandoned if it is not used for, or in support of, agricultural purposes at least once in the immediately preceding five years. The Proposed Rule also explains that agricultural uses can include myriad conservation and non-extractive uses, providing that the Agencies' new list of agricultural uses ""may not be obvious to Corps field staff,"" such that the Corps can rely on public or private documentation that the land is being used in accordance with the agricultural uses set forth in the rule.

Ditches. The Proposed Rule would clarify the types of ditches that are excluded from WOTUS jurisdiction, explaining that non navigable ditches that are constructed or excavated ""entirely in dry land"" are not WOTUS. The Proposed Rule explains that ditches that channel or relocate jurisdictional tributaries maintain their jurisdictional status if the tributary continues to meet the regulatory definition of a tributary.

New exception for groundwater. The Proposed Rule explains that groundwater has never been interpreted as WOTUS, explaining that groundwater is by nature not navigable. However, ""surface expressions of groundwater,"" like groundwater that emerges from the ground and becomes baseflow in a relatively permanent stream, are not subject to the exclusion and would continue to be subject to federal jurisdiction if they otherwise meet the requirements of a WOTUS.

Eliminations

The Proposed Rule would eliminate jurisdictional triggers for interstate waters that are disconnected from traditionally navigable waters. Eliminating these triggers would remove lakes and streams that straddle state borders, that do not themselves independently meet the regulatory definition of a WOTUS. The Agencies reason that this has been a consistent source of litigation, reads out ""navigable"" from the statute, and is ultimately not supported by Sackett or Rapanos v. United States (Rapanos). The Proposed Rule provides that nonjurisdictional interstate waters are appropriately regulated by the ""States and Tribes under their sovereign authorities.""

Additionally, the Proposed Rule would restrict mosaic wetlands to the individual wetland segments, which previously together constituted a single wetland comprising the hydrologically connected segments. In particular, this has significant implications for jurisdictional determinations in Alaska, where permafrost wetlands have long been regulated under the mosaic wetland interpretation.

Additionally, the Agencies are seeking comment regarding whether to adopt a USDA definition of wetland under the Food Security Act that expressly excludes certain permafrost wetlands in lands with high agricultural potential in Alaska.

Implications

The Proposed Rule would limit the scope of federal jurisdiction over the nation's waters and correspondingly reduce the federal regulatory burden and compliance issues for work done in and near waters that are no longer considered jurisdictional. We would anticipate a significant reduction in the number of Section 404 permits and associated CWA 401 water quality certifications. However, the Proposed Rule is unexpectedly vague and deferential on many details for Agencies to define the limits of the rule.

Once finalized, additional litigation on the final rule is almost certain to occur.

Furthermore, irrespective of this rulemaking, states and Tribes will likely use their own regulatory authority to fill the gap left by Sackett and the finalized rule. States, including Washington, have ongoing rulemaking processes to further develop their regulatory authority over state waters.

""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity.

Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""
To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital.","The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has called for a holistic green transition that strengthens finance, boosts recycling systems, and simplifies environmental approvals, saying this shift is essential as India moves closer to its $ 5 trillion economy goal.

""As India moves closer to its goal of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy, advancing a green economy is no longer a choice but a strategic necessity. This transition is vital not only for meeting climate goals but also for shaping India's long-term growth, competitiveness, and global standing,"" said Banerjee.

At the centre of the push is the need for strong transition finance, circularity, and improved reporting systems. Banerjee said, ""As India strides forward on its path of green transition, it is imperative to have a holistic approach to decarbonisation where transition finance, circularity and a robust ESG reporting ecosystem are prioritised, in addition to the focus on renewables and green mobility.""

According to him, India needs nearly $ 1 trillion in green investments over the next 10 to 15 years, and close to $ 10 trillion by 2070, to reach its net-zero goal. But current finance flows meet only about one-fourth of this requirement. To address the gap, Banerjee has suggested creating a Green Finance Institution (GFI) that can bring in large-scale, low-cost capital. The body can be set up in GIFT City and supported by global funds without needing direct government spending. It can offer concessional finance, equity support, guarantees, and securitisation to bring down project costs across renewable energy, clean mobility, green buildings and industrial decarbonisation.

Banerjee also proposed a ""Green Tech Expo Fund"" to help Indian clean-tech companies participate in global technology events. The idea is to push India's growing innovations in green technology onto the world stage and build partnerships with global investors and buyers.

He further highlighted the strong need for a recycling strategy for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and nickel, as India depends heavily on imports. Rules for mandatory recycling of batteries and electronics, fast-track clearances, and incentives for domestic recovery of minerals, were also suggested. Banerjee recommended creating Circular Economy Parks for waste like plastics, tyres, e-waste and batteries, with 15 parks in three years and 45 in five years.

Advt

To make approvals faster and clearer, Banerjee has proposed a unified Environmental and Climate Clearance Authority with a fully digital system and automatic approvals within fixed timelines for projects that meet low-emission and sustainability norms. He also stressed the need for energy-efficient buildings, recommending a National Digitalization of Built Environment Initiative and uniform adoption of building energy codes.

As India builds for the future, the shift must go beyond electric vehicles and renewable power to include green finance, easier environmental processes, stronger recycling systems and sustainable buildings. ""These are vital for not only building a resilient, innovative, and inclusive economy but also offer significant untapped opportunities for investors looking to capitalise on these transformative trends,"" Banerjee said.

The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.","Maryland set a bold goal of 1.1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. With just shy of 150,000 EVs registered as of October 2025, the state has ground to make up.

That growth depends on a public charging network that is reliable, affordable and widely available, especially for apartment and condo dwellers without home charging and for drivers crossing the state on longer trips. Public charging must keep pace. Yet a new regulation from the Maryland Department of Agriculture threatens to do the opposite.

Starting Jan. 1, 2026, every public charging station in Maryland that accepts payment must register with the state’s Weights and Measures program and pay a $150 annual fee. That is per port. A simple four-plug Level 2 station at a grocery store, office garage, or apartment complex now owes Maryland $600 a year just to remain in service.

The state calls it a registration fee. In practice, it operates as a $150-per-port tax, perhaps the highest in the nation. For comparison, Maryland charges gas stations only $20 to register each fuel dispenser. An EV charging plug now costs 7.5 times more to keep legal than a gasoline nozzle.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture is gearing up for enforcement. Chargers not registered by Jan. 1 face being red-tagged with a stop-use order. This removes the unit from service entirely. Every fix requires a registered service agency to sign off on repairs, and those technicians charge real money.

In spring 2026, state inspectors will arrive with certified test equipment to verify that each charger meters electricity within tolerances. New chargers must be certified before operating. The cost of compliance begins long before the first kilowatt-hour is sold.

Large fast-charging networks will simply take this in stride and raise rates a few cents. The damage falls hardest on low-margin Level 2 stations that drivers rely on daily. Apartment complexes, hotel lots, small retail centers, and office buildings often run these chargers at break-even or as customer perks.

A substantial yearly charger tax transforms a goodwill gesture into a financial liability. Many hosts will run the numbers, see red ink, and simply rip out the equipment rather than pass the cost to users or risk repeated red tags for minor violations.

Charger hosts lose the incentive to keep stations online. Drivers lose convenient charging options. The public charging network shrinks at the exact moment Maryland needs it to expand.

By 2026, compliant chargers will sport a little MDA decal proving they are registered. What many won’t see will be the faint outlines on the pavement where perfectly functional Level 2 chargers once stood, quietly removed because the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54918991226_f8b0d3035c_o-1024x7681764557690.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=or7AvzVL,N,,2025-11-30 23:58:10.431753

The manufacturing industry has long been a cornerstone of the Southern economy. From chemical plants along the Gulf Coast to food processing facilities across the region, these industries have provided jobs, growth, and stability for decades. However, traditional manufacturing has often relied heavily on fossil fuels and energy-intensive processes. This has led to growing concerns about environmental impact and long-term sustainability.

Today, many Southern manufacturers are taking significant steps to reduce their environmental footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, companies are finding ways to improve efficiency, cut costs, and meet increasing consumer and regulatory demands for cleaner operations. Tyler Pommier, a renewable energy executive based in Baton Rouge, observes that the move toward sustainability is not just about compliance. “Companies are recognizing that being sustainable is good for business and good for the community,” he says.

Energy Efficiency in Manufacturing

One of the first areas manufacturers are addressing is energy consumption. Modernizing equipment, upgrading lighting, and installing energy management systems can reduce electricity usage significantly. Factories are investing in high-efficiency motors, variable-speed drives, and smart HVAC systems to optimize energy performance.

Solar and wind energy are also becoming part of the solution. Companies are installing rooftop solar panels or participating in community solar programs to supplement their energy needs with renewable sources. These steps not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also lower operating costs over time.

Tyler Pommier emphasizes that energy efficiency is often the simplest and most impactful starting point. “You do not have to wait for new technology to make a difference,” he notes. “Even small improvements in energy management can lead to substantial savings and environmental benefits.”

Water Conservation and Waste Reduction

Manufacturing processes often consume large amounts of water and generate waste. Many Southern companies are implementing water recycling and treatment systems to reduce consumption and limit pollution. By reusing water within production cycles, factories can cut costs and reduce their impact on local waterways.

In addition, waste reduction programs are becoming more common. Manufacturers are rethinking materials, optimizing supply chains, and finding ways to recycle byproducts instead of sending them to landfills. Some companies have even started using waste as a raw material for other processes, creating a circular economy that benefits both business and the environment.

“Water and waste are two areas where manufacturers can make real changes without sacrificing productivity,” Tyler Pommier says. “It requires planning and investment, but the results speak for themselves.”

Clean Energy and Industrial Innovation

Beyond efficiency and conservation, Southern manufacturers are exploring cleaner energy sources. Combined heat and power systems, hydrogen energy, and bioenergy are emerging as viable options for industrial applications. These technologies provide reliable energy while reducing emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.

Some manufacturers are integrating smart technology to monitor and optimize their operations in real time. Sensors, data analytics, and automation allow companies to detect inefficiencies, predict maintenance needs, and adjust energy usage dynamically. This approach not only supports sustainability but also enhances productivity and reduces downtime.

The combination of clean energy and smart technology is redefining what it means to be a modern manufacturer. It is no longer just about producing goods efficiently. It is about producing them responsibly, with a focus on long-term environmental and economic benefits.

Economic and Community Benefits

Sustainable manufacturing brings benefits beyond environmental impact. It creates new jobs, attracts investment, and strengthens local economies. Skilled positions are needed to design, install, and maintain renewable energy systems and smart manufacturing technologies. This opens opportunities for workers who may have previously relied solely on traditional roles.

Communities also benefit when manufacturers reduce pollution and use resources responsibly. Cleaner air, reduced water contamination, and lower greenhouse gas emissions improve public health and quality of life. Companies that prioritize sustainability often build stronger relationships with local stakeholders and gain trust within their regions.

Overcoming Challenges

Transitioning to sustainable practices is not without challenges. Initial costs for new technology, energy systems, and process upgrades can be significant. Some companies may also face regulatory hurdles or uncertainty about the return on investment.

Education and planning are essential. Leaders must assess their current operations, identify areas for improvement, and develop realistic strategies. Collaboration with renewable energy experts, technology providers, and community partners can make the transition smoother and more effective.

Tyler Pommier stresses that persistence and vision are key. “Sustainability is a journey, not a single project,” he explains. “The companies that succeed are those that are willing to invest in the long term and continuously improve.”

Success Stories Across the South

Several Southern manufacturers are already showing how sustainability can work in practice. Chemical plants are using bio-based feedstocks, food processing facilities are implementing water-saving measures, and automotive suppliers are reducing energy consumption with smart systems. These examples demonstrate that environmental responsibility and industrial growth can go hand in hand.

States like Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas are supporting these efforts through grants, incentives, and technical assistance. Public-private partnerships are helping manufacturers adopt renewable energy, modernize equipment, and train their workforce for a sustainable future.

The Future of Green Manufacturing

The future of manufacturing in the South is being shaped by sustainability, technology, and innovation. Companies that embrace these principles will not only reduce their environmental impact but also strengthen their competitiveness and resilience.

As Tyler Pommier notes, “The South has an incredible opportunity to lead in sustainable industry. By combining innovation with our traditional strengths, we can build a manufacturing sector that is cleaner, smarter, and more resilient for generations to come.”

From energy efficiency to clean technology, from waste reduction to smart systems, the South is reimagining its industrial future. Green manufacturing is no longer an option; it is a necessary evolution. The region is proving that economic growth and environmental responsibility can go hand in hand, paving the way for a stronger, more sustainable Southern economy.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 03:58:49.129706

China will champion the exchange of green technologies, promote the global alignment of green standards, facilitate the supply of green products and share opportunities in the green market.","As global climate efforts intensify and the energy transition accelerates, the international community is converging on the imperative need to transform manufacturing along green and low-carbon pathways. President Xi Jinping has put forward the concept that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"". Embracing this concept, China has undergone a fundamental shift in its economic development paradigm. As a responsible manufacturing powerhouse, China is advancing new industrialization as a key task, with green and low-carbon development as its ecological foundation. By reducing carbon emissions, curbing pollution, expanding green initiatives and fostering economic growth, China contributes its wisdom and solutions to global sustainability.

Strengthening green vision guidance

Ideas guide actions, and the deep impetus for the green transition of China's sprawling manufacturing sector stems from President Xi's ecological civilization concept. The belief that ""lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets"" transcends the traditional industrial paradigm, setting China on a path of high-quality growth coupled with high-level environmental protection. Guided by this vision, China has established a ""1+N"" policy framework for carbon peak and carbon neutrality, translating these ambitious goals into actionable and measurable steps. Through tools like setting green standards, promoting green finance and building carbon trading markets, China has created a stable and predictable market environment for green transition.

In recent years, China's economic growth has been relying less on energy consumption. From 2021 to 2024, China recorded an average annual industrial growth rate of over 5 percent with only around 3 percent annual growth in energy consumption. This green transition has unleashed robust new economic momentum: China has built the world's largest new energy industry chain. In 2024, China's total installed capacity of wind and solar power exceeded 1.2 billion kilowatts, achieving the 2030 installation target in Nationally Determined Contributions six years ahead of schedule. Today, over half of the world's electric vehicles run on Chinese roadways.

Deepening green tech innovation

Technological innovation is the core driver of the green transition in manufacturing. China has integrated green technology innovation into its national innovation system, achieving remarkable results through strategic government support, economies of scale and industrial synergy. According to the 2024 China Patent Survey Report by the China National Intellectual Property Administration, nearly half of Chinese enterprises have engaged in, or plan to pursue, green technology innovation.

Over the past decade, China has contributed to a cumulative reduction of over 60 percent and 80 percent, respectively, in the global average levelized cost of electricity for wind power and solar photovoltaic technologies.

Breakthroughs have also been made in making traditional industries greener. For instance, Chinese companies have built hydrogen-based metallurgy production lines with an annual production capacity of one million metric tons and green ammonia synthesis production lines with an annual capacity of 300,000 tons, achieving full-process mastery of complex technologies that support these factories. Meanwhile, one-million-ton carbon capture, utilization and storage projects have been completed and put into operation. These advancements lay the groundwork for larger-scale and deeper green transitions of manufacturing.

Popularizing green manufacturing models

Green manufacturing is a modernized production mode characterized by low consumption, low emissions, high efficiency and high returns. China has built a green manufacturing system encompassing green factories, industrial parks, supply chains and products, embedding environmentally friendly development into entire industrial processes. To date, China has cultivated 6,430 green factories, 491 green industrial parks and 727 green supply chain enterprises, while promoting over 40,000 types of green products. Among these, the output value of green factories now accounts for 20 percent of China's total manufacturing output, up from 9 percent in 2020. The energy and water consumption per unit of industrial output in green industrial parks is only two-thirds and one-fourth of the national average, respectively, with their average solid waste utilization rate exceeding 95 percent.

An increasing number of Chinese companies are incorporating green design and procurement into supply chain management, driving upstream and downstream partners to adopt green upgrades. Meanwhile, some industry leaders are pioneering carbon footprint management across product life cycles.

Contributing green transition solutions

By providing high-quality green technologies and products, Chinese manufacturing offers practical pathways for the global green transition. The nation's renewable energy products are exported to over 200 countries and regions, meeting more than 80 percent of global demand for photovoltaic modules and 70 percent for wind power equipment. This helps nations around the world, especially developing countries, access clean, reliable and affordable energy.

For instance, from 2021 to 2024, China produced approximately 15.6 trillion kW of photovoltaic modules, helping the world generate about 3.2 trillion kilowatt-hours of green electricity and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by roughly 2.54 billion tons. China has also collaborated with more than 100 countries and regions on green energy projects, delivering high-quality equipment and affordable green power. These initiatives demonstrate the tangible impact of Chinese solutions in helping other developing nations address climate change while fostering economic growth.

Systematic advancement of green transition

At a time when global climate governance is encountering setbacks and some nations are backsliding on their commitments, China's decision to embark on a green and low-carbon transition for its manufacturing sector serves as a powerful demonstration of its drive to foster new quality productive forces and pursue high-quality development. This choice also stands as a solemn pledge to global climate governance.

In his video speech at the United Nations Climate Summit 2025 in September, President Xi announced China's new NDC targets. China will, by 2035, reduce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent to 10 percent from peak levels, striving to do better; increase the share of non-fossil fuels in total energy consumption to over 30 percent; expand the installed capacity of wind and solar power to over six times 2020 levels, striving to bring the total to 3.6 billion kW; scale up the total forest stock volume to over 24 billion cubic meters; make new energy vehicles the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles; expand the National Carbon Emissions Trading Market to cover major high-emission sectors; and basically establish a climate adaptive society.

China's new NDC targets demonstrate a pragmatic and actionable ambition for emission reductions. With manufacturing spearheading the green transformation of our economy and society, China's industrial strategy is now honing in on a systematic transition. Moving forward, efforts will focus on three key fronts — modernizing the industrial system, developing green supply chains and deepening international collaboration.

Building a green industrial system

Traditional industries remain a crucial pillar of Chinese manufacturing. Their transformation and upgrading require systematic adjustments to product mixes, energy consumption patterns and raw material structures, along with the re-engineering of industrial processes. Particular emphasis will be placed on scaling-up the application of innovative technologies in sectors such as steel, building materials and chemicals.

Industries will capitalize on the vast market opportunities created by the green and low-carbon transition. Efforts will be made to vigorously develop green and low-carbon sectors, increasing the share of industries like environmental protection, new energy equipment and NEVs.

Simultaneously, to meet the demands of the energy revolution and industrial transformation under the ""dual carbon"" goals, China will strategically plan and deploy future-oriented energy and manufacturing industries, including hydrogen energy, energy storage, bio-manufacturing and carbon capture, utilization and storage.

Building a green supply chain

China is committed to embedding green development principles throughout the entire manufacturing chain — from raw material procurement to production, sales and recycling. China will drive large enterprises to implement green and low-carbon supply chain enhancement initiatives, leveraging green procurement as a guiding force. Through activities such as green audits and supply chain financing, the initiative will support upstream and downstream suppliers in adopting green upgrades and managing carbon footprints.

The country will also promote the cultivation of green factories, steadily increase the procurement share from green factory suppliers and strengthen international cooperation in building green supply chains. Furthermore, China will advance circular economy models, facilitate the development of reverse logistics networks that manage the flow of goods from their final destination back to the point of origin for purposes like recycling, and encourage businesses to establish recycling systems for key products such as batteries.

Enhancing international cooperation

Adhering to the principle of extensive consultations and joint contributions, China will leverage bilateral and multilateral cooperation mechanisms to deepen collaboration in green technologies, equipment, trade and standards.

The country will encourage competitive Chinese enterprises in photovoltaics, wind power, lithium batteries and new energy vehicles to expand globally and to invest in and develop green energy projects in countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative and beyond, while promoting green infrastructure and transportation solutions. China will also actively participate in shaping international green and low-carbon regulations and strengthen its capacity to implement international conventions.

An ancient Chinese proverb reads: ""Those who persevere in action will achieve their goals; those who steadfastly journey will reach their destination,"" which echoes the universal spirit of the Western adage: ""Actions speak louder than words.""

History rewards those who take concrete actions. No matter how the international landscape shifts, ""Made in China"" remains committed to honoring its pledge of building a community with a shared future for mankind through tangible green initiatives. China will champion the exchange of green technologies, promote the global alignment of green standards, facilitate the supply of green products and share opportunities in the green market. By forming the world's greatest joint force for green development, the country can collectively advance toward a future that is greener, more inclusive and sustainable.

The Permian Basin has become an essential destination for the US energy market, with operations being developed by several of the world’s top energy companies. Now, Brazos Midstream has commissioned a new $185 million gas processing facility in the Permian, close to Martin County. Despite calls to diversify the global energy market, Texas is standing firm and fostering investments in the American energy market.

Texas offers substantial tax incentives for any energy operators planning to enter the market

For any energy company planning new projects, deciding where to establish operations can be challenging; however, some regions in the world and states in the US offer significant tax incentives to attract potential operators. Texas is one such state and has recently granted the Sundance II project the tax incentive it has been searching for.

Brazos Midstream’s Sundance II project has been selected by the state of Texas to receive substantial tax benefits. The Sundance II gas processing facility is a 300-MMcf/d natural gas processing plant in Martin County and has the potential to boost the region’s gas processing power. The project qualified under the state’s Texas Jobs, Energy, Technology, and Innovation (JETI) program.

The company has noted its expectation is for the Sundance II project to create $185 million in capital investment, marking the continued reliance on the energy potential of the Permian basin in the American energy market, as noted by the state’s Governor.

“Texas energy fuels the American economy. New investment in natural gas processing is essential to meet increasing energy demands. Working with innovative industry leaders, we will continue to power growth across critical sectors for a stronger, more prosperous Texas.” – Texas Governor Greg Abbott

Brazos Midstream’s presence in the Permian basin has been a boost to the local energy market

Brazos boasts one of the largest privately held natural gas midstream networks in the Permian, and through its planned Sundance II gas processing facility, is aiming to increase its standing in the American energy market. Once complete, the Sundance II project will increase the company’s Midland Basin processing capacity to 500 MMcf/d.

The aforementioned JETI designation means that Brazos will enter a 10-year school district and maintenance and operations tax appraised value limitation, with the aim of returning the favor by creating new employment for locals. Along with the state of Texas, the energy firm has partnered with the Stanton Independent School District, which is located in Martin County.

“With support from the state through incentive structures such as the JETI program, Brazos Midstream hopes to further leverage its existing large-scale energy infrastructure by building gas processing facilities located in Texas to drive additional job creation and economic growth.” – Brazos Midstream CEO Brad Iles

The new project comes as Japan has agreed with the United States to finalize $550 billion investment framework that will boost the US’s energy infrastructure tremendously over the coming years.

The US infrastructure market is enjoying a surge of interest, with more firms seeking access largely due to the country’s strong artificial intelligence position. The North American economic giant is home to many of the early leaders in the space, as well as heavy government backing for the technology.

Of course, developing and maintaining a competitive edge is not easy. But some of the more established firms are benefiting from tried and tested approaches. 3i, which just celebrated its 80th anniversary, is one such firm. Rob Collins, managing partner for 3i North American Infrastructure Partners, explores what makes the US such an attractive market, as well as which opportunities stand out strongest.

How would you characterise the current investment landscape for infrastructure in the US?

Generally speaking, since the pandemic, US infrastructure has become a more expensive market to invest in. There are a lot more fishermen in the pond, so to speak, and this is driving up prices.

The opportunity set we most prefer is found in the mid-market, which is a less competitive space than the mega-market. We focus our efforts on identifying under-the-radar infrastructure opportunities that we can support or put in place high-quality management teams to execute on our investment thesis. 3i has been investing in the mid-market since 1945, and has built up a longstanding track record over that period.

Which sectors are attracting the most attention?

Clearly, digital infrastructure has gained the most attention since the pandemic. This has been most prominent across fibre broadband providers and most recently data centre developers, resulting in higher valuations across the board.

We believe that digital infrastructure is attractive and have invested through differentiated strategies such as backing an experienced team to build cell towers or being very selective in the fibre markets we want to go after. While traditional data centre development is less attractive to us, we are exploring adjacent industries such as power generation and other services that will benefit from the same industry tailwinds.

In addition to digital, we’re focused on three additional sectors right now: transportation, environmental services and social infrastructure. Some of our peers will define social infrastructure assets differently, so it’s worth clarifying that we have a wide-span aperture to this area. Our ambition to invest in social infrastructure has led us towards businesses related to food and agriculture production or leasing of equipment, which support other essential services.

How important is sustainability to investment decisions?

ESG is an important part of our process and something we, as a firm, have taken seriously for a long time. In 2008, 3i acquired SLR Consulting, the largest ESG consulting firm in Europe. We held on to the investment in SLR for a decade, which helped us firmly embed ESG criteria in our investment committee processes over almost the last 20 years.

The way in which we champion ESG considerations in our investments is evident in several of our holdings, such as EC Waste. This is the largest vertically integrated provider of solid-waste services in Puerto Rico. The company is also the only provider of 100 percent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) compliant, regulated and permitted waste disposal on the island.

With our help, EC Waste has made significant investments in its infrastructure and operations technology through sustainable waste practices and continuing to exceed US EPA compliance. Doing so has had a meaningful impact on improving drinking-water quality in Puerto Rico.

This is also important work because the main competition for EC Waste is illegal solid-waste disposal that’s unregulated and can severely contaminate the groundwater through toxic leachate without properly regulated EPA landfill permits. Our work, and consideration of ESG criteria in our investment decisions, is continuing to enhance the quality of drinking water in Puerto Rico, while growing the investment performance of the company.

What are the biggest challenges investors face in the US market?

In terms of finding businesses that perform an essential service, and that have sustainable barriers to entry with demonstrated and durable cashflows, we have a wide lens on identifying such opportunities. The challenge is finding businesses that meet those criteria and are also recession resistant.

An example I would give is Smarte Carte, which is our airport-concession business. For over 50 years, this business has been a key player in North American logistics, providing customers with products like luggage solutions and secure storage in over 300 airports and other locations globally (including 97 of the top 100 airports in the US). In 2017, we invested in Smarte Carte after identifying the company as having the same revenue risk as owning a stake in an airport.

The pandemic demonstrated the most severe downside case of any underwriting model and temporarily paralysed air travel. However, we were pleased to see Smarte Carte not just survive covid but really thrive throughout that period and beyond. Now, international airlines have increased flights, seat capacity, pilot training and new-plane purchases.

As evidence of core-risk infrastructure, Smarte Carte was designated by the US Treasury Department as an essential-service company, and the only business selected in the US aviation-value chain that wasn’t an airport or airline. The company was able to overcome the challenges of that severe economic downturn through optimising pricing and managing costs.

Since then, we’ve worked with Smarte Carte to expand its operations to more locations and geographies. This was while helping introduce the business to the infrastructure-lending market (for the first time in its history) and raising several successful rounds of financing on attractive terms.

How can managers differentiate themselves when investing?

Since we were founded in 1945 to help reconstruct the UK after World War II, 3i has been building businesses. In fact, our 3i name stands for Investors In Industry. From the beginning, we’ve invested in infrastructure by identifying best-in-class management teams and partnering with them to realise the full potential of each investment. We also have decades of value-add private equity experience that we leverage throughout our infrastructure underwriting and asset management processes.

We’re also differentiated thanks to our global network of operating partners, which we call our Business Leaders Network (BLN). We’ve been cultivating this network for the last 40 years and actively leverage these relationships to bring industry-leading expertise to our holdings when they need it.

For another example during the pandemic, with Smarte Carte we really relied on a 3i BLN operating partner we put on the company board – Greg Hart, retired COO at United Airlines – to help us navigate that challenging time for the aviation industry.

Going into the pandemic we were prepared, much like the major US airports were, for a complete 90-day domestic airport shutdown. This involved taking a fresh look at expense management and putting in place availability payments with airport partners to help the company perform during that economic downturn.

How do you see opportunities evolving?

Looking ahead, we’re seeking businesses in the US that fit our criteria and play into the AI revolution. Whether that’s power generation or providing support services to operating data centres, we’re finding businesses connected to AI’s growth story. This is similar to the way Smarte Carte gave us great exposure to the aviation value chain, with the same revenue risk of owning an entire airport.

The AI investment theme is deservedly getting a huge amount of attention and disruption concern. But I see this disruptive technology as more exciting than challenging to infrastructure investing. Ironically, we can use AI itself to identify AI infrastructure businesses. This is making for a really exciting time. AI will be transformational and disruptive in virtually every industry, and infrastructure perhaps has the most to benefit.

How are geopolitical events and domestic politics impacting US infrastructure investing?

There’s a lot of dynamic change right now with respect to global geopolitical events and US politics specifically, which naturally provides challenges and opportunities.

Encouragingly, though, most domestic US infrastructure investments still enjoy broad and very consistent bipartisan support. Regional Rail is an example of this. The company is a short-line rail platform that we acquired in 2019. Regional Rail has been running since 2007 and provides freight transportation, car storage and transloading services across the US and Western Canada, spanning over 875 miles of track.

Covid hit less than a year after we first invested in Regional Rail. Fortunately, both Republican and Democratic states continued to provide grants for rail expansion, as this mode of transport played a critical role in getting the economy back up and running. And since our initial investment in three railroads, we’ve supported Regional Rail in acquiring 14 additional railroads, further strengthening and expanding its presence in the US and Canada.

The pandemic also greatly expanded the definition of core-risk infrastructure, and such investments were thoroughly tested throughout the economic downturn. However, one of the benefits of that two-year period was it really helped us further identify downside risk in our investments, making them even more recession resistant.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2025/11/P87.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:58:55.445603

Collaboration, from customizing workforce training to preparing shovel-ready sites, has nourished North Carolina’s life-sciences industry for more than 40 years. New programs ensure that support will continue into the future.

Fujifilm Biosciences opened one of North America’s largest commercial-scale cell culture factories in September. The more than $3 billion investment measures 1 million square feet and will employ 750 people by year’s end. It’s expected to add 300,000 square feet when it reaches capacity in 2028 and employ 1,400 by 2031. “North Carolina is creating the future of biotech, and Fujifilm is an industry leader,” Gov. Josh Stein said at the ribbon cutting. “This overall project will grow our state’s economy by $4.7 billion over the next decade.”

Growth was a pillar of Research Triangle Park’s master plan in 1984, when state leaders began investing in the state’s future economy. Traditional manufacturing — tobacco products, textiles and furniture — was declining. “North Carolina’s leaders realized that genetic engineering and other new technologies from bioscience research labs had enormous potential,” says Mark Phillips, N.C. Biotechnology Center vice president of statewide operations and executive director of its eastern regional office in Greenville. “They also knew that technology could transform some of North Carolina’s largest industries, notably agriculture and medicine.”

Fujifilm is the latest in a steady stream of life-sciences companies that have invested in North Carolina. More than 840 of these companies do business here and employ 75,000 people, according to N.C. Biotechnology Center. Include the 2,500 businesses that support this industry, and employment swells to 225,000 statewide. Growing the industry, which made more than $10 billion in investments last year alone, is a community effort.

North Carolina’s biomanufacturing corridor stretches from Winston-Salem’s Innovation Quarter, which is home to more than 90 companies and 3,600 employees, to the BioPharma Cresent, which arcs through Edgecombe, Johnston, Nash, Pitt and Wilson counties. The latter has been called one of the East Coast’s largest biopharma manufacturing concentrations.

It employs more than 10,000 people and continues to grow. Six projects, representing more than $6.2 billion in investments, were announced last year.

Scott Ralls is president of Wake Technical Community College. It’s his latest post in a career with the N.C. Community College System that stretches nearly three decades. He has watched the biotechnology industry grow during that time, and he says its recent spurt is the culmination of years of hard work and investment. Those efforts have built a business-friendly environment that’s filled with shovel-ready sites, a falling corporate tax, and rail, road and air connections to consumers around the world. And there’s plenty of mechanics in place to ensure companies have the workforce they need to succeed.

Wake Tech serves about 75,000 students across its eight campuses. “One of the things the community colleges and universities attempt to do is to keep scaling to support our new and existing industries,” Ralls says. “Today, we have four times the number of students in biotechnology programs than we did four years ago and a myriad programs we didn’t

have before.”

Ralls and his team train, upskill and reskill workers. That’s done through traditional courses and training tuned to each company’s exact needs. The college partnered with CSL Seqirus, Fujifilm and Eli Lilly, for example, to create the country’s first eight-month program for training advanced maintenance technicians. And it collaborates with Amgen to provide training programs for its recent $1.5 billion investment in Holly Springs. Amgen also sponsors a co-laboratory at Wake Tech’s RTP campus, where technologists and industry professionals collaborate on innovations.

The community college system’s customized workforce training is available to existing businesses, too, and it’s often offered before the first dirt is turned for new locations and expansions. “We actually get involved with proposals when companies begin making the decisions about when to locate here,” Ralls says. NCEdge, for example, develops training solutions that address the participating company’s immediate challenges and prepare it for the future.

Collaborations between companies and colleges are becoming more common. “We have established a brand-new Lilly Center for Science and Technology, and next August we’re opening Fujifilm Hall on our new campus in Apex,” Ralls says. “Our biopharma partners work with us on apprenticeship programs, and that wasn’t happening four years ago.”

Partnerships across the 58-college system increase capacity. Wake Tech and Durham Technical Community College launched RTP Bio. It unifies the talent pipeline for the industry. “We have this notion that our economic development partners are part of an ecosystem,” Ralls says. “But to me, it is really a community. I’m very close with my colleagues at other community colleges, NC State University and our industry partners, and it feels like we’re all building it together.”",https://images.businessnc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LifeSciences_main_image_web.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:59:14.485469

The Terrapins are using chitin, the chemical that makes crustacean casings hard, to form a biodegradable electrolyte, according to an Instagram post from the World Economic Forum. By using it in a battery, the experts may have created a circularly produced power pack for electric vehicles and other tech.

""Now we can 'eat ze water bugs' and use their skeletal remains for energy!"" one charismatic viewer commented.

And, they aren't far off the mark. Research from the Chemical Engineering Journal, published in ScienceDirect, reported that up to 8.8 million tons of shrimp, lobster, and crab shell waste are made each year. Much of it comes from the restaurant industry.

The Maryland team can turn recycled chitin from those shells into a degradable electrolyte, one of the key components of a battery. Adding zinc enables chemistry that astoundingly maintains 99.7% of its capacity after 400 charge/discharge cycles, according to the post.

If successfully scaled, the innovation could limit invasive mining for lithium and other hard-to-gather and costly materials in common packs.

For its part, chitin is abundant. The University of Connecticut reported that 100 billion tons of the biological polymer are naturally made each year. Researchers elsewhere are experimenting with it as the base for plastic-free products.

The Instagram post shows phones, drones, and EVs as everyday products that could be powered by the shell-based packs.

What's more, the battery can be broken down by microbes in less than half a year, compared to the hundreds of years it can take common lithium-ion components to degrade, per the World Economic Forum. And, zinc from the shell packs can be reclaimed and used again for the same purpose.

Some commenters took issue with harvesting crustaceans as part of the process.

""How is [it] sustainable to kill millions of crabs [for] batteries? This is insane!"" a viewer wrote.

But the World Wildlife Fund reported that three billion people rely on seafood as a protein, so shell waste is likely inevitable. Putting it to use keeps it from contributing to methane-producing landfill trash that adds to our planet's warming. Most of the world's excess heat is trapped in the ocean, harming sea life, according to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. So, the impact of cleaner batteries could benefit future shellfish if scaled.

One of the best ways to help limit heat-trapping air pollution is to add home solar to your electricity plan. Solar panels with a battery backup can help you reduce or eliminate your electricity costs while ensuring your lights stay on during outages.

The Cool Down's Solar Explorer can match you with trusted partners that will compare quotes, find an installer, and help you secure tax breaks that expire on Dec. 31, saving up to $10,000 in upfront costs.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that in the first three quarters of 2025, sales have skyrocketed — with 1.2 million EVs sold — more than the entire previous year.
The increase in sales is largely due to automakers making their EVs more affordable and expanding electrification across new models.
In 2015, only 25 EV models existed, compared with 113 in 2025.

The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) notes that in the first three quarters of 2025, sales have skyrocketed — with 1.2 million EVs sold — more than the entire previous year.

The increase in sales is largely due to automakers making their EVs more affordable and expanding electrification across new models. According to the ICCT, 68% of EVs are now priced at under $50,000. In 2015, only 25 EV models existed, compared with 113 in 2025.

The ICCT states that ""consumer appetite continues to grow,"" noting that recent surveys show a majority of respondents are interested in making an EV their next vehicle.

Still, many automakers are holding back from investing in EVs. The ICCT reports that companies are hesitating because of market uncertainty, rising costs, shifting regulations, and concerns about consumer demand.

A shift toward vehicle electrification benefits consumers by introducing new models at more affordable prices. EVs do not need gas and typically require less maintenance, which can significantly reduce ownership costs and customer dissatisfaction.

As EVs continue to outnumber combustion vehicles, prices are expected to keep dropping, making them a more affordable option. This may also encourage consumers to electrify their lifestyles further by looking into solar energy to power their homes and vehicles.

EVs are also a far more environmentally friendly option because they lack tailpipes that release dirty, polluting gases that contribute to the warming of our planet.

To further increase affordability, a startup, Ateios Systems, has come up with a process that coats electrodes for faster battery manufacturing. This allows batteries to be produced more quickly to ramp up EV production.

Corporations are also teaming up to strengthen the battery supply chain. Epsilon Advanced Materials and Phillips 66 are partnering to produce key graphite materials inside the U.S., rather than relying on foreign sources that are vulnerable to tariffs and export restrictions.

It is evident that automakers are working hard to reduce the cost of EVs. Jeremy Short, chief engineer for the GM Bolt, told Fast Company, ""We wanted to get that under-$30,000 number.""

Similarly, a spokesperson for Ford told CarsDirect that the 2026 Ford F-150 Lightning will see price cuts of up to $4,000, and CarsDirect adds the company ""is doing so without sacrificing standard equipment.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hands.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 19:58:40.784755

In a rare instance of bipartisan alarm, Republican-chaired committees in the House and Senate announced that they have launched inquiries into an explosive Washington Post report alleging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had given a spoken order to “kill everybody” aboard a vessel carrying suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean. The occupants included two people who had survived an initial missile strike on the vessel and were seen “clinging” to the wreckage.

“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Friday.

“The Committee has directed inquiries to the [Department of Defense], and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances,” leaders in the Senate Armed Services Committee said.

The September 2 attack kicked off what has now been nearly two dozen attacks, killing at least 83 people, who the US military claims, without evidence, had been attempting to smuggle drugs into the US. The attacks, which President Trump justifies as a part of an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, have been likened to extrajudicial killings.

Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona told CNN on Sunday that Hegseth’s actions, as reported by the Post, appear to be a war crime.

“If what has been reported is accurate, I’ve got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over,” Kelly said. “We are not Russia. We are not Iraq. We hold ourselves to a very high standard of professionalism.”

Kelly is locked in a related battle of words with Hegseth after Kelly participated in a social media video with five other Democrats seeking to remind members of the military that they can “refuse illegal orders.”

Hegseth has blasted the Post’s reporting on the missile strikes as “fabricated.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hegseth.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-30 20:59:16.019935

Employers will continue to receive $5,000 for engaging apprentices in KAP priority occupations for another year, while apprentices will continue to receive $10,000.
This support will be shared equally - with $2,500 for the apprentice and $2,500 for the employer.
""Changes to the incentive system have been carefully calibrated to target support towards housing and new energy occupations, ensuring a skills pipeline in these nation-building industries.
""Alongside our other supports for apprentices, including Free TAFE and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans, these incentives support a continued strong pipeline of skilled workers in the areas they are most needed, like housing and new energy.""","The Albanese Labor Government is extending its $5,000 financial incentive for employers who engage apprentices in the Key Apprenticeship Program (KAP) sectors of housing and new energy.

The decision to extend the payments to December 2026 follows strong uptake of the KAP since it commenced on 1 July this year.

KAP, an expansion of the successful New Energy Apprenticeship Program (NEAP), has seen more than 6,600 apprentices commencing under the housing construction stream, while more than 15,400 new energy apprentices have started training under the NEAP and KAP.

Employers will continue to receive $5,000 for engaging apprentices in KAP priority occupations for another year, while apprentices will continue to receive $10,000.

The changes to the incentive payments follow recommendations from the Strategic Review of the Incentive System and support the Albanese Government's broader plan to meet net zero targets and to build 1.2 million homes by 2029.

From 1 January next year, new apprenticeships in priority occupations that are not eligible for KAP funding will receive incentive payments of $5,000 per apprenticeship. This support will be shared equally - with $2,500 for the apprentice and $2,500 for the employer.

Incentive payments for apprenticeships that commence prior to 1 January 2026 won't be affected by these changes.

This payment is among a suite of government support measures for apprentices, including:

Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans of up to $25,983 (2025-26) to help with the costs of undertaking an apprenticeship in priority occupations

The Living Away From Home Allowance to help those who need to move away from home to take up an apprenticeship opportunity.

Other supports available for apprenticeships include the Apprentice Connect Australia Providers for advice and assistance accessing services, Free TAFE and the Building Women's Careers Program.

The Australian Skills Guarantee Procurement Connected Policy is also creating more employment opportunities for apprentices and trainees by including national targets for apprentices as a requirement for Commonwealth infrastructure and ICT projects.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Skills and Training, Andrew Giles:

""The Albanese Government recognises that employers play a key role in getting more apprentices into critical housing construction and clean energy jobs. This includes carpenters and joiners, plumbers and electricians.

""Changes to the incentive system have been carefully calibrated to target support towards housing and new energy occupations, ensuring a skills pipeline in these nation-building industries.

""The Government continues to provide a range of supports for apprentices because we acknowledge the importance of growing a skills-based workforce ready for the future.""

Quotes attributable to Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Amanda Rishworth:

""The Albanese Government is supporting apprentices in priority occupations who are literally building Australia's future.

""Alongside our other supports for apprentices, including Free TAFE and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans, these incentives support a continued strong pipeline of skilled workers in the areas they are most needed, like housing and new energy.""",https://cdn1.miragenews.com/tmp_cache?cdn=cdn.pixabay.com%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F05%2F31%2F11%2F17%2Foffice-2360063_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 21:58:50.286847

ROBERTS III, Staff columnist, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/faimon-roberts-carbon-capture-opponents-wont-go-away-and-it-s-scrambling-conservative-politics/article_8a222ce6-150a-5a5b-bf2a-87f335dfc83e.html,"The carbon capture insurgency just won’t die.
Some conservatives say carbon capture is unneeded because climate change is overblown.
Earlier this year, it seemed that those who favored expansion of carbon capture had the upper hand.
Jeff Landry issued a moratorium on new carbon capture permits.
Not surprisingly, carbon capture boosters were not pleased.","The carbon capture insurgency just won’t die.

Last week, a group called Save My Louisiana filed a lawsuit in Baton Rouge, arguing that the process amounts to a “egregious and overt trampling” of property rights.

And on Nov. 17, the Vernon Parish Police Jury reversed an earlier decision and passed a resolution opposing the practice.

These latest salvos are an indication of how carbon capture has scrambled conservative and Republican Party politics in this state, because much of the opposition to the process comes not from left-wing environmental justice types (though many of them oppose it, too), but from rock-ribbed conservatives in some of the reddest regions of Louisiana.

To understand what is going on here, it’s important to know what exactly is being proposed. Carbon capture and sequestration is an industrial process by which CO2 and greenhouse gases produced as byproducts are captured and stored rather than released into the air.

Proponents, including industry and business groups, argue that this makes production greener by releasing less CO2. They also contend that the storage, which typically happens thousands of feet underground and is performed by something known as a carbon injection well, is safe, and that there is no danger of the CO2 leaching upward through the ground into water supplies or to the surface.

But the opponents, including many landowners, aren’t buying it.

They worry about the potential for pipeline failures, or that the carbon could find its way into local aquifers. Some conservatives say carbon capture is unneeded because climate change is overblown.

Many of those who oppose it are clustered in the central part of the state, where there are a number of proposed carbon storage areas.

Earlier this year, it seemed that those who favored expansion of carbon capture had the upper hand. Following a 2024 federal government decision that gave the state “primacy” in permitting carbon capture projects, the Legislature rejected Republican-authored bills that would have given local governments the right to veto injection wells, though lawmakers did tighten some rules in landowners’ favor.

But the opposition wouldn’t go away. Last month, in response, Gov. Jeff Landry issued a moratorium on new carbon capture permits. A handful already in the process were not affected.

""Local government and citizens, through their local government, have a right to be heard to ensure safety, transparency, and local input,"" Landry wrote in his order.

Not surprisingly, carbon capture boosters were not pleased.

The move sends the “wrong message,” said David Cresson, of the Louisiana Chemical Association. Others warned of “obstacles” the state was putting in the way of expansion.

So what we have here is a pitched fight between, essentially, two different conservative constituencies who are both dug in.

On the one hand, you have business, industry and economic development types who see the potential for growth.

On the other, citizens and officials in many of Louisiana’s reddest parishes who, in a notable development, echo many of the concerns that environmentalists have uttered for years — and also assert traditional conservative values like property rights and local control.

It’s too early to see how it will all play out. But if this oil and gas state ever turns on its biggest and most powerful industry, analysts may point to carbon capture as the spark that ignited the flame.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/a2/8a222ce6-150a-5a5b-bf2a-87f335dfc83e/6927760dadc22.preview.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-12-01 02:59:43.286652

“Coal-fired power plants nearly destroyed the Adirondack Park’s forests, lakes and ponds with acid rain,” Adirondack Council Clean Air Specialist and Director of Communications John F. Sheehan said in a press release. “Things are starting to get better here after 30 years of pollution reductions. We don’t want to undo this win and once again lose trees and fish.

“The 2024 soot standards were 25% better at protecting public health than the old standard, which now goes back into effect. Rolling back National Ambient Air Quality Standards undermines public health and safety and will have lasting economic impacts for the country. The nation saves $20 in public health costs for every dollar spent cutting air pollution such as soot, ozone and sulfur dioxide.”

The Adirondack Park contains one of the largest, intact temperate forests in the world and is home to approximately 130,000 year-round residents.

The executive order, issued Nov. 21, said steel makers would be exempt from former President Joe Biden-era standards designed to prevent future pollution increases at all coal-fired smokestacks. All of the steel plants exempt were already meeting the new standards.

Members of the Student Action Committee of the NJ Chapter of the Sierra Club recently launched a thrift store at Princeton Farmer’s Market at Hinds Plaza to raise funds for the Club’s Political Action Committee (PAC), in support of Mikie Sherill’s successful bid to become governor of New Jersey.

Our action tells two stories: one of polyester and other nondegradable materials saved from the landfill, and another of students choosing to support a political election.

The funds were raised the sustainable way: through recycling. Friends, families, and neighbors across the state rallied behind us by donating gently worn clothing, spreading word of our mission, and providing a community level market with the potential to thrive. Clothing items were priced from $3–$15, and Princeton community members and beyond excitedly shopped at our thrift shop, turning closets into catalysts for change! Our goal was not only to support a PAC but also to protect the planet.

Why Thrifting?

In recent years, fast fashion—often unsustainable and polluting—has led to large amounts of clothing being discarded. Much of it could have been reused or recycled. The fast-fashion trend has encouraged people to purchase more clothing than is truly needed. This clothing is often cheaply made, worn just a few times, and then thrown away. This cycle harms the environment in ways that may not always be obvious.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in 2018 around 11.3 million tons of clothing, footwear, and linens were sent to landfills in the United States, and about 85% of all textiles were landfilled or incinerated. That’s a lot of waste.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme and allied sources, the fashion and textile industry is one of the world’s largest consumers of water (often cited as second only to agriculture) and is responsible for roughly 8% to 10% of global greenhouse‑gas emissions.

The materials in many of these clothes are also harmful. For example, polyester releases tiny plastic particles when washed. These end up in rivers, oceans, and even the food chain. It is estimated that washing synthetic clothes releases up to 500,000 tons of microfibers into the ocean each year, roughly equivalent to billions of plastic bottles.

Even donated clothes may end up in landfills. A more effective solution is buying secondhand clothes, known as thrifting. Thrifting lessens the environmental impact and supports local shops and charities that depend on donations. Another option is recycling or upcycling old clothes by turning them into something new instead of discarding them.

If more people bought secondhand items, repaired their clothing, or donated responsibly, less clothing would end up in landfills, and fewer harmful chemicals would pollute the environment.

Places We Can Sustainably Shop

Frequently recommended thrift stores in New Jersey include myUnique, on 2nd Street in Westfield, and Gift To Earth, at 712 Clinton Ave. in South Plainfield. Shoppers also prefer Goodwill for a more classic thrifting experience. It has many locations.

Places to Donate Clothes

Goodwill locations in New Jersey accept clothing donations, and unsold items at their stores are in turn donated to other organizations. Donating to local thrift stores and churches can ensure that donated clothing is distributed to people who live near you. Some other organizations that take clothing donations are Salvation Army and Planet Aid

Global Efforts

Some solutions to textile waste focus on turning discarded clothes into useful new products and materials. Fiber materials are taken from used garments and repurposed into new textiles, cleaning cloths, and construction materials. Mechanical textile recycling has been practiced for over 250 years. This involves physically separating fabrics and fibers for reuse. However, this often results in low-quality materials.

A more recent option is chemical recycling, which breaks down fabric into polymer building materials, although the downsides of this are concerning, such as energy use, emissions, and chemical pollution. There are also biotech solutions being explored at MIT that involve developing proteins to break down the polymers in fabrics so textiles can decompose in as little as two weeks.

Policy-based solutions in the United States, such as California’s Responsible Textile Recovery Act of 2024 (SB 707), are being implemented. This is an extended producer responsibility (EPR) law designed to hold fashion brands accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, including waste management.

New York and Washington also are proposing EPR bills. Moreover, clothing companies such as Patagonia and H&M encourage consumers to trade in used clothes for credit.

What More Can We Do?

Fast fashion is harming our planet, but small, intentional choices are our building blocks for sustainable consumption.

Supporting local thrift stores reduces waste while strengthening our communities. Spreading awareness and educating those around us can also make a large difference. If we make responsible clothing choices, we can mitigate fast fashion’s impact and promote a cleaner, more sustainable future.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-30 19:59:19.645675

The McMinnville facility will focus on heavy-gauge thermoforming, featuring:

An expanded rotary line to increase production capacity.

New heavy- and thin-gauge roll stock extrusion capabilities.

Cost savings of approximately 15 percent on sheet production, increasing competitiveness in the thermoforming market.

Additionally, Nefab will consolidate its Morrison Thermoforming operation into the new McMinnville site, with full readiness expected by year-end. The installation of new extruders, scheduled to be operational by December 2025, will further expand capacity and reinforce in-house material production.

A key component of the expansion is the facility’s role as a recycling hub for heavy-gauge thermoformed trays. The site will be equipped with a new grinder to support closed-loop recycling, allowing customers to return plastic trays at the end of their lifecycle through Nefab’s take-back program. These materials will be reprocessed and re-extruded into new plastic sheets, reducing waste and promoting a more sustainable lifecycle for plastic packaging.

He noted the political opposition occurring out of state, but offered no suggestion of how the Maine Legislature could influence it.
He said a Maine law that requires voter approval of any effort to restore nuclear power here should be changed.
Money spent on nuclear power in Maine wouldn’t stay here, Lawrence said, unlike local, renewable energy development such as offshore wind.","As the Trump administration works to dismantle renewable energy initiatives and boost oil, coal and natural gas, states such as Maine with aggressive climate initiatives will be largely on their own to maintain momentum. Or maybe shift gears.

That’s why the makeup of the Maine Legislature and the occupant of the governor’s office after the 2026 election cycle will be so consequential.

While the 132nd Legislature will reconvene in January and the who’s who of 2027 is unknowable now, the key issues lawmakers will face were foreshadowed earlier this month during a panel discussion at the Maine State Chamber of Commerce’s Energy Summit in Portland.

One takeaway is that energy affordability — under mounting stress chiefly from rising electricity prices — will be a litmus test for most any climate policy or spending decisions. That puts pressure on Democrats specifically. They have controlled both the Legislature and the executive branch since 2019, and have thus set Maine’s energy agenda, embodied in the state’s climate action plan.

Another takeaway is that, although Democratic and Republican legislators have different visions of how to make energy more affordable, they seem to have retained the rapport necessary for dialogue, a value largely gone from Washington in the Trump era.

The policy outlook panel hosted by the chamber featured four lawmakers with deep institutional knowledge, gained from their years on the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee: Sen. Mark Lawrence, D-York, the Senate co-chair; Rep. Melanie Sachs, D-Freeport, the House co-chair; Rep. Steve Foster, R-Dexter, ranking committee member; and Sen. Matt Harrington R-York, the assistant Senate Republican leader.

Solar policy has been among the most divisive issues handled by the committee. Maine has wrestled in recent years to adjust financial incentives, championed by Democrats, that unleashed a wave of solar development but proved too generous and created a multi-million-dollar burden for electric customers. A recent law, L.D. 1777, restructured the incentives and set the stage for designing a successor program.

During the panel discussion, Sachs and Lawrence expressed satisfaction with the reforms, with Lawrence saying solar policy is now “in the rearview mirror.” But Harrington and Foster disagreed, saying the changes didn’t go far enough. Whether solar stays in the rearview mirror will depend on whether Democrats remain in the driver’s seat, or if a suit filed this week by the solar industry to block the law gets traction.

On the challenge of balancing affordability with clean energy goals, Sachs said Maine can do both. And Lawrence suggested Maine can expand its renewable energy sectors to export more power and boost economic growth. But their Republican colleagues see it differently.

Referring to a large wind farm in Bingham, near his district, Foster noted it was built to satisfy out-of-state contracts and didn’t directly benefit Maine electric customers. More pointedly, Harrington questioned the entire premise of building clean energy projects to meet “our climate goals.”

Harrington continued: “I do not share in those goals. The last six years in the Maine Legislature, the only focus has been on ‘their climate goals.’ There has been zero emphasis on affordability. And Maine people are feeling that so badly today.”

One step that could reduce electricity prices is lowering the wholesale cost of natural gas, which is used to generate half of New England’s electricity. The region doesn’t have enough pipeline capacity on the coldest days, and building new pipelines into southern New England could help lower costs and reduce price volatility. Public and political opposition in New York and Massachusetts, however, has kept more gas from coming north. That’s the primary reason most Maine electric customers will see their electricity supply rates rise next year.

Lamenting that, Foster spoke at length about the financial and climate emission benefits that natural gas brought to Maine paper mills after they converted from oil. He noted the political opposition occurring out of state, but offered no suggestion of how the Maine Legislature could influence it.

There’s a global effort to design small, less-expensive nuclear reactors that can be built in factories and assembled on site, although none yet exist in North America. Asked by the panel’s moderator to comment on the potential role of next-generation nuclear power, Harrington said it should be part of the energy conversation in Maine. He said a Maine law that requires voter approval of any effort to restore nuclear power here should be changed.

Lawrence, who along with Sachs had recently visited Ontario to learn about Canadian plans to build small modular reactors, said he wasn’t opposed to nuclear power. But the effort in Ontario is heavily subsidized by the government, he said, with job opportunities related to uranium mining, research and construction taking place in Canada.

Money spent on nuclear power in Maine wouldn’t stay here, Lawrence said, unlike local, renewable energy development such as offshore wind. He called nuclear power “an economic loser for the state of Maine.”

The panelists were asked to identify priorities for the upcoming legislative session. No surprise, the top issue was affordability. Harrington said affordability should be the only standard to work under, as opposed to the clean electricity standard now in state law that calls for greater shares of renewable power.

One hopeful sign that Maine lawmakers can work across party lines on affordability came in a closing remark from Lawrence, reflecting on his seven years working with Foster. It spoke to mutual respect, at a time when some lawmakers vilify their political opponents as personal adversaries.

“He’s very much a conscience,” Lawrence said of his Republican colleague, “when we Democrats are doing something too fast, too ambitious.”",https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/AP19218765527962.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-11-30 16:59:12.074505

The Trump Administration has published the maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program for initial price applicability year 2027; these 15 drugs in Part D were selected because of either high program spending or high beneficiary utilization.

The administration’s touted $12 billion in savings (an approximately 44-percent reduction in net Part D spending if the prices had been in place for 2024) are nearly double the initial year of savings under the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program.

While the savings seem significant, further analysis of the announcement identifies calculated inefficiencies, an overrepresentation of benefit, and the continued lack of evidence that any savings will truly materialize in Part D.

Introduction

On November 25, 2025, the Trump Administration announced the latest round of negotiated drugs under the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The initial price applicability year (IPAY) 2027 announcement marks the second major wave of Medicare drug price negotiations, extending negotiated “maximum fair prices” (MFPs) to 15 high-spend or high-utilization Part D drugs starting January 1, 2027. These drugs accounted for roughly $42.5 billion in gross Part D spending in 2024 – about 15 percent of total program drug costs – and were used by about 5.3 million beneficiaries. The administration touted savings of $12 billion in net covered prescription drug costs, or approximately 44 percent lower aggregate net spending, if the MFPs had been in effect for 2024. For 2027, the administration estimated that people enrolled in Medicare prescription drug coverage would save $685 million in out-of-pocket costs under the MFPs. While seemingly impressive, these aggregated, theoretical savings based on retrospective data continue to tell only one aspect of the entire Medicare landscape.

CMS IPAY 2027 Announcement

Under the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) directly negotiates prices for high-expenditure, single-source Part D drugs lacking generic or biosimilar competition. For IPAY 2027, CMS finalized MFPs for 15 selected Part D drugs after a year-long negotiation process with manufacturers. The table below, from the CMS fact sheet announcing the MFPs, demonstrates the range of projected savings.

Headline Savings and Comparison to IPAY 2026

CMS’ 2027 estimates show larger aggregate savings in both absolute and percentage terms: $12 billion in net savings (44-percent reduction) excluding the coverage gap discount program (CGDP), and about $8.5 billion (36 percent) when CGDP is incorporated. Under the CGDP – or the Manufacturers Discount Program as it is now called – participating manufacturers are required to provide discounts on applicable drugs in the initial and catastrophic coverage phases of Part D. In other words, a wide-reaching discount program already resulting in beneficiary savings without the IRA MFPs. On the beneficiary side, CMS projects that, under the defined standard Part D benefit, enrollees could save an estimated $685 million in out-of-pocket costs in 2027 from these MFPs alone.

The IPAY 2027 figures are frequently contrasted with those from the first negotiation cycle, IPAY 2026, which involved 10 Part D drugs used for conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, autoimmune disease, and blood cancers. For the first round, CMS estimated that if the 2026 MFPs had applied in 2023, Medicare would have saved about $6 billion in net spending – roughly a 22 percent reduction – while beneficiaries were projected to save about $1.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs in 2026.

The second-year discounts are deeper on average than those in the first year, in part because the 2027 group includes very high-spend GLP-1s and oncology agents with substantial room between list prices and MFPs. Additionally, the absolute out-of-pocket gain to beneficiaries from MFPs alone is smaller than in 2026 because the broader Part D redesign (including the new out-of-pocket cap) is now doing much of the heavy lifting on catastrophic costs. The table below shows numerous calculations to demonstrate the “true” amount of the government-determined rebate. Note: t did not have sufficient data to assess average manufacturer rebates, and thus comparable numbers could not reliably be generated. Based on the calculations, some rebates may be impactful; others are clearly not huge sources of savings for either the government or beneficiaries.

Potential Implications for Beneficiaries

For individual Part D enrollees, the practical impact of these new MFPs will depend on benefit design, utilization, and interactions with other IRA changes.

Interaction with the Part D out-of-pocket cap: As of 2025, Part D enrollees face a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug spending (rising to $2,100 in 2026), after which they owe no additional cost sharing for covered Part D drugs. For heavy users of high-cost products such as GLP-1s or oral oncology drugs, this cap may already substantially limit spending; the MFPs then reduce the amount of cost sharing they incur before hitting the cap and may mean fewer people hit the cap in the first place.

Coinsurance versus copay designs: Beneficiaries in plans that charge coinsurance (a percentage of the drug’s price) should see a direct reduction in per-fill costs when the MFPs take effect, assuming the MFP is below the plan’s current net price. Those facing flat copays may see little or no immediate change if the plan keeps the same copay amount, even though the plan’s own liability falls. The magnitude of out-of-pocket savings from negotiation is inherently uncertain and will vary by plan design and beneficiary utilization.

Formulary coverage and access: A key structural component is that Part D plans are required to cover all selected drugs with MFPs, including all dosage forms and strengths, which may reduce the risk that a beneficiary finds a high-profile drug excluded from their plan or subject to unusually restrictive utilization management compared to non-selected competitors. CMS has indicated it will scrutinize tiering and management practices that could undermine access to selected drugs.

Distribution of gains: Because the IPAY 2027 list includes several specialty and high-cost products, savings will be concentrated among beneficiaries who use these specific drugs rather than spread evenly across all Part D enrollees. At the same time, program-level savings can exert downward pressure on premiums and on federal Part D spending over time, potentially benefiting a broader population indirectly.

Points of Confusion and Contention

Aggressive “negotiations” to address beneficiary needs

Outside of the IRA negotiations, the White House had long been signaling that drug pricing would be handled aggressively, with a mix of Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) rhetoric and tariff brinkmanship. The message to manufacturers and foreign governments has been: Accept lower prices, or face some combination of trade penalties, import restrictions, or regulatory pressure. That’s not a traditional negotiation over value; it’s a leverage campaign.

The IRA’s negotiation authority is just the domestic counterpart to these external tactics. MFN talk toward other countries says, “we’ll make you pay if you don’t give us your lowest price.” The IRA framework says to manufacturers, “we’ll tax you out of the Medicare market if you don’t sign the MFP contract.” This approach doesn’t build a principled, predictable pricing framework; it levies the threat of punishment to drag prices down in discrete skirmishes.

As noted in POLITICO, Chris Klomp, the Director of Medicare, stated this clearly:

The key factor in the second round of price negotiations was the administration’s willingness to walk away from the table if they didn’t reach a deal, said Chris Klomp, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which handled the talks.

“A true negotiation implies that you might not reach a negotiated outcome,” Klomp said.

Thus, framing the IPAY 2026 and IPAY 2027 rounds as “negotiations” obscures what’s really going on. The same posture that underlies MFN posturing and pharmaceutical tariff threats –naming and shaming manufacturers and threatening punitive penalties for headline-ready percentage cuts – has simply been imported into Medicare. The millions of beneficiaries that CMS is arguably responsible for representing have no say in the determination of an acceptable price, so the central decision-making process can’t be called a negotiation. It creates a blurred line between legitimate purchasing strategy and ad hoc economic coercion, and it makes it hard to argue that the resulting prices are the product of a thoughtful, evidence-based process rather than the latest move in a high-stakes game of chicken.

Any “value” created is narrow

On paper, the IPAY 2027 MFPs deliver several billion dollars a year in lower Medicare spending on a carefully curated list of high-spend drugs. But those “savings” are calculated relative to a baseline that assumes the old system – escalating list prices and opaque rebates – would have continued unchanged. There is still no serious accounting for how manufacturers will respond when a significant share of their Medicare revenue is capped by statute: higher prices in commercial markets, trimmed investment in follow-on indications, different launch strategies, or more aggressive contracting outside Medicare. Those downstream effects are invisible in the headline savings figure, but they are very real economic costs.

For beneficiaries, the purported benefits are muddled. The projected out-of-pocket savings sound impressive in aggregate, but they are narrowly concentrated among people taking a small set of drugs and sit on top of a redesigned Part D that would have reduced catastrophic exposure anyway. A sizable share of the “benefit” claimed through MFPs is arguably just double-counting: The out-of-pocket cap and restructured liability phases are doing most of the heavy lifting, while MFPs marginally lower the prices that feed into that benefit formula.

The graph below shows that the comparative impact of these “negotiations” is less than the market itself could drive. Only four of the 15 selected drugs (the graph omits Pomalyst due to sparse data) have an IRA rebate that outperforms the market. This is more than last year’s MFPs – which had no IRA rebates that out-performed the market – but it is not a ringing endorsement of the program’s success.

The Ever-present Mismatch of GLP-1 policy

As if the GLP-1 coverage decision-making process wasn’t convoluted enough, the gap between the semaglutide MFP for IPAY 2027 and the earlier, highly publicized GLP-1 “deal” is a useful case study in how ad hoc this policy environment has become. The administration has announced two different prices for the same medication that is intended to be administered in the same program. We now have two competing reference points:

a statutory MFP for semaglutide inside Part D, produced by the IRA’s statutory process and meant to apply across plans; and

a program-specific GLP-1 price, marketed as a breakthrough “deal,” that in some cases lands below, and in other cases above, the semaglutide MFP – depending on channel, indication, and details of the arrangement.

CMS has already announced that the separately negotiated GLP-1 deal will supersede the IRA MFP outcomes, which could support a narrative that the Medicare drug negotiation program is not a rational, rules-based anchor for the market, but instead is a stopgap for the price-setting endeavors being led by the White House. It tells patients and plans that there is no single “true” price for these drugs; there are multiple, politically-negotiated prices depending on where you sit. The result looks less like a principled, evidence-based pricing regime and more like a layered set of one-off bargains.

Conclusion

CMS’ long-awaited announcement of maximum fair prices for covered drugs in the Medicare Drug Negotiation Program closes one of the largest outstanding items on its 2025 regulatory agenda. The accompanying data, however, does not provide clear evidence of the benefits of the IRA Medicare drug negotiation program. While the savings seem significant, further analysis of the announcement identifies calculated inefficiencies, an overrepresentation of benefit, and the continued lack of hard evidence that any savings will truly materialize in Part D. The health care industry still has not experienced a world in which any MFP has been effectuated for Part D, and until this is the case, the impact of any MFPs remains theoretical and unsubstantiated.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MDNP-IPAY-2027.png,N,,2025-11-30 16:59:47.004501

Flagship BEV Taurus prime mover features innovative battery-swapping technology

Company to continue supporting hydrogen solutions with price reductions coming

At the company’s annual general meeting, shareholders voted strongly in favour of the name change which the company said reflects its expansion beyond hydrogen into a wider portfolio of clean energy technologies, mobility solutions and services.

While Pure One (proposed code: P1C) will continue to offer a strong line-up of hydrogen mobility products, its vehicle offering has also expanded into battery-electric solutions.

Importantly, this includes a battery-swap technology that is cheaper than diesel in both capex and maintenance.

This tech allows vehicle batteries to be quickly swapped out in minutes, which completely side-steps the biggest drawback of BEVs – namely the need for lengthy recharging times.

Highlighting this, the company is targeting a price point of $200,000 plus GST for its flagship Taurus battery-swap 6x4 prime mover – a highly competitive price point for a new prime mover in Australia.

The prime mover and the 8X4 rigid are both expected to be strong sellers as Pure One leverages its first-mover advantage as a leading supplier of clean energy vehicles for the commercial transport sector.

PH2 has also reiterated it will continue to support hydrogen solutions as input prices continue to decrease with improved product redesign and diversified supply channels.

To deliver on its market opportunity, Pure One is taking a strategic partnership approach – highlighted recently by a signed term sheet with Advanced Manufacturing Queensland for the supply, assembly and sale of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in Australia.

Diverse, ADR compliant fleet

Operating as Pure one, the company will offer customers a diverse fleet of clean technology commercial vehicles that have been designed from the ground up.

It provides a pathway to near-term cashflow with proven technology and the company notes a strong demand pipeline for BEV buses as passenger transport.

The company’s prime mover – 23t waste truck and buses compliant with Australian Design Rules – meet national standards for road vehicle safety, anti-theft and emissions.

Multiple vehicles are being built to meet a growing sales pipeline comprising multi-vehicle orders from large Australian industrial and construction customers.

In August 2025, Pure One secured more than $3m in new orders from commercial transport operators for its leading fleet of hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) vehicles.

These include two Taurus HFC prime movers ordered by Scott Lovatt Transport – a NSW- based company in Preston, southwest of Sydney – and a follow-up purchase order from construction major Heidelberg Materials Australia for a second HFC 8×4 concrete agitator rigid truck.

California-based truck distributor and leasing operator GTS Group has also sent the company a letter of intent for the purchase of Class 8 HFC tractor units along with a range of rigid trucks including 6X4 waste collection and 8X4 concrete mixer vehicles for its leasing customers.

The company has also been growing its exposure with agreements in place.

To meet these and future orders, Pure One has established manufacturing capacity capable of producing up to 200 hydrogen fuel cell or BEV vehicles per month.

US President Donald Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” policy is most often viewed through the lens of conservative priorities that favor fossil fuels, but that’s only part of the partisan political picture. Solar power has become an economic lifeline for K–12 school districts, putting it at odds with a long-standing effort to reshape the nation’s politically neutral system of public education.

The US Solar Industry Hearts Public Education

The conservative effort to undercut K–12 public schools has a long history. It stretches far back into the 20th century, when journalists drew media attention to the personal and corporate enrichment of self-proclaimed “school choice” activists.

The same political divide is evident today. While blue states continue to support traditional K–12 public schools as a universal right, a series of new “voucher” laws in red states has raised concerns that the quality of public education will suffer from lack of funding, alongside a fresh wave of book bans and other forms of censorship.

Against this backdrop, solar power has emerged as an ally on the side of public education. Solar projects provide local school districts with new tax dollars and relief from high electricity costs, providing a significant new pillar of support for districts that face stagnating or declining state and federal funding. The extra relief can help school districts manage new restrictions on funding, too. Local solar arrays also provide new opportunities for study in and out of the classroom, and they can serve as platforms for workforce training.

The Power Of Solar Power

One interesting example comes from Texas, where the global energy firm RWE just flipped the switch on its new Stoneridge Solar power plant. The facility is located in Milam County, which bills itself as a “peaceful retreat” between Austin and Waco.

The new power plant includes a 200 megawatt-hour battery energy storage system along with a solar capacity of 200 megawatts, adding another notch to RWE’s 11-gigawatt footprint in in the US. “The project is expected to generate millions in tax revenue for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District, with direct investments supporting first responders and educational initiatives,” RWE notes. The non-revenue assist to Milam County schools includes funds for renovating a local elementary school.

Like all school districts in Texas, Milam County faces pressure from rising costs and stagnating assistance from state policymakers. A years-long bottleneck in state funding finally broke last summer, but the bulk of the new $85 billion funding went to increase teacher pay among the state’s 1,200 school systems, not to help offset rising operational costs. The new funds also failed to make a meaningful improvement in the all important metric of per-student allotment. Lawmakers did, however, approve a new $1 billion voucher program for non-public schools, a pet project of Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

Urban Solar Power: 20 Megawatts & Counting

Large, utility-scale solar power plants are beyond the immediate reach of urban school districts, but even a modest rooftop array can provide significant economic and educational benefits. For big cities with numerous schools, the numbers add up.

In October, the education news organization Chalkbeat New York took stock of New York City’s school solar program. “With solar panels on 126 school building rooftops, New York City schools are central to the city and state’s green energy goals and generate the majority of solar energy installed on municipal buildings,” observed reporter Seyma Bayram.

All together, the rooftop arrays have a capacity of almost 20 megawatts, accounting for about 80% of the combined rooftop capacity of all municipal properties in the city.

In addition to the economic and climate action benefits of school solar power, Bayram also teased out yet another significant reason to install rooftop solar at public schools. “More than half of FEMA’s approximately 67,500 designated shelters nationwide are located in schools, making it more urgent to equip them with solar storage systems that can provide backup power during outages,” Bayram explained.

Bayram also cites Sara Ross, whose nonprofit UndauntedK12 advocates for clean energy in schools. “ School budgets are tight, and fundamentally, solar is the cheapest energy around, so when schools install solar, they can reduce their operating costs,” Ross told Chalkbeat. “That frees up more dollars to go back into their core mission.”

Solar can also be a revenue earner in some cases. When school buildings are idle for holidays, their electricity needs are lower, and they can sell unused solar power back to the grid.

On the down side, as part of the fallout from the Republicans’ new “OBBA” federal tax bill, the cost of installing school solar arrays is expected to shoot up by as much as 30% after the end of 2027, when the relevant tax credits are set to expire. New country-of-origin restrictions on solar panels and other equipment could also put a crimp in the school solar movement.

Nevertheless, New York City is not letting the solar power grass grow under its feet. According to Bayram, 90 additional school solar projects are already in motion and 200 more are in the review process.

K–12 Schools As Solar Ambassadors

Despite their radically different political profiles, Texas and New York State are both hotspots for solar development among other renewable energy activities. West Virginia provides another perspective on the school solar movement, considering its longstanding hostility to anything that interferes with fossil energy extraction.

Talk of converting West Virginia’s spent coal mines to solar farms goes back at least as far as 2011, with little to show for it. As of 2020, West Virginia hit the lowly #49 slot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, at just 10.52 megawatts. Still, a trickle of new utility-scale power plants benefiting school districts continued to slip through, and the emerging Energy-as-a-Service industry has added another wrinkle.

EaaS contracts enable the client to install new energy efficient systems and equipment without paying upfront costs. They pay off the installer in increments from their savings on energy costs, and pocket the rest for themselves. In some cases, those funds can help support new rooftop solar projects.

Last year, the CMTA branch of the advanced engineering consulting firm Legence recapped its EaaS work with the Grant County, West Virginia school district. The contract included guaranteed energy savings at all four schools in the rural district. One highlight was Petersburg Elementary School, where CMTA focused its “Zero Energy” strategy for introducing renewable energy supported by energy efficiency upgrades.

“The building was not Zero Energy ready prior to this project,” CMTA explained. “The elementary facility had a unique opportunity to have a large solar array installed that would be fully funded by energy savings.”

Power purchase agreements (PPA) are another financial tool aiding the school solar movement in West Virginia. In 2021, state lawmakers approved new legislation enabling schools to use PPA contracts. Among the first to set the wheels in motion was Calhoun County, which entered into a PPA for two of its schools with the firm Secure Solar Futures.

The two projects went live in May of this year. Got Electric, the company that installed the solar arrays, calculates that solar power is offsetting a healthy 70–80% of electricity used by the schools. At that rate, Secure Solar estimates that the school system will save $740,000 over the 25-year term of the agreement.

The Calhoun County project also illustrates the ripple effect of hands-on solar education at schools, with local students now getting a leg up on solar-related scholarships and apprenticeships as well as new job opportunities in their communities.

Who could hate it? West Virginia State Senator Craig Hart (R-Mingo), for one. Earlier this year, Hart proposed new legislation that would pull the rug out from under PPA contracts. “I don’t think a school is a good place to make a political statement about your utilities and whatnot,” Hart reportedly said during a committee meeting in April, while drawing politics into the conversation.

On the down side, as part of the fallout from the Republicans’ new “OBBA” federal tax bill, the cost of installing school solar arrays is expected to shoot up by as much as 30% after the end of 2027, when the relevant tax credits are set to expire. New country-of-origin restrictions on solar panels and other equipment could also put a crimp in the school solar movement.

Nevertheless, New York City is not letting the solar power grass grow under its feet. According to Bayram, 90 additional school solar projects are already in motion and 200 more are in the review process.

K-12 Schools As Solar Ambassadors

Despite their radically different political profiles, Texas and New York State are both hotspots for solar development among other renewable energy activities. West Virginia provides another perspective on the school solar movement, considering its longstanding hostility to anything that interferes with fossil energy extraction.

Talk of converting West Virginia’s spent coal mines to solar farms goes back at least as far as 2011, with little to show for it. As of 2020 West Virginia hit the lowly #49 slot in a state-by-state ranking of installed solar capacity, at just 10.52 megawatts. Still, a trickle of new utility-scale power plants benefiting school districts continued to slip through, and the emerging Energy-as-a-Service industry has added another wrinkle.

EaaS contracts enable the client to install new energy efficient systems and equipment without paying up-front costs. They pay off the installer in increments from their savings on energy costs, and pocket the rest for themselves. In some cases, those funds can help support new rooftop solar projects.

Last year the CMTA branch of the advanced engineering consulting firm Legence recapped its EaaS work with the Grant County, West Virginia school district. The contract included guaranteed energy savings at all four schools in the rural district. One highlight was Petersburg Elementary School, where CMTA focused its “Zero Energy” strategy for introducing renewable energy supported by energy efficiency upgrades.

“The building was not Zero Energy ready prior to this project,” CMTA explained. “The elementary facility had a unique opportunity to have a large solar array installed that would be fully funded by energy savings.”

Power purchase agreements are another financial tool aiding the school solar movement in West Virginia. In 2021 state lawmakers approved new legislation enabling schools to use PPA contracts. Among the first to set the wheels in motion was Calhoun County, which entered into a PPA for two of its schools with the firm Secure Solar Futures.

The two projects went live in May of this year. Got Electric, the company that installed the solar arrays, calculates that solar power is offsetting a healthy 70–80% of electricity used by the schools. At that rate, Secure Solar estimates that the school system will save $740,000 over the 25-year term of the agreement.

The Calhoun County project also illustrates the ripple effect of hands-on solar education at schools, with local students now getting a leg up on solar-related scholarships and apprenticeships as well as new job opportunities in their communities.

Who could hate it? West Virginia State Senator Craig Hart (R-Mingo), for one. Earlier this year Hart proposed new legislation that would pull the rug out from under PPA contracts. “I don’t think a school is a good place to make a political statement about your utilities and whatnot,” Hart reportedly said during a committee meeting in April, while drawing politics into the conversation.

It was just several days ago that I wrote an article about Tesla launching a huge EV charging hub that runs on solar power. Today I found another one. Though, it actually launched a little before the Tesla one. It’s a new hub with 18 fast chargers for fleet vehicles. The press release from Terawatt Infrastructure says the source of electricity is renewables. “Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session.”

The location is Rialto, California, about 56 miles east of Los Angeles. The new fleet charging hub provides:

18 pull-through 350kW DC fast-charging stalls

55 bobtail parking stalls for overnight parking, shift changes, and logistics needs

Driver lounge building featuring Wi-Fi, climate control, and restrooms

License plate recognition for seamless entry

Solar canopies and 100% renewable energy powering every session

24/7 security with 360-degree cameras and gated access to protect vehicles, cargo, and drivers.

For people who might think this new site is just a one-off, Terawatt opened a similarly sized hub in April. “The private site, shared among multiple fleets, will house a total of 20 pull-through and bobtail DC fast charging stalls and boast a capacity of 7MW — enabling charging for up to 125 trucks per day.”

But let’s get back to the Rialto hub. “The Rialto site brings Terawatt’s vision of a connected, electrified network to life. It provides fast, reliable, and high-speed pull-through charging along an electric lane that runs from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles through Vernon and Commerce, culminating in Rialto. Our network enables companies to reduce emissions and run a variety of routes across a number of vehicle classes with the confidence of a dependable charging solution. EV fleets can now travel further, more cleanly, without slowing down their operations,” said Neha Palmer, CEO and co-founder of Terawatt.

Solar power canopies generate electricity and don’t require vast amounts of land. They also provide shade and protection from precipitation.

There has been much good news about new EV charger installations lately, despite the loss of the federal EV incentives and a Trump administration that is anti-EV.

Using fully electric medium- and-heavy-duty freight trucks reduces harmful air pollution because they don’t burn diesel fuel or gasoline. There are some environmental benefits as well.

NJ ZIP Incentives for GreenPower

GreenPower Motor Company announced that its full Class 4 EV Star lineup—including the Passenger Van, Mobility Plus, ReeferX, Cab & Chassis, Stakebed, and Utility Truck—is now eligible for major incentives under New Jersey’s newly reopened Zero-Emission Incentive Program (NJ ZIP). Base vouchers start at $65,000 per vehicle and can exceed $90,000 with stackable bonuses.

The NJ ZIP program relaunched November 24, 2025, with $75 million in funding, split into two $37.5 million rounds. GreenPower vehicles qualify on a first-come, first-served basis.

New Jersey also launched the NJ ZEV Financing Program, offering low-interest loans of $50,000 to $500,000 for up to 100% of eligible zero-emission vehicle costs. This financing can be combined with NJ ZIP vouchers or used independently.

GreenPower executives highlighted the company’s ready-to-deliver lineup of passenger, mobility, cargo, refrigerated, and utility configurations, while Wolfington Body Company expressed support for expanding zero-emission fleets across the state.

Pure Lithium Saudi Patent for Brine-to-Battery Technology

Pure Lithium Corporation has received a foundational patent from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its “Vertically Integrated Pure Lithium Metal Production and Lithium Battery Production” technology. The patent covers the company’s end-to-end Brine to Battery™ process, which unifies lithium extraction, anode production, and battery manufacturing.

CEO Emilie Bodoin noted that Saudi Arabia’s lithium-rich brines and abundant vanadium make it an ideal location for the company’s next-generation battery ecosystem. The company now holds more than 128 patents and applications globally, along with multiple trademarks.

Saudi Arabia’s Energy Capital Group, an investor since 2023, says the technology could give the country a competitive foothold in battery manufacturing with exceptional supply-chain security. Pure Lithium’s metal battery design uses no graphite, nickel, cobalt, or manganese—materials that dominate the current lithium-ion supply chain—while offering lighter, more powerful, and lower-cost performance.

ChargePoint & Dabaja Brothers: Ultra-Fast EV Charging Site in Detroit

ChargePoint has opened a new ultra-fast EV charging site in Canton, Michigan, in partnership with the Dabaja Brothers Development Group. This marks the first of several Dabaja-owned properties that will be equipped with ChargePoint Express Plus fast chargers, with additional sites planned in Dearborn and Livonia.

The rollout aims to fill “fast charging deserts” across metro Detroit by deploying more than 40 fast-charging ports. All stations will run on the new ChargePoint Platform, offering real-time monitoring, flexible pricing, and performance management.

Dabaja Brothers says the project addresses a significant lack of EV charging options in the region. ChargePoint’s Express Plus system supports every EV model, can charge two vehicles simultaneously, and uses advanced cooling to maintain peak charging speeds for quicker, uninterrupted sessions.

Suncoast Charging 1st Fast-Charging Station

Suncoast Charging Corporation has officially opened its first public DC fast-charging station in Land O’ Lakes, Florida, marking the start of its broader EV charging network rollout planned for 2026 and beyond. The station supports up to eight vehicles simultaneously and features 325 kW Tesla V4 Canvas Superchargers, accessible to all EV models with flexible payment options and 24/7 availability.

The company also announced its two Founders: electric mobility veteran David Patrick, who brings extensive leadership in EV infrastructure deployment, and Wesley Sima, whose background in finance and clean energy business development supports Suncoast’s growth strategy.

Suncoast is partnering with Center Connect Development to build its first two premium charging locations: the Hub at Bexley (now open) and the Hub at Lexington Oaks, expected in Q1 2026. These sites were selected for their destination-style amenities, including dining, retail, live music, and community events, serving both local residents and travelers.

Looking ahead, Suncoast plans to open approximately 20 new stations in 2026 as part of a reliable, customer-focused regional network.

The company is also launching a Community & Environmental Partnership Initiative, collaborating with local businesses and environmental groups to feature wildlife-themed charger designs and promote regional habitat preservation.",https://cdn.autoconnectedcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/staronly.png,N,,2025-11-30 16:00:10.410161

Summary

TC Energy benefited from positive results in 2Q25, beating estimates, with EBITDA guidance being modestly raised, and the current capex remaining static.

Enbridge has vast scale across oil, gas, utilities and renewables. Enbridge’s strategy is to focus on a steady dividend, coupled with modest growth.

Earlier in the year, ONEOK missed 7-8% on EBITDA, which hurt performance for the company.

In 2Q25, Hess Midstream beat street estimates and remains a solid yield play.

Chart: Solar and wind are meeting — and exceeding — new power demand

A few months I posted a link to Michael Liebreich’s excellent two-part essay on the great climate reset. Underpinning Liebreich’s thesis was math: if clean energy exceeds demand by 3% per year for the next 40 years, pretty much everything will be clean shortly after 2060, despite a tripling of demand. I know that’s not fast enough for a lot of folks but for any student of energy history, that would be extremely fast.

And so far this year, solar and wind growth has outpaced demand by over 5%.

Throw in nuclear and new clean supply has outpaced demand by over 10%.

It’s only nine months but it’s extremely encouraging nonetheless.

Texas Grid Operators and Regulators Iron Out New Rules for Data Centers - Inside Climate News

This article provides a good overview of the various rulemakings underway to implement Senate Bill 6 — and the need for them.

The large load interconnection queue faced by ERCOT, Texas’ power grid, is now dominated by data centers, according to data from ERCOT’s latest system planning and weatherization update. Compared with September 2024, ERCOT now is tracking more than three times as many large load interconnections, with nearly 69% of the large load requests coming from data centers. By contrast, in May 2024, non-cryptocurrency data centers made up less than half of the large power demand requests.

While writer Arcelia Martin highlights the many concerns swirling around data center development, she also highlights an important perspective I often talk and write about here: Texas is a unique place for this kind of development which could inure to Texas’ benefit:

For Woody Rickerson, chief operating officer of ERCOT, the new rules outlined in SB6 are exemplary of why Texas is an opportune place for the growth of data centers, particularly those servicing artificial intelligence.

Grid operators and regulators want to move quickly, he said at a Sept. 30 data center industry conference in San Antonio.

Rickerson said in recent years, the state has proven it can transform the grid through the widespread adoption of renewable energy in ERCOT. The state’s independent grid now hosts more solar, wind and batteries than any other state in the country, with operators saying it can grant customers access to large amounts of power without the bureaucracy other grids face.

“We can change. We can adapt,” Rickerson said. “We can put new processes in place more quickly.”

Much more on how data centers could strengthen the grid here:

Approximately four out of five Americans surveyed supported the Endangered Species Act, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare.","Several United States environmental policies may be weakened or removed following a week of announcements by various agencies with plans to introduce major changes. This could mark the largest rollback of environmental protections under any administration.

In November, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed to remove federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, thereby reducing the power of the 1972 Clean Water Act. The EPA said it planned to more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams, which is expected to take away federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85 percent of all wetlands nationwide, according to the environmental group the Natural Resources Defence Council.

Just two days later, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act, which may make it more difficult to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction. The move would permit the government to assess economic factors, such as the loss of revenues by not exploiting the land in question, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered, rather than assessing the region based on purely scientific evidence.

Another day later, the Interior Department announced plans to allow for new oil and gas drilling across almost 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, with as many as 34 lease sales in federal waters. The agency is exploring the potential for holding lease sales in California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Arctic waters of Alaska.

Pat Parenteau, a professor of climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School, said, “This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States… Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

Ironically, the move to dismantle some of the strongest environmental protections in the United States took place as many world leaders were attending the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. President Trump did not attend COP30, making it the first time in the summit’s 30-year history that the United States was not present.

White House representatives said that the moves supported Trump’s American energy dominance agenda, which he has been pushing for several months. In recent months, Trump has signed a flurry of executive orders taking target at the growing green energy sector, and instead favouring the expansion of U.S. fossil fuels.

This has been met with mounting criticism from environmental groups who claim that Trump is not fulfilling his legal obligations by scrapping several major environmental policies. However, several industries support the latest move, including farming groups, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, home builders, and real estate developers. Nevertheless, finalising the three proposals could take up to two years, during which time the government may have to endure lengthy legal battles over the proposals.

Many Americans are in favour of the environmental protections currently in place. Approximately four out of five Americans surveyed supported the Endangered Species Act, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Meanwhile, 81 percent of Americans who were polled said they were concerned about the environment, including the welfare of animals and nature.

Kristen Boyles, an attorney with environmental law group Earthjustice, said in a statement, “Trump’s attacks on the Endangered Species Act seriously misread the room. Most people are not going to allow the sacrifice of our natural world to a bunch of billionaires and corporate interests.”

However, the EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said that he aims to establish regulations that would be “durable and withstand future swings of presidential elections to come.” He said he expected significant environmental rollbacks to be taken in 2025. “We will do more deregulation in one year than entire federal governments in the past have done across all federal agencies combined,” said Zeldin.

In addition to the recent attacks on environmental protections, the Trump administration is making several changes to the Department of Energy (DoE), seemingly aimed at weakening the agency’s research and support for green energy and cleantech initiatives.

The DoE posted a revised organisational chart this month, which no longer shows the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, or the Grid Deployment Office, which have previously provided financial support for clean energy sectors. This follows moves by Trump earlier in the year to cut Biden-era funding destined for decarbonisation projects.

The efforts by the Trump administration to rein in clean energy spending and reduce environmental protections double down on President Trump’s goal to roll back the aims outlined in Biden’s climate policies, in favour of the expansion of U.S. fossil fuels. However, we will likely see pushback from environmental organisations and communities across the country who oppose these moves.

But who should pay for these losses?
These scores have mostly been generated by First Street – a private company that takes publically available information about climate risk, and downscales it to the lot level using a proprietary algorithm.
That is a (relative) loss to those owners, for something that is not their fault (at least directly).
Additionally, lower (relative) prices mean lower (relative) real estate commissions, and thus this has upset the realtor industry as well.","Climate risk scores on real estate listings are having an impact on prices and realtors are complaining. But who should pay for these losses?

If you have been browsing Zillow or Redfin in recent years, you may have noticed that (in the US at least), listings have been accompanied by a property risk score for fire, flood, air quality, etc. These scores have mostly been generated by First Street – a private company that takes publically available information about climate risk, and downscales it to the lot level using a proprietary algorithm.

Here’s an example for a home in Houston, Texas:

Since this has been common, analysts have noticed that the worst-ranked homes for risk are suffering from relative price declines, particularly for homes at risk of flooding. This seems like a natural outcome, the higher the risk of flooding, the more expensive insurance will be, and if you can’t get insurance, the higher the risk of financial loss, and thus there is a reduction of price to compensate. If this was a static situation, then ideally these additional costs/risks would have been built into the historical prices and new prices wouldn’t be any worse affected. However, the situation is not static.

Intense rain events, wild fires, coastal flooding etc. are becoming more common in many places (while air quality issues are decreasing), and so risks to properties are changing over time, and homeowners are finding that they may not be able to sell their home for as much as they expected. That is a (relative) loss to those owners, for something that is not their fault (at least directly). Additionally, lower (relative) prices mean lower (relative) real estate commissions, and thus this has upset the realtor industry as well.

This is actually a big problem

Sympathy for brokers is not high outside of the industry (to say the least), and their struggles are not going to win many hearts or minds, but the bigger issue is much more serious. Climate changes are going to lead to increased future losses not just because of more ‘stuff’ being built (a big factor in increasing historical damages), but also because existing properties are facing more risk.

For example, take a row of houses along the North Carolina dunes, one of which fell into the sea this summer. Sea level there is rising (even more than the global mean), predominantly as a function of human impacts on the climate. Thus, a home built in 1976 that Zillow values at over $400,000 is now actually not worth anything. There are many less extreme examples where rainfall intensity increases are leading to more risks of flooding, or increases in fire weather etc. but the point is that areas of higher hazards are expanding and, objectively, many property values are (relatively) decreasing.

Generally speaking, property value rises and falls are felt by the current owners – they benefit (when they sell) if an area becomes more desirable, or take a loss if the opposite occurs. Public policy can impact this, but mostly society deals with this via changes in property taxes and assessments (in the US at least). The impacts due to climate changes are different though – these are changes that can in fact be blamed on our historical emissions that we have known for decades have been having such an effect.

Previously, it was a situation like pass-the-parcel – whoever was left holding the property when the impact was felt (the flood, the fire, the collapse into the sea) would end up paying for it or, at best, split the losses with their insurance company. The risk factor information is helping spread the costs to the current owners (as well as the future owners), which (I think) is a bit fairer but, of course, the costs are not being borne by the people causing the issue (the fossil fuel companies, the people that used their products etc.). People have also argued that society writ large should cover these losses – that regional or federal governments either through grants or insurance payouts should compensate owners, while others argue that the oil and gas companies should pay.

There is a real issue in how reliable these risk assessments are – if they are wildly different from different companies or approaches, or if the algorithms are proprietary, then it’s possible the impacts from releasing this information will be sub-optimal. But both Florida (h/t Kelly Hereid) (for hurricane damage) and California (wildfires) are leading the way in having public, open source, catastrophe models, and conceivably that could be spread more widely.

In practice, there is going to be a patchwork of different ideas, and different models, but there is no (sensible) answer that is based on ignoring the risks to keep prices artificially high. Even realtors should be able to accept that, and if they want to be compensated for their loss of commissions, they should get in line to sue the people who caused it.

Hydrogen power plants could be the answer to a greener future and a way to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Hydrogen plants are rare, with only four currently producing low-carbon hydrogen in Europe, but a new project, HySynergy, was recently inaugurated in Denmark, according to Tech Xplore.

The plant is powered by solar and wind energy, and it will produce around ""eight tonnes of hydrogen a day in its first phase,"" per Tech Xplore. This hydrogen will then be transported to a nearby refinery and to Germany.

Though this power option has been slow to take off, it presents a real, positive solution to air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels. When hydrogen is burned, it only creates water vapor, rather than the harmful pollutants that are released when burning oil or gas.

The plant will initially produce 20 megawatts of power, with ambitions of producing up to 350 megawatts. This could power up to 315,000 homes for a whole year.

Green hydrogen is one of the most expensive forms of power, due to the large amounts of electricity it uses to produce hydrogen fuel. It is created through electrolysis, where an electrical current is used to separate the hydrogen from oxygen in water. However, as the cost of renewable energy sources drops, the cost of hydrogen should also become more affordable.

There are many exciting advancements in green hydrogen, such as researchers finding a way to make the electrolysis work on seawater as well as freshwater.

Jakob Korsgaard, founder and CEO of Everfuel, which owns 51% of the HySynergy project, said: ""The growth of green hydrogen depends on the political momentum.""

Without sufficient funding from governments and support for renewable energy sources by politicians, many of these expensive projects can't get off the ground.

""The momentum behind hydrogen is strong. In total, 60 governments (including the European Union) have adopted hydrogen strategies,"" the International Energy Agency commented.

""However, faster action is required to create demand for low-emissions hydrogen and unlock investment that can accelerate production scale-up and bring down the costs of technologies for producing and using low-emissions hydrogen.""

The Last Roadhouse: A Glimmer Of The Past In A Rapidly Changing Collin County

Raveling North on State Highway 121 in Collin County, suburbia sprawls, just as it has throughout the rest of North Texas. Rolling farms and ranchlands are now cut and stripped and peppered with subdivisions, restaurants and developments meant to entertain the masses moving in. Small-town schools have grown into 5A megacampuses, with state-of-the-art football stadiums and training facilities that you’d expect in college or the NFL.

This move reflects a shift in strategy and capital allocation.

The reshuffling of Hut 8’s assets has coincided with striking share price volatility. The 1-day share price return recently surged 6.2%, and the 7-day return jumped over 31%. However, the 30-day period saw an 11.2% decline. Still, the stock is up more than 100% year-to-date, and its total shareholder return over the past year stands at 60.6%, suggesting momentum is building around the company’s latest moves and renewed strategic focus.

If you’re eager to expand your search beyond Hut 8, now is a great time to discover .

With such a dramatic stock rally and ongoing strategic changes, the real question is whether Hut 8’s current share price still offers a bargain or if the market is already factoring in the company’s future growth prospects.

Most Popular Narrative: 22.2% Undervalued

Compared to Hut 8's last close price of $45.00, the most closely followed narrative assigns a significantly higher fair value. This highlights a notable mismatch in market expectations versus narrative-driven projections.

The Power First strategy, featuring sizable pipeline origination (10.8 GW under diligence; 3.1 GW under exclusivity) and dual-purpose sites for both Bitcoin mining and AI compute, provides scalability and flexibility to benefit from rising institutional adoption of digital assets and accelerating demand for clean energy-powered blockchain infrastructure. This supports future revenue and earnings growth.

Wondering what numbers are powering such an aggressive valuation? Take a closer look at the rapid-fire revenue expansion and bold margin assumptions beneath the surface. You'll want to see which game-changing metrics and leap-of-faith forecasts are at the heart of this hot take.

Result: Fair Value of $57.87 (UNDERVALUED)

Still, disruptions in Bitcoin prices or delays in converting the development pipeline into revenue could quickly challenge the bullish outlook surrounding Hut 8’s story.

Another View: Looking at Market Ratios

While the narrative-based valuation pitches Hut 8 as markedly undervalued, our look at market price-to-earnings ratios paints a different picture. Hut 8's 23.8x ratio is well below the software industry average of 31.8x, yet it stands dramatically higher than its fair ratio of 7x and even above some peers. This gap suggests that, despite seemingly favorable comparisons, there may be valuation risk if the market reverts closer to the fair ratio over time, especially if growth stalls.

The order requires PJM, working with Constellation Energy, to ensure Units 3 and 4 remain operational and to limit costs to consumers. The Department of Energy said continued electricity production from the units is essential to avoid blackouts during the coming winter months.

“Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is using all tools available to keep the lights on and heat running for the American people,” Wright said. He added that the emergency directive is critical to maintaining affordable and dependable power during periods of high demand.

The two Eddystone units were already operating beyond their planned retirement date due to a previous emergency action issued May 30, 2025, followed by an additional directive on August 28. DOE said the facility played a significant role during heat waves in June and July, when PJM called on the units to help stabilize the grid.

PJM’s region is expected to continue facing “emergency conditions both in the near and long term,” according to DOE. The grid operator set a new winter peak in January 2025, surpassing a record that had stood since 2015.

The order takes effect November 26, 2025, and runs through February 24, 2026.

PJM has repeatedly warned federal regulators and Congress about escalating reliability risks tied to rising electricity demand, slow entry of new generation resources, and accelerating retirements of existing power plants. A February 2023 analysis highlighted concerns about the timing mismatch between retirements and new capacity. In a December 2024 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, PJM reported “substantial increases” in expected load growth and stated its reliability concerns were “increasing at an extraordinary pace.”

During a March 2025 hearing before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana told lawmakers the grid operator faces a “growing resource adequacy concern” affecting a large portion of the country.

Some aren’t quite ready so they leave the queue, but they still ask and expect their place to be saved. Others with vital immediate work to do have no choice but to wait outside the door. In the confusion, no one knows who should really take priority. Delay and uncertainty ensue.

That’s a bit like the way connecting to Britain’s electricity system has been working. Strong, ready-to-go projects are being left behind and waiting a decade to connect as a result.

• Fears grow over surge in electricity demand from data centres

Despite the initial successes of the first-come, first-served approach to grid connections, which helped the early and rapid deployment of renewable power and batteries, there were unintended consequences.

The value of having a connection offer led to more unviable and speculative projects, with no intention to build. Outdated rules meant that for any project, plans had to be made to design and build the pylons, offshore and onshore electricity cables to support them. All at a cost to the consumer.

As a result, the queue has grown tenfold in just five years, and together the projects in it exceed 800GW, four times the generation needed by 2030.

Dormant projects have blocked promising clean energy ventures that are ready to connect and have stood in the way of further clean economic growth across Great Britain. That must change.

By abolishing the first-come, first-served system, we can ensure that the connections process enables what is needed, when it’s needed, where it’s needed. Neso can free up space for shovel-ready wind and solar power, and make room for the data centres and electric vehicle superhubs of the future.

Neso will soon begin informing projects from the previous queue whether they have been moved to a new delivery pipeline. What we’ve been clear about is that not every project can progress in this round.

But Neso and Schroders Greencoat know that clearing the gridlock is essential to giving developers and investors the certainty they need to unlock jobs, develop supply chains and supercharge £40 billion a year of economic growth.

Overhauling the connections process isn’t a panacea. Transmission owners still need to build thousands of kilometres of new electricity cables. Planning reforms must be implemented.

But by putting in place these major changes to how we plug in to the grid, we are taking a big step forwards to help make sure the vast economic potential of Britain’s clean energy transition is realised.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fae271929-5281-4399-a97d-0dc7d28cbcaa.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-30 13:59:57.410263

Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.), opinion contributor, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5626178-antidumping-laws-foreign-threats/,"During my tenure in Congress, I shared many of the president’s grievances with American trade policy and I maintain those views now.
But there is another trade policy area where the Trump administration should focus its energy and pursue reforms to offer relief to American manufacturers.
As this cheating continues, American businesses lose customers and markets to the under-valued foreign products causing harm which can be long-lasting.
Perhaps not surprisingly, China is the biggest violator of U.S. anti-dumping orders, comprising 26 percent of adjudicated cases since 2020.
It is essential that we reinvigorate American manufacturing by enforcing fair competition and President Trump’s trade policies have the potential to do that.","A hallmark of each of President Trump’s terms in office has been his focus on trade issues. He has sought to use the power of the presidency to address perceived imbalances in the benefits of trade with foreign partners, and to put in place policies — led by tariffs — to encourage businesses to reshore and invest in manufacturing in the United States.

During my tenure in Congress, I shared many of the president’s grievances with American trade policy and I maintain those views now. We as a country have been too willing to sit back and accept a shift of production to countries that have lower labor, environmental and other standards, allowing multi-national companies to make increased profits on goods that they sell back to us as imports. Consequently, manufacturing jobs have fallen drastically, industrial investment in the U.S. has dropped, and the communities that rely on these mainstays have experienced economic decline. America lost roughly 5 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2020. I am hopeful that by applying tariffs smartly, President Trump can set in motion a fundamental change in this trend and reinvigorate production and manufacturing in the U.S.

But there is another trade policy area where the Trump administration should focus its energy and pursue reforms to offer relief to American manufacturers. While tariffs are often applied broadly against all imports from specific countries or on a class of imported products, antidumping laws and duties are narrowly applied to address violations of American trade law by specific foreign countries.

When foreign entities are found to be selling their goods in the U.S. at below market value with the intent of undercutting American companies, these duties are applied against those imports to penalize unfair trade practices and even the playing field for domestic producers. Such relief is critical, especially for small and medium-sized manufacturers.

However, even when a petition for relief is successful, foreign companies can find ways to evade the application of the duties. For example, after one American small business prevailed in its anti-dumping claims against European producers, the same products were found being shipped through third-country routes under new product names, seeking to evade Customs and duty payments. As this cheating continues, American businesses lose customers and markets to the under-valued foreign products causing harm which can be long-lasting.

According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the number of anti-dumping (and countervailing duty) cases enforced by the agency increased from 540 in 2020 to 716 in 2024, a 33 percent increase, indicating that these foreign threats continue to grow. Perhaps not surprisingly, China is the biggest violator of U.S. anti-dumping orders, comprising 26 percent of adjudicated cases since 2020. But plenty of developed countries make the list too, with South Korea, India, Japan, and even Italy making the top ten. Despite the breadth of these violations, CBP only collected $2 billion in duty deposits and levied $80 million in penalties for violations in FY24.

The process for filing an anti-dumping claim can be expensive and time consuming. Specialized legal support is often required to help small businesses investigate and file claims, and the adjudication process can take months if not years. Approved anti-dumping claims are then subject to annual reviews, adding to costs and delays in applying duties. Efforts by American businesses to prove violations of dumping laws and evasion of duties require “non-public” information which is difficult and expensive to obtain.

Moving forward, CBP should utilize some of the significant new funding it recently received to better enforce anti-dumping laws and deter and penalize those who seek to evade these laws. The Commerce Department should update its procedures and modernize the process to make it more efficient and effective. Congress should consider changes in law to prevent any U.S. government entity or federal contractor from buying or utilizing imports that are subject to anti-dumping laws. Commerce should establish an ombudsman office to help small and medium-sized American businesses understand and file anti-dumping cases as a means of relief from the legal costs that may otherwise impede them from pursuing these cases.

The agency should also consider expedited procedures for filings and annual reviews, especially for smaller-sized petitioners. Finally, the United States should encourage the World Trade Organization to revise its rules on anti-dumping which have not been updated since the 1990s and are well overdue for reform.

It is essential that we reinvigorate American manufacturing by enforcing fair competition and President Trump’s trade policies have the potential to do that. A key component of those policies, however, must be strengthening the protections that we have in place to punish foreign entities who cheat our trade laws, which will allow American companies and their workers to thrive.

Community energy groups and not-for-profit organisations across NSW can apply for grants up to $600,000 to scale up their work helping households adopt renewable technologies, access incentives and rebates, improve energy efficiency and navigate the transition to cleaner, smarter energy solutions.

Funded projects could include community education workshops, one-on-one energy guidance, adapting existing programs for wider audiences, creating digital tools, staffing local advisory roles and developing marketing or communication campaigns to reach more households. Other innovative projects addressing local energy needs will also be considered.

Professor Ty Christopher, Director of Energy Futures Network at the University of Wollongong’s Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, said this kind of support could supercharge what Illawarra community groups had already been building in the region.

“One thing we’ve seen here in the Illawarra is a terrifically positive group of grassroots organisations such as Electrify 2515, Hi Neighbour and Good for the Gong to increase energy literacy in the community,” he said.

“These community-driven efforts are incredible, but there comes a time, if all this good work is for the benefit of the public, that the government charged with serving that public should help things along. This funding will help with just that.

“Pardon the pun, but more power to them, as they support these community activation efforts not just to kick off, but to build and maintain momentum.”

The program forms part of the NSW Government’s Consumer Energy Strategy, which aims to put households and small businesses at the centre of the state’s clean energy transition.

It also supports early planning for the Illawarra Renewable Energy Zone (REZ), enhancing the capacity of local groups to help residents integrate technologies such as rooftop solar, batteries, energy-efficient appliances and home electrification into the region’s evolving energy system.

Member for Wollongong Paul Scully said the program would position the Illawarra at the forefront of NSW’s clean energy future.

“The Illawarra is at the centre of NSW’s clean industrial future and this program will help the community further embrace renewable energy and prepare to be home to the state’s first urban renewable energy zone,” he said.

“Crucially it will help to better inform everyone in the Illawarra from community groups to businesses and individual households on renewables so we can all work together to lead the way for renewable energy generation in urban areas.”

It comes as the Australian Research Council (ARC) Future Grids Training Centre at the University of Wollongong (UOW) prepares to host the IEEE International Conference on Energy Technologies for Future Grids (ETFG 2025) next month, bringing together global experts to explore the future of clean, reliable and resilient energy systems.

The conference will welcome researchers, policymakers and industry leaders from Australia and around the world to address the challenges and opportunities in transforming Australia’s electricity networks.

In Zaragoza, Spain, a groundbreaking ceremony marked the start of construction on one of Europe’s largest battery factories. Chinese battery maker CATL and automaker Stellantis are launching a €4.1 billion joint project. The site is set to underpin the next phase of the EU’s electric transition, with capacity to supply batteries for up to one million electric cars a year — an output that turns policy targets into production reality.

The gigafactory will focus on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells and, across the lifetime of all units produced, could cut more than 30 million tonnes of CO2. Production is scheduled to begin at the end of 2026. More than 4,000 direct jobs are planned, with thousands more indirectly, a scale likely to jump-start a local supply chain rather than simply add another pin to the map.

The financing, arranged as a second tranche under a mechanism led by Standard Bank, was confirmed last week and now awaits deployment across key industrial markets where energy insecurity continues to restrain growth.

The transaction builds on the first tranche closed in December 2024 as reported by Ecofin Agency, which opened space for additional participation from Norfund, Impact Fund Denmark and the Emerging Africa and Asia Infrastructure Fund in the course of 2025.

These institutions, all focused on climate-aligned investment, have backed CBE on the basis of a business model that removes up-front power infrastructure costs for companies and replaces them with long-term offtake agreements.

The financing momentum accelerated further in July, when the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) approved a US$495 million guarantee to shelter CBE’s assets from currency volatility and transfer restrictions in countries where macroeconomic fluctuations have historically deterred private capital.

CBE’s approach centers on fully financed renewable systems, primarily solar and storage, that industrial clients pay for through consumption rather than capital expenditure. This has been especially appealing to firms in mining, manufacturing and telecommunications, where unpredictable grid supply and high diesel costs erode profit margins.

One of its flagship developments is a 30-megawatt solar-plus-storage unit under construction for the Kamoa-Kakula copper mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. If completed on schedule, it will deliver steady baseload power that reduces shutdown risks, lowers operating costs and curbs emissions in a region where diesel generators remain the fallback for most industrial sites.

The scale of the new debt facility signals that lenders are increasingly willing to back decentralized renewable infrastructure in markets once considered too high-risk. However, the financing gap remains vast. IRENA’s most recent figures show that sub-Saharan Africa received only around 2 percent of global renewable energy investment in 2024, amounting to less than a tenth of what analysts estimate the region requires annually to meet medium-term demand.

Countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Egypt and Morocco continue to draw the bulk of capital, while frontier markets, including parts of West and Central Africa, rely heavily on concessional finance and guarantee structures like the one CBE secured from MIGA.

The implications extend beyond the energy sector. Reliable power is one of the most significant determinants of competitiveness for African industries. The mining sector alone accounts for more than 30 percent of export revenues in countries like Zambia and the DRC, yet outages often push firms to spend as much as 20 percent of operating budgets on alternative power.

In manufacturing hubs such as Nigeria and Ghana, grid instability forces companies to run diesel generators for between 30 and 60 percent of operating hours, inflating production costs and undermining sustainability commitments. Projects financed under CBE’s model have the potential to reverse part of this trend by embedding long-term cost predictability into industrial supply chains.

Africa’s broader energy transition hinges on whether capital can reach commercially viable projects at scale, and whether those projects can demonstrate performance strong enough to pull in more investors. The latest financing round positions CBE among a handful of firms attempting to prove that renewable power in frontier markets is bankable when structured with the right risk protections and operational guarantees.

If the pipeline proceeds as planned, the company’s installations could serve as reference points for lenders assessing similar opportunities across the continent. For now, the US$200 million secured marks a step forward in linking private capital to Africa’s energy needs, offering industrial consumers alternatives to unreliable grids and high-carbon fuels.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/croed-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 14:00:25.566636

The old warehouse strip reborn as the Lee + White development is a popular destination for anyone seeking a bite or a beverage on the Atlanta Beltline’s Westside Trail. But steps from the breweries and eateries inhabiting much of the space, serious science is taking place.

In an industrial space at the complex’s north end, engineers in blue lab coats huddle over circuit boards. Scientists test how certain films and other materials respond to pressure, heat and more. And in a machine shop off the main lab, a computer-controlled machine mills custom components from raw metal.

The space is a hive of activity, one that exudes the spirit of experimentation embodied by its founder, the legendary inventor Lonnie Johnson.

Johnson isn’t a household name like Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham Bell. You’ll be hard-pressed, however, to find a child of the 1990s who isn’t familiar with his most famous invention: the Super Soaker. The ubiquitous water gun has produced an estimated $1 billion in sales over its lifetime.

“Inventing, for me anyway, is looking for a good problem to tackle,” Johnson said.

At 76, the prolific inventor is not done hunting for solutions, and he believes the one his team is refining steps from the Beltline — the Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter, or JTEC — could be his most significant yet.

Johnson and outside experts say the JTEC is a “novel” energy device. It’s not a battery or a fuel cell, and it doesn’t fit neatly into other conventional categories.

What it is, Johnson thinks, is a potential key to unlock a huge power source that’s rarely utilized today: waste heat. At the same time, he thinks it could help humanity slow climate change and meet its seemingly insatiable need for more electricity.

It’s still relatively early days for the company, but Johnson and other JTEC executives think the future is bright — if they can clear the hurdles that come with scaling any first-of-its-kind technology.

Capturing waste heat

A trained nuclear engineer, Johnson served in the Air Force and later worked on NASA’s Galileo mission. A lifelong inventor, he has more than 140 patents to his name and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2022.

Energy issues have been a driving force behind Johnson’s innovations for years. In fact, an “aha” moment working on a more efficient heat pump — a type of home heating and cooling system — is what led to the Super Soaker.

In the late 1980s, while experimenting at home with new nozzles he’d fashioned, he shot a stream of water across his bathroom.

“I thought, you know, a high-performance water gun would be a lot of fun,” Johnson said.

The idea for the JTEC wasn’t quite as spontaneous. It was born about 20 years ago, while Johnson was researching solid state batteries — an intense focus of automakers and other industries to this day.

The JTEC has few moving parts, no combustion and no exhaust. All the work to generate electricity is done by hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe.

Inside the device, pressurized hydrogen gas is separated by a thin, filmlike membrane, with low pressure gas on one side and high pressure gas on the other. The difference in pressure in this “stack” is what drives the hydrogen to compress and expand, creating electricity as it circulates. And unlike a fuel cell, it does not need to be refueled with more hydrogen.

All that’s needed to keep the process going and electricity flowing is a heat source. As it turns out, there are enormous amounts of energy vented or otherwise lost from industrial facilities like power plants, factories, breweries and more.

Between 20% and 50% of all energy used for industrial processes is dumped into the atmosphere and lost as waste heat, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

‘Power … from just about anywhere’

The JTEC works with high temperatures, but the device’s ability to generate electricity efficiently from low-grade heat sources is what company executives are most excited about.

Inside JTEC’s headquarters, engineers show off a demonstration unit that can power lights and a sound system with water that’s roughly 200 degrees Fahrenheit — below the boiling point and barely warm enough to brew a cup of tea, said Julian Bell, JTEC’s vice president of engineering.

Comas Haynes, a research engineer at the Georgia Tech Research Institute specializing in thermal and hydrogen system designs, agrees the company could “hit a sweet spot” if it can capitalize on lower temperature heat. Haynes is not affiliated with JTEC.

For Johnson, the potential application he’s most excited about lies beneath our feet.

Geothermal energy exists naturally in rocks and water beneath the Earth’s surface at various depths. Tapping into that resource through abandoned oil and gas wells — a well-known access point for underground heat — offers another opportunity.

“You don’t need batteries and you can draw power when you need it from just about anywhere,” Johnson said.

Right now, the company is building its first commercial JTEC unit, which is set to be deployed early next year. Mike McQuary, JTEC’s CEO and the former president of the pioneering internet service provider MindSpring, said he couldn’t reveal the customer, but said it’s a “major Southeast utility company.”

“Crossing that bridge where you have commercial customers that believe in it and will pay for it is important,” McQuary said.

‘Horse race’

The challenge for JTEC, as for all startups, is whether the company can control costs as it scales its product.

It took decades for renewables like wind and solar to bend their respective cost curves to compete with fossil fuels. McQuary said the company can’t wait that long, and its focus now is on sourcing the specialized materials it needs, while it works to drive down cost.

Haynes from Georgia Tech said he’s “generally optimistic” about the JTEC, especially if it can find ways to put low-quality heat to good use.

“The lower the temperature it can accommodate, the more novel it will be,” he said.

On top of some initial seed money, the company brought in $30 million in a Series A funding in 2022 — money that allowed the company to move to its Lee + White headquarters and hire more than 30 engineers. McQuary said it expects to begin another round of fundraising soon.

Johnson, meanwhile, hasn’t stopped working on new inventions.

He continues to refine the design for his solid-state battery — the one that spawned the JTEC. Solid-state batteries have long been considered the “holy grail” for battery makers, offering more range in electric vehicles, shorter charging times and improved safety.

Watching his battery venture progress alongside JTEC has been like a “horse race,” Johnson said. He’s still not sure which one will cross the finish line first.

“I‘ve got teams for both technologies now,” Johnson said. “Sometimes, one is ahead of the other in getting to commercialization … but it’s fun watching them solving their own problems in their individual space.”

A Bloomberg report on Saturday claimed China, citing Goldman Sachs economists, is squeezing developing nations by dominating both low- and high-tech manufacturing. The article bluntly characterizes China's strategy as a ""beggar-thy-neighbor"" threat to the global economy.

Dressed up in the language of data and economics, this narrative is less a neutral assessment and more a repackaged version of the old ""China manufacturing threat"" storyline.

Its political intent is hard to miss: to recast China not only as a challenger to the US and Europe, but also as a spoiler of other developing countries' prospects - thereby justifying a broader coalition in support of decoupling policies against Beijing.

For years, parts of the Western commentariat have relied on zero-sum thinking to explain China's rise.

A decade ago, the refrain was that China had ""stolen American blue-collar jobs."" Today, the script has been updated: China is now supposedly ""stealing"" Africa's industrialization, Southeast Asia's export growth and Latin America's development space.

The claim that ""China is crowding out other developing countries"" is simply another layer of rhetorical wrapping around a broader strategy of ""de-risking from China.""

The problem is that this story does not hold up against the facts. In recent years, Chinese outward direct investment and industrial cooperation have expanded rapidly. Chinese companies have established industrial parks and production bases in Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico, Egypt, Ethiopia and many other countries, bringing not just capital and equipment, but also technology, management expertise, and, crucially, jobs.

Across Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Chinese-built railways, ports, power plants and telecom networks are providing critical infrastructure that many countries had long lacked.

The statement that China is ""taking its industries abroad"" is much more accurate than saying it is ""clinging to low-end manufacturing at home.""

Key segments of Chinese-linked industrial chains are being reconfigured across borders. Many emerging economies are actively drawing on elements of China's development experience to upgrade their own manufacturing. Through this kind of chain extension, developing countries can plug into global production networks more quickly by leveraging Chinese capacity, while also exporting more in complementary sectors. That is a pathway to faster industrialization, not a roadblock.

This is what the West is most worried about: The development of manufacturing in more developing countries will ultimately shake the West's dominance in more fields.

It is not a result of Chinese competition, but of the long-standing division of labor dominated by advanced economies and the resurgence of protectionism in the West. For decades, a small group of rich countries has controlled key technologies, standards and financial rules, keeping high-value, high-margin activities at home while offloading labor-intensive and resource-intensive segments abroad. Many developing economies have been stuck at the bottom of global value chains as a result.

Now, under the banners of ""national security"" and ""de-risking,"" the US and some of its allies are erecting new tariff and technology barriers, championing ""friendshoring"" and building ""small yards and high fences"" to restructure supply chains in ways that explicitly sideline China and, in practice, also limit the policy autonomy of many Global South countries. Western efforts to ""contain China"" are increasingly being projected into the wider developing world, seeking to weaken trade and industrial ties between these countries and China. That is what a genuine beggar-thy-neighbor strategy looks like - and it is a more credible explanation of who has historically taken the ""jobs and opportunities"" of the developing world.

China, by contrast, has sought to offer an alternative through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Global Development Initiative - built on principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. This approach does not pretend that there are no interests at stake; instead, it recognizes that sustainable cooperation is in all parties' long-term interest and that development rights should be more equally shared.

China's development has never been an isolated success story. It has unfolded alongside, and increasingly in partnership with, the broader developing world. Sharing opportunities, supporting partners and contributing to global growth through concrete actions, not slogans, is the strongest possible response to any ""China threat"" narrative.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-11-30/87be9e0f-cf7b-49cc-be46-b930bfb4ee1b.jpeg,N,,2025-11-30 14:01:13.000745

The region has seen the government advancing initiatives to grow the wind power sector, and through the new deal with Nordex, the Irish wind power market is set to become a dominant force in the region’s energy market.

Wind power projects have become immensely popular in Europe

Several European nations have revived their wind power ambitions in recent years amid calls to diversify the global energy market. Wind power’s potential to deliver large-scale energy projects is commendable, add to that the clean energy and emission reduction properties, and one questions why more nations are not turning to the wind sector.

The climate in Europe is perfect for wind power projects, almost as if the region were designed to make use of the wind that is a constant feature, especially in places like Ireland. The government has been fostering investments in wind power, with Nordex playing a vital role in supplying wind turbines for the UK energy market in recent years.

Nordex will supply up to 12 wind turbines for the Irish wind project

The German wind turbine manufacturer has an immensely impressive portfolio in the wind sector, providing turbines for a litany of projects not only in Europe, but further afield as well. Nordex will supply 12 N133/4.8 wind turbines at the Drumnahough Wind Farm in Donegal, Ireland, continuing its presence in the UK energy market for many years to come.

The Drumnahough project is just the latest in a long relationship between SSE and Nordex

The new Drumnahough project is just the latest for the long-standing relationship between SSE Renewables and Nordex, with the German manufacturer already supplying 29 turbines for the 101MW Yellow River wind farm in Offaly, Ireland. Additionally, the pair of companies recently announced a new order for wind turbines for a wind project in Spain.

“We’re pleased to have been awarded the contract to manufacture and install turbines for the Drumnahough Wind Farm – another important milestone in Ireland’s renewable energy journey. With the N133’s suitability for high wind locations and our long-term service commitment, at Nordex, we’re proud to continue to deliver as a trusted, dependable partner in the Irish onshore sector.” – Jason Welch, Managing Director UK & Ireland at the Nordex Group

Nordex will not only construct and install the 12 wind turbines at the Drumnahough project, but will also continue to provide substantial maintenance for the project as part of a long-term Premium Service agreement. The company has become the backbone of the international wind sector, and recently received an order for wind turbines for a wind project in Germany, exemplifying the company’s expertise in turbine manufacturing.

Once construction has been completed and the Drumnahough project is operational, it will potentially provide enough electricity to cover the power consumption of around 40,000 homes.

X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC, a developer of advanced nuclear reactor and fuel technologies, announced it has closed an oversubscribed Series D financing round of approximately $700 million led by Jane Street. X-energy expects to utilize proceeds from the round to help continue the expansion of its supply chain and commercial pipeline. (TRISO fuel element. Image: X-Energy)

Additional new investors include ARK Invest, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, XTX Ventures and various others, as well as existing investors including Ares Management funds, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, NGP, Segra Capital Management and others.

Prior Funding Supports Current Development Efforts

X Energy, LLC in April 2024 awarded a $148.5 million tax credit for the construction by its wholly-owned subsidiary, TRISO-X LLC an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility, TX-1, in Oak Ridge, TN. Funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the award is part of the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit program jointly administered by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and the Internal Revenue Service.

In addition to ARDP funding, the U.S. Department of Energy also awarded X-energy $9 million in 2018 to support the initial design of the company’s fuel fabrication facility that later evolved into TX-1.

TRISO-X anticipates regulatory approval from the NRC by May 2026 and recently received approval from the Department to spend an additional $30 million to secure long-lead procurement items to adhere to the overall project schedule.

In October 2024 X-Energy Reactor Company, LLC announced a Series C-1 financing round of approximately $500 million, anchored by Amazon.com, Inc. Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation (Ares), NGP, and the University of Michigan join Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund in the financing round.

The investment will help meet growing energy demands by funding the completion of X-energy’s reactor design and licensing as well as the first phase of its TRISO-X fuel fabrication facility.

X-energy and Amazon plan to establish and standardize a deployment and financing model to develop projects in partnership with infrastructure and utility partners. The investment includes manufacturing capacity to develop the SMR equipment to support more than five gigawatts of new nuclear energy projects utilizing X-energy’s technology.

The efforts will help meet growing energy demands in key locations through direct project investments and long-term power purchase agreements to help power Amazon operations.

Order Book Pipeline

X- Energy has plans to build four of its 80 MW HTGR design SMRs at the DOW Seadrift Operations manufacturing site located on the Texas Gulf Coast. X-energy has received updates from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the construction permit application for the initial deployment of the Xe-100 advanced reactor. The proposed project is being developed by The Dow Chemical Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Long Mott Energy LLC.

Citing the completeness and quality of the application, and the effectiveness of pre-application engagements, the NRC published an 18-month review timeline for the Texas Gulf Coast project and will concurrently proceed with its environmental assessment. Since 2018, X-energy has led and participated in extensive pre-application engagements with NRC staff on the Xe-100 design, TRISO-X fuel, and topical reports covering numerous aspects of the company’s technology

Another deal is to build up to five and as many as 12 of the SMRs for Amazon at a site adjacent to the Columbia Generating Station in Washington by the end of the 2030s. The reactor is operated by Energy Northwest. The utility has signed an MOU to operate the SMRs once they are built.

In Washington, Amazon’s agreement with Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, will enable the development of four advanced SMRs. The reactors will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest, and are expected to generate 320 MW of capacity for the first phase of the project, with the option to increase to 960 MW total.

Additionally, X-energy is partnered with British multinational energy and services company Centrica to deploy 6 GW in the United Kingdom. The project includes plans to build up to 12 of the 80 MW HTGR SMRs. Centrica will provide initial project capital for development with the goal of initiating full-scale activities in 2026.

Subject to regulatory approval in the U.K., the first electricity generation would be expected in the mid-2030s. Centrica and X-energy are in discussions with additional potential equity partners, as well as leading global engineering and construction companies, with the goal of establishing a UK-based development company to develop this first and subsequent projects.

Fuel Fabrication Plant Under Construction in Oak Ridge, TN

X-energy is building an advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, TN, to manufacture its proprietary TRISO-X fuel. Earlier this month X-energy announced the start of vertical construction for its $300 million TX-1 fuel fabrication facility. The facility will manufacture the company’s proprietary TRISO fuel for its commercial reactors.

Located within the Horizon Center Industrial Park, the 110-acre TRISO-X campus is situated on land that was formerly part of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was part of a tract released in 1996 for private development to help diversify the region’s economic base. TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.

TX-1 will be the first of two facilities planned for the site to fabricate the company’s ceramic fuel designed to withstand extreme temperatures and retain fission products under all reactor conditions.

The fuel will be enriched to 19.5% U235. TRISO-X utilizes more energy dense high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) that allows for longer periods of operation. X-Energy manufacturs a proprietary product to enrure supply and quality control.

The group will start building the shell of the 214,812 square foot facility at the Oak Ridge site that will be used to fabricate 700,000 TRISO fuel pebbles each year, which is enough fuel for 11 Xe-100 small modular reactors. X-Energy said full employment at the plant will be 500 people.

TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.

First Allocation of HALEU from DOE

In April 2025 X-energy and its wholly owned subsidiary TRISO-X LLC announced an allocation of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy’s HALEU Allocation Program.

“This first allocation is a critical step forward to bridge the HALEU availability gap in the nuclear supply chain with existing material,” said TRISO-X president Joel Duling.

“Coupled with the HALEU Availability Program and other efforts, we expect the commercial sector to further bridge the availability gap to support the delivery and scalability of the advanced reactor fleet.”

The allocation is part of X-energy’s participation in DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program and will be delivered in the first core loads of fuel in partnership with Dow Inc. at their UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site.

The two companies recently announced the submission of a construction permit application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the proposed Xe-100 plant at Seadrift, with the potential to begin construction later this decade and start up early next decade.

X-Energy TRISO Fuel Irradiation Testing Underway at INL

Pebbles of TRISO-X fuel have begun 13 months of irradiation testing at Idaho National Laboratory to evaluate fuel performance across operating scenarios and qualify them for commercial use. Over a 13-month trial, the experiments will evaluate fuel performance under different power levels, temperatures and burnup scenarios, which are essential for meeting Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards for commercial use in advanced reactors, including X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor. Once testing is complete, post-irradiation examination will begin at INL and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Vattenfall Invests $42 Million in New Nuclear for Sweden

Up to five small modular reactors being planned for existing Ringhals site

(NucNet) Swedish state-owned power company Vattenfall and the industrial consortium Industrikraft have signed an agreement for joint investment and collaboration that will enable the next steps in a project to deploy new nuclear power in Sweden.

Vattenfall said in a statement that Industrikraft will become a 20% shareholder in the nuclear project company Videberg Kraft and invest $42 million in the project.

Vattenfall and Industrikraft, formed in June 2024 to support the expansion of Swedish non-fossil fuel electricity supply, will work on the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) at Vattenfall’s existing Ringhals nuclear site on the Värö Peninsula, southwest Sweden.

The agreement covers project management and selection of technologies. Vattenfall said Swedish technology has a role to play in driving the development of a strong supplier cluster in Europe.

In August Vattenfall said it will proceed with US-based GE Vernova (GEV) and British company Rolls-Royce SMR as it looks to choose a potential supplier for new nuclear power plants next to Ringhals.

Vattenfall said at the time final investment decisions will be made “later in the process”.

It said both companies offer SMRs with proven technology and simplified designs that have integrated learnings from previous nuclear projects worldwide. Both use fuel for which Vattenfall has established supply chains.

GEV’s technology is the 300-MW BWRX-300. Construction of the first BWRX-300 unit is underway at Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington nuclear site near Toronto in Canada.

Rolls-Royce SMR is developing a 470-MW unit. The company has been selected by the British government as the preferred bidder to develop SMRs for the UK.

Vattenfall is planning a project with either five BWRX-300 plants for a total capacity of 1,500 MW or three Rolls-Royce SMR plants for 1,410 MW.

The company also said it is already looking at the next step to build an additional 1,000 MW of SMR capacity at the Ringhals site, where two large-scale reactors are in operation and two have been permanently shut down.

The company said building a series of smaller units as opposed to single, large-scale reactors, brings clear cost advantages. SMRs require less space, need significantly fewer personnel, and lead to more manageable logistics.

Dutch Government Prepares To Build Four New Nuclear Reactors

The incoming Dutch government has backed plans to more than triple the funds earmarked for the expansion of the nuclear sector. This plan would bring the total planned investments in the nuclear sector up from $4.9 billion to $15.2 billion, marking a significant increase in funding.

The Dutch government has started the assessment process for two new nuclear projects, with Borssele and Eemshaven being designated as possible locations for the new nuclear facilities. The government said its involvement in the nuclear plans is preferable to private sector investment due to the uncertain nature of nuclear projects including schedule and cost issues.

In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new 1,000 MW+ nuclear units.

The government said the units should be deployed by 2035, each have a capacity of between 1,000 MW and 1,650 MW, and use Generation III+ reactor technology.

Earlier this year, the Dutch government established the Nuclear Energy Organization Netherlands (NEO NL) to facilitate the construction of the planned new nuclear power plants, marking a long-term involvement and commitment from the state. The new organization will be responsible for the entire process of developing the nation’s nuclear new reactors.

The government said it is considering two nuclear facilities to include small modular reactors, or SMRs, as they are significantly cheaper to construct, install, and operate than a larger conventional nuclear reactor. This would be a first for the European continent, as it has no small modular reactors in operation in the EU.

Japan Will Offer Loans to Finance Nuclear Power Projects

Government-backed loans would work with private investment as Tokyo backs reactors

(NucNet) Japan will introduce a loan support program to aid public investment in nuclear power plants and major transmission projects. The news was confirmed by the Tokyo-based industry group the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF), which said that under the plan loans would be provided through the government’s Organization for Cross-Regional Coordination of Transmission Operators.

The loans would be granted as co-financing agreements between private institutions and the state, with the government recognizing its part in supporting the development of nuclear power projects.

JAIF said that Japan had been encouraged to follow the path of other governments which provide loan guarantees and other public investment to ensure that nuclear projects were viable and spread the risk more equitably.

At a press conference Ryosei Akazaka, Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), said, “With electricity demand expected to grow, we will take a hard look at whether private financing alone is sufficient for large-scale investments in decarbonized power sources and transmission networks.”

“We intend to deepen discussions on institutional frameworks and legal amendments that make effective use of the government’s creditworthiness.”

Japan’s new prime minister Sanae Takaechi has publicly supported the revival of nuclear power, with the aim of reducing the country’s reliance on fuel imports.

At present, 14 of the country’s 33 commercially available nuclear power plants have been restarted following the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The government plans to restart additional reactors and finish several that were under construction at the time of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Asian Development Bank to Invest in Nuclear Energy

The multilateral development bank has amended its energy policy, paving the way for it to support developing member countries that choose to pursue nuclear power.

(WNN & IAEA) The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a new agreement on 11/25/25 to strengthen cooperation in support of countries across Asia and the Pacific that are exploring nuclear energy as part of their long-term energy and development strategies. Discussions will include identifying potential projects for collaboration, including those involving small modular reactors.

The agreement was signed by the IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi and the ADB President Masato Kanda in Manila, Philippines at a meeting of the the ADB’s Board of Directors. The Board revised its energy policy to support nuclear power, including investment measures for the first time as a pathway for decarbonization.

As part of the new policy, it has signed an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to cooperate in supporting countries in Asia and the Pacific who are exploring nuclear energy as part of their energy and development strategies.

The Asian Development Bank’s move to consider funding nuclear energy projects follows a similar one between the IAEA and the World Bank earlier this year.

Asian Development Bank (ADB) President Masato Kanda said: “These changes further enhance ADB’s ability to support countries in Asia and the Pacific as they work to meet their rapidly growing energy needs. Nuclear power, for example, is an important technology option for countries looking for reliable alternatives to baseload electricity.”

“With ADB’s updated energy policy recognizing nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels for baseload generation, this agreement ensures that developing member countries choosing this path do so with robust safeguards, strong governance and a clear commitment to sustainability.”

IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, who attended the announcement with Kanda, said, “As ADB opens the door to financing nuclear power, we will move quickly to identify practical areas of collaboration that respond to rising energy needs of countries across the region … our teams will now begin shaping concrete initiatives that deliver reliable, low-carbon energy and strengthen resilience for millions of people.”

“It further broadens that international momentum, strengthening support for countries that are turning to nuclear energy to enhance energy access, security and resilience”.

The memorandum of understanding with the IAEA will see the two “collaborate to build knowledge and technical capacity across the full nuclear life cycle. Key areas of cooperation include energy planning, the management of nuclear fuel cycles and radioactive waste, and nuclear facilities’ life-cycle management. The IAEA will also support informed decision-making by providing guidance on safety, security, safeguards, and stakeholder engagement.”

Founded in 1966 and owned by 69 member states, including 50 from the region, ADB committed $3.8 billion to energy projects in 2024. It says it aims to support “inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth across Asia and the Pacific.”

General Atomics Completes Concept for New Fast Reactor Design

The fast modular reactor (FMR) design is one of three early-stage concept projects the Department of Energy supported under its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

General Atomics has demonstrated feasibility of their fast modular reactor (FMR) design through various modeling and lab-scale tests to verify the performance of key safety systems, fuel, and operations — allowing the firm to start maturing the technology to a preliminary design phase for potential demonstration in the 2030s. Completed work also included the fabrication of sample fuel rods that match the design intended for use in the FMR.

The company is developing a gas-cooled modular reactor that can be made in factories and assembled on-site to deliver 44 MW as little as 0.2 acres of land.

The reactor is designed to pair with an air-cooling system for potential deployment in remote or arid locations and runs on silicon carbide-wrapped high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel that can withstand temperatures twice as high as fuel claddings currently used in light-water reactors.

The FMR’s conceptual design work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy through an Advanced Reactor Concepts 2020 (ARC-20) award, part of the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

Funding supported General Atomics’ strategic partnerships with other companies, academia and national laboratories to successfully verify the technical feasibility of the FMR design, helping to progress the advanced reactor design in its early phase.

Dr. Christina Back, Vice President of General Atomics said, “The ARC-20 program has supported critical advances in the gas-cooled fast reactor concept and demonstration of robust materials that enable an added layer of safety, while still enabling operation without the need for a water source. These features facilitate siting and compatibility for small communities and diverse applications, including the recycling of used nuclear fuel.”

What’s Next?

General Atomics has submitted their Principal Design Criteria and the Quality Assurance Plan Description licensing documents to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The NRC also docketed several pre-application FMR documents that will be referenced in the future license application when General Atomics submits future formal licensing documents.

The proposed Fast Modular Reactor (FMR) is designed to generate 44 megawatts of firm electricity. The system utilizes silicon carbide-wrapped high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.

With the completion of the conceptual design, General Atomics is moving to the preliminary design phase. Future planned activities include safety-related testing, and work to further develop fuel, materials, and power conversion system components. Work will lead to the final design phase, which will include construction, non-nuclear tests, and receiving HALEU for fuel fabrication.

The prototypes of the FMR fuel rods fabricated during the conceptual design process are undergoing irradiation testing at Idaho National Laboratory to experimentally verify their integrity.

This technology, referred to as SiGA, utilizes a silicon carbide composite material intended to form the basis of fuel rods capable of withstanding temperatures exceeding the limits of currently used materials. The multilayer composite cladding structure is designed to provide high-temperature resilience for both current and future reactor systems.

Westinghouse And Google Partner Using AI To Speed Up Nuclear Construction

Early pilot of technology shows significant time and cost savings

(NucNet) Westinghouse announced a partnership with Google Cloud to develop a custom AI-powered platform using specialized models that help optimize and accelerate the construction of nuclear power plants. Google said in a statement that early pilots of the platform have shown significant time and cost savings. The companies are also exploring ways for AI to help enhance nuclear operations and safety.

The core AI innovation targets the construction process, which historically represent 60% of reactor costs. Until recently, construction management relied on spreadsheets and paper documents, leading to delays that cascaded across thousands of interdependent tasks. Westinghouse turned decades of documentation to its advantage by loading them into an AI application.

The new AI system combines the companies’ AI models and prediction tools with Westinghouse’s WNEXUS, a 3D digital twin of its reactors. When combined with current and historic data, the system can predict bottlenecks, optimize construction task sequences, adjust staffing levels and account for external factors like supply chain constraints.

The optimization technology for new reactor construction is built using a “technology brick approach”, said Lou Martinez Sancho, Westinghouse’s chief technology officer and executive vice-president of R&D and innovation. He added that this means the technology has applications far beyond the initial project.

Google’s AI tools are being applied to reduce licensing processes and operations timing. By finding the fastest path through maintenance and refuelling tasks, the AI helps minimize reactor downtime.

Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner has stressed that AI-driven decision-making optimization is essential to making nuclear power a viable investment for utilities and addressing energy urgency.

The company has already established its own proprietary AI infrastructure, Hive, designed specifically to meet the nuclear sector’s stringent regulatory and export-control frameworks. It also developed Bertha, a generative AI assistant that instantly accesses 75 years of nuclear knowledge and documentation at Westinghouse. The firm said that early use of the AI tools showed positive results in terms of reducing construction costs.

Google has increasingly looked towards nuclear energy as a key power source for its operations. In October, the company signed a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement with NextEra Energy to offtake power from its 615MW Duane Arnold Energy Center in Palo, Iowa. The agreement will support restarting the plant, which has been shuttered since 2020.

Raiford Smith, Google Cloud’s global director of Power & Energy, noted that energy now “underpins economic growth, data-center expansion and 24/7 carbon-free goals.”

Google has signed several nuclear energy deals. These include a 200 MW PPA with Commonwealth Fusion Systems for fusion power, a 50 MW PPA with SMR reactor firm Kairos Power, and a strategic agreement with Elementl Power to develop three nuclear energy projects in the US. The location and timing of these projects are still to be determined.",https://neutronbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/x-energy-triso-fuel_thumb.png,N,,2025-11-30 12:00:59.149004

Europe’s energy transition is largely powered by Chinese technology.
The gap is even starker in R&D, where the U.S. outinvested Europe by nearly €120 billion in 2023.
Chronic underinvestment, overregulation, deindustrialization, and fragmentation have left Europe’s defense industrial base too small, too slow, and incapable of meeting its security needs.
The world’s economic center of gravity has long since shifted away from Europe and the Atlantic toward the Indo-Pacific.","“Nothing grows in the shadow of great trees,” said the sculptor Constantin Brâncuși when he left his master, Rodin. He wasn’t rebelling for rebellion’s sake; he was claiming the space to become himself. He spoke of art, but he might as well have been speaking of today’s Europe.

Europe has long mistaken comfort for strength. Under the protective shelter of the United States, it outsourced its own defense, convinced that diplomacy and regulatory power could substitute for hard power. Under the seductive efficiency of China’s manufacturing engine, it outsourced its industrial backbone, trusting that access to cheap technology and components would last forever. And under the lure of Russian energy, it outsourced its security, mistaking abundant gas and oil for lasting leverage.

Europe’s energy transition is largely powered by Chinese technology. Over 98 percent of imported solar panels come from China, which also dominates the rare earth and magnet industry—controlling roughly 70 percent of global mine production, 90 percent of refining, and 94 percent of permanent magnet manufacturing. These materials are critical for everything from renewable energy to EVs and high-tech devices.

Europe is barely in the game when it comes to artificial intelligence, a competition dominated by two giants. In 2024, U.S.-based institutions produced forty notable AI models, compared with China’s fifteen and Europe’s three. The continent also relies heavily on major American companies for digital infrastructure and cloud services, as recent disruptions from an AWS server outage have shown. It has no hyperscalers of its own.

Moreover, red tape is choking tech development. The Draghi report mentions that the bloc has roughly 100 tech-focused laws and more than 270 regulators overseeing digital networks across all member states.

Defense isn’t much better. Reliance on the U.S. has hollowed out Europe’s capabilities, as the war in Ukraine has shown. Defense spending sits at just 1.9% of GDP in 2024. The gap is even starker in R&D, where the U.S. outinvested Europe by nearly €120 billion in 2023. The problem is not a shortage of know-how but of scale and strategic vision. Chronic underinvestment, overregulation, deindustrialization, and fragmentation have left Europe’s defense industrial base too small, too slow, and incapable of meeting its security needs.

The world’s economic center of gravity has long since shifted away from Europe and the Atlantic toward the Indo-Pacific. Home to more than half the planet’s population, nearly two-thirds of global GDP growth, and the world’s busiest trade routes, that region now anchors global security and prosperity.

Once, Venice was a great power. But when the center of gravity moved from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, it failed to adapt and ended up as a city living off tourism and relics. Europe risks the same fate through a slow “Venetization” of its own. Unless it awakens, it too will become an open-air museum of its own past glories.

For as long as the Atlantic system dominated, Europe’s internal weaknesses—its fragmented market, sluggish productivity, sprawling bureaucracy, and energy dependence—remained hidden. But under the current geopolitical realities, those weaknesses are no longer manageable.

If Europe’s leaders fail to think strategically and in global competitive terms, the continent will fall even further behind. The pressure from Washington, particularly under Donald Trump, may be self-serving, but it also acts as a wake-up call. Europe can no longer afford to depend on others for its defense. The long shadow of the United States, especially since the end of the Cold War, has atrophied Europe’s strategic muscles and discouraged the growth of a competitive defense industry.

Economic dependence breeds political timidity. A continent that relies on others for its energy, technology, and critical resources cannot claim real independence. As Mario Draghi warned, Europe’s maze of regulations, fragmented markets, and chronic underinvestment are stifling its ability to compete. Europe survived every storm since the Cold War, but it lets others decide which way the wind blows.

Europe must take tough decisions. That means making choices that often seem politically impossible within the short cycles of national politics: pooling defense capabilities, building genuine capital markets, investing jointly in next-generation technologies, and accepting that sovereignty shared among Europeans is stronger than sovereignty borrowed from others.

Europe now needs a new “whatever it takes” moment, not to save its currency, but to save its future. It must find the courage to think and act on its own terms, to grow and compete on its own strength rather than rely on others for protection, power, or purpose.

Constantin Brâncuși left Auguste Rodin’s studio despite his admiration for the master. Europe now faces the same moment of truth. It is more a question of will rather than means. It can either cling to a fading shelter, protected, supplied, and slowly diminished, or step into the light and learn to stand on its own. Stepping into the light does not mean turning its back on its allies, but standing tall beside them.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/european-union.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:01:02.343241

The European continent has been embracing the renewable energy market with open arms in recent years, with Italy serving the global hydrogen demand that has emerged over the past few years. The all-new decade-long agreement between the two companies sets the stage for a long and prosperous project in Italy.

Italy’s Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project is reaching a new milestone

The renewable energy sector has been growing at an astonishing rate in recent years as more nations around the world finally accept the realization that the generational reliance on fossil fuel-based energy production needs to come to an end. Climate change has become so severe that it has devastated numerous regions of the world, so something needs to change. Up steps hydrogen power to save the day, hopefully.

To combat climate change, several nations are turning to the renewable energy market to decarbonize their energy markets. In that regard, Italy is progressing in its plans to develop the Hydrogen Valley Rosignano Project by enabling Solvay and Sapio to enter into a 10-year deal to develop renewable hydrogen for the project, marking a turning point in the European hydrogen dream.

Solvay’s Rosignano site is set to receive significant support from Sapio’s solar expertise

The new agreement calls for Solvay to construct a new 5 MW electrolysis plant, while Solvay will install a 10 MW solar photovoltaic system to provide the site with the required power. With the expected completion date set for mid-2026, the project is expected to produce approximately 756 tonnes of renewable hydrogen, marking a 15% reduction in CO₂ emissions at the site.

The new project was officially launched in November this year

At a groundbreaking ceremony attended by the most prominent officials in the Italian energy sector, the energy firms highlighted the importance the project will play in Italy’s clean energy transition and emission reduction ambitions. Italy has been working exceedingly hard in recent years to fast-track any projects that may enable the energy transition to renewable power.

The green hydrogen produced on-site will supply Solvay’s peroxide manufacturing operations, which serve a multitude of sectors across the world. The partnership exemplifies the cooperative nature of the global energy market as nations aim to boost investments in the renewable energy market. Europe’s positive sentiment for renewable energy projects has become all too evident in recent months.

“Our partnership with Sapio represents a good example in how we enhance our global peroxide operations. This project is a key part of our broader strategy to support essential industries – from electronics and water treatment to energy and food safety – with more sustainable solutions. – Carlos Silveira, President of Solvay Peroxides’ business

Building on the statement from Solvay’s leadership, Sapio’s CEO noted that “We are extremely proud of our collaboration with Solvay: this project, funded by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP).”

“There is a demand pull that gives investors optimism,” said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, which seeks an expansion of nuclear power.
Its effort to license a new form of nuclear energy technology failed during the Biden administration.
“You would get acute radiation syndrome,” said Nick Touran, a nuclear reactor physicist, who called Valar out on X.
There are people who are building nuclear reactors on time, on budget in the world today.”","The fledgling Texas company Fermi America has yet to produce an electron, split an atom or survive the torturous gantlet of regulatory and manufacturing obstacles required to build a nuclear reactor.

But investors are betting big that the Trump administration will help Fermi turn from a glossy, aspirational marketing brochure into a cutting-edge nuclear operation to meet the rapacious energy needs of AI data centers. So much so that they catapulted its founders into the ranks of the world’s richest men a few months after Fermi filed paperwork with regulators to build the “Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and Intelligence Campus.”

Typically, a company’s revenue, track record and market advantage drive valuations. But in the age of President Donald Trump’s promised nuclear revival, shareholders and backers see connections to the White House as the road to profitability, investment analysts and longtime industry insiders say.

Fermi was founded by three men: Rick Perry, who served as Texas governor and was U.S. energy secretary during Trump’s first term; Perry’s investor son; and the son of a former Texas congressman celebrated by the right when he founded an “anti-woke” bank that later failed.

“If you or I launched the same business, our valuation would be zero,” said Raphaëlle d’Ornano, whose firm Decoding Discontinuity advises investors on AI-related start-ups.

Fermi’s corporate blueprint, d’Ornano said, essentially signals to investors “we have no proven execution capabilities in this field but what we do have is a team of politically connected people who make us believe attaining the needed regulatory clearance should not be too much of a problem.”

Fermi is not an outlier. Other Trump-connected companies with untested business plans are brimming with cash infusions and winning regulators’ favor.

They include the advanced reactor developer Oklo, where Energy Secretary Chris Wright was a board member; General Matter, a uranium enrichment start-up where former Trump megadonor and adviser Peter Thiel is a board director and funder; and Valar Atomics, a small California reactor company backed by major Trump donor Palmer Luckey and Shyam Sankar, the chief technology officer of Palantir Technologies, a firm closely aligned with the White House. Some of the companies are leapfrogging past far more seasoned firms.

“They assume there is something shiny, new and fancy just waiting for a Steve Jobs of nuclear,” said Chris Keefer, co-founder of Canadians for Nuclear Energy. “It is creating valuations that are probably wildly out of touch with what these companies are capable of.”

Energy Department officials said nuclear approvals are subject to rigorous regulatory review. They referred questions about the firms’ political connections to the White House, which declined to answer them.

These firms are far from the only ones working on advances in nuclear power. BWXT, a longtime military contractor, is developing new small commercial reactors. Industry leader Westinghouse recently signed an $80 billion deal with the Trump administration to build large legacy reactors across the nation. Even relative newcomer TerraPower, an advanced reactor firm founded by Bill Gates, is further along than other start-ups, having broken ground for a commercial plant in Wyoming.

Some in the industry say investor excitement makes sense as dozens of new firms compete to meet AI’s exploding need for power.

“There is a demand pull that gives investors optimism,” said Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute, which seeks an expansion of nuclear power. “The market sees companies close to the administration as having the best chance for success, as would be the case in any administration.”

The start-ups chafe at the characterization that they’re merely trading on connections.

“Ask the world’s leading investors and potential customers who watch our site via satellite, and they will tell you they marvel at what we’ve already accomplished,” Fermi CEO Toby Neugebauer, son of former congressman Randy Neugebauer, R-Texas, said in an interview.

Neugebauer, a GOP megadonor who lives in a home styled after the White House, is referring to a large patch of land near Amarillo where the company hopes to have reactors operating by 2032, a timeline experts say is unheard of, and has already started building gas plants to generate additional power.

He said he has hired highly accomplished nuclear executives and argued that some of the nation’s most complicated energy undertakings were launched by small groups of entrepreneurs.

The combined net worth on paper of Toby Neugebauer and his father – a major investor in Fermi – surged to $5 billion when he and the Perrys took their company public nine months after forming it. Griffin Perry, the son of the former Texas governor, saw his net worth grow to $2 billion, according to Forbes. Their fortunes have since fluctuated with the stock price.

Oklo is another darling of Wall Street speculators, despite zero revenue and no licensed reactors. Its effort to license a new form of nuclear energy technology failed during the Biden administration.

After Trump invited Oklo co-founder Jacob DeWitte to join him in the Oval Office for the signing of executive orders boosting companies developing advanced reactors, the firm’s stock surged.

Oklo, with its 188 employees, at times last month was valued higher than industry powerhouse BWXT, a nearly 10,000-employee company that has sold hundreds of reactors to the military over many decades.

DeWitte and co-founder Caroline DeWitte, his wife, are also on the Forbes list of billionaires now. The couple cashed out $90 million in Oklo stock this year, cementing some of those paper gains.

“If we look at all of Oklo’s insider activities, there is little to no purchasing of stock,” said Michael Seely, an industry consultant who advises investors on nuclear firms. “It is all selling, at somewhat regular intervals. If you were confident the company will succeed, you would not be doing that.”

DeWitte said in an interview that the stock sales were scheduled before the firm’s valuation surged, as part of the couple’s plan to unload a set amount of shares at fixed times. He said investors value firms like his higher than legacy government contractors because Oklo is oriented toward solutions for energy needed for AI data centers.

BWXT, he said, “doesn’t necessarily have the same pace and rate of growth opportunity that I think investors are expecting and seeing from groups, like us, that are facing a lot more towards the AI side.”

BWXT does not agree. “BWXT has built an unmatched reputation in the nuclear industry through delivery, including the production of fuel and components for more than 420 nuclear reactors,” Joe Miller, who leads its government operations, said in an email.

Wright has forfeited his interest in Oklo and, according to DOE, recuses himself from decisions involving the company. But Oklo’s White House ties remain strong: Interior Secretary Doug Burgum traveled to Idaho Falls in September to help Oklo break ground for a pilot plant.

The Trump administration has fast-tracked some start-ups that are cagey about technologies or reviving designs that sputtered previously.

The uranium enrichment company General Matter has not even disclosed which process it would use to enrich uranium. Yet, after its April public launch, the firm won a valuable federal land lease in Paducah, Kentucky, where enrichment took place during the Cold War. Company officials say they briefed regulators on their technology but do not share that information publicly “due to security concerns,” an unusual position in the industry.

General Matter has yet to build anything but is now thought by company officials and competitors to be a front-runner to receive subsidies valued at as much as $900 million to construct enrichment operations, over competing bids by established firms that have already completed large-scale projects.

General Matter CEO Scott Nolan was one of only three nuclear executives, along with Oklo’s DeWitte and the CEO of Constellation Energy, invited to join Trump in the Oval Office when he signed executive orders in May and hailed a nuclear “renaissance.”

Newcomer Valar Atomics, where company leaders wear “Make Nuclear Great Again” hats, is partnering with DOE and Utah to build a test reactor there. It was selected, along with Oklo, for a federal program to help companies make fuel needed for next-generation reactors.

Valar’s 26-year-old CEO, Isaiah Taylor, was the subject of a July feature in the American Conservative, where he praised the current administration and attacked earlier energy policy as being driven by the left’s misguided climate obsessions. Three years ago, he wrote on LinkedIn that he was destined to build several multibillion-dollar companies.

Valar declares on a company webpage that “holding the spent fuel from [its] system for five minutes gives the equivalent radiation exposure to receiving a CAT scan.” Nuclear engineers were appalled by his claims.

“You would get acute radiation syndrome,” said Nick Touran, a nuclear reactor physicist, who called Valar out on X. “You would have a fatal dose within seconds. The gamma rays kill enough of your cells – white blood cells first – that your body loses ability to have an immune system and you would die a quite painful death in a couple of weeks.”

Taylor released company data to back the safety claim, but other engineers said it only bolstered Touran’s criticism. Taylor promised further explanation in a post on X, but it never came. Valar did not respond to requests for comment.

DOE said in its statement that all the firms selected for its pilot reactor program, including Valar, passed rigorous safety reviews.

Longtime nuclear proponents are bewildered to see firms that publicly have shared only vague safety plans and engineering blueprints getting expedited approvals.

Keefer, the Canadian nuclear energy advocate, warned that investors in these firms risk a major reckoning. Oklo, for instance, is trying to make commercially viable a new type of reactor that Keefer said even the government of China, with its advantages in nuclear energy, has struggled to make pencil out despite 15 years of effort.

In fact, during the Biden administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission found a similar Oklo reactor plan inadequate.

“It’s not like the NRC asks for an extraordinary amount of information,” said a former nuclear official who was involved in reviewing Oklo’s failed application and spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing their work in the industry. “The NRC asks three questions: What is the worst that can happen, what are the systems, structures and components in your reactor that prevents that from happening, and how do you know that?”

“Oklo would only answer them at a very high level,” the person said. “They wanted to say nothing bad can happen to our reactor.”

DeWitte said Oklo had planned a robust public rebuttal but claims that at the time, NRC officials “threatened us, in a retributional way, not to issue a response letter to correct the record.”

“Well, they’re gone now,” he added.

Scott Burnell, an NRC spokesman, did not respond to the allegation. In an email, he referred to the agency’s official denial letter and said the agency is working with Oklo on a new application.

DeWitte argues the company is well positioned to demonstrate that its test reactor is capable of creating electricity as soon as next summer. But he acknowledged building turnkey reactors that can produce sustained, uninterrupted electricity could take years longer.

The Trump administration is working to help companies such as Oklo succeed by changing safety reviews in ways that unnerve many safety advocates.

Some of the independent agency’s traditional safety reviews for projects such as Oklo’s reactor will be handled instead by the Energy Department, which is led by political appointees. The NRC and the administration signed an agreement in October saying that safety “risks that have already been addressed in DOE review” will not be revisited by the NRC.

Burnell said in his email that if DOE “thoroughly tests a reactor design and shows it operates safely, the NRC will build on that work, not repeat it.”

Even so, several conservative states have joined Valar and other nuclear start-ups in suing the NRC, arguing that the federal agency has overstepped its authority by regulating smaller nuclear reactors the companies claim are inherently safe. The plaintiffs say licensing for such plants should be left to the states. The agency declined to comment on the lawsuit.

For its part, Fermi argues it can build the same type of reactors already operating across the country – but do it exponentially cheaper and faster. Since modern safety standards were established in the 1970s, even the most experienced developers have not met anything close to Fermi’s timeline to have a reactor turned on by 2032.

The last such reactors were seven years behind schedule and $7 billion over budget by the time they went online in Georgia in 2023. South Carolina utilities burned through $9 billion before scrapping a similar project, and executives involved were later convicted of making false promises to investors.

Skeptics caution that Fermi could be destined for the same fate as Neugebauer’s last buzzy start-up, Glorifi. The bank, which promoted credit cards made out of bullet casings and homeowner’s insurance discounts for gun owners, went bankrupt and landed in the “Museum of Failure,” a traveling collection of entrepreneurial “failures and mistakes.”

Household-battery startup Base Power Inc. raised $1 billion to expand its energy-storage business and build a manufacturing plant in Texas.

The Series C funding round led by venture capital firm Addition included other existing investors such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Altimeter, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Base Power, co-founded by entrepreneur Zach Dell, will use the proceeds to boost energy-storage production.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” Chief Operating Officer Justin Lopas said. “This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second.”

Battery companies are expanding in the US as the need to support the nation’s aging power grid grows amid rising electricity demand from data centers and widening electrification of the economy.

Base installs residential backup power systems at a fraction of the cost of traditional natural gas- or propane-fueled generators. Under Dell’s business model, the batteries are charged when local electricity prices are low.

But during high-demand periods, such as heat waves or cold snaps, Base can tap a portion of those stored electrons to capture price differentials while ensuring each homeowner retains ample spare electricity to avoid power blips or blackouts.

The new facility will enable Base to “build our own hardware to meet surging demand and scale nationwide,” Dell wrote in a post on X. “This is a key step in putting a battery on every home in the country.”

“This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills?
“I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.” Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs.","As loyal Republicans, Reece Payton said that he and his family of cattle ranchers in Hogansville, Ga., had one thing on their minds when they cast their ballots in November for the state’s utility board — “to make a statement.”

They were already irked by their escalating electric bills, not to mention an extra $50 a month levied by their local utility to cover a new nuclear power plant more than 200 miles away. But after they heard a data center might be built next to their Logos Ranch, about 60 miles southwest of Atlanta, they had enough of Republicans who seemed far too receptive to the interests of the booming artificial intelligence industry.

“That’s the first time I ever voted Democrat,” Mr. Payton, 58, said.

Message sent.

In some of Georgia’s reddest and most rural counties, Republicans crossed party lines this month and helped propel two Democrats, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, to landslide upsets, ousting the incumbent candidates on the Georgia Public Service Commission. No Democrat has served on the five-person commission, which regulates utilities and helps set climate and energy policy, since 2007.

Across the country, Democrats have seized on rising anxiety over electricity costs and data centers in what could be a template for the 2026 midterm elections.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger pledged during her campaign to lower energy bills and make data centers pay more. In the House of Delegates, one Democratic challenger unseated a Republican incumbent by focusing on curbing the proliferation of data centers in Loudoun County and the exurbs of the nation’s capital.

In New Jersey, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill promised to declare a state of emergency on utility costs and freeze rates. And in Memphis, State Representative Justin J. Pearson, who is challenging Representative Steve Cohen in a high-profile Democratic primary next year, has vowed to fight a supercomputer by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI, that would be located in a predominantly Black neighborhood.

Strong opposition by citizens forced the Tucson City Council in August to pull the plug on an Amazon data center slated for that Arizona city, and then in September forced Google to call off one in Indianapolis.

“Electricity is the new price of eggs,” said Charles Hua, executive director of Powerlines, a nonpartisan organization which aims to modernize utility regulations and reduce power bills. “This is a defining moment for politicians of all stripes — what’s your answer to lowering utility bills? Because I think consumers and voters are looking for leadership on this.”

After meeting recently with Virginia legislators, Mr. Hua said he was struck by how “the nexus of data centers and utility bills actually came up very consistently.”

In 2022, a spike in natural gas prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine fueled a rise in energy costs around the U.S. Utilities have also undertaken costly projects to modernize the power grid and improve the infrastructure to guard against extreme weather and absorb an anticipated surge in demand from data centers.

As the price of electricity has risen, more American customers have fallen behind on their utility bills, or have had their power cut off.

Georgia ranks 35th in energy affordability, in part because of cost overruns and delays associated with its new Plant Vogtle nuclear generators in Waynesboro, according to the American Legislative Exchange Council, an influential conservative policy group.

So it wasn’t a surprise when Attorney General Chris Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — candidates in the Republican primary to succeed term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp — called November’s results a referendum on affordability. “You’re a fool if you don’t recognize that,” Mr. Carr said.

Some Georgia Republicans have cautioned against reading too much into the 25-percentage-point losses suffered by the utility board incumbents, Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson.

This year’s elections stemmed from a 2020 federal lawsuit, which contended that the statewide elections for commission seats, which represent geographic districts, were unfair to Black voters. An appeals court eventually ruled against the plaintiffs, but the legal battle delayed the elections — setting the stage for November’s two races, the only statewide ones this year. (Two more utility seats will be contested in 2026.)

Democratic turnout was also boosted, Republicans said, by municipal elections in strongholds like Atlanta.

“I think it’s a complete anomaly,” State Senator Greg Dolezal said at a Republican event in Valdosta to tout his candidacy for lieutenant governor next year. Noting the comfortable margins racked up by President Trump in 2024 and Mr. Kemp in 2022, he added, “There’s no planet on which a 65-35 split is representative.”

One plaintiff in the lawsuit was Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters. She said the lawsuit enabled advocacy groups to develop a plan to help people “connect the dots” between the bills they were receiving and the commission’s role in approving six rate increases for Georgia Power, the state’s largest electric provider, over the last two years.

The group’s political action fund spent $2.3 million, sending half a million texts, plastering 92 billboards across the state and producing an anti-incumbent website.

That outreach made a difference, she said, pointing to Lowndes and Brooks counties on the Florida border. In previous races for federal and state offices going back to 2018, including the public service commission, Republicans won there by 20 points.

This year, Mr. Echols and Mr. Johnson each lost by 20 points.

At a weekly food pantry run by South Street Care House in Valdosta, Ga., where dozens of cars had lined up to receive a box full of fresh fruits, vegetables, breads and other staples, several people said they had heard about the election through texts and social media.

Barbara Lehman, 66, is typically a reliable Republican, but not this time, according to her daughter Angela and granddaughter Shelby, who were among those waiting for food.

“If the power companies want to expand their business, then that should be on them, not the consumer,” Ms. Lehman said in a text message. “Some people are just barely making it as it is.”

At the event attended by Mr. Dolezal and two other candidates for statewide offices, Gary McMillan, a former chair of the Lowndes County Republican Party, said that he, too, knew Republicans who bucked the party.

“They said my electric bills keep going up, and Republicans control the public service commission, and I’ve got a problem with that,” Mr. McMillan recounted. “I told all of them, elect a Democrat, and your bills will go up some more.”

Data centers have been a prominent issue in Atlanta’s rural exurbs. Mr. Trump wants to accelerate their growth in the battle for A.I. supremacy. At least 26 are under construction within 60 miles of Atlanta, and another 52 are planned.

But some Georgia Republicans — including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is resigning her seat in January — have questioned the facilities’ use of resources. Some residents say local wells have been damaged, and the cost of municipal water has climbed.

Good Jobs First, a liberal group that tracks tax breaks for corporations, has said the state has done a poor job disclosing subsidies for data centers. The public service commission’s own staff has also warned that monthly residential bills could climb by $20 a month or more (a figure disputed by the utility) if the commission approves Georgia Power’s proposal to add almost 10,000 megawatts of power to accommodate data centers — the equivalent of nine nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.

Only one-third of that proposal should be approved, the staff recommended.

In Troup County on the Alabama border, the victorious Democratic utility candidates whittled 24-point romps enjoyed by the Republican candidates in 2020 and 2018 down to 10, thanks to voters like the Paytons.

The Paytons had never been to a Hogansville City Council meeting before they heard about a proposal to build a data center on 437 acres next to their ranch, and across from their Georgia Untamed Zoo, which houses animals like sloths and capybaras and is popular with school field trips. Now they’ve been to two, and counting.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw/00nat-electricity-politics-data-lvpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:02:14.379985

This agreement intends to strengthen federal-provincial collaboration in the energy sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, utilize Alberta’s energy resources, and create more careers for Canadians.

Per a Nov. 27 press release, Canada and Alberta will collaborate on multiple projects to build Canada’s economy and meet growing energy demands. It will advance the construction of Pathways Plus, reportedly the world’s largest carbon capture, utilisation, and storage project.

The agreement centres around a new pipeline to the British Columbia coast. The MOU states that upon receipt of a proposal from the Government of Alberta, the Government of Canada will provide an approval process under the Building Canada Act for the construction to be financed and constructed by the private sector, with Indigenous Peoples’ ownership and benefits. The pipeline would reportedly transport at least one million barrels per day to Asian markets as a priority.

“In the face of global trade shifts and profound uncertainty, Canada and Alberta are striking a new partnership to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more independent Albertan and Canadian economy. We will make Canada an energy superpower, drive down our emissions and diversify our export markets. We want to build big things, and we’re building bigger and faster together,” said Carney.

The MOU advances multiple clean energy projects including an industrial carbon pricing agreement for the province and an agreement to lower methane emissions by 75% over the next decade. Additional initiatives intend to enable Alberta to build nuclear power generation, reinforce the electricity grid to power AI data centres, and build large transmission interties with British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

The federal government states that these projects will only be built in consultation and partnership with Indigenous rights-holders and British Columbia. They will reportedly create opportunities for Indigenous co-ownership, partnership, and economic benefits.

Balcony solar panels are now widespread in countries such as Germany – where more than 1m homes have them – but have until now been stymied in the US by state regulations.
A further five states could join the rush in the next few months, according to Kevin Chou, executive director of Bright Saver, a non-profit that champions the adoption of balcony solar panels.
The panels themselves are smaller than standard rooftop panels and can be zip-tied in place without professional installation.
In Utah, state legislator Raymond Ward was intrigued after reading about balcony solar and realized a minor adjustment to the law would allow Utahns to purchase the technology.","Acquiring solar panels at home can be an expensive hassle for people in the US. But small, simple, plug-in solar panels for use on balconies are soon to become available for millions of Americans, with advocates hoping the technology will quickly go mainstream.

Earlier this year, Utah became the first state in the country to pass legislation allowing people to purchase and install small, portable solar panels that plug into a standard wall socket.

When attached outside to the balcony or patio of a dwelling, such panels can provide enough power for residents to run free of charge, home appliances such as fridges, dishwashers, washing machines and wi-fi without spending money on electricity from the grid.

Balcony solar panels are now widespread in countries such as Germany – where more than 1m homes have them – but have until now been stymied in the US by state regulations. This is set to change, with lawmakers in New York and Pennsylvania filing bills to join Utah in adopting permission for the panels, with Vermont, Maryland and New Hampshire set to follow suit soon.

“Plug-in solar is a powerful tool to deliver enhanced energy independence and affordability to millions of New Yorkers who are currently shut out of the solar economy,” said Liz Krueger, a New York state senator who has sponsored a bill to allow balcony solar.

Krueger said that her tweak to state law will be “a gamechanger for renters, low-income New Yorkers, and many others who can’t install rooftop solar”.

A further five states could join the rush in the next few months, according to Kevin Chou, executive director of Bright Saver, a non-profit that champions the adoption of balcony solar panels.

“There’s now so much interest in this,” said Chou. “The federal administration has been so negative to clean energy that people have thought ‘OK what can we do at the state level?’ and this has been one of those things.

“There’s real momentum behind this now. In states where electricity is more expensive, in particular, I think we will see market forces really carry this far.”

As with solar panels that are attached to a building’s roof, or arrayed in fields, balcony solar soaks up the sun, albeit on a smaller scale. It then feeds this clean energy, via an inverter, into the wall socket. The panels themselves are smaller than standard rooftop panels and can be zip-tied in place without professional installation.

They sell for the equivalent of about $300 in Germany, with more expensive versions for $1,500 and upwards, that include some battery storage that can continue to feed in solar power to the home once the sun has vanished for the day.

All of this power is sufficient to run most home appliances for free, although it isn’t enough for larger family homes that have substantial air conditioning units or require charging for an electric vehicle.

“If you’re a single person living at home it can power all of your needs, but not for a family of six,” said Chou. “This isn’t a silver bullet or anything, it could maybe knock 5% off emissions. But it is an easy thing to do, it’s convenient and it can save people money. At the moment, there aren’t many wins happening for the climate and this can be one.”

A major barrier to balcony solar, though, has been the regulatory system across states, which typically requires anyone who installs solar panels to strike an agreement with the local utility for the power they are feeding back to the grid.

The installation of panels also typically has to be done by contractors and is inspected. This regime, plus inconsistent federal and state incentives for solar, means that only about 7% of US homes have rooftop solar, far less than some other countries. In Australia, for example, more than one in three households have rooftop solar.

In Utah, state legislator Raymond Ward was intrigued after reading about balcony solar and realized a minor adjustment to the law would allow Utahns to purchase the technology. His legislation carved out an exemption from interconnection agreements for people generating 1.2 kilowatt of power or less.

“The state law said that if you put any power back on the grid, even one electron, you need a contract with the utility, which is just crazy,” said Ward, who is a Republican.

“No one opposed the change. I fully expect 10 other legislatures in 2026 will run a bill like this, and more and more people will become interested in this. It will definitely happen.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/997e791ece5cc1681d149264ea11d93783969b69/898_0_4650_3721/master/4650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac0018441a7808c443a8b98f6e1d928b",N,,2025-11-30 10:02:18.629125

Allying With Nvidia Mr. Sacks opened the door of the White House to Silicon Valley leaders.
Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang, who had not met before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, forged a tight bond this spring, said three people familiar with the men, who were not authorized to discuss their interactions.
The Sacks Portfolio The White House has praised Mr. Sacks, saying he minimized his financial conflicts of interest.
Mr. Sacks opened the event by describing his White House experience as “incredible” and hailing the administration’s work on A.I.","In July, David Sacks, one of the Trump administration’s top technology officials, beamed as he strode onstage at a neoclassical auditorium just blocks from the White House. He had convened top government officials and Silicon Valley executives for a forum on the booming business of artificial intelligence.

The guest of honor was President Trump, who unveiled an “A.I. Action Plan” that was drafted in part by Mr. Sacks, a longtime venture capitalist. In a nearly hourlong speech, Mr. Trump declared that A.I. was “one of the most important technological revolutions in the history of the world.” Then he picked up his pen and signed executive orders to fast-track the industry.

Almost everyone in the high-powered audience — which included the chief executives of the chipmakers Nvidia and AMD, as well as Mr. Sacks’s tech friends, colleagues and business partners — were poised to profit from Mr. Trump’s directives.

Among the winners was Mr. Sacks himself.

Since January, Mr. Sacks, 53, has occupied one of the most advantageous moonlighting roles in the federal government, influencing policy for Silicon Valley in Washington while simultaneously working in Silicon Valley as an investor. Among his actions as the White House’s artificial intelligence and crypto czar:

Mr. Sacks has offered astonishing White House access to his tech industry compatriots and pushed to eliminate government obstacles facing A.I. companies. That has set up giants like Nvidia to reap an estimate of as much as $200 billion in new sales.

Mr. Sacks has recommended A.I. policies that have sometimes run counter to national security recommendations, alarming some of his White House colleagues and raising questions about his priorities.

Mr. Sacks has positioned himself to personally benefit. He has 708 tech investments, including at least 449 stakes in companies with ties to artificial intelligence that could be aided directly or indirectly by his policies, according to a New York Times analysis of his financial disclosures.

His public filings designate 438 of his tech investments as software or hardware companies, even though the firms promote themselves as A.I. enterprises, offer A.I. services or have A.I. in their names, The Times found.

Mr. Sacks has raised the profile of his weekly podcast, “All-In,” through his government role, and expanded its business.

No event better illustrates Mr. Sacks’s ethical complexities and how his intertwined interests have come together than the July A.I. summit. Mr. Sacks initially planned for the forum to be hosted by “All-In,” which he leads with other tech investors. “All-In” asked potential sponsors to each pay it $1 million for access to a private reception and other events at the summit “bringing together President Donald Trump and leading A.I. innovators,” according to a proposal viewed by The Times.

The plan so worried some officials that Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, intervened to prevent “All-In"" from serving as the sole host of the forum, two people with knowledge of the episode said.

Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump and a critic of Silicon Valley billionaires, said Mr. Sacks was a quintessential example of ethical conflicts in an administration where “the tech bros are out of control.”

“They are leading the White House down the road to perdition with this ascendant technocratic oligarchy,” he said.

Mr. Sacks has been allowed to serve in government while working in private industry because he is a “special government employee,” a title the White House typically confers on experts who temporarily advise the government. He is not paid for his work for the administration.

But Mr. Sacks stands out as a special government employee because of his hundreds of investments in tech companies, which can benefit from policies that he influences. His public ethics filings, which are based on self-reported information, do not disclose the value of those remaining stakes in crypto and A.I.-related companies. They also omit when he sold assets he said he would divest, making it difficult to determine whether his government service has netted him profits.

A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, said Mr. Sacks had addressed potential conflicts. His insights were “an invaluable asset for President Trump’s agenda of cementing American technology dominance,” she said.

Jessica Hoffman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sacks, said that “this conflict of interest narrative is false.” Mr. Sacks has complied with special government employee rules and the Office of Government Ethics determined that he should sell investments in certain types of A.I. companies but not others, she said. His government role has cost him, not benefited him, she added.

At a White House dinner for tech executives in September, Mr. Sacks said he was grateful to work in both technology and government. It was “a great honor to have a foot in each one of these worlds,” he said.

‘David’s House’

Mr. Sacks’s road to the White House began in Silicon Valley.

He arrived in the tech heartland in 1990 as an undergraduate at Stanford University, where he met fellow students including Peter Thiel. Mr. Sacks later joined Mr. Thiel at a start-up that became the electronic payments firm PayPal, alongside Elon Musk.

After eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion in 2002, the men invested in one another. Mr. Sacks helped fund Mr. Musk’s rocket company, SpaceX, as well as Palantir, the data analysis firm co-founded by Mr. Thiel. In turn, Mr. Thiel backed Yammer, Mr. Sacks’s business communications start-up that was sold to Microsoft in 2012 for $1.2 billion.

In 2017, Mr. Sacks began Craft Ventures, a firm that has invested in hundreds of start-ups, including some owned by his friends. He also started the “All-In” podcast three years later with friends and fellow investors Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya and David Friedberg.

Mr. Sacks became a major player in Republican politics in 2022, when he donated $1 million to a super PAC supporting the Senate run of JD Vance, a former tech investor who worked for Mr. Thiel.

Last year, Mr. Sacks hosted a $12 million fund-raiser for Mr. Trump at his San Francisco mansion. The dinner made an impression on the presidential candidate.

“I love David’s house,” Mr. Trump said on “All-In” two weeks later. “What a house.”

After the election, Mr. Trump’s team asked Mr. Sacks to join the administration. He said he would, as long as he could continue working at Craft — and got his wish.

“It’s exactly what I requested,” Mr. Sacks said of his dual position in December.

Allying With Nvidia

Mr. Sacks opened the door of the White House to Silicon Valley leaders. Among the most prominent visitors was Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive.

Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang, who had not met before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, forged a tight bond this spring, said three people familiar with the men, who were not authorized to discuss their interactions.

Both stood to benefit. Mr. Huang, 62, wanted government clearance to sell Nvidia’s highly coveted A.I. chips around the world, despite security concerns that the components could bolster China’s economy and military. Mr. Huang argued that restricting exports of Nvidia’s chips would push Chinese companies to develop more powerful alternatives. And spreading Nvidia’s technology would expand the A.I. industry, aiding the A.I. investments owned by Mr. Sacks and his friends.

In White House meetings, Mr. Sacks echoed Mr. Huang’s ideas that the best way to beat China would be to flood the world with American technology. Mr. Sacks worked to eliminate Biden-era restrictions on Nvidia and other American chip companies’ sales to foreign countries. He also opposed rules that would have made it difficult for foreign companies to buy U.S. chips for international data centers, five people with knowledge of the White House discussions said.

Free of those restrictions, Mr. Sacks flew to the Middle East in May and struck a deal to send 500,000 American A.I. chips — mostly from Nvidia — to the United Arab Emirates. The large number alarmed some White House officials, who feared that China, an ally of the Emirates, would gain access to the technology, these people said.

Ms. Hoffman said Mr. Sacks developed his thinking by talking to many people, not just Mr. Huang, and “wants the entire American tech stack to win.” None of his holdings benefited from the Emirates deal, she said.

Mylene Mangalindan, an Nvidia spokeswoman, said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was the company’s primary contact for A.I. chip sales abroad.

Mr. Sacks trumpeted the Emirati deal on “All-In” in May. “I would define winning as the whole world consolidates around the American A.I.” companies, he said.

There was one last obstacle to that goal: removing a U.S. ban on direct chip sales to China.

In the White House, Mr. Sacks promoted the idea that the ban inadvertently helped China by diverting chip sales to Huawei, a Chinese rival to Nvidia, four people familiar with the discussions said.

In July, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Huang took their argument to an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump. Before the meeting ended, Mr. Trump cleared Nvidia to sell its chips to China.

The Sacks Portfolio

The White House has praised Mr. Sacks, saying he minimized his financial conflicts of interest.

The ethics waivers that Mr. Sacks received said he and Craft Ventures had sold more than $200 million in crypto positions, including investments in Bitcoin, and were divesting stakes in A.I.-related companies including Meta, Amazon and xAI.

Mr. Sacks had started or completed sales of “over 99 percent” of his “holdings in companies that could potentially raise a conflict of interest concern,” the White House said.

Ms. Huston, the White House spokeswoman, said Mr. Sacks was “recused from participating in any matters that could affect his financial interests until he was able to divest of conflicting interests or until he received a waiver.”

But Mr. Sacks’s waivers provide an incomplete picture of his wealth and do not say when he sold his holdings in Meta, Amazon and other companies.

What is clear is that Mr. Sacks, directly or through Craft, has retained 20 crypto and 449 A.I.-related investments, according to The Times analysis.

Of the A.I.-related investments, 11 were designated in one waiver as “A.I. Interests.” The other 438 were classified as software or hardware makers, even though they promote A.I. offerings or services on their websites. In one example, the waiver categorized Palantir as “software as a service,” while the company’s website says it provides “A.I.-Powered Automation for Every Decision.” Forty-one of the companies have A.I. in their names, such as Resemble.AI and CrewAI.

In one of the waivers, the White House said many of the software companies “do not currently use A.I.-related applications in their core business in any material way,” but added that “many of them are likely to at some point in the future.”

Policies that Mr. Sacks supported at the White House have laid the groundwork for his investments to flourish.

The A.I. Action Plan promoted domestic production of autonomous drones and other A.I. inventions for the Pentagon. Mr. Sacks has stakes in defense tech start-ups such as Anduril, Firestorm Labs and Swarm Aero that make drones and other products, according to his filings. In September, Anduril announced a $159 million contract with the U.S. Army to build a new type of night vision goggles with A.I.

Shannon Prior, an Anduril spokeswoman, said the company had a relationship with the Army before the A.I. Action Plan and that it received the contract because its founder, Palmer Luckey, is “the world’s best virtual reality headset designer.” Ms. Hoffman said it was an “obvious idea” to include the military use of A.I. in the policy plan.

This spring, Mr. Sacks also backed a bill called the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant price of $1. Mr. Sacks promoted the legislation on CNBC and worked to advance it through Congress.

After the bill passed in July, Mr. Sacks called it “historic” and “momentous” on “All-In.” It is poised to significantly expand the stablecoin business.

One of Craft’s crypto investments is BitGo, a company that works with issuers of stablecoins. BitGo celebrated the GENIUS Act on its website and promptly capitalized, declaring that its service “fit perfectly” with the new guidelines. “The wait is over,” the site said.

In September, BitGo filed for an initial public offering. Craft owns 7.8 percent of the company, according to financial filings, which would be worth more than $130 million at BitGo’s 2023 valuation.

BitGo declined to comment. Ms. Hoffman said the GENIUS Act’s passage “contained no specific benefit for BitGo.”

Since Mr. Sacks joined the White House, A.I. companies have continued to announce new investments from Craft. In July, Vultron, a start-up that develops A.I. software for government contractors, celebrated $22 million in new financing and heralded the contribution of “Craft Ventures, co-founded by White House A.I. adviser David Sacks.”

The funding was secured before Mr. Sacks joined the administration, said Mac Liu, Vultron’s chief executive. “We mentioned David in the announcement because he’s a big name in A.I.,” he said.

Mr. Sacks remains on the board of Glue, a start-up that he helped found that offers an A.I.-assisted chat platform. In October, Glue announced $20 million in new funding, including from Craft.

Mr. Sacks had left corporate boards before joining the Trump administration, but stayed on Glue’s because “it was allowed,” Ms. Hoffman said. The funding was completed last year, she said. Glue did not respond to a request for comment.

Going ‘All-In’

In an “All-In” episode in March, two of the podcasts’ hosts, Mr. Friedberg and Mr. Palihapitiya, stood outside the East Wing.

They had been “running around” the White House, Mr. Palihapitiya said, as the show spliced in photos of them walking through wainscoted rooms and joining Mr. Sacks in the portico dividing the East and West Wings.

The podcasters then interviewed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about economic policy. Days later, they returned with a nearly two-hour interview with Mr. Lutnick. Two months after that, they interviewed the secretaries of agriculture and the interior. In September, “All-In” posted a video of a private Oval Office tour with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Sacks’s government work has boosted the profile of the podcast, which is downloaded 6 million times a month. Its annual conference in Los Angeles generated roughly $21 million in ticket sales this year, up from $15 million last year, based on its $7,500 ticket price and public attendance estimates. In June, the podcast introduced a $1,200 “All-In”-branded tequila.

Mr. Sacks has forgone A.I. and crypto-related revenues, such as from sponsorships, but can share in sales from tequila and event tickets, Ms. Hoffman said. Jon Haile, the podcast’s chief executive, did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Sacks’s personal business and policy work came together at the July A.I. event in Washington, which he tapped “All-In” to host.

But Ms. Wiles, the White House chief of staff, did not want the administration to appear to endorse the “All-In” brand, two people with knowledge of the summit said. They said she called for the addition of a co-host. Mr. Sacks went to the organizers of the Hill and Valley Forum, an annual conference for tech and government officials, Ms. Hoffman said.

Visa and the New York Stock Exchange sponsored the A.I. summit. The organizers declined to disclose what the companies paid. Ms. Hoffman said “All-In” lost money hosting the event, and that “no V.I.P. reception occurred.” The New York Stock Exchange declined to comment, and Visa did not respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Sacks opened the event by describing his White House experience as “incredible” and hailing the administration’s work on A.I. and crypto. Then he handed off hosting duties to his “All-In” partners, who interviewed Mr. Huang of Nvidia and White House officials onstage.

In the keynote speech, Mr. Trump described Mr. Sacks as “great” before signing executive orders to speed the building of data centers and exports of A.I systems.

Then he handed Mr. Sacks the presidential pen.

,EVs,2025-11-30 12:17:25+00:00,The Mercury News,California's popular EV carpool lane decal program ends Monday: $490 tickets for violators,"Paul Rogers, progers@bayareanewsgroup.com",,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/11/30/californias-popular-ev-carpool-lane-decal-program-ends-monday-490-tickets-for-violators/,"The CHP says it will begin writing tickets for solo EV drivers who are in carpool lanes during restricted times from here on out.
For the past 25 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles.
Owners of electric vehicles say they are disappointed by the loss of the solo carpool lane access.
Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027.
As of August, there were 511,877 active EV carpool stickers in California, according to DMV spokesman Jonathan Groveman.","Bad news, electric vehicle owners. Starting Monday morning, one of California’s longest-running incentives for people to buy electric cars — a program that provided access to carpool lanes regardless of how many people are in a zero-emission vehicle — is coming to end.

The Clean Air Vehicle decal program expired Oct. 1, after Republican leaders in Congress and the Trump administration declined to reauthorize the federal law that allowed it.

Two months ago, the California Highway Patrol gave motorists across the state a 60-day grace period until Dec. 1. That’s Monday. The CHP says it will begin writing tickets for solo EV drivers who are in carpool lanes during restricted times from here on out.

“Starting Monday it will be an enforceable violation,” said Sgt. Andrew Barclay, a CHP spokesman. “Officers have discretion on every stop they make. But the important thing to remember at this point is that you can now be cited for a violation of HOV lane rules even if you have the sticker.”

A violation ticket for driving solo in carpool lanes in California, also known as diamond lanes, or high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, is a minimum $490 fine.

The colorful “Clean Air Vehicle” stickers have given drivers of Teslas, Priuses, Leafs, Rivians and other electric vehicles privileges to cruise along carpool lanes during commute times on congested roads like Highway 101 in Silicon Valley, 880 in the East Bay or the 405 freeway in Los Angeles.

For the past 25 years, federal law has allowed states to decide whether they want to grant carpool-lane access to electric vehicles. The original idea was to provide incentives to sell the vehicles, which reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But under the most recent version of the federal law, signed by President Barack Obama in 2015 and called the “Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act,” those permissions expired on Sept. 30. Republicans who currently have majorities in the House and Senate have not reauthorized the program, and President Donald Trump ended federal tax credits for electric vehicles, and blocked a California law requiring all new vehicles sold in the state starting in 2035 be electric.

Owners of electric vehicles say they are disappointed by the loss of the solo carpool lane access.

“It’s a huge, huge bummer for EV enthusiasts,” said John Stringer, president of Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley, a club with 6,000 members. “It has been one of the things we’ve been able to enjoy for years. It was one of the reasons why I bought my first EV.”

Most freeways in California require two, or in some cases three, people per vehicle to be allowed to drive in carpool lanes during morning and afternoon rush hours.

Stringer, a San Jose resident, said EV access has cut 20 minutes each way off his 1-hour-and-15-minute commute to work in San Mateo. Many of his fellow EV owners may have forgotten that the grace period for their once coveted stickers expires Monday, he said.

“It’s going to be a big adjustment,” he said. “If you are used to just getting into the carpool lane and going, you are going to have to adjust. People are going to need to remember. Some people are definitely going to be in for a rude awakening.”

California political leaders of both parties have opposed the loss of carpool lane access.

Last year, a Southern California Republican, Assemblyman Greg Wallis of Rancho Mirage, wrote a bill, AB 2678, to extend California’s EV carpool decal program until Jan. 1, 2027. It passed with large bipartisan majorities in Sacramento. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it into law. But it won’t take effect unless Congress reauthorizes the program.

The auto industry and other supporters of the program tried to insert last-minute language into legislation to keep the federal government open before the shutdown earlier this fall, but that failed, said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Coalition for Clean Air, an environmental group.

Advocates are expected to try again next year when the federal highway funding bill comes up. But it’s far from a guarantee, he said, not only because Trump has pushed oil and coal over renewable energy and electric vehicles, but also because in some places like California, there are large numbers of EVs on the highways.

As of August, there were 511,877 active EV carpool stickers in California, according to DMV spokesman Jonathan Groveman. Since the program began in 2000, there have been 1,211,530 million issued.

When the program first began, after former Gov. Gray Davis signed AB 71, a law written by former Republican Assemblyman Jim Cunneen of San Jose in 1999, less than 2% of cars on the road were electric. Last year in California, 25.3% of the new vehicles sold were electric, according to the California Energy Commission.

In some counties, the number is even higher.

In Santa Clara County, 43.8% of new passenger vehicles purchased last year were “zero emission” — basically electric or plug-in hybrid. In Marin County, it was 40.1%; Alameda County 37.7%; Contra Costa County 32.7%; San Mateo County 25.3% and San Francisco 35.6%. It was 31% in Orange County, and 26.5% in Los Angeles County.

The top-selling car in California for the past three years has been the Tesla Model Y, according to data from the California New Car Dealers Association, surpassing the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla and other traditional gasoline-powered vehicles that once led sales.

Nobody knows whether the HOV sticker change will increase traffic, or reduce it. It depends on whether more people carpool, work from home, take transit or other alternatives, or just decide to sit in the slow lanes during rush hour.

“EVs are kind of the norm now in California,” Stringer said. “I think this was inevitable.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EBT-L-HOV-XXXX-04.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-30 08:57:37.333156

While these regions aim to move away from fossil fuels, they face unique challenges that could affect global climate change efforts. This transition is not only about shifting energy sources but also ensuring equitable technology transfer and economic stability. Let’s explore these challenges in detail and their implications.

Complexities of Energy Transition in the Global South

Developing nations often rely heavily on fossil fuels, presenting a significant hurdle in their energy transition efforts. According to the International Energy Agency, fossil fuels account for over 70% of energy consumption in many of these countries. Transitioning to renewable energy sources demands substantial investment and infrastructure changes, which are often unaffordable for these nations.

Moreover, the lack of technology and expertise further complicates this shift. Policies that promote technology transfer become crucial here, ensuring these countries can access and implement advanced technologies. The equitable distribution of such technologies can help bridge the gap between developed and developing nations, fostering a more balanced global climate policy. For more insights, explore discussions on Reddit regarding energy policies in developing regions.

Impact on Sustainable Development Goals

The energy transition is pivotal to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly in poverty reduction and economic growth. However, the focus on renewable energy must be carefully aligned with these goals to avoid unintended consequences. For example, rapid shifts without proper planning might lead to job losses in traditional energy sectors, exacerbating poverty issues.

To mitigate such risks, policies should include retraining programs and investment in green jobs to ensure a just transition. This aligns with SDG 8, which emphasizes decent work and economic growth, and SDG 7, which focuses on affordable and clean energy. Initiatives that integrate these goals can create a more resilient economy in developing nations.

Climate Change and Policy Implications

The shift towards renewable energy in the global south has significant implications for global climate change policies. Developing nations, despite contributing less to global emissions, often face the brunt of climate impacts. Therefore, equitable climate finance is critical to support their transition efforts.

International bodies and agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, play essential roles here, mandating developed countries to provide financial resources. This support is vital for developing nations to implement climate resilience strategies effectively. Moreover, collaboration between these nations and developed economies can foster knowledge exchange, promoting sustainable practices globally.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the energy transition in developing nations is a multifaceted challenge that impacts sustainable development and climate change mitigation strategies. For these countries, achieving an equitable, sustainable energy system requires not only financial investment but also collaborative global efforts in technology transfer and policy-making. To succeed, we must ensure that climate finance and supportive policies are effectively implemented, allowing these nations to contribute positively to global climate goals while boosting their economic growth. This will not only help meet international commitments but also foster a more inclusive global community.

The state is increasingly powering its entire grid with 100% clean energy for periods of time, a significant achievement that puts it on a strong trajectory toward its official 2045 target. This ambitious progress, driven by landmark legislation like Senate Bill 100 (SB 100), underscores a deep commitment to combating climate change and building a sustainable energy system.

The Path to 100% California clean energy

California’s journey toward a fully clean energy grid has been marked by significant, record-breaking moments. In 2022, the state’s grid ran on 100% renewable energy for the first time, a feat it repeated and expanded upon in 2023 by achieving 100% zero-carbon energy for extended periods. These accomplishments were made possible by California’s diverse clean energy portfolio, which includes solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and hydroelectric power.

The state’s clean energy capacity is growing at a breakneck pace. With a current capacity of 28 gigawatts, solar energy is the undisputed leader, accounting for 67% of the total. The scale of this expansion is staggering; in 2023 alone, California added 10 GW of clean energy. This rapid progress is a testament to the state’s investment in renewable infrastructure and the sophisticated [basics of solar panel manufacturing] that make such growth possible.

Challenges Ahead for California clean energy

Despite these achievements, the road to a continuously 100% clean grid is paved with challenges. To meet its ultimate 2045 goal, the state must add an estimated 71 GW of new clean energy capacity. This expansion will require a parallel and massive increase in energy storage, particularly through battery systems. While the transition promises long-term environmental benefits, it has also contributed to California having some of the nation’s highest electricity prices, a critical issue for residents and businesses.

Energy storage is the linchpin for maintaining a stable and reliable power supply. Batteries are crucial for capturing excess energy generated during peak production—like sunny afternoons—and releasing it when demand is high or production is low, such as after sunset.

The scale of storage required is daunting. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has approved plans for deploying over 50,000 MW of energy storage by 2045. This will require unprecedented investments in technology, infrastructure, and innovation to ensure the grid remains resilient.

Investment and Innovation in California clean energy Storage

California is already making impressive strides in expanding its energy storage capacity. After adding 1.9 GW of battery storage in 2022, the state reached a total of 5.6 GW by 2023. This rapid growth is projected to continue, with estimates suggesting the state could add up to 10 GW of battery storage by 2026.

Groundbreaking projects like the Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility, with a capacity of 300 megawatts (MW) and the ability to store 1,200 megawatt-hours (MWh) of energy, are setting new global standards. These facilities are essential for balancing supply and demand, preventing blackouts, and ensuring the grid remains stable as it incorporates more intermittent renewable sources.

Overcoming Barriers to California clean energy Expansion

While the progress is impressive, California must navigate several barriers. These include regulatory hurdles, supply chain constraints, infrastructure modernization, and the need for continued technological innovation.

Regulatory frameworks must evolve to support the rapid deployment of clean energy and storage. This includes streamlining permitting processes for new solar farms and wind projects and creating incentives for utilities and private companies to invest in the necessary infrastructure, including crucial transmission line upgrades to move power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed. The intricate [solar panel manufacturing process] relies on a complex global supply chain, which presents its own set of challenges.

Constraints on the availability of [solar panel raw materials] and components for batteries pose a significant risk. The state must work with manufacturers to build resilient supply chains to support the construction and maintenance of its clean energy ecosystem. Understanding the entire pipeline, from raw materials to the [solar panel manufacturing machines] used in factories, is key to forecasting and mitigating these bottlenecks.

Innovation will also play a pivotal role. Continued research and development in advanced battery chemistries and alternative storage solutions—like pumped hydro, compressed air, and even novel ice-based systems—will be essential for meeting California’s ambitious goals affordably and reliably.

A Model for the Nation: California clean energy

California’s ambitious energy transition serves as a powerful model for other states and nations. It’s part of a broader decarbonization strategy that includes the electrification of transportation, with the state recently surpassing 200,000 public EV charging ports. This holistic approach demonstrates that a reliable, sustainable energy future is not just a dream but an achievable reality.

As California moves closer to its 2045 target, it will undoubtedly face more challenges. However, with a potent combination of policy support, private investment, and relentless innovation, the state is forging a path toward a fully clean energy grid. This journey will not only benefit Californians but also provide an invaluable blueprint for the global fight against climate change.

Lee Zeldin, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has labeled climate change a “religion” instead of what it is: a matter of physics.","When nearly 200 nations signed the 2015 Paris agreement, acknowledging the threat of rising global temperatures and vowing action, many hoped that the era of climate denial was finally over.

Ten years later it has roared back, arguably stronger than ever.

As delegates wrapped the annual United Nations climate talks last Saturday, those who have campaigned to reduce the use of fossil fuels expressed growing alarm that forces arrayed against them are gaining ground in the information war.

The oil, gas and coal industries continue to downplay the scientific consensus that the burning of fossil fuels is dangerously heating the planet. It’s a strategy that has been echoed by oil-rich countries such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and — under the Trump administration — the United States.

President Trump mocks global warming as a hoax, cheered on by a chorus of influencers online who regularly promote disinformation on social media platforms that once tried to curtail it. While such views have long been dismissed as conspiracy theories, their influence on the global policy debates has clearly grown.

The final statement of the U.N. talks, which were held in Belém, Brazil, did not even use the words “fossil fuels.”

“We thought that good ideas would get people to act,” J. Timmons Roberts, a researcher at Brown University and executive director of its Climate Social Science Network, lamented in a briefing on the eve of the talks.

“In fact there’s been a quite systematic campaign that’s been sophisticated and extremely well funded,” he said. “They have succeeded at undermining climate action globally.”

This year’s climate summit took place against a backdrop of increased drilling and mining — in Brazil, the host government recently granted a license to the state oil company to explore new sources of oil near the mouth of the Amazon River.

“They manipulate algorithms, sow hatred and spread fear,” he said, describing a surge in disinformation and propaganda aimed at blocking action to slow climate change.

The problem has become so acute that the summit, for the first time, put the issue on the agenda. A coalition of countries and international agencies issued a separate “Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change,” calling on governments to address climate disinformation, promote transparency and protect journalists, scientists and environmentalists.

The initiative is light, however, on details about how governments should go about it. By Friday, only 21 of the nearly 200 countries that signed the Paris agreement had also signed the disinformation declaration.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who was in Belém and has attended several climate summits, said the global embrace of the Paris agreement by most governments and major corporations for a time obscured the still-fierce opposition to ending fossil fuels.

“I think there was some confidence at the time that when governments got together, and everyone put forward their national commitments, everybody felt we were just going to sort of breeze past that,” Mr. Whitehouse said. “Now, I think, there is a better understanding of the true nature of the fossil fuel disinformation and corruption campaign.”

Mr. Lula said that this year’s summit would “deliver yet another defeat to denialism.” Instead, it struggled to build consensus.

The final conference statement did endorse the call to promote “information integrity” and provided more money for vulnerable countries hit by climate catastrophes. But it included only a voluntary agreement among nations to begin discussions on a “road map” to an eventual phaseout of fossil fuels. The modest outcome was only achieved after a bitter standoff with oil-producing countries from the Persian Gulf.

Critics blamed the meager results on oil, gas and coal interests that have been increasingly present at U.N. summits in recent years. One review of delegates by a group called the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition found 1,600 fossil fuel representatives participated in the Belém talks, a number that includes diplomats from countries with state-run oil companies.

“Once again, fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered many delegations from the countries most affected by the climate crisis,” Brice Böhmer, climate and environment director for Transparency International, a Berlin-based nonprofit group, said in a statement.

For critics of the environmental movement, the shifting sentiment on display in Brazil was a victory after years of pressure on energy industries.

“There’s a lot of reality that has hit,” said Steven J. Milloy, the founder of JunkScience.com, a website that has disputed the scientific consensus on climate change. “People are realizing now that we need fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are here to stay.”

Polls consistently show that a majority of adults globally and in the United States consider climate change to be a serious threat.

At the same time, a growing body of research is warning that climate misinformation — from misleading claims from Mr. Trump that wind turbines “kill all the birds” to viral hashtags proclaiming clean energy is a scam — is steadily growing, amplified by social media.

The strategy is not subtle, a recent study found. Climate skeptics present their position as “projecting rationality, authority, and masculine self-control” while those who acknowledge global warming “are depicted through emotionally charged, feminized, and irrational imagery,” and labeled “alarmists” who propose radical solutions.

Political campaigns deploy the same playbook. Republicans frequently claimed the Biden administration was trying to “emasculate” American drivers by forcing them into electric vehicles. Lee Zeldin, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, has labeled climate change a “religion” instead of what it is: a matter of physics.

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said that Mr. Trump was pursuing “energy addition, not energy transition.”

“The President has set a strong example for the rest of the world by reversing course on the Green Energy Scam and unleashing our natural resources, like beautiful, clean coal and natural gas, to strengthen our grid stability and lower energy costs,” she said, citing arguments that many economists dispute.

Still, Mr. Trump’s policies threaten more than 500 solar and energy storage projects in the U.S. that were set to provide 116 gigawatts of capacity. His administration also terminated a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for an 800-mile transmission line that would have carried mostly wind power from the Great Plains to some of the most strained parts of the nation’s power grid.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/multimedia/00cli-COP30-disinformation-01-zhfv/00cli-COP30-disinformation-01-zhfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:04:34.953650

By Alfred McCoy / TomDispatch

At the dawning of the British Empire in 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned a memorable sonnet freighted with foreboding about the inevitable decline of all empires, whether in ancient Egypt or then-modern Britain.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.

Unlike oceans, Great Lakes states, not the federal government, have jurisdiction over offshore wind projects.

Despite past efforts, no offshore wind turbines currently exist in the Great Lakes due to economic and legal challenges. Erie state Rep. Bob Merski has sponsored a bill to facilitate development.

Researchers are studying the unique challenges for Great Lakes turbines, including freshwater ice and supply chain logistics.

Offshore wind power could provide far more electricity than the U.S. uses for residential, commercial and industrial purposes. But the federal government has recently stopped approving offshore projects in the ocean.

Another option is available, though: the Great Lakes, where we are based as water policy researchers, and where state agencies rather than federal officials are the trustees of the lakes. A January 2025 executive order from President Donald Trump attempts to stop all federal permits for offshore and onshore wind power pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices.

But the states, not the federal government, handle leases and permits for wind power on the Great Lakes, though federal agencies are involved in the overall process. It is unclear how this executive order might impede efforts to move forward with offshore wind in the lakes, but at the very least states could lay the groundwork now to be prepared to act when the next shift in federal priorities arrives.

A 2023 analysis from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that the Great Lakes states have enough offshore wind power potential to provide three times as much electricity as all eight Great Lakes states use currently, which would mean plenty left over to meet increasing demand or send power elsewhere in the country.

States are looking for opportunities

States have been forging their own paths separate from federal clean energy policy for decades. All eight Great Lakes states have state clean energy goals, and five of them — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin — have a goal to achieve 100% clean or renewable energy by 2040 or 2050.

The challenge is not just to transform the current energy supply. As transportation and other sectors electrify, that increases electricity demand. As artificial intelligence proliferates, tech companies need more and more electricity and water for their data centers. By 2028, data centers are projected to consume nearly 12% of the country’s total usage, which requires massive increases in production in the Great Lakes and other key locations.

Companies and states are looking high and low to find enough electricity to meet the rising demand. They are extending the lives of coal-fired power plants and building new gas-fired power plants. Elon Musk’s xAI company has even been powering an artificial intelligence data center in Tennessee with massive generators that add air pollution without permits.

Government and industry are also looking to other sources, such as investing in nuclear fusion advancement and building geothermal plants.

A brief history

In the 2000s and 2010s, the Great Lakes Commission Wind Collaborative, Wisconsin Public Service Commission and the Michigan Great Lakes Wind Council began to sketch out regulations for offshore wind in the Great Lakes and to identify locations that might be suitable for the turbines.

In 2012, the Obama administration agreed to collaborate with five Great Lakes states — Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania — to streamline a permitting process for offshore wind development. Multiple projects were proposed off the shores of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario, Canada, though Ontario banned offshore wind projects in 2011.

Since then, momentum has stalled. One effort, the Icebreaker project off Cleveland, was approved and survived various legal challenges, but the project backers paused it indefinitely in 2023 due to the economic impacts of the legal delays.

Community activists are split, with some embracing offshore wind in the Great Lakes as part of a clean energy future and others vocally opposing it, citing environmental, health and economic concerns.

As of mid-2025, the Great Lakes were home to no offshore wind turbines.

Big potential, big unknowns

States continue to explore the possibility of offshore wind power in the Great Lakes. In early 2025, Illinois legislators again introduced a bill to create a pilot wind project off Chicago in Lake Michigan.

Also in 2025, Pennsylvania legislators introduced a bill sponsored by Rep. Bob Merski, of Erie, D-2nd Dist., to facilitate offshore wind power in Lake Erie. If adopted, the law would map which areas are fit to be leased for development by avoiding nearshore areas, shipping lanes and migration pathways. The Ontario Clean Air Alliance is pushing the province to lift its moratorium and reconsider offshore wind in Canadian waters.

A lot of details remain unknown. New York state supports offshore wind in the ocean but says “Great Lakes Wind does not provide the same electric and reliability benefits” by comparison. Ocean wind tends to be closer to areas where electricity demand is high, which can make those projects more cost-effective.

New York also concluded in 2022 that despite the combined 144.5 terawatt-hours of annual technical potential in state waters in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, “numerous practical considerations … would need to be addressed before such projects can be successfully commercialized.”

To further explore the concerns New York’s report and others have raised, in 2024, with National Science Foundation funding, we collaborated with a team of researchers looking at a wide range of issues, including engineering, environmental effects and law. That effort resulted in articulating research questions whose answers would clarify how realistic different aspects of offshore wind could be in the Great Lakes, such as:

How does ice that forms in freshwater affect the structural integrity of turbines?

Are floating turbines a better fit than traditional fixed-bottom turbines to reach the higher wind speeds in the deeper parts of the lakes and out of view from shore?

If turbine components and installation vessels can’t fit through the St. Lawrence Seaway, could they be built in the region and drive economic development?

Can turbines be located in places that improve fisheries and avoid migratory paths of birds and bats?

How can states establish leasing and permitting programs that maximize environmental, social and economic benefits?

State jurisdiction is an opportunity

In the oceans, U.S. states have jurisdiction from shore out three miles, with the federal government’s jurisdiction continuing out for hundreds of miles beyond that. So offshore project sites in the oceans are leased by the federal government.

The Great Lakes are different. The state governments hold the lakes’ waters and submerged lands in trust for the public. And state jurisdiction extends from shore all the way out to the boundary of a neighboring state’s jurisdiction or the international boundary with Canada.

Regulation of planning, site selection, leasing and other elements of offshore wind projects in the Great Lakes are the responsibility of one or another U.S. state. The federal government’s role is secondary, conducting environmental reviews and protecting navigation, but could still result in slowing state-led projects.

In research we published in 2024 and 2025, we explain that states could evaluate and select offshore wind projects based on a range of social and environmental benefits, in addition to financial considerations. For instance, they could look for designs that provide fish habitat or seek corporate partners that agree to train local workers, manufacture turbines and ships near the lakes, and provide cheaper electricity to local consumers.

Despite all the unknowns, we encourage greater support for research to harness the potential of offshore wind energy in the Great Lakes to be a renewable resource for states, the region and the nation as a whole.","https://www.goerie.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/02/NETN/74277612007-getty-images-520511959.jpg?crop=3350,1885,x0,y1426&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-30 05:57:12.566523

Asia has not been the only bright spot. Trump’s trade deal with the EU, announced earlier this year, saw Brussels agree to invest $750 billion in American energy by 2028.

Congress has also gotten in on the action, primarily via the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which mandated offshore oil and gas leases, opening up drilling in the Gulf of America. It also brought down the federal royalty rate for offshore gas and oil development to 12.5%, restoring it to where it was before former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act increased it to over 16%.

The “big, beautiful” bill also included the Enhancing Energy Recovery Act. Originally a separate bill, the legislation increased 45Q tax credits. While these may not be well-known, they are extremely important for companies in the energy sector, as they provide tax credits for carbon capture. Previous versions of the tax credit were limited to only certain types of companies; the bill eliminated this, allowing for what lawmakers called “across-the-board” access.

But there is more that can be done. The Natural Gas Export Expansion Act, currently pending before the Senate, will make it easier for the U.S. to expedite LNG abroad to any country that is not under sanction. Sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), the bill recognizes that LNG will be, going forward, a key tool for the U.S. as it navigates a multipolar world order where Russia, China, and other adversaries are all seeking economic leverage. At the same time, it empowers domestic producers — helping America at home and abroad.

MIKE JOHNSON WARNS DELIVERING ON TRUMP’S AFFORDABILITY AGENDA WILL TAKE ‘A WHILE’: ‘VERY COMPLEX’

Whether the Natural Gas Export Expansion Act is passed via a new reconciliation package or on its own, the Trump administration should throw its weight behind it, and Republicans should use their majority in the House to pass it, thereby giving it momentum in the Senate.

America is a land blessed with a plethora of natural resources, including energy.

Renewable energy digital services are becoming the foundation of our new energy system.","The energy industry is in a strange place right now. People talk nonstop about clean energy, net-zero goals, big plans for the future — but the practical side is much messier. Even if we keep adding solar and wind at a record pace, it’s still not enough. IRENA estimates that the world needs roughly 1,000 GW of new renewable capacity every year from now until 2030. It’s a massive target, and the older power grids we rely on were never designed for anything like this.

With conventional power plants, you more or less know what you’re getting. They run steadily, and operators can control the output. Renewables don’t behave that way. Digital systems help make sense of everything: they predict demand, estimate how much energy renewables will produce, and coordinate countless devices scattered across different regions. And now it’s worth looking at the companies that are actually pushing these solutions forward.

What renewable energy sources actually look like today

When people say “renewable energy,” they’re usually thinking about basic stuff. Solar panels on roofs. Maybe some windmills. But it’s gotten way more complex than that.

Solar energy now includes massive industrial parks generating hundreds of megawatts. There’s Al Dhafra PV2 in the UAE – the world’s biggest single-site solar plant with four million modules powering 200,000 homes. Some solar installations float on reservoirs. Others are built right into building facades.

Wind energy has gone offshore in a big way. Dogger Bank in the UK has turbines as tall as skyscrapers, sitting miles out in the North Sea where winds are stronger and more consistent. These things can power millions of homes.

Hydropower is old news, sure. But pumped hydro storage is basically a giant battery – pump water uphill when you have extra electricity, let it flow down through turbines when you need power. Simple physics, massive impact.

Biomass energy uses everything from agricultural waste to wood chips. Countries like India and the US are converting biomass plants that used to run on coal.

Geothermal just keeps running. No weather dependence, no variability. Iceland gets most of its energy this way. And green hydrogen, made by splitting water with renewable electricity, might be the future for heavy industry and shipping.

Here’s what all these sources have in common: they only work at scale if we have serious digital transformation in renewable energy. You can’t manage this many variables, this much data, this many interconnected systems without software that can think faster than humans.

The companies building these solutions

1. DXC Technology

DXC gets into the complicated stuff. They build Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems – DERMS for short. What that means in plain English: software that can juggle thousands of solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries at once.

Their renewable energy digital services do real-time forecasting and balancing. When a cloud covers a solar farm, the system already knows and has adjusted before anyone notices a flicker. They use predictive analytics to figure out what’s going to happen hours or days ahead, which matters when you’re trying to keep the lights on for millions of people.

The thing about DXC is they’re focused on helping utilities transition without blowing up their existing infrastructure. Grid stability sounds boring until your power goes out. Their systems make sure that doesn’t happen, even when half your electricity is coming from sources that change by the minute.

2. Siemens Energy

Siemens has been in energy forever. Their Omnivise Digital Solutions covers pretty much everything – from the moment you build a power plant to the day you tear it down decades later. They make distributed control systems that pull data from every sensor, every turbine, every transformer, and show it all in one place.

What’s interesting is their edge computing for substations. Instead of sending all data to some central cloud and waiting for instructions, the processing happens right there on-site. Milliseconds matter when you’re managing a grid.

Siemens is also deep into green hydrogen tech. They’re working on projects in over 100 countries and their equipment generates about half the world’s electricity. When you flip a light switch, there’s a decent chance Siemens technology is involved somewhere in that chain.

3. Schneider Electric

Schneider built EcoStruxure, which is basically their answer to “how do we make everything smarter?” It connects hardware, software, and services to optimize energy use in buildings, factories, and grids.

Their new One Digital Grid Platform uses AI to manage planning, operations, and asset management all in one place. The AI automatically catches when the digital model of a grid doesn’t match reality – like when someone forgot to update the system after installing new equipment. Sounds simple, but that kind of mismatch causes real problems.

Schneider also runs a venture fund backing startups working on clean energy tech. Their approach to digital transformation in renewable energy includes everything from microgrid management to consulting services that help companies figure out how to actually decarbonize their supply chains.

4. ABB

ABB does electrification and automation at a massive scale. They make robotic systems for manufacturing solar panels, complete instrumentation packages for solar and wind plants, and the smart grid systems that tie it all together.

Their battery storage solutions are particularly interesting. BESS-as-a-Service means companies can use battery systems without buying them outright. For industrial users trying to cut electricity costs during peak hours, that’s huge. You get energy independence without the capital expenditure.

ABB supplies converters for the world’s biggest offshore wind farms and generators for hydroelectric plants. Their renewable energy digital services include distributed control systems that give operators real-time visibility into everything happening across their assets. Less downtime means more power generation means more money.

5. GE Vernova

GE Vernova is the spinoff from General Electric that focuses purely on power generation and grid management. They generate about 25% of the world’s electricity through their installed base of 2200 GW worth of equipment.

Their Grid Orchestration Software uses AI to predict demand, optimize energy flow, and integrate all those distributed resources we keep talking about. Their Advanced Asset Performance Management system pulls data from information systems, operational systems, and engineering models to help people make faster decisions.

GE Vernova partnered with Amazon Web Services to accelerate cloud migration and bring generative AI into energy infrastructure. They’re working on everything from wind farms to small modular reactors. The renewable energy digital services from GE Vernova are about coordination – making sure different energy sources work together instead of fighting each other.

6. IBM Energy and Utilities

IBM brings Watson and AI expertise to energy. Their Maximo platform manages assets, and Watson handles the heavy data analytics. They’re using AI to forecast renewable energy production, optimize maintenance schedules, and manage distributed resources.

IBM is also experimenting with quantum computing for modeling complex energy systems. Their blockchain platforms enable peer-to-peer energy trading – imagine selling excess solar power from your roof directly to your neighbor. They build digital twins that simulate how turbines, transformers, and entire grids will behave under different conditions.

Cloud solutions from IBM let energy companies scale operations without spending millions on IT infrastructure. Digital transformation in renewable energy from IBM is about making the complex stuff manageable through better data and better intelligence.

7. Accenture

Accenture isn’t selling hardware or software directly. They’re consultants who help energy companies figure out their entire digital transformation strategy. Sometimes the problem isn’t technology – it’s knowing which technology to use and how to implement it without disrupting your business.

They work with industry leaders on IoT, Big Data, AI, and cloud solutions. Their approach covers operational excellence, asset management, customer experience, and decarbonization. Renewable energy digital services from Accenture include predictive maintenance for wind and solar farms, platforms for managing virtual power plants, and real-time carbon emission monitoring.

They also help companies integrate ESG principles into operations and reporting.

Why this stuff actually matters

We’re at a turning point. IRENA calls digital transformation in renewable energy a “critical catalyst” for hitting COP28 targets – tripling renewable capacity by 2030. Companies investing in digital solutions are already cutting operational costs by 20-30%.

Predictive analytics can forecast wind and solar generation 24-48 hours ahead. That gives grid operators time to prepare for fluctuations. IoT sensors detect equipment failures weeks before they happen, cutting maintenance costs by 20% and extending equipment life by 3-5 years.

Fixing this requires collaboration between private companies, governments, and tech firms. Projects like TwinEU – a 25 million euro initiative to create a digital twin of Europe’s electricity grid – show what’s possible when everyone works together. Denmark and Germany are already using digital twins to improve renewable integration and prevent grid failures.

Bottom line

Digital transformation in renewable energy isn’t optional anymore. The world is electrifying transportation, industry, and buildings. The only way to provide stable, affordable, clean energy is through smart grids that can adapt on the fly.

These seven companies – DXC Technology, Siemens Energy, Schneider Electric, ABB, GE Vernova, IBM, and Accenture – each tackle the problem differently. Some focus on hardware and automation. Others build software and analytics. Some create comprehensive consulting strategies.

Renewable energy digital services are becoming the foundation of our new energy system. They let us not just generate cleaner energy, but use it smarter.

By 2050, renewable sources should provide half the world’s electricity. But that future only happens if we invest in the technology to manage it effectively. Companies implementing digital transformation in renewable energy today aren’t just saving money – they’re building the infrastructure for a sustainable, secure, and prosperous future for everyone.",https://azbigmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 05:57:18.412023

Ola Electric’s Backup Plan On a sticky wicket, the listed EV maker has switched to plan B — B for battery.","When a hero product begins to wobble, the founder’s first instinct is almost always the same: pull the diversification lever. That’s exactly the crossroads where Bhavish Aggarwal of Ola Electric is finding himself standing. And he has been swift in diversifying. In October, Aggarwal launched Ola Shakti, a residential battery energy storage system (BESS).

The device, which uses Ola’s in-house 4680 Bharat Cells, has been built to provide power backup to residential units, farms, and commercial purposes.

But why this diversification from an EV maker, one may ask?

Well, once celebrated as India’s largest electric vehicle maker, with a commanding 30% market share, Ola Electric’s state of affairs is in complete shambles. The company has lost its leadership position, thanks to its shrinking monthly unit sales, which it acknowledges could fall even further. Then, raising fresh capital has become challenging for the EV maker.

The tension is clearly visible. While its losses continued to take a toll on its balance sheet, compounded with falling revenues, its cash balance dropped to INR 2,903 Cr in Q2 FY26 from INR 3,959 Cr in March 2025.

This erosion has bit Ola Electric, and Aggarwal has been forced to shift his narrative and capital towards an ancillary business that he hopes will eventually reduce costs and offset slowing scooter demand.

While the future holds the answer to whether the bet will eventually pay off, let’s trace how the EV juggernaut skidded out of the fast lane.

The EV Rocket That Lost Its Grip

For years, Ola Electric symbolised India’s EV two wheeler revolution. Despite arriving later than its Bengaluru rival Ather Energy, Ola Electric sprinted ahead with a strong brand recall, aggressive marketing, and rapid scale-up of its scooter manufacturing.

For a brief period, the company held a 30% market share. Ola Electric has struggled to be consistent.

Poor after-sales service, unresolved quality concerns, and intensifying competition steadily eroded its lead.

Compounding this, Ola Electric quietly shelved its ambitions in electric three-wheelers and cars, signalling that the company was stretched way too thin.

The situation further worsened when, in a bid to conserve cash, Ola Electric abruptly discontinued discounting, an aggressive pricing tactic that had fuelled its early rise. Without subsidies, customers simply walked away. The sales collapse was immediate, allowing Ather Energy to overtake Ola Electric.

While Ola Electric sold around 52,666 units in Q2 FY26, Ather sold around 66,000 units in the quarter.

This reversal of fortunes has made fundraising exceedingly difficult for the EV major. Lenders have steered clear of the company’s proposal to raise INR 1,700 Cr via debt, a plan that was approved by the company board in May 2025. But more than six months later, the company is yet to conclude this raise.

Now, the company wants to raise INR 1,500 Cr in a mix of debt and equity, for which it received a shareholder nod this week.

While the company has avoided stating the reasons for this change in plans, backers are wary of declining sales and the absence of a stable operating model.

Ola Electric’s Backup Plan

On a sticky wicket, the listed EV maker has switched to plan B — B for battery.

In a move that many believe was inspired from Tesla’s journey, Aggarwal announced in 2022 that Ola Electric would manufacture its own cells to gain control over costs and supply chains.

By 2024, Bhavish Aggarwal was ambitiously projecting a 100 GWh battery cell capacity, even as Ola Electric was laying the groundwork for a mere 1.4 GWh.

Delays were inevitable. The much-touted “indigenous” battery cell, expected to be mass-produced in 2023, finally entered production in Q1 FY26, almost two years behind schedule.

Then, just one quarter after stating that Ola Electric would complete 5 GWh of installation by FY26, Aggarwal revised the target to 5.9 GWh by FY26-end and 20 GWh by the second half of 2027.

This ongoing course correction, with every milestone pushed back again and again, shows that it has been rather tough for Aggarwal to scale its battery manufacturing. Besides, the cell business is a major cash guzzler.

In Q2 FY26, its battery vertical, Ola Cell Technologies, clocked a mere INR 4 Cr in top line (up from INR 1 Cr in Q2 FY25), while losses surged a massive 61% YoY to INR 79 Cr.

To aid the slowing sales of its EV scooters, Ola needs a new narrative, and ideally, a new revenue generator. And its diversification to battery tech fits perfectly.

Aggarwal sees FY26 as a ‘transition year’ where Ola activates its next growth vector in energy. He claims this energy segment will generate INR 100 Cr by Q4 FY26, and INR 1,200 Cr by FY27.

Given Ola’s history of overpromising and underdelivering, these numbers could be just fancy mumbo jumbo.

An Uncertain Road Ahead

Aggarwal is now reportedly pitching his newly launched residential battery system to investors, an implicit sign that the scooter business no longer inspires confidence on its own. But the path ahead is fraught with structural challenges.

The battery storage market is already dominated by giants such as Exide and Amara Raja that have deep pockets, strong goodwill, and powerful distribution networks.

While the market is dominated by lead acid battery systems sold at relatively low price points, Ola Electric is attempting to sell pricey lithium-ion packs, priced in the range of INR 29,999 to a steep INR 1,59,999, depending on capacity.

Then there’s the challenge of building a nationwide distribution network from scratch, which will put even more pressure on the company’s already strained balance sheet. Putting pressure further on this will be Ola’s credibility in the market.

Its new 4680 cells, though positioned as a technological breakthrough, are untested at scale. The company’s history of quality issues with its scooters still hangs over it, and any reliability problems with these battery packs could cripple the segment even before it takes off.

Aggarwal may be betting big on energy storage, but he is entering a category where reputation, reliability and service matter more than hype – the areas where Ola still has significant ground to gain.

As for now, Ola Electric’s diversification to energy storage appears to be a defensive manoeuvre against sliding scooter sales, missed fundraising attempts, and eroding investor trust.

Aggarwal may frame this as the company’s next growth frontier, but the reality is that Ola is stepping into a capital-heavy, competition-dense industry with untested technology, a fragile brand trust, and weak balance sheets.

The question is simple: Is Ola only delaying the inevitable, or charting a real comeback?",https://inc42.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75/https://asset.inc42.com/2025/11/The-outline-ola-electric-social-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 06:58:15.833069

While manufacturing solar, wind and other clean energy sources produce some air pollution, the technology is completely clean once it’s operational.

Advances in photovoltaics have improved a panel’s efficiency from converting 17% of solar energy to electricity up to 23%.","Clean energy — such as solar, wind and batteries — is often considered a zero-emission technology that doesn’t generate any climate-change-inducing carbon dioxide when it produces electricity.

But manufacturing the solar panels, wind turbines and battery cells for those energy sources is anything but clean.

Most production facilities require large amounts of electricity from emission-spewing coal and gas plants to make them, explained Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.

Mining the minerals needed for solar panels and batteries also requires huge amounts of mostly dirty energy and can also pollute the environment and endanger the health of local residents.

“Low-carbon sources are lower, but they’re not zero,” Paltsev said. “We definitely need to educate both decision-makers and the general public on making sure that we are not making claims which are not realistic.”

It all begs the question: How clean really is green energy, and do the potential benefits offset the negative impacts?

‘There’s a big difference’

Manufacturing wind, solar and batteries can come with a significant upfront carbon footprint. But nearly all research agrees that those energy sources produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal or gas over their entire lifecycle.

Coal plants, on average, generate 1,000 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of energy produced, according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Wind generates 13 grams per kilowatt hour; solar produces 28 grams; and lithium-ion batteries generate 33 grams, according to the analysis.

“When you are comparing around 10 grams versus 1,000, that’s a big difference,” Paltsev said. “We need to keep that scale in perspective.”

To put those numbers in perspective, solar panels need to operate for 4 to 8 months to offset their manufacturing emissions; wind turbines need about three months to two years; and lithium batteries take 1 to 3 years.

That’s a short stretch in the lifespan of a solar array.

“When we do a solar system, it’s there for 30 years if you want it to be,” said Allan O’Shea, president of Contractors Building Supply in Copemish. “You will continue to make your return on investment on the minerals and silver and steel, the aluminum you’ve put into it and the glass.”

Fossil fuels also generate huge amounts of toxic air pollution that killed more than 8 million people worldwide in 2018, according to a Harvard University study released in 2021.

While manufacturing solar, wind and other clean energy sources produce some air pollution, the technology is completely clean once it’s operational.

Reducing air pollution through clean energy sources could help save 400,000 American lives by 2050, according to Princeton University’s 2021 Net Zero America study.

“Coal is really out there in terms of the bad impacts,” Paltsev said. “So, at this point, even though wind and solar isn’t at zero emissions, it’s still better.”

Getting green clean

But even with clean energy’s clear track record of producing less pollution and earth-warming gases, its downside shouldn’t be ignored, argued Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University.

Today, many solar panels and batteries contain toxic chemicals that could be hazardous to human health, but still slip under the regulatory radar.

A case in point: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December banned the use of trichloroethylene, which increases risks of certain cancers, in nearly every industry. Battery manufacturers, however, don’t have to phase out their use for 20 years.

“Here’s a hazardous chemical that’s in the battery supply chain that is not necessarily being adequately addressed,” said Mulvaney. “The EPA is putting this green halo on batteries, saying we forgive all of the bad sides to this.”

Mining lithium for electric-vehicle batteries is notoriously bad for the environment, using vast amounts of water in sometimes arid locations while employing heavy machinery that generates tons of emissions.

Silicon mining for solar panels also poses major health risks to workers, who face permanent and sometimes fatal lung diseases by inhaling toxic silica dust.

Mining can also pollute groundwater and degrade soil.

Most solar panels, wind turbines and some batteries also end up in landfills at the end of their lifecycle, which negatively impacts the environment.

Although the research is clear that clean energy produces fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels, there currently is no metric measuring the overall, life-to-death environmental impact of green technologies, noted Paltsev with MIT.

Mulvaney argued that although it’s imperative to reduce the impacts of climate change through green energy, the people who do deal with its negative side effects, like polluted groundwater or increased health risks, shouldn’t be ignored.

“I think it’s dangerous to dismiss these impacts,” he said. “Even if 7 billion people benefit and only 20 people suffer on the planet, I think those 20 people deserve attention.”

Approaching zero

But new technology and improved manufacturing processes for clean energy sources are quickly diminishing those adverse impacts.

Companies like Arizona-based First Solar have developed a panel that doesn’t use silicon, greatly reducing its carbon footprint and water usage, compared to traditional arrays.

The publicly traded company with facilities in four countries also started the first global solar recycling program, and today recovers 90% of the materials in each module it produces.

The American Battery Technology Company is innovating ways to recycle lithium batteries and extract the rare metals inside to sell back into the battery-supply chain. The system reduces the need for mining and produces American-sourced metals with less environmental impact, according to the company.

Even China, where about 80% of all solar panels are manufactured, has since 2011 halved the CO2 produced through its manufacturing processes, according to the International Energy Agency. Still, total emissions from solar manufacturing there have almost quadrupled in the same time as production skyrockets.

Solar panels can be recycled, O’Shea said. His solar array company has replaced a few dozen out of the thousands it’s installed since transitioning to installing the arrays in the mid-90s. Those were broken by hail, the occasional golf ball or vandalism.

While those panels went back to the manufacturer to be recycled, others that still function could get a second life, O’Shea said.

Advances in photovoltaics have improved a panel’s efficiency from converting 17% of solar energy to electricity up to 23%.

That’s led some utility-scale array operators to upgrade their panels, as even a small increase in efficiency adds up over time and across thousands of panels, O’Shea said. If the old ones still function, they can be refurbished and resold.

“So if it tests properly … it can still be very viable for 15 years or more,” he said.

Paltsev said how quickly green energy can move toward net-zero emissions in the U.S. really depends on policymakers and the economic incentives that they can provide.

That matters, he argued, because reduced emissions from clean energy won’t be enough to curb climate change in the long run. Greenhouse gases are also coming from non-energy sources like agriculture and deforestation, Paltsev noted.

Until zero emissions are reached across the globe, temperatures will continue to rise and contribute to a surge in catastrophic weather events around world.

“At some point, I think there will be a huge demand for much more aggressive actions, because when you see things which are destroying your way of life, you will start asking more and more loudly that policymakers do something,” he said.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-30 08:04:39.099280

""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""","A recent study led to the development of a comprehensive framework that policymakers can use to retire America's coal plants forever.

The study, published in Nature Energy, was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A Tech Xplore article said that the goal was to develop a strategy to speed up the country's transition away from coal power.

Although many coal plants have already shut down, over 100 remain active with no retirement plans, per the outlet. The plants' continued operation could make it more difficult to meet carbon pollution goals meant to protect air quality and health.

But shutting down coal plant operations can be more complicated than one might realize.

""Our goal was to build tools that reflect that complexity, so different actors can take on different facets of the problem,"" said study lead Sidney Gathrid, for whom the project started as a senior thesis. ""There's no one straightforward path, and we wanted to do research that represented that reality.""

The researchers' framework has two major points that policymakers could use to inform their decisions.

One is the ""contextual retirement vulnerability"" score, which measures a coal plant's likelihood of shutting down. The other is ""retirement archetypes"" — patterns that explain why plants may close, such as economic, health-based, and political factors.

Burning coal can have a variety of negative impacts on human health. For example, the pollutants from burning coal can lead to respiratory concerns, lung disease, and brain damage, per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Coal power plants can also affect the environment. The Union of Concerned Scientists stated that ash may contaminate waterways, impacting recreation and drinking supplies.

That makes this new framework an exciting opportunity to close the coal plants that have had lasting impacts on people and the planet.

Some research suggests that coal use in the U.S. has reached its lowest since the 1960s. Another study discovered that most coal plants cost more to maintain than it would to replace them with wind or solar.

""What's exciting is that this framework doesn't just describe which plants might retire,"" said senior author and professor Grace Wu. ""It shows how to accelerate those retirements using drivers that worked with other retired or soon-to-be retired coal plants.""

The scientists involved in the study believe the framework could even be adapted for other energy policy efforts. Wu said: ""It's flexible, transparent and reproducible — exactly what we need to make smarter, more strategic decisions about the energy transition.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OX.727hkan2HkayN4JFviw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/9b332861fed2429d98ccbac82e6e6773,N,,2025-11-30 06:58:27.245509

JEFF ROLANDER

VICE PRESIDENT OF CLAIMS AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, FAYE, RICHMOND

After almost 20 years working for Allianz Group subsidiaries, Jeff Rolander left the French corporation in late 2021 to join Richmond travel insurance startup Faye, drawn by its focus on customer loyalty and retention. Following his most recent promotion, Rolander oversees the claims and frontline teams, comprising almost all of Faye’s roughly 50-person local workforce.

Founded in 2019 and owned by Zenner, Faye achieved $100 million in sales revenue this year, and Time magazine included the company on its Best Inventions of 2025 list. Its app allows customers to file claims quickly and to keep them in a virtual wallet, as well as offering a “cancel for any reason” coverage option.

Faye’s corporate office is in Delaware, but it has major hubs in Richmond and Tel Aviv. The company has leased an office in Henrico County, and it anticipates more growth in 2026. With about 150 employees worldwide, the company hopes to grow its local headcount by 35% within the next year.

GWENN ROSENER

CEO, FLEXPROFESSIONALS, FAIRFAX

In 2010, Gwenn Rosener co-founded her staffing firm, FlexProfessionals, which even pre-pandemic has focused on finding remote and hybrid jobs for women with family demands. The company has worked with about 1,000 companies over the past decade and a half, and many of its placements are in accounting, sales, marketing and human resources at organizations throughout Northern Virginia.

Before starting FlexProfessionals, Rosener was a systems engineer at General Electric and a senior manager at Capgemini, the French multinational IT company that purchased Ernst & Young Consulting in 2000.

Amid federal spending cuts and job layoffs in the private and public sectors, Rosener and her colleagues have been very busy fielding calls this year. Speaking this summer, Rosener said that many of the former federal workers she’s spoken with never expected to go through another job search after landing what used to be dependably secure employment.

The regulatory environment continues evolving in ways that generally favour silver demand growth.
Disclaimer: This analysis contains forward-looking statements regarding silver market dynamics, industrial demand projections, and price scenarios.","What Economic Forces Are Driving Silver's Historic Price Surge?

The precious metals landscape has transformed dramatically as global monetary systems face unprecedented stress. While traditional economic models suggested moderate commodity appreciation, the convergence of multiple destabilizing forces has created conditions far beyond conventional forecasting parameters. Furthermore, silver's rise to all-time highs reflects deeper structural shifts that extend well beyond typical supply-demand dynamics.

Monetary Policy Shifts Creating Perfect Storm Conditions

Federal Reserve policy pivots have fundamentally altered opportunity cost calculations across asset classes. When central bank officials signal dovish positioning amid persistent inflationary pressures, non-yielding assets like precious metals suddenly appear more attractive relative to debt instruments offering negative real returns.

Interest rate cut speculation has amplified this dynamic considerably. Market participants increasingly view precious metals as essential portfolio components when monetary authorities prioritise employment metrics over price stability concerns. This environment particularly favours silver given its dual role as both monetary metal and industrial commodity.

Currency debasement concerns now extend beyond traditional dollar-skeptic demographics. Institutional investors increasingly recognise that monetary expansion policies create wealth preservation challenges that standard portfolio diversification cannot adequately address. In addition, the silver market squeeze impact demonstrates how monetary uncertainty translates into tangible market dynamics.

Central bank coordination failures have created additional monetary uncertainty. When major economies pursue conflicting policy objectives, currency volatility increases substantially, driving demand for assets with intrinsic value independent of government backing.

Inflation Persistence Rewarding Hard Asset Positioning

Consumer price index data continues revealing elevated inflation levels despite aggressive policy interventions. This persistence validates precious metals allocation strategies that many investors adopted during initial inflationary phases but later questioned during temporary price corrections.

Real interest rates have turned negative across multiple developed economies. When inflation-adjusted returns on government bonds and bank deposits become negative, precious metals offer compelling alternatives despite their lack of yield generation.

Currency purchasing power erosion has accelerated wealth preservation demand among high-net-worth individuals. Historical analysis demonstrates that during periods of sustained monetary expansion, silver often outperforms other inflation hedges due to its industrial demand component creating additional price support.

Historical inflation hedging performance validates silver allocation strategies employed by sophisticated investors. During the 1970s inflationary period, silver achieved record returns significantly exceeding those of gold, real estate, and equity markets, establishing precedents that current market participants reference when making allocation decisions.

How Are Industrial Demand Dynamics Reshaping Silver Market Fundamentals?

Industrial consumption patterns have evolved beyond historical precedents as technological transformation accelerates. The electrification megatrend encompasses transportation, energy generation, storage systems, and digital infrastructure, all requiring substantial silver quantities for optimal performance characteristics.

Green Energy Transition Driving Structural Consumption Growth

Solar panel installations require approximately 20 grams of silver per unit manufactured. As renewable energy mandates expand globally, this consumption base continues growing exponentially. Photovoltaic efficiency depends heavily on silver's superior electrical conductivity properties, making substitution technically challenging without performance degradation.

Electric vehicle production consumes unprecedented silver quantities compared to traditional automotive manufacturing. Each electric vehicle requires significantly more silver than conventional automobiles due to enhanced electrical systems, battery management components, and charging infrastructure requirements.

Renewable energy infrastructure demands conductive metal components throughout power generation, transmission, and storage systems. Wind turbines, smart grid technology, and energy storage systems all incorporate substantial silver quantities, creating sustained industrial demand independent of financial market conditions.

The electrification megatrend represents a multi-decade demand trajectory that supply planners struggle to accommodate. Unlike cyclical industrial demands that fluctuate with economic conditions, this structural transformation appears irreversible given climate policy commitments worldwide.

Application Annual Demand (Million Oz) Growth Rate (YoY) Photovoltaics 140 +18% Electronics 240 +8% Automotive 55 +25% Medical Devices 15 +12%

Supply Constraints Amplifying Price Discovery Mechanisms

Primary mine production has stagnated due to ore grade deterioration across major producing regions. Geological surveys indicate that easily accessible high-grade silver deposits have been largely exploited, forcing miners to process increasingly lower-grade materials at higher operational costs.

Environmental regulations now restrict new project development in many jurisdictions. Permitting processes extend development timelines far beyond historical norms, creating supply response delays that cannot accommodate rapid demand growth in emerging applications.

Geopolitical tensions disrupt traditional supply chains regularly. Trade disputes, sanctions, and resource nationalism policies affect silver flows between major producing and consuming nations, creating additional supply uncertainty that market participants must price accordingly.

Recycling rates remain insufficient to offset consumption growth. While electronic waste contains substantial silver quantities, recovery processes are energy-intensive and economically viable only at elevated price levels, limiting recycled supply elasticity during price increases.

What Geopolitical Catalysts Are Accelerating Safe-Haven Demand?

International trade tensions have escalated beyond conventional diplomatic frameworks. Recent announcements regarding potential tariff increases reaching 100% on strategic commodities signal a fundamental shift toward economic nationalism that undermines global supply chain efficiency.

Trade War Escalation Creating Market Uncertainty

Rare earth export controls fragment global supply networks in ways that affect multiple industries simultaneously. When nations weaponise resource access, international businesses must develop alternative sourcing strategies that often prove more expensive and less reliable than previous arrangements.

Technology transfer restrictions disrupt industrial partnerships that previously facilitated efficient production processes. These disruptions force companies to develop domestic capabilities or alternative international relationships, creating transitional periods characterised by increased costs and operational uncertainty.

Furthermore, the tariff impacts on silver demonstrate how economic nationalism policies reshape international commerce toward bilateral rather than multilateral frameworks. This transformation reduces efficiency gains from comparative advantage while increasing transaction costs across international borders.

Government Shutdown Aftermath Revealing Systemic Vulnerabilities

Federal operations disruptions highlight institutional fragility that concerns market participants. When government functions cease temporarily, economic data collection suffers, policy implementation delays occur, and market confidence decreases regarding institutional stability.

Economic data collection interruptions create information gaps that complicate investment decision-making. Missing economic indicators force market participants to rely on incomplete information, increasing uncertainty premiums across asset classes.

Policy implementation delays generate market volatility as businesses postpone investment decisions pending clarity regarding regulatory frameworks. This uncertainty particularly affects long-term industrial projects requiring substantial capital commitments.

Debt ceiling concerns resurface despite temporary resolutions. Each recurring debt ceiling debate undermines confidence in fiscal sustainability while highlighting political dysfunction that could eventually threaten economic stability.

How Do Current Silver Valuations Compare to Historical Precedents?

Current silver valuations appear modest when examined through historical inflation-adjusted analysis. Market participants increasingly recognise that nominal price comparisons provide misleading perspectives without considering currency debasement effects over extended periods.

Inflation-Adjusted Price Analysis Revealing Undervaluation

The 1980 peak equivalent exceeds $180 in current purchasing power terms. This comparison suggests substantial upside potential exists if similar monetary conditions develop, though market participants acknowledge that contemporary industrial demand provides additional price support not present during previous cycles.

Real price performance has lagged behind monetary expansion significantly. Federal Reserve balance sheet growth over the past two decades far exceeds silver's rise to all-time highs, indicating that monetary metals have not kept pace with currency creation rates.

Asset class rotation potential suggests significant upside opportunities. When institutional investors recognise that traditional portfolio allocations inadequately address monetary debasement risks, precious metals allocation increases often occur rapidly and substantially.

Risk-adjusted returns favour precious metals allocation within diversified portfolios. Academic studies demonstrate that modest precious metals allocations improve portfolio risk-return characteristics across various economic scenarios.

A 1923 US Silver Peace Dollar containing 0.7734 troy ounces now holds $44.15 in metal value alone, representing 4,315% currency debasement over 102 years.

Gold-Silver Ratio Dynamics Indicating Relative Opportunity

The current 74.6x ratio exists below the century average of 69.4x, suggesting potential mean reversion opportunities. Historical analysis indicates that extreme ratio readings often precede significant silver outperformance periods.

Industrial demand creates structural ratio compression pressures. Unlike gold, silver's substantial industrial consumption provides price support that becomes particularly important during economic expansion phases when industrial activity accelerates.

Investment flows increasingly favour higher-beta precious metals exposure. When investors seek precious metals exposure, silver's greater volatility appeals to those seeking enhanced return potential despite increased risk characteristics.

However, comprehensive gold-silver ratio analysis reveals complex dynamics beyond simple mean reversion expectations.

What Supply-Demand Imbalances Are Supporting Price Momentum?

Market fundamentals reveal structural deficit conditions that traditional economic models struggle to accommodate. Annual consumption now exceeds mine production by over 200 million ounces, creating inventory drawdown pressures that affect market dynamics substantially.

Structural Deficit Conditions Tightening Physical Markets

Exchange-traded product inflows accelerate inventory drawdown from available stockpiles. When institutional investors seek silver exposure through ETF purchases, these products must acquire physical metal, removing supply from industrial markets.

Industrial stockpiling creates additional demand pressure beyond immediate consumption requirements. Manufacturers increasingly maintain larger inventories to ensure production continuity amid supply chain disruptions, effectively removing metal from available markets.

Speculative positioning amplifies price volatility in both directions. When trend-following strategies dominate futures market activity, price movements often exceed levels justified by fundamental supply-demand conditions alone.

Furthermore, silver supply deficits highlight the structural challenges facing market equilibrium.

Mine Development Pipeline Insufficient for Demand Growth

New project economics require silver prices above $40 for development viability. At current cost structures, most potential projects cannot generate adequate returns unless prices remain elevated substantially above historical averages.

Permitting delays extend development timelines beyond demand curve projections. Environmental review processes now require multiple years for completion, making supply response lag substantially behind demand growth in emerging applications.

Capital allocation favours higher-margin base metals projects over silver-focused developments. Mining companies typically prioritise copper, zinc, and nickel projects that offer superior return profiles compared to primary silver operations.

Exploration budgets have declined despite elevated commodity prices. Mining companies focus capital on developing known deposits rather than discovering new resources, limiting long-term supply growth potential.

Which Investment Strategies Are Capitalising on Silver's Momentum?

Investment approaches vary significantly across market participant categories. Institutional investors typically favour liquid instruments that provide silver exposure without storage complications, while sophisticated individual investors often pursue physical allocation strategies.

Exchange-Traded Product Flows Accelerating Price Discovery

ETF holdings have reached multi-year highs amid institutional adoption. These products provide convenient silver exposure for investors who cannot or prefer not to hold physical metal directly, creating substantial demand flows.

Futures positioning indicates continued bullish sentiment among managed money participants. Commitment of Traders data reveals speculative long positions approaching historical extremes, suggesting widespread optimism regarding price direction.

Options market activity reflects elevated volatility expectations. Implied volatility levels indicate that market participants anticipate significant price movements, creating opportunities for strategies that benefit from volatility expansion.

Retail investor participation expands through accessible products. Simplified investment vehicles enable broader participation in silver markets, creating additional demand from demographics previously unable to obtain meaningful exposure.

Consequently, sophisticated silver price strategies have evolved to capitalise on these market dynamics.

Mining Equity Leverage Amplifying Returns

Silver miners generate substantial operational leverage to underlying metal prices. When silver prices increase, mining companies benefit from fixed cost structures that amplify margin expansion effects significantly.

Production cost curves support margin expansion opportunities. Many producers operate with all-in sustaining costs below current price levels, creating substantial free cash flow generation potential at elevated prices.

Exploration upside creates additional value catalysts beyond current production profiles. Successful exploration programmes can substantially increase company valuations independent of prevailing metal prices.

Dividend policies evolve to reward shareholder returns. Mining companies increasingly return cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share buyback programmes, making equity ownership more attractive.

What Technical Indicators Support Continued Price Advancement?

Technical analysis reveals multiple confirmation signals suggesting sustained bullish momentum. Chart patterns, momentum oscillators, and volume characteristics align to support continued price advancement beyond current levels.

Momentum Signals Confirming Bullish Trajectory

Weekly parabolic trends indicate sustained buying pressure across extended periods. When parabolic indicators remain bullish across multiple timeframes simultaneously, trend continuation probability increases substantially.

Volume patterns support price breakout authenticity. Increasing volume during price advances suggests genuine participation rather than technical manipulation, providing confidence regarding trend sustainability.

Resistance level penetration creates new technical floors. Previous resistance zones often become support levels during subsequent corrections, establishing higher price ranges for future trading activity.

Moving average configurations signal trend continuation. When short-term averages remain above longer-term counterparts with expanding distances, momentum typically persists until configuration changes occur.

Market Structure Analysis Revealing Institutional Participation

Large speculator positioning has reached multi-year highs according to regulatory filings. Institutional participation provides price support during corrections while creating additional upward pressure during advances.

Commercial hedging activity declined relative to historical norms. When traditional short hedgers reduce positions, upward price pressure typically increases due to reduced selling pressure from producers.

Open interest expansion indicates genuine demand growth rather than position rotation. Increasing open interest during price advances suggests new capital entering markets rather than existing position adjustments.

Volatility patterns remain consistent with structural market shifts. Price volatility characteristics differ during fundamental trend changes compared to cyclical corrections, suggesting underlying demand changes.

How Might Regulatory Changes Impact Silver Market Dynamics?

Regulatory frameworks continue evolving in ways that favour silver-intensive technologies. Environmental mandates, energy transition policies, and financial market regulations all influence silver demand and investment flows substantially.

Environmental Policies Accelerating Industrial Demand

Carbon reduction mandates require silver-intensive technologies for implementation. Solar panels, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems all depend heavily on silver's unique properties, creating policy-driven demand growth.

Renewable energy subsidies support photovoltaic deployment across multiple jurisdictions. Government incentives make solar installations economically attractive, directly increasing silver consumption for electrical components.

Electric vehicle incentives drive automotive consumption beyond market-driven adoption rates. Tax credits and purchase subsidies accelerate EV adoption, creating additional silver demand from enhanced electrical systems.

Energy storage regulations favour silver-dependent solutions. Grid-scale storage requirements often specify technologies that incorporate substantial silver quantities for optimal performance characteristics.

Financial Market Regulations Affecting Investment Flows

Basel III implementation potentially supports physical precious metals demand. Banking regulations that require higher capital reserves for paper gold holdings may encourage physical allocation strategies among institutional investors.

Commodity position limits influence futures market structure. Regulatory constraints on speculative position sizes may reduce paper market influence while increasing physical market importance for price discovery.

Central bank reserve diversification policies increasingly include precious metals considerations. Monetary authorities seek alternatives to dollar-denominated assets, potentially creating additional institutional demand.

Tax policy changes affect investment vehicle preferences. Favourable tax treatment for specific precious metals investment structures influences capital allocation decisions among tax-sensitive investors.

What Scenarios Could Sustain Silver's All-Time High Trajectory?

Multiple scenario paths support continued silver price advancement beyond current levels. The convergence of monetary, industrial, and geopolitical factors creates conditions where various outcomes lead to sustained demand growth.

Bull Case: Convergence of Multiple Growth Drivers

Industrial demand growth exceeding 15% annually through 2027 represents a realistic outcome given current technology adoption trajectories. Solar installations, electric vehicle production, and energy storage deployment all support this growth scenario.

Monetary policy remaining accommodative amid persistent inflation creates continued precious metals demand. If central banks prioritise employment over price stability, negative real interest rates support non-yielding asset allocation.

Geopolitical tensions escalating safe-haven premium requirements affects portfolio allocation decisions. International conflict, trade disputes, and currency instability all favour assets with intrinsic value characteristics.

Supply disruptions creating acute shortage conditions become increasingly probable. Mining accidents, labour disputes, and geopolitical restrictions can rapidly tighten physical markets beyond normal supply-demand dynamics.

Base Case: Gradual Price Appreciation with Periodic Volatility

Steady industrial demand growth supporting a $45-55 price range reflects continued technology adoption without acceleration. This scenario assumes normal economic growth rates with gradual energy transition implementation.

Moderate monetary policy normalisation limits downside risk while constraining upside potential. Gradual interest rate adjustments allow economic adaptation without creating severe precious metals headwinds.

Technological substitution occurring gradually enables market adaptation without demand destruction. Alternative materials development proceeds slowly enough to allow supply adjustments and price optimisation.

New mine supply partially offsets consumption growth through gradual capacity expansion. Existing operations increase production while new projects come online with sufficient lead times to moderate price pressures.

What Are the Risk Factors?

Aggressive interest rate increases could reduce precious metals appeal substantially. Rapid monetary tightening that creates attractive real yields on fixed income instruments typically pressures non-yielding assets.

Technological breakthroughs enabling silver substitution in key applications represent long-term risks. Alternative materials development could eventually reduce industrial demand for critical applications.

Economic recession dampening industrial consumption requirements affects near-term demand projections. Reduced manufacturing activity directly impacts silver consumption across multiple applications.

Large-scale mine discoveries could significantly expand supply outlook. Major new deposits with favourable development characteristics could alter long-term supply-demand projections substantially.

Positioning for Silver's Next Phase

Silver's rise to all-time highs reflects fundamental shifts across monetary, industrial, and geopolitical landscapes. The structural supply deficit, combined with accelerating green energy adoption and persistent inflation concerns, creates conditions supporting continued upward pressure. While short-term volatility remains inevitable given silver's historical price characteristics, the underlying drivers appear sustainable across multiple economic scenarios.

The industrial demand transformation represents perhaps the most significant long-term factor supporting silver prices. Unlike previous precious metals rallies driven primarily by monetary concerns, current conditions feature substantial industrial consumption growth that provides price support independent of financial market sentiment. This dual-demand characteristic distinguishes silver from other precious metals and suggests greater resilience during potential economic transitions.

Investment strategies capitalising on silver's momentum vary significantly across risk preferences and time horizons. Direct physical ownership provides maximum exposure with storage considerations, while ETF products offer liquidity advantages for tactical allocation adjustments. Mining equity exposure amplifies returns but introduces additional operational and management risks that require careful evaluation.

The regulatory environment continues evolving in ways that generally favour silver demand growth. Environmental policies, energy transition mandates, and financial market regulations all create conditions supporting increased silver utilisation and investment demand. These policy trends appear unlikely to reverse given climate commitments and energy security concerns.

Market participants should remain cognisant of potential risk factors that could disrupt silver's rise to all-time highs. Aggressive monetary tightening, technological substitution breakthroughs, or major supply discoveries could alter market dynamics substantially. However, current conditions suggest these risks represent longer-term considerations rather than immediate threats to price advancement.

Analysis from Reuters highlights silver's outperformance compared to other precious metals, reinforcing the fundamental drivers supporting current market dynamics.

Co-hosted with Nigeria’s Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the African Energy Commission (AFREC), the workshop explored regional opportunities and challenges, while sharing international best practices and cost-effective solutions.

The event brought together over 100 participants from across Africa and beyond, including government officials, regulators, industry representatives and international organisations.

In addition to the host country, Nigeria, participants from eight other African countries joined from across the continent, representing Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal and Uganda.

It follows two previous regional workshops on methane abatement that have taken place as part of the IEA’s Global Methane Engagement Programme.

The first, held in October 2024 in Baku with Azerbaijan’s COP29 Presidency, focused on the Caucasus and Central Asia.

The second took place in Lima in July 2025 in partnership with the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) and Peru’s Ministry of Energy, with a focus on Latin America and the Caribbean.

At each event, experts highlighted the latest data on methane emissions and methods for reducing them.

Participants discussed how pledges could be turned into supportive plans, policies and regulations in their respective regions, as well as the data tools available for monitoring progress and the options available for financing abatement projects.

A key focus has also been on opportunities for regional cooperation.

The Engagement Programme has now brought together over 500 people from 35 countries to discuss pathways for reducing methane emissions.

The next instalment will take place in early next year, with a focus on the Middle East and North Africa region.

According to the IEA’s Global Methane Tracker 2025, methane emissions from fossil fuels remain stubbornly high despite improvements in data and transparency.

Current pledges by companies and countries to tackle methane cover 80% of global oil and gas production.

Around 70% of annual methane emissions from the energy sector could be avoided with existing technologies.

Meanwhile, a significant share of abatement measures could pay for themselves within a year, since the gas that is captured can be sold.

The IEA also released two new reports related to methane abatement this week. Pledges to Progress 2025 – produced in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) – provides an initial assessment of the actions taken by over 100 oil and gas companies to deliver on their ambitions to reduce emissions.",https://cms360.alhilalgroup.com//source/TA/2025/11/30/TA_20251130105553.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:02:55.790217

Under the agreement approved Wednesday, Nov. 19, with solar development firm Solar One, the district will purchase the power at a fixed rate of 3.6 cents per kilowatt hour for seven years. Dixon Public Schools Business Manager Marc Campbell said that's less than what it currently pays ComEd at a rate of 4.38 cents per kilowatt hour plus a distribution fee on each kilowatt.

""There is an immediate savings on the supply that it provides in the future. The board has continued to express interest in wanting a solar deal. This appears to be, in our opinion, one of the good ones that we can kind of stand on,"" Campbell said.

[ Dixon school board may sign onto solar plan to save energy costs ]

In late 2022, the district moved forward on a solar project with Chicago-based energy company Econergy that estimated about $2 million in energy cost savings over 25 years. Based on the lack of progress on the project, school board members voted to terminate those contracts in April 2025, but said they'd still like to pursue solar options.

""We're moving on and we're moving forward. We're looking to the future,"" Campbell said.

The contract is a 15-year commitment to operate the system, which has a life of 30 years. At the end of the first seven years, the district can either choose to extend its fixed rate for another eight years or buy the equipment at a fair market value with the option to pay for it at 0% interest over 10 years, according to the agreement.

Solar One Lead Industrial Developer Shawn Stonesifer, who's a 1998 Dixon High School graduate, said it's estimated to save the district $82,000 in the first year, about $70,000 each of the following six years and about $100,000 to $120,000 a year for eight years after that if the district purchases the system.

Those estimates are calculated using the district's past energy bills, with a 1.26% annual rate increase to account for inflation, Stonesifer said.

Campbell said the only concern he has about the project with Solar One is how fast the district needs to move on its decision.

""The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' has made significant changes in the industry. The biggest being timeline and expiration of credits and incentives,"" Campbell said.

President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" was signed into law in July. It includes large tax cuts in multiple areas, along with shifting the federal focus from clean energy to expanding domestic oil and gas production, according to whitehouse.gov.

In 2022 and 2023, ""everybody rushed to the table. There's lots and lots of solar developers all of a sudden,"" Stonesifer said.

During those years, under former President Joe Biden's administration, state and federal governments signed legislation like the federal Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 that provided tax credits and other incentives to clean energy projects.

""The 'One Big Beautiful Bill' put an end to some of those subsidies, so there's a lot of urgency to get this knocked out now,"" Stonesifer said.

Starting at the end of December, solar projects will have to be compliant with new requirements that will increase the cost of purchasing rates, Stonesifer said.

""We have this nice little window here where we can get a project that's going to save the district a lot of money over a long period of time,"" Stonesifer said.

Campbell reminded the board that, based on the length of the contract, it will most likely be passed along to a new group of board members and district administrators.

""We need to make sure that we understand that that's a serious thing to do,"" Campbell said.

""I think it's got to be done for financial reasons and environmental reasons,"" Board President Linda Wegner said.

Stonesifer said the next steps are for Solar One to purchase the equipment before the new rules kick in and complete final engineering and design plans.

As of now, the plan is for panels to be installed on the roof of DHS and Washington Elementary and in the field behind Jefferson Elementary and Reagan Middle School. Building is expected to start in late summer 2026, Stonesifer said.",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-11-30 08:57:45.941813

This transition will be especially visible in the coming months as UBE C1 Chemicals America (UCCA) begins the next phase of construction on a $500 million production facility inside CEP. The project will establish the first reliable U.S. supply of critical components used in energy storage systems — materials essential to building a more sustainable national energy future.

“This is an exciting time for Cornerstone Energy Park as we continue to forge partnerships focused on creating a sustainable future for the site,” said Jacques Byrd, Cornerstone Vice President of Site Development. “Please pardon our progress as we work to construct this vital facility and transition the Cornerstone Energy Park for a sustainable future.”

To construct the new facility efficiently and responsibly, UCCA is employing modular construction, a method increasingly used in advanced manufacturing projects around the world. In modular construction, equipment is built in smaller components off-site, transported by barge, and then assembled on location.

“Think of modular construction as putting together the pieces of a puzzle,” said UCCA President and CEO Tom Yura. “The pieces are built elsewhere, and the puzzle is assembled on-site. It’s a smarter way to build because it minimizes disruption to the community and reduces the duration of construction.”

These pre-built modules offer multiple advantages: improved efficiency and reduced construction time. To transport the equipment from shipping barges to the CEP construction site, crews will move the modules over River Road using a temporary heavy-haul bridge.

UCCA has selected Morimatsu, a contractor with more than 20 years of global experience moving modular components using hydraulic systems. “Morimatsu brings valuable knowledge and experience to assure project safety and efficiency,” Yura said.

As the modular equipment arrives and is transported onto the site, residents should expect intermittent road closures along River Road. Installation of the temporary bridge will be completed in early to mid-December. Shortly after, the modules will begin crossing the temporary bridge into CEP.

Temporary road closures are scheduled to begin in early December and last through February, when the temporary bridge is expected to be fully deconstructed. Until then, periodic road closures, typically lasting less than one hour, will occur outside of peak travel times.

“We are working with local authorities to help keep the community informed on River Road traffic conditions throughout the construction process,” said Ainslie Blanke, Cornerstone’s senior marketing and communications advisor. “Thank you for your patience as we make Jefferson Parish one of the country’s leaders in sustainable energy.”

Cornerstone and UCCA are coordinating with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jefferson Parish Levee District and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development to ensure all work is completed safely and efficiently.

Cornerstone Energy Park has grown into a multimillion-dollar industrial campus and is home to several companies that operate both independently and collaboratively. The shared focus aims to produce essential materials, support local jobs and prepare Louisiana’s petrochemical sector for a more sustainable future.

The UCCA facility represents the first U.S. production of its kind and deepens Jefferson Parish’s role as a location of choice for energy-forward projects. With sustainability top of mind, CEP and its site companies continue to upgrade technology and strengthen environmental stewardship.

“CEP is focused on transitioning the site for the future,” Byrd said. “The companies on our site share a commitment to safety, health and the environment. That unity is key to building long-term growth.”

As construction accelerates, the UCCA facility stands as both an industrial milestone and a signal of what’s to come: more green-energy jobs, enhanced manufacturing capacity and a stronger local economy built on innovation. And, with decades of history and major projects pointing to a cleaner, more resilient future, Cornerstone Energy Park remains a vital pillar of Jefferson Parish’s industrial landscape.

Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.
The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old.
So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land.
And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.","Hey everybody, Peter Zeihan here. Coming to you from Colorado. Today we’re taking a question from our Patreon page, specifically from one of our friends down in Australia, wondering if it would be possible for Australia to recreate the sort of energy complex that the United States has, courtesy of the shale revolution. The United States is now just a gross over producer of both oil and natural gas.

It’s driven down energy costs in the country, especially electricity costs, which are now among the lowest in the world. And it’s generated a robust processing and manufacturing system with downstream work and a significant export industry, Australia having a smaller population, but almost as much land could they do it? I don’t want to say no, but there’s some things you have to keep in mind.

Number one, geology is just the first step. So in order to have a shale industry, you have to have a lot of sedimentary layers that are petroleum bearing that just the right age to generate oil, natural gas. And the United States has that because in the past, the North American continent, especially our part of it, has had a series of shallow seas.

And then geology would change, and then you’d get another shallow sea and you basically got these stacked layers so you can drill down and hit multiple petroleum producing zones. In fact, in some places in West Texas, you can have upwards of 20 layers that you can all access from one vertical. Now with shale technology, you go down it until you hit that layer and then you go horizontally.

And that brings us to the second thing. You need water. The way shale works is you make this suspension of water and sand, and that is pumped into the lateral through a series of holes that basically crack the, rock open and release the petroleum. And then back pressure pushes all the liquid out and eventually oil and natural gas comes to the surface.

Don’t have to pump the stuff, but you have to have the water to do it. And part of that folds into the third issue, which is proximity. You have to have relative proximity for your oil and natural gas production. Two population centers are places that can take the stuff for processing. And in this this the United States is pretty good.

We have shale zones in Texas, which of course can get pumped to corpus Christi in Houston. And the rest we’ve got some in Colorado which benefit the Denver area. We’ve got some in Ohio which can be pumped into the Northeast and Pennsylvania. Same thing. Australia’s problem is that most of the geology that looks promising is in the outback.

So not only is it a long ways away from any potential population centers, you’re in the middle of a literal desert, so the water access is more difficult. You can access groundwater that’s done in the United States, too. But all of these things incrementally raise the cost of development. Let’s see what else. Regulatory structure. This is one where a lot of countries, trip up shale wells, as a rule, generate somewhere from the hundreds of barrels to thousands of barrels a day, which sounds great, but it’s not like the mega wells you’re going to get a place like, say, Saudi Arabia.

So you’re going to have more of them and they’re more involved from a technical point of view for production. So you have to have a more advanced educational system to generate that sort of workforce. And the United States really does stand out among the world when it comes to petroleum engineers, because we’ve been doing it for so long.

The shale revolution at this point is about 20 years old. In the United States. Our first oil deposits were back in the mid 1800s. So this is something that we’ve been going and going and going. It’s not that the Australians don’t have that, but most of what the Australians have been doing for energy production in the last 30 years has been offshore, where they tap foreign labor almost as much as local labor.

So there’s there’s a labor crunch there. In addition, if you live in Houston, you can work in West Texas. If you live in Sydney or Brisbane, you’re probably not going to be working on the northwest shelf. It’s just too far. So linking these together, and then on the regulatory side, you have to be able to do things on the fly very, very quickly and have a regulatory structure.

That’s okay with that. So in Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission, which is the one that regulates the space issues, permits 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. They drill on Sundays, they drill on Christmas. And if you don’t have an institution set up to handle that, everything else gets pushed back. This is one of the reasons why the shale attempt in Poland just didn’t work out, because the poles tried to work European hours and it just didn’t fly.

The geology wasn’t as good either. But the most important thing, the single most important thing is landowners have to have an interest in the industry. So in the United States, unless you have signed it away, you own the mineral rights on your land. So if a petroleum company comes and wants to drill in your land, you get a chunk of the proceeds.

We’re the only country in the world that does it that way. So when the United Kingdom tried to kick in the shale that ten years ago, they discovered huge amounts of local opposition because the companies would take all of the money, and that would be that the locals had to deal with the noise and the traffic and all the rest, and they saw absolutely no benefit.

Australia is kind of in that camp. So if, if, if this is going to happen, it’s going to take a lot more money and put a lot of pressure on the labor force and require a regulatory and maybe even a legal overhaul of property rights in Australia in order to generate the sort of outcome that you might want to see.

There are three countries, however, that are worth keeping an eye on when it comes to shale that are closer than Australia to achieving something like the United States. The first, ironically, is Argentina. They already have preexisting infrastructure in a place called vacuum worth a dead cow fields which are very close to populated Argentina, including Buenos Aires. The socialist governments of the past set a price floor.

So anyone going to invest knows how much they’re going to get out. So even though the property law structures are weird and it’s Argentina. So if they’re very weird, if you know the rules of the game on the day that you start, you can get some projects going. And so Argentina already has the second most successful shale industry in the world.

The other two to watch are Mexico and Canada. both have a shale fields that in many ways are extensions of the American geography, especially northern Mexico. The weird thing about Canada in Mexico, though, is their closest population centers for most considerations around the American side of the border. So if we’re going to ever see a successful shale industry in those two countries, it will be because they’re accessing American infrastructure, population structure, processing infrastructure and basically linking into a greater North American energy grid.

Doesn’t mean it can’t happen, but if you’re in Ottawa or Mexico City developing a local energy sector to serve another country, let’s just call that a bit of a political complication.",https://zeihan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oil-rona-header.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 01:58:25.108388

Not enough chargers have been built and the ones that do exist don’t work for all vehicles. Tesla has built the most substantial charging network and finally Stellantis has agreed to switch to the Tesla North American Charging System for some of its battery electric vehicles. That means starting in 2026, vehicles like the 2026 Dodge Charger Daytona and the 2026 Jeep Recon will be built with the NACS plugs. Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler have electrified vehicles that can be plugged in to charge. Ram is working on an extended range hybrid pickup.

The Tesla Plug Change Will be Phased in Gradually

Apparently, the adoption of the North American Charging System (NACS) for select Stellantis battery-electric vehicles will happen in phases. Starting in early 2026, in North America, existing BEVs, such as the Jeep Wagoneer S and Dodge Charger Daytona will be equipped to use the Tesla Supercharger network. Eventually the 2026 Jeep Recon and other future products will also be able to use the NACS network. There will be more details about adapter information for current Stellantis BEV models released in the future.

The change in charging plugs will start in North America in 2026. In 2027, vehicles in Japan and South Korea will be added to the NACS network. There are currently 28,000 Tesla superchargers in North America, Japan and South Korea.

Reluctance to Buy Electric Vehicles

Range anxiety and concerns about finding adequate charging facilities are two of the main reasons that people are reluctant to buy electric vehicles. All of the automakers have struggled with convincing customers that they will be able to charge vehicles quickly. Most complaints center around poor charging infrastructure, especially in rural or remote areas. Jeep has financed installing chargers at trailheads but still the outlets are few and far between. Often, when drivers do find charging facilities, they have been vandalized.

The collaboration between Stellantis and Tesla will certainly boost customer confidence in public charging. By unlocking broader access to charging infrastructure, Stellantis gives customers more choice, more coverage and more control over how, where and when they power their EVs.

New Mexico received the most of any state with more than $2.7 billion in payments.

The disbursements support a wide range of initiatives, including public infrastructure, education, emergency services, conservation and reclamation projects, and historic preservation. This year’s total represents the fifth-largest disbursement since 1982.

The Donald J. Trump administration has focused on combating inflation and reducing energy costs. These lower prices have helped keep more money in the pockets of American consumers while still providing critical funding to states, tribes and federal programs through ONRR’s disbursements. This year’s disbursements decreased from the previous year largely due to the drop in commodity prices.

ONRR’s disbursements were aided by the Trump administration’s priorities under Executive Order 14154, Unleashing American Energy, which directs federal agencies to remove regulatory barriers and encourage responsible energy development on public lands. Additionally, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which reduced the cost of doing business on public lands, making oil and gas development more economically attractive to industry, spurred domestic energy production while lowering commodity prices.

Fiscal year 2025 Disbursement Highlights:

$5.01 billion to the U.S. Treasury

$4.07 billion to 34 states

$2.98 billion to the Reclamation Fund

$1.05 billion to the Land and Water Conservation Fund

$1.00 billion to Tribes and individual Indian mineral owners

$350 million to federal agencies

$150 million to the Historic Preservation Fund

The $4.07 billion in state disbursements reflects revenue from mineral and energy production on federal lands within the states’ borders and offshore tracts in federal waters adjacent to states’ shores.

The states receiving the highest disbursements based on those activities are:

New Mexico

$2.76 billion

Wyoming

$544.87 million

Prices have strengthened, and shares of Alcoa and Century Aluminum have rebounded after last spring’s tariff shock.
Domestic production slips into survival mode This shift has left the United States with only four active smelting operations.
Century Aluminum has secured a multi-year power deal in South Carolina to keep one of its plants viable through 2031.
Industry leaders warn that without government action, the United States will struggle to rebuild a capability many now consider strategically important.","The United States should be living through a renaissance in aluminium. Data centers, electric vehicles and the wider clean-energy buildout are pulling unprecedented volumes of the metal into server racks, cooling systems, power grids and vehicle frames. Prices have strengthened, and shares of Alcoa and Century Aluminum have rebounded after last spring’s tariff shock. Yet the companies behind the country’s remaining smelters say the boom is slipping away from them just as demand surges.

The problem is electricity. Turning alumina into metal requires vast, steady power — roughly 14 megawatt-hours for every tonne of aluminium. A single modern smelter draws as much energy as a mid-sized American city. For decades, the economics worked only when smelters locked in long-term power at around USD 30 to USD 40 per megawatt-hour. That equation has collapsed. The explosion of AI infrastructure has tech giants paying more than USD 100 per megawatt-hour to secure guaranteed supply, far beyond what metal producers can absorb. Industry executives admit they simply cannot match Big Tech’s bidding power.

Domestic production slips into survival mode

This shift has left the United States with only four active smelting operations. Output last year barely reached 670,000 tonnes — less than one percent of global production — and nowhere near enough to meet domestic needs. The country now relies heavily on Canadian imports, while China and Indonesia expand aggressively with cheaper energy and looser constraints. No new US smelter has been built in nearly half a century, and the sector’s decline has become structural.

Demand outpaces the country’s ability to supply

Ironically, the long-term fundamentals look stronger than ever. Automakers are substituting aluminium for steel as they electrify their fleets. Renewable power developers need the metal for turbines, solar frames and transmission hardware. And data center construction is rising so quickly that Bank of America expects US power demand to grow five to ten times faster over the coming decade. Yet Goldman Sachs forecasts that the wave of new global supply will push prices lower through 2026, compressing margins for the producers that remain.

Smelters search for lifelines

In this environment, companies are scrambling for stability. Century Aluminum has secured a multi-year power deal in South Carolina to keep one of its plants viable through 2031. Emirates Global Aluminium has announced plans for a new smelter in Oklahoma — an extraordinary move that would nearly double current US capacity if it proceeds. Alcoa, meanwhile, has hinted that selling assets directly to technology firms might make more economic sense than running power-hungry metal operations that no longer pencil out.

Industry leaders warn that without government action, the United States will struggle to rebuild a capability many now consider strategically important. The Aluminum Association estimates that reviving domestic smelting would require at least five large facilities, billions in capital and years of construction. Washington has already moved on tariffs, but producers argue that the deeper challenge lies in the power market, where the surge in AI-driven demand is leaving traditional industries priced out.

The result is a paradox: a country experiencing its highest aluminium demand in modern history, yet unable to supply the metal that underpins the technologies it wants to lead. As AI expands and electricity grows scarce, America’s aluminium sector finds itself fighting for relevance in the very boom that should have secured its future.",http://www.alcircle.com/api/media/1764380591.26506_AI_0_0.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:03:03.222413
